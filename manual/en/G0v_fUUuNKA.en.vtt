Hi, my name is Dave Andrews, today I'm going
to show you how to back up and restore files

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.670
to an external hard drive. I have here with
me an external USB hard drive, it's about

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.600
two hundred and fifty gigabytes. This is good
enough to store most of the pictures that

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.660
you might have from family vacations, any
music files that you want to keep track of,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.380
any work documents that you want to make sure
don't get lost. A good size for an external

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.720
hard drive is about two hundred and fifty
gigabytes for the average user. They make

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:41.100
them up to five hundred gigabytes. All I have
to do is plug in a USB cable, and power, I'm

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.980
going to turn the device on. The computer
is going to recognize that I've turned on

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.870
a device, and a way that you can tell is by
going to the - you'll see - first of all it'll

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.340
pop up these, just like you've plugged in
the removable thumb drive, it's going to ask

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.120
you what you want to do with it. What I want
to do is just open the folder to view the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.049
files. And here are the files that are stored
on that removable hard drive. To copy files

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.430
to the hard drive, do just like you normally
would. I'm going to grab this music file.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.890
I'm going to just drag it over onto my hard
drive. Let's just copy that file to my hard

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.450
drive. Instead of being stored on my computer
now, it's stored on the removable drive. I

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.189
can close this, turn the device off, unplug
it, and store it in the closet. Let's say

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:40.340
it is now six months later and I want to restore
that file. I would plug it in, turn it on,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:48.520
click on start, go back to my computer, and
we're going to see here my hard drive, and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.790
there is the music file that I copied there
once before. To restore it I just copy and

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:03.149
paste it back onto my desk top. This is a
very easy tool to use to back up your documents.

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.159
My name is Dave Andrews and I've just showed
you how to back up and restore files using

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.030
an external hard drive.
