Voiceover:The Wood Whisperer is

00:00:01.104 --> 00:00:03.342
sponsored by Powermatic,

00:00:03.342 --> 00:00:05.641
the gold standard since 1921,

00:00:06.164 --> 00:00:08.208
and by Rockler Woodworking and Hardware,

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.183
create with confidence.

00:00:10.183 --> 00:00:24.771
(upbeat music)

00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:25.817
Marc:If you find that your blades

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.281
and bits just aren't preforming

00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:28.413
like they use to,

00:00:28.413 --> 00:00:29.838
you might not need to send them

00:00:29.838 --> 00:00:30.897
out for a sharpening.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:32.285
You might just need to clean them.

00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:33.508
As you can see,

00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:34.869
I've got a dirty bit.

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:36.306
All right, all this buildup here,

00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:38.011
this is going effect the cut quality.

00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:39.251
So, you want to make sure you

00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:40.877
clean that up, in fact,

00:00:40.877 --> 00:00:42.331
this bit got me through my entire

00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:43.979
Ruobo workbench build.

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:45.542
So, that's a lot of mortises

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:47.531
that I wound up cutting with this bad boy,

00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:49.800
and it is overdue for a cleaning.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.343
My table saw blade here,

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:52.859
this is just something that every

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:54.204
couple of months I like to clean

00:00:54.204 --> 00:00:55.605
just to make sure these teeth

00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:57.311
don't have any buildup, pitch,

00:00:57.311 --> 00:00:58.740
or resin or anything on there.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.353
That will also make the table saw

00:01:00.353 --> 00:01:01.706
cut nice and clean.

00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:03.864
So, let's get to the cleaning process.

00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:05.587
The cleaning agent I'm going to use

00:01:05.587 --> 00:01:08.023
is Rockler's Pitch and Resin remover.

00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:09.498
I've been using this stuff for years.

00:01:09.498 --> 00:01:10.245
It works great,

00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:11.440
so I haven't had the need to look

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.490
for anything else.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.880
It smells to me like a citrus cleaner,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.319
so you could probably use one of those

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.542
or something like Simple Green for this.

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:20.281
So, let's do the router bit first.

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:22.709
I'm just going to grab a little cup here.

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:23.832
(pouring)

00:01:23.832 --> 00:01:25.158
Pour some of the solution in there.

00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:28.861
Then, I will dip the router bit.

00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:29.878
I'm going to leave it in there

00:01:29.878 --> 00:01:30.836
for about 5 minutes.

00:01:31.543 --> 00:01:33.627
Now, depending on how
caked on the smuts is,

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:35.472
you might want to use different tools

00:01:35.472 --> 00:01:37.793
to help get the rest of this material

00:01:37.793 --> 00:01:38.573
off of there.

00:01:38.573 --> 00:01:39.547
If it's very light,

00:01:39.547 --> 00:01:41.141
you can usually just get an

00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:42.474
acid brush like this

00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:43.916
and wipe the surface

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:45.214
or even a paper towel.

00:01:45.214 --> 00:01:48.003
That should get most of the stuff off.

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:50.285
Now in this case, this is pretty stubborn.

00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:51.508
So, what I'm going to do is

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:53.822
actually use a Scotch Bright pad.

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:55.568
Dip that into the solution.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.009
Just very carefully

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.247
wipe the smuts off,

00:02:01.247 --> 00:02:02.697
and of course, be very careful.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.307
This is a router bit.

00:02:05.137 --> 00:02:05.900
It can cut you.

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:07.911
When I do this,

00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:09.396
I'm being very careful not to

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:12.611
actually rub too hard on the cutting edge.

00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:14.216
I don't really want to dull it.

00:02:14.216 --> 00:02:15.900
I just want to make sure that the pad

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.703
is under the blade,

00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:19.306
and then over the blade.

00:02:21.628 --> 00:02:22.583
Once it looks pretty clean,

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:23.964
you can just wipe off the excess

00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:27.507
resin remover with a dry paper towel.

00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:29.620
Once you're done,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.977
you could just pour the solution

00:02:30.977 --> 00:02:32.176
back into the container.

00:02:32.176 --> 00:02:33.320
You can reuse this later.

00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:36.061
For blades, you can pretty much use

00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:37.768
any shallow pan that's big enough

00:02:37.768 --> 00:02:39.045
to hold a blade.

00:02:39.045 --> 00:02:40.451
Drop the blade down inside,

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:43.558
and just soak it with some of

00:02:43.558 --> 00:02:44.561
the resin remover.

00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:46.835
Now, the instructions on this

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:48.635
usually indicate to

00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:51.195
dilute this stuff down,

00:02:51.195 --> 00:02:52.781
because it is concentrated.

00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:54.693
Because, I always use it on the blade,

00:02:54.693 --> 00:02:56.343
and then put it back in the container,

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:58.310
I actually use this stuff for years.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.283
So, I like to keep it in this

00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:00.592
concentrated form.

00:03:00.592 --> 00:03:01.788
I don't know that necessarily

00:03:01.788 --> 00:03:02.926
improves anything,

00:03:02.926 --> 00:03:03.486
but

00:03:03.992 --> 00:03:05.416
I would guess that more concentrated

00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:07.080
means it's going to be stronger.

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:08.845
Because I'm not throwing it out

00:03:08.845 --> 00:03:09.688
after each use.

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:10.687
I'm not wasting it.

00:03:10.687 --> 00:03:11.848
After a 5 minute soak,

00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:14.868
I can usually get my brush here

00:03:15.344 --> 00:03:16.539
and go alone the edges.

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.511
Once again, if the buildup isn't too bad,

00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:21.577
a brush should do the trick.

00:03:21.577 --> 00:03:23.515
If it does wind up being a little

00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:24.683
bit too stubborn,

00:03:24.683 --> 00:03:25.939
I just go back to

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.350
the little scrub pad

00:03:28.026 --> 00:03:29.228
and do the same thing.

00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:30.863
You notice I'm sort of going with

00:03:30.863 --> 00:03:33.008
the [directionality] of the blades.

00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:34.149
If you go this way,

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:35.761
you're going to have a much harder time.

00:03:36.822 --> 00:03:38.135
You might even wind up

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:39.738
dulling the edges

00:03:39.738 --> 00:03:41.575
of your carbide tips.

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:48.526
(scrubbing)

00:03:48.526 --> 00:03:50.210
Once you have the outside edges done,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.810
you're going to need
to do the inside face,

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.359
and you probably want to do the back,

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:54.835
the back end of the teeth.

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:57.529
So, just keep that
[directionality] in mind.

00:03:58.036 --> 00:03:59.331
It should be fairly simple.

00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:01.804
(scrubbing)

00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:03.239
Now for the front face of each tooth,

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.914
I usually just spread the pad out like so,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.692
and put that in-between ...

00:04:08.692 --> 00:04:10.340
the space between each tooth.

00:04:11.432 --> 00:04:13.416
Just take a few strokes like so.

00:04:14.892 --> 00:04:15.863
It's typically enough to keep

00:04:15.863 --> 00:04:16.845
it nice and clean.

00:04:16.845 --> 00:04:20.289
(scrubbing)

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:21.995
Since it tends to get pretty sudsy,

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.071
(squirting) 
I like to take a spray bottle and just

00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:25.409
(squirting)

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:26.267
rinse it off a little bit

00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:27.248
with some water.

00:04:27.248 --> 00:04:29.295
(squirting)

00:04:29.295 --> 00:04:30.424
I can pour the cleaner

00:04:30.424 --> 00:04:32.092
back into the container.

00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:35.836
Since it can be tricky to get all

00:04:35.836 --> 00:04:37.611
the liquid out in-between the teeth,

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:39.193
I actually just use a hair dryer

00:04:39.193 --> 00:04:41.710
to make sure everything is bone dry.

00:04:42.602 --> 00:04:47.684
(buzzing)

00:04:47.684 --> 00:04:49.157
Of course the additional advantage

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:50.543
being that I can make sure I still

00:04:50.543 --> 00:04:51.722
look good for my closeup.

00:04:51.722 --> 00:04:54.384
(buzzing)

00:04:54.384 --> 00:04:55.322
Oh yeah.

00:04:55.758 --> 00:04:56.968
The final treatment for my blades

00:04:56.968 --> 00:04:58.644
and bits is to give it a coat of

00:04:58.644 --> 00:04:59.652
a dry lubricant,

00:04:59.652 --> 00:05:01.202
and that's going to help extend the life.

00:05:01.202 --> 00:05:03.562
The stuff I use is called DriCote.

00:05:03.562 --> 00:05:05.156
(squirting)
Just spray a little bit

00:05:05.156 --> 00:05:06.401
on the teeth.

00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:15.570
(squirting)
(scratching)

00:05:17.165 --> 00:05:18.498
(banging)

00:05:18.898 --> 00:05:20.239
Try to get both sides.

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:23.896
(squirting)

00:05:23.896 --> 00:05:25.139
Take a dry paper towel,

00:05:25.523 --> 00:05:27.541
and I just rub it into the metal.

00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:31.610
Pretty much the same treatment

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.605
for the router bit.

00:05:32.605 --> 00:05:36.756
(squirting)

00:05:40.403 --> 00:05:42.114
Simple routine maintenance like this

00:05:42.114 --> 00:05:44.508
can really save you a
lot of time and money.

00:05:44.508 --> 00:05:45.322
First of all,

00:05:45.322 --> 00:05:46.850
if your blades and bits are clean,

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.206
they just cut cleaner,

00:05:48.206 --> 00:05:49.456
and that means better results

00:05:49.456 --> 00:05:50.331
for your projects.

00:05:50.331 --> 00:05:51.322
The other this is,

00:05:51.322 --> 00:05:53.165
without all that pitch and resin on there,

00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:54.785
we don't get as much heat buildup.

00:05:54.785 --> 00:05:56.532
The heat is what really contributes

00:05:56.532 --> 00:05:58.290
to these edges becoming dull,

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.486
which means you have to then send

00:05:59.486 --> 00:06:00.726
them out to the sharpener.

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:03.013
I send my stuff out to a
professional sharpener,

00:06:03.013 --> 00:06:04.621
and the fewer times I have to do

00:06:04.621 --> 00:06:05.420
that a year,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.660
the more money I'm going to save.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.063
So, this is something I try to

00:06:08.063 --> 00:06:09.575
do at least monthly,

00:06:09.575 --> 00:06:10.700
and if I have a big project,

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.423
like my workbench that uses one

00:06:12.423 --> 00:06:13.811
particular bit heavily,

00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:15.160
I may even clean it in the middle

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.668
of the project but certainly after

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:17.773
the project is done.

00:06:17.773 --> 00:06:19.375
That bit is going to get cleaned up,

00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:21.180
and hopefully, it will extend the life.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.368
The other I wanted to mention is

00:06:23.368 --> 00:06:24.893
all the different cleaning solutions

00:06:24.893 --> 00:06:26.115
out there ranging from really

00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:27.274
caustic stuff,

00:06:27.274 --> 00:06:28.237
which I try to avoid,

00:06:28.237 --> 00:06:29.933
to the stuff that's very

00:06:29.933 --> 00:06:31.342
environmental friendly.

00:06:31.342 --> 00:06:33.382
Even just some simple soap and water

00:06:33.382 --> 00:06:34.041
could do the trick.

00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:35.785
That's what I want to hear from you guys.

00:06:35.785 --> 00:06:37.220
What stuff do you use to clean

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.466
your blades and bits?

00:06:38.742 --> 00:06:40.124
That's about it.

00:06:40.124 --> 00:06:41.344
That's how I keep my blades and

00:06:41.344 --> 00:06:43.523
bits nice and sharp between sharpening's.
