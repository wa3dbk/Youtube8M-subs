00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:15.860
This is how the case looks like when it was opened from the plastic wrap

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.520
This case has a kickstand on it's back

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.140
It's hard enough to be flipped open

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.660
The kickstand must be locked in place so the whole thing can stand stably

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.880
Now let's separate the inner and outer layer

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.440
The inner layer is made from hard rubber that's harder than regular silicon material

00:01:19.593 --> 00:01:26.253
See that it is a little sharp on the edges, but it's not harmful for the phone's screen and body

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:35.800
It seems that the outer layer is made from similar material with the inner layer, with higher hardness

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.100
Here goes my Mi 4i

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.580
I use anti-glare screen guard from Nillkin

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.840
The process of installing is a little bit harder than silicon case, because the stiffness of the material

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.660
Hopefully the screen and body won't be scratched.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:42.720
See that because the edge presses the screen, there are a bubble appears on the screen guard

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:53.140
The button parts also pretty stiff

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.580
Let's try to install the outer layer

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:29.140
You can see that there are gaps between the outer and inner layer edges

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.640
When compared with branded rugged-cases, it look untidy

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:03.460
The bubble on the edge of the screen guard appears, but it's not too annoying (I think)

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:11.100
With this kind of edge, I'm not sure it will goes well when paired with tempered glass

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.300
This is how it looks like when the kickstand is used

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.500
Pardon my thumb .. :P

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.540
That's it and thanks for watching
