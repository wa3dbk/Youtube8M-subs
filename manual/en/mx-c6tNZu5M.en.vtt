00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.370
Every year in the spring we come to Brookville
to collect walleye for our statewide walleye

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.500
stocking program.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.990
Annually we have a goal of about 30-35 million
eggs; if we have 30-35 million we are able

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.340
to fulfill all of our stocking needs throughout
the state.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.520
The crews will go out at 6:00 and set eight
gill nets that are five feet deep, the mesh

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.179
is about 1.25 inches and they're about 200
feet long.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:38.960
The gill nets are set about 10 feet from the
bank in about 6-8 feet of water.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.400
The idea is as the fish come in at night to
spawn, they'll run into these gill nets and

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:54.879
they'll become entangled, either through their
teeth or their gill flaps - opercles.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.790
Then the net crew will go out around 11 o'clock
that evening, run the nets, reset the nets,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.100
bring those fish back.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.170
That's a male.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.991
Seven males, that's all the males.

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:18.890
and then get a couple of hours of sleep and
then go back out about six in the morning

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:40.819
again, run the nets, collect the fish, and
bring the nets in 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:41.819
with them.

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.401
Once the fish are back at the facility, we
go back through, pick out the ripe females.

00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:52.420
They'll be placed in a tub with CO2 which
kind of relaxes the fish so that we're able

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.890
to handle them without them squirming around
too much.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.170
We generally take two or three females per
pan.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.500
We manually squeeze the eggs right out - when
the fish is ripe, the eggs flow easily right

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.100
out of the fish.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.020
We do two or three females and then two or
three males.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.110
We collect the milt from two or three females
to add to the eggs.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.940
We keep everything dry as we do this.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.390
The fish themselves we dry off because the
egg and sperm aren't activated until they

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.800
hit water.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.840
So we have a window of about 40 seconds to
a minute for the fertilization to take place.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.640
Once that happens they sit in a tupperware
container for about a minute.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.770
We add fuller's earth, which is a real fine
clay material, to the eggs and sperm which

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.140
keeps the eggs from sticking to each other.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.980
Rinse the eggs, put them in a hardening tray
which is just a flat structure that allows

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.840
oxygen to the egg.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.110
After about four hours they're tough enough
to be handled with a scoop and that's when

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:15.110
we place them in the McDonald jars. we try
to get about three quarts of eggs per jar.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.070
There's roughly 120,000 eggs per quart. once
they're positioned on the jar battery, which

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.800
is a contraption that has continuous water
flow to each jar, they're pretty much good

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.680
to go until they get back to the hatchery
at Cikana.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.250
This time of year we're working hatching walleye
eggs.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.110
The eggs come from Brookville Reservoir.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.360
The eggs when they come back are just a real
bright yellow color, kind of a golden color,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.360
really pretty.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.880
As they age, as they mature they begin what
we call "eyeing" up.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.020
That's when you start seeing the eyes of the
individual fish inside of the egg.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.080
That turns the eggs kind of a greenish state
and then by the time they're ready to hatch

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.010
the eggs are black basically, or they look
black.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.110
once the eggs come back we treat them and
then put them on the jar battery.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.440
And then every day until they are 10 days
old, we treat them with Hydrogen Peroxide

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.980
to try and eliminate any fungus that may be
on the eggs.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.340
We remove any eggs that aren't viable from
the jars as well as we can.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:30.120
Once hatching starts then we funnel the eggs
into one of four of our linear tanks.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.569
Those tanks then, each day we funnel into
a different tank.

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:42.710
So by the end of four days we have fry that
are four days old and some that have just

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.710
hatched.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:51.129
Eggs when they first hatch, the fry at that
stage are really what we call larval fry because

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.439
they're not fully developed.

00:04:54.439 --> 00:05:00.389
They have a tail which they wiggle and that
helps them swim up and out of the jar, but

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:06.440
at that stage, why we keep them for four days,
is because they've got a yolk sack, very much

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.280
like a chicken's egg yolk - just full of nutrients.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.599
They use those nutrients to further develop.

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.129
When they first hatch, they don't have all
of their body parts, their fins aren't fully

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:22.400
developed, they couldn't eat anything, they
don't have their full mouth parts, nor their

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.000
digestive tract.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.090
By the time they've what we call "buttoned
up" they've used that yolk sack, then they've

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.749
got their mouth parts, their digestive tract,
their fins - they're little tiny fish, they're

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:38.039
really fry at that stage and they need to
eat things.

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.910
That's when we want to stock them out.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:48.470
When we go to stock the fry we dip them out
with a special dip net and to innumerate them

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.590
we use beakers, 500 mL beakers.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:57.379
We hold that up to the light because the fry
will, when you hold it up to a bright light

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:02.740
they'll kind of sink down in that beaker and
we can read how many milliliters of fry there

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.830
are in that beaker.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.219
We then multiply that by the number of fry
we have established per milliliter over the

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:13.490
years and that determines how many we have.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.099
We try to stock about 100,000 per box.

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:23.669
We don't put them in a fish tank, we put them
in bags like when you get fish for your aquarium

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.870
at the store you get a little plastic bag
with a fish in it.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.259
Our bags are a little bigger.

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:34.370
We only put about four or five gallons of
water in each bag and we put the fry in there

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:41.370
and then we try and evacuate most of the air
out of that bag, just by squeezing it like

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.129
you would a ziplock bag at home.

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:50.840
and then we fill the bag with pure Oxygen
and tie it off so it won't leak.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.990
We put the bags in boxes, close the boxes
so sunlight doesn't get to them and then we

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.990
can haul them.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:05.800
We can usually keep fry in boxes like that
for 10 or 12 hours if we have too.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:14.360
We've already hatched a lot of eggs, we took
35 million total, we hope to get 20-25 million

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.529
fry out of those.

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:19.139
And then we'll stock them throughout the state.

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:23.360
The main benefit is for the anglers.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:30.470
Walleye fishing is a very popular past time,
it's a high quality eating fish, it's a fun

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.379
fish to catch.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:37.100
So our main goal is to provide walleye for
anglers to catch.
