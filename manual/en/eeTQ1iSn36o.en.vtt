JESSICA: Hi, I'm Jessica, I work in Marketing,
and today, I'm reviewing the Ultra ThinLine

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.950
Sheepskin Comfort Half Pad.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.550
The main reason I chose this half pad is because
of the ThinLine technology on the top side

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.610
of the pad.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.599
ThinLine is known for its incredible shock-dissipating
abilities.

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:22.019
Specifically, it disperses shock laterally
across the pad instead of up and down, which

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.109
impacts both your horse's back and your own
back.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.949
When you ride on a ThinLine pad, you can tell
that your horse feels more comfortable, and

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.279
you actually feel more stable and steady in
the saddle.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.649
My other favorite feature of this pad is that
it's shim-able.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.920
There is an easy shim pocket right here, and
you can choose ThinLine shims designed for

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.680
both the front shoulder area and the back
of the pad, and it's really simple to slide

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.149
them in and move them around.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.670
This gives you more flexibility when it comes
to getting just the right saddle fit for your

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.670
horse.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.059
The other reason to choose this pad is because
of the beautiful sheepskin on the underside.

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.179
Having sheepskin against your horse makes
a huge difference in their comfort and also

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.409
helps avoid pressure points.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.450
This half pad also features traditional velcro
billet straps to help keep it in place.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.659
This half pad is perfect for anyone riding
in an English saddle.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.799
It comes in several different sizes and it
also comes in both black and white depending

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.340
on your style preference.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.880
It's great for schooling, as well as showing,
because the sheepskin rolls continue on both

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.560
the pommel and cantle area to give it a beautiful
look underneath your saddle.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.700
You can use sheepskin pads like this by themselves
right against your horse's back or you can

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.130
help keep them a little bit cleaner by using
a cotton pad, like a square, all-purpose,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.880
or dressage pad or a baby pad underneath.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.219
As with any sheepskin pad, this one is well
worth the investment, but it does require

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.539
just a little bit of extra TLC.

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.340
I recommend washing it with a cleaner specifically
designed for sheepskin, such as Melp, and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.200
after riding, if the pad is sweaty, you'll
want to turn it upside down so that it can

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.200
air dry.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.179
I'm Jessica, and the Ultra ThinLine Sheepskin
Comfort Half Pad is the perfect choice for

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.579
keeping your horse comfortable.
