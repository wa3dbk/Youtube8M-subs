00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.379
Bridging the Persian gulf, the country of
Iran sits to the west of Iraq, and the east

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:07.140
of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.930
Since 1979, Iran has been ruled by a violent
Shiia regime. The current Supreme Leader,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.019
Ali Khameini, has declared that Western governments,
led by the US, wish to overthrow the Islamic

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.289
Republic in a similar manner to their overthrow
of the Soviet Union.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.039
But just how dangerous is Iran?

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.009
Iran is already a threatening presence in
the Middle East. It supports the oppressive

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.670
Syrian Assad regime financially and militarily.
Its leaders have announced Israel should be

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.480
wiped off the map, and have frequently been
guilty of holocaust denial.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.320
To date, the country's military consists of
525,000 active personnel, thousands of armoured

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.820
vehicles, and hundreds of missiles.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.190
Unstable and aggressive, history suggests
Iran wouldn't hesitate to use these weapons.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.699
In 1992 it bombed the Israeli embassy, and
in 1994 attacked a Jewish community centre

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.960
in Buenos Aires, killing 200 people.
But there could be an even greater threat

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.180
in store, as suggests Iran is developing nuclear
weapons..

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.250
Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons became public
knowledge in 2002, when Iranian exiles reported

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.439
a huge uranium enrichment plant had been built
beneath the city of Natanz without informing

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.420
the United Nations. However, Iran claimed
it only intended to develop a nuclear fuel

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.420
cycle.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.791
In 2012 a think tank dedicated to tracking
Iran's nuclear programmes, announced that

00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:33.110
the country had produced 6.2 tons of weapons-grade
Uranium â€“ enough to make five nuclear weapons.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.399
In 2012, the US defence department said: ""With
sufficient foreign assistance, Iran may be

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.650
technically capable of flight-testing an intercontinental
ballistic missile by 2015""

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.420
However, Iran has repeatedly refused requests
for full investigations, meaning we cannot

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.140
be sure just how close they are to having
a nuclear arsenal.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.030
The outcome of Iran owning nuclear weapons
could be disastrous.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.950
With full nuclear capability, it is probable
they would become increasingly aggressive,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.829
with the threat of an attack giving them power
over fellow Middle-Eastern countries.

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.360
More worryingly, it could signal the emergence
of a nuclear contest between Iran and Israel.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.230
While Iran has claimed that due to the county's
small size ""even one nuclear bomb inside

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.500
Israel will destroy everything"", fear of
being hit could provoke Israel into launching

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.900
a defensive attack.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.090
And as one of the world's largest state supporters
of terrorism, it is possible their nuclear

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.610
weapons could fall into some very dangerous
hands...

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.680
Iran has provided training, money and military
support to the terrorist groups Hezbollah

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.630
and Hamas.
Yet the US has deemed their relationship with

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.260
these extremist groups as of lesser concern
than the rise of IS.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.760
However in reality Iran could be an equal,
if not greater threat than IS, with whom they

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.739
share a hatred for those in Israel and the
West, whom they call infidels who must be

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.239
destroyed.

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.560
Despite Obama's claim that he will consider
an effective way to prevent Iran from launching

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.760
attacks, including possible military action,
there has been no credible course of action.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.819
As such many have suggested that Iran is being
given the space to become even stronger.

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.629
Consequently, if the world does successfully
rid itself of IS, Iran may step into the void.

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.840
So the West might do nothing more than replace
the threat of a radical Sunni caliphate, with

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.170
a rising radical Shiia caliphate.
So while we are safe for now, we could simply

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:47.560
be biding our time until the true danger of
Iran becomes very clear.
