00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.190
Brazil x Japan

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.010
-Low blow.
-That was cowardice.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.200
Hey, Japanese dude!
Don't be a coward!

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.150
In 1986
Jairzinho went to Japan...

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.000
to Nagasaki, to teach 1,500 boys.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.050
So, I'd like to say that Jairzinho was
contributing back then...

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.240
to the current success
of the Japanese soccer.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.210
Now let's watch the game,
let's watch the game.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.170
A game between a teacher
and a student.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.200
Brazil, Brazil. Not Japan.
Brazil, Brazil.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.060
Do it!

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.230
-Goal!
-Incredible goal!

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.060
Is there sashimi pizza on the menu?
Salmon?

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.110
Japan is a very good team...

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.090
tactically speaking. But when they
need to resume their game...

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.090
get back on their feet,
they're very slow.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
They're bringing their lines forward,
like I told you.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.110
Felipão should bring
Hurricane to play.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.020
I'll just have to come
and replace Hulk.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.220
Do I have big eyes?
Are my eyes big or small?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.160
Mr. Ohara...

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.150
What do you see going on with Japan
that they can't get to the goal area?

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.090
EXCLUSIVE CAMERA - MR. OHARA'S VIEW

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.080
Mr. Ohara, here's a gift to you.
Here's for you to drink up.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.180
They missed it.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.100
He's rooting for Brazil!

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.070
So, how is Japan doing?

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.240
What do you think,
is Japan going to improve?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.030
Yeah.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.210
HALFTIME

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.140
Lionel Gomes has a question.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.190
Jair, what's the logic of life?

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.180
The logic of life...

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.040
is knowing how to be successful
in life. That's the logic of life.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.050
Ana Luiza Machado has a question.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.130
Jair, shouldn't Brazil
bring Lucas back for the second half?

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.190
SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING
CHEW YOUR FOOD PROPERLY

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.040
Lucas should've come in already.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.030
I agree with you.
On the second half...

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.190
I hope Brazil
achieves more advantage...

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.030
it's still a tight,
risky score, 1 x 0.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.120
-Paulinho.
-Paulinho.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.120
What's the main technical shortcoming
of the Brazilian Soccer Team?

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.180
The main shortcoming  is collectivity.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.010
...should know how to defend,
organize, and finalize.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.090
Japan is not bringing it
out in Brazil.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.140
This guy right here
is the best coach in Brazil.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.210
Go on, ask away.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.200
Would you change last week's grade,
when you gave Brazil a 2?

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.040
No, no, no... You're mistaken.
I didn't give the Brazilian Team  a 2.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.230
-We have it on tape.
-I gave Felipão a 2, that's different.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.160
Play it back and show him.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.050
How would you grade
the current Felipão management?

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.040
Felipão.
Felipão.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.130
¡Arriba!

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.180
Ohara, Ohara!

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.070
Mr. Ohara...
Mr. Ohara...

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.170
Mr. Wilson!

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.010
Mr. Ohara,
have you ever played soccer or not?

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.170
-No, he's a fighter.
-Fighter?

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.160
-Miyagi, Mr. Miyagi!
-...for over 10 years.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.220
-He doesn't want it.
-I prefer Caipirinha.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.110
Bad luck! ??

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.100
Ohara, would you like some sushi?

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.210
END OF GAME

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.080
So that's the path we should take,
towards our main goal...

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.200
which is winning
the Confederations Cup...

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:21.000
and preparing this team
to be world champion next year.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.210
Congrats, that's what we want.
