00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.480
hey I'm cavalia take a left the street
rod magazine and crash the trucks

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.689
magazine and today we're going to be
using it with bead roller

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.289
it's more than just to be wrong though
because it also form step flanges and it

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.220
will share middle

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.759
it comes with various manual so you can
be drawn quarter inch 38 inch and half

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:30.750
inch white beads

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.129
it also flange 1 16 or 18 and a quarter
inch step and it comes with a sheer

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.089
mandrel so you can cut sheet metal with
it a little cutting manual is also

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:39.750
available

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.570
we're going to be using the bead roller
today to form a step lines around the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.350
edge of this panel where I've marked it
i want it fits up inside were used to be

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.730
a trailer fender

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.960
it will fit flush inside it and then
when it's worded and ground down

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.960
you wanted to see the joint and I look
like a one-piece stamping one of the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.230
advantages of step landing sheet metal
is it'll stiffen it

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.719
this is the sheet metal before we find
it as you can see is pretty flexible and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.310
our fruits flange waste effort as you
can see we got the new panel in here and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.310
it's not flush

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.950
there we have it one step plans panel
and this is what the finished piece

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.420
looks like we've welded one piece to the
other the ground down the world sanded

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.719
smooth and a fabricated to call and
pieces of the jobs finished

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.030
ok so now we're going to change out the
step pledge manuals and fit the bead

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.280
rolling minerals and we're ready to be
dropped those we feed this through we

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.719
follow the line

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:56.959
why I will be turn the wheel slowly we
bring it way back round to where we

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.179
started and there we have a biro

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.560
this provides way more strength of the
panel and just a flat panel zone and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.259
that's how the bead roller works if you
want to see more of their tools visit
