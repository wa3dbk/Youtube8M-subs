JENNIFER&gt;&gt; Hello! My name is Jennifer and
I'd like to tell you a few things about the

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:09.710
Yellow Route that you might not know.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.150
First of all, none of us like to be stuck
in traffic-especially me! And sometimes when

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.890
I'm in Branson I'm tempted to go right down
the Strip--in that case, traffic often looks

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.060
kind of like this. Lots of cars, sometimes
worse, sometimes a little better. But if I

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.989
want to get someplace I'll take one of the
bypasses that are listed on all the local

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.359
maps. I'm going to show you today two things
about the Yellow Route that you might like

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:44.449
to know. It's not just a bypass; it's an easy
and interesting route to get to some of the

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.149
really neat things that Branson has to offer.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:54.289
So here's a glimpse of the Yellow Route. Wide
Lanes, not too much traffic-kind of the secret

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.690
back entrance to several things. First, I'd
like to show you one of the nature trails

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.940
you can take if you just happen to have a
little extra time or want to wear off some

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.720
of those calories from all the good places
you've been eating. Hang on, I'll show you!

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.650
If you're in pretty good shape you might want
to take a little jaunt down here to the Lakeside

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.010
Forest Wilderness Area. This isn't for the
weak of heart, there's quite a few steps down

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.640
to the lake but well worth it.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:30.470
The Yellow Route will also take you right
along the edge of Thousand Hills Golf Resort.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.780
It's an 18 hole public course and really fun
to play. You can also stay at this resort

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.910
for a night, a week, a month or however long
you'd like. It's a great, great place to stay.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.630
Close and as you can see, beautiful and quiet.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.850
My, I wish I were playing, but I have an assignment
to do-I've got more to show you of the yellow

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.850
route.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.280
Not quite ready for the 18 holes at Thousand
Hills? You might just spend the afternoon

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.280
with your family and friends at one of the
places to miniature golf on the Yellow Route.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.740
This is on Green Mountain Drive, called Dinosaur
Canyon.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.940
If you prefer pirates over dinosaurs you have
your choice here on the Yellow Route. You

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.560
can have Pirate's Cove mini-golf as well as
dinosaurs if you prefer.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.410
Did you know that Missouri is quite famous
for it's grape growing and wine making abilities?

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:37.230
Here in Branson you can stop in at the Mount
Pleasant Winery.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.840
Also right along Green Mountain Drive, on
the yellow route.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.860
Did you know that in places the Yellow Route
almost parallels the Strip where all the theaters

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.780
are? And if some night you're wanting to slip
in or slip out of a theater without getting

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.240
in all that traffic take the yellow route,
come into the backside of the theater. You're

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.630
going to wind up here anyway! It's just a
lot more convenient.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.690
What's this on the hill? Gosh I think it's
the Butterfly Palace and Rainforest. You'll

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.720
find this at the end of the yellow route.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.540
Yes we have now made it to the end of the
Yellow Route. If you go north, you'll run

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.830
right into the Red Route and Shepherd of the
Hills Expressway; a good, quick way to get

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.830
out of town.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.630
At the end of the Yellow Route you're only
about 4 miles from Highway 65 that will go

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.220
north to Springfield or south to Arkansas.
You're only about 7 miles to Branson West,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.370
probably about 5 miles to Silver Dollar City.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.750
Thank you for looking at the yellow route
with me and remember, when in Branson, always

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.599
drive friendly!
