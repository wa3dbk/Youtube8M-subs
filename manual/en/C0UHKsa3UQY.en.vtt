00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.296
what up guys? Welcome to Inspire to Cook!

00:00:02.296 --> 00:00:07.697
Summer is coming up so today I am going to show you something cool and exciting for both kids and adults alike

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.146
Orange Jello in the Orange Peel

00:00:10.146 --> 00:00:13.433
The ingredients we are going to need you can easily find in your grocery stores

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:15.219
we are going to use some oranges

00:00:15.746 --> 00:00:18.386
as well as some jello, the orange jell-o

00:00:18.386 --> 00:00:22.617
and I also will need a couple boiling hot water and a cup of cold water

00:00:22.617 --> 00:00:26.592
We will start with the jello. I'll go ahead and open the jello box

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.060
we'll dump everthing in our small container

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:32.513
it needs to fit at least two cups

00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:35.313
grab our hot water and pour it all in

00:00:36.952 --> 00:00:38.072
nice and orangey

00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:39.832
mix it up with the spoon

00:00:40.314 --> 00:00:41.434
smell delicious

00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:46.339
you want to make sure the jello powder dissolves completely in the hot water before you do anything else

00:00:47.718 --> 00:00:53.158
once our powder is dissolved, we are going to grab our cup of cold water and add it in

00:00:53.158 --> 00:00:55.082
and we are going to put it aside

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:59.159
than we are going to grab our oranges and we are about to knife them in half

00:00:59.463 --> 00:01:00.423
just like that

00:01:00.423 --> 00:01:01.851
from top to the bottom

00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:06.385
than we'll take our spoon and will separate the flesh from the skin

00:01:09.382 --> 00:01:10.982
same with the other half

00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:12.936
my oranges are nice and juicy

00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:15.291
and you'll take these and give it to your kids

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:18.272
alright we will separate the orange peels separated from the flesh

00:01:20.134 --> 00:01:24.134
we'll take these and put them on the muffin pan just like that

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.150
to make sure they seat horizontally

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.677
looks like its pretty level

00:01:28.677 --> 00:01:30.546
so we are ready for our next step

00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:35.442
then we'll grab our jello in the making and transfer it into one of these thingies

00:01:35.442 --> 00:01:39.664
so it's comfortable for us to transfer the gello liquid in the orange peels

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:49.275
and it's ready to place in our fridge

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.858
useful tip: don't fill it all the way to the top

00:01:51.858 --> 00:01:55.676
place it in the fridge and than fill it in all the way to the max

00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:58.988
after four to six hours, we are ready to take these out

00:01:58.988 --> 00:02:02.239
and as you see they are all settled. All nice and solid

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:05.952
and we are ready to take these out and we are about ready to serve them

00:02:05.952 --> 00:02:06.924
exciting time!

00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:08.796
There are couple ways to serve it really!

00:02:09.148 --> 00:02:14.668
you can cut it into slices like that or take halves and give it to someone with a spoon

00:02:15.304 --> 00:02:18.184
and it's just beautiful jello in the oragne

00:02:18.184 --> 00:02:19.249
looks pretty amazing

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:20.601
let's give it a taste

00:02:21.385 --> 00:02:22.585
taste like jello!

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:24.530
very cool, very cool presentation

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.384
it makes it much more fun to eat

00:02:26.384 --> 00:02:27.546
let's taste one of these

00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:33.348
Pretty good!

00:02:33.348 --> 00:02:36.544
