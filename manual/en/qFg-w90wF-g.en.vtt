00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.580
Hello, my name is Michael Raines. And we're
on Expert Village. Here's your typical set-up.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.259
Here is your disposal unit. Now, this one
happens to be a one-third horsepower. They

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:16.220
come in one-half horsepower, three-quarter
horsepower, and for some of the commercial,

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.970
like restaurant applications, they're going
to be a one horsepower motor. Now they're

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.540
electric. They're powered down here. They're
connected to the sink with a connector we're

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:33.719
going to show you later. And basically all
it does is spin around and grind up food.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.000
We'll show you that when we get the disposal
off. We'll show you the teeth inside and how

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.679
it actually works. You've got to understand
there's a whole lot more going on in here,

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:51.159
like the drain, the water feed, and this air
breather for the dishwasher. Now this is also

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:58.339
a breather for the disposal and it also feeds
from the dishwasher to shoot hot water into

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.409
the disposal. Which is a good thing because
it cleans out your disposal with the hot dishwater.

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.370
And this is the line from the dishwasher.
So you never really want to disconnect these

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.750
two and leave them unconnected. Because the
next time you throw on your dishwasher, you're

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.900
going to have a big mess under here. So, obviously
I found a little problem here. This hose should

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.470
not be loose. This one's kind of tight, this
one's loose, we need to tighten that up. So,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.700
that's one little problem. But that's not
our problem. Our problem is that the disposal

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.450
doesn't work. Okay, before we go taking out
the disposal, we're going to make sure that

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.250
there's nothing jammed inside the disposal.
Sometimes there's keys, change. I mean, a

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.590
penny is the most common, common thing that
blocks up a disposal. It jams it up very nicely.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.820
So we're going to go look around, see if there's
anything inside the disposal that's jamming

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.980
it up. If there's nothing jamming the disposal,
the electrical isn't working, then we just

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.750
have to pull the disposal out. So let's have
a look down inside the business end of a disposal

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.770
unit.
