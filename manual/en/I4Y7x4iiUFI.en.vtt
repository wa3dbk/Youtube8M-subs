00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.220
 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.599
When you're dealing with younger
swimmer who seems to have water comfort fears

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.789
There's a wide array of areas that
they might be afraid of.  A lot of times

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.410
it's a fear of submerging certain body
parts

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.029
a lot of times it's just support in the
water or feeling a lack of control

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.070
It may be one little thing that they're
afraid of, once they conquer that

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.400
then the development seems to
hit a quantum leap

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.989
or it hits hyper speed and they
develops really fast if you can identify

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.640
and conquer these waters fears in general

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.000
at an early age

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.500
Submerging body parts

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.800
Now it may sound trivial to the
adult

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.860
but to the kids this is a very very real
fear

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.800
So you need to be aware that sometimes
when kids are scared of the water

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.660
it may be simply related to the fact
that they are afraid of submerging

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.050
certain body parts.  Now it can be

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.300
anywhere on the body, 
it could be their shoulders it could be their hands

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.750
 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.380
but most of the fears that I have found
are actually linked to the head in some way

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.850
 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.170
it could be their mouth, their nose,
their ears, their eyes

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.320
something that they're actually afraid
to submerge

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.350
so pay attention when you're little
scared swimmer

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.950
is in the water and see if there is
something which they're dodging

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.600
which they're always keeping dry

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.710
this may be a sign that they're afraid
of submerging

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.869
a certain body.  Okay I wanted to
talk to the parent briefly

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.729
when you're dealing with your younger
swimmer that might have a little bit

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.289
a few fears and they might be little bit
timid or shy around the water

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.910
There are a few tricks to it and the
biggest thing is probably the parent

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.100
making sure that they actually stay calm
and relaxed and that the swimmer feels safe

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.820
 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.040
if you can create that environment for
your swimmer then you're going to have a

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.180
lot more success

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.310
that someone whose tense because the
this swimmer will pick up on that

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.190
As far as tricks to it--If you do
'Bobs' I know it sounds simple but you

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.450
really want to keep it simple

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.130
You want to do 'Bobs' up and down out of the
water.  Some things are like

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.860
'face splashes' that's really where you're just 
splashing your face down hard into the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.470
water

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.049
and your little swimmer will do it as
well and then you guys can have

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.090
fun doing that

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.120
and they'll really start to see that the
water is not going to hurt them

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.500
a couple of other things is give them small
goals when they're trying to get

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.829
comfortable to the water

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.829
If you wanna set a point on their
body

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.570
If they're real scared to even get in then
you can set like their knees

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.519
'Let's go up to our knees right now'
'Now let's go up to our waist'

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.730
'Let's see if we can get our shoulders in?'
if you set little goals and the swimmer

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.940
feel successful bit by bit along the way

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.890
Then they'll really start to adjust to the water and
they'll really start to see the water as

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.600
something that they can be comfortable
in

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.720
Another thing is like 'Spider Walk' or
'Caterpillar Walk' along the side of the pool

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.230
 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.370
That's where you both hang onto the
side to the pool

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.570
and you can walk down as far as you
need to go as you're going down the pool

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.280
 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.900
Sometimes when the swimmer really
becomes comfortable they can actually

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.870
loop around the deep end and 
you guys can go all the way around the pool

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.190
and before you know it

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:29.190
they're really not scared to be in certain
parts of the pool

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.980
A lot of times you'll run into a whole new
set of fears when they start working on their back

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.680
 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.640
As long as they're on their front, in their
comfort zone, where they can see

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.990
everything that's going on

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.300
They are going to go
They'll do anything you want them to do

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.690
but as soon as you flip them over 
and start working on their back

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.920
Oooh! there's a whole set of fears that
actually come on them. The two most common

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.989
things that I have found

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.800
Is a lack of control and a lack of
support

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.060
the lack of control comes in with the
inexperience they have on their back

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.380
they're not used to doing a lot of
skills on their back

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.470
So they have to be able to trust
themselves and a lot of times younger

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.030
swimmers or developing swimmers

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.730
aren't good at that.  So give them time
don't rush the swimmer, allow them to

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.930
become comfortable with their body
movements when on their back

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.800
Also a lack of support.  Now there's two
magic places that you can

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.510
put support

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.840
and it helps the swimmer develop
freely and it frees their mind

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.229
of having to stay afloat

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.790
There's two points on the body--one is on
the back of the head

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.250
one is just underneath the hips and if
you apply support in those two areas

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.810
then the swimmer will stay up nice and easy
