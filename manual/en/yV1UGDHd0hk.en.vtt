00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:13.889
Kyle Bradshaw from Cruiser Customizing Line
and Cable Tip of the Week.

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.460
Over the last couple of weeks we've been doing
modifications with this VStar 650 classic,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.720
put risers and bars and this time we're gonna
tackle lines and cables.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.880
Our buddies at Baron's Custom Accessories
have sent us the complete kit. In this kit

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.800
they have sent us throttle push and pull,
clutch and front brake line.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.100
Over the next hour or so we're gonna assemble
the Vstar 650 and install the clutch lever,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.230
brake line, and the new throttle cable. You
may want to take a look on how simple the

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.550
process is.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.579
First thing we're gonna do is to remove the
seat and the tanks. We have access to everything

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.470
we have access to. The seat is removed. Ok,
so take removal of each motorcycle is slightly

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.219
different, the actual disassembly of this
is not necessarily that clean, but the installation

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.109
of lines and cables is almost identical for
all motorcycles.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.570
Remove the gas tank off, as you can see here
we have all the access from the throttle cables

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.780
all the way down to the connector carburetor.
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna separate the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:15.070
switchbox housing, and I'm gonna slide these
throttle cables off the bar. What I'm gonna

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.829
do is remove the cables from both the grip
and the housing. I'm gonna come in here to

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:28.020
the throttle cables near the intake. I'm gonna
go ahead and loosen both the front and back,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.450
and slide this out of the room.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.869
We start to the other side of the carburetor.
I'm gonna go ahead and remove the top and

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.799
bottom cables. Once they are disconnected
on the other, I can bring them over here,

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.979
I can undo each of these nuts, and undo the
cables and slide them all the way to the front

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:55.890
of the motorcycle. Here's the top cable, and,
easy. Now, the bottom cable.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.350
Before we install these cables, it's imperative
that we lube them. The easiest way to lube

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.450
the cables is to use a fancy tool from Motion
Pro. We slip the cable into this rubber housing,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.320
and now we're gonna go ahead and tighten this.
once you've got that in place we're gonna

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.329
get the Motion Pro Lube Can. We're gonna insert
the straw. Now, we'll spread lube under this

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.329
cable until you see the lube coming out in
the other end.

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.609
Now we're gonna install the stainless steel
throttle push and pull cables into the housings.

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.940
And then, we're gonna attach them into the
front of the carburetor.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.540
Alright, we just got the throttle housing
connected back up. Our lines are framed through

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.980
the back of the motorcycle.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.900
Once I get this attached to this brace here,
we'll slide the brace in between the choke

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.980
cable here and we're gonna attach them to
the front of the carburetor.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.549
We'll attach them to the carburetor. Now the
test.

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.080
Does the throttle react like they should?
Oh, look at that snap back.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.609
Now that we got this handle, now we're gonna
go ahead and tackle the front brake line and

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:03.850
the clutch. Now we'll remove this reservoir
cap. So I'm gonna go ahead and remove the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.500
line, down here at the caliper.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.260
Now we put all the fluid out of the master
cylinder here, we're gonna go ahead and cover

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.470
this when the bolt is loose and remove this
line.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.979
Baron's has given us a brand new line, brand
new budger bolt, and new washers. So assign

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:34.160
the first washer into the bolt, we're gonna
go through the housing, apply our second washer,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.949
and screw this to the caliper.

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:46.750
We're gonna run the brake line up to the triple
tree, take this, attach it to the reservoir.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.380
There are lots and lots of different ways
to bleed a brake system. Typically, you bleed

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.630
the brakes of a motorcycle by filling the
reservoir here with fluid, creating some pressure,

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.350
holding it, and releasing the valve to release
the pressure and that bleeds the line.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.579
In the community for the last couple of weeks
there was quite a talk about it.

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.829
Today we're gonna show you secrets passed
down from great-grandfather, to my grandfather,

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.639
and today I'm gonna show you.

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.979
It's a really simple way to make sure that
there are no air bubbles in the system here.

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:20.229
What I'm gonna show you is I'm taking a nipple,
putting it into the bottle. What I'm gonna

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:26.560
do is I'm gonna squeeze this fluid into this
line through the calper, up the brake line,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.260
and I'm gonna fill this entire reservoir using
this bottle. It's gonna make sure that there's

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:40.730
absolutely no air in the calper all the way
up to the reservoir.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.950
Once you've got the reservoir filled, we're
gonna go ahead place the reservoir cap, our

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.220
mounting screws, and the installation of our
front brake line is complete.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.180
Now it's time to replace the clutch cable.
The clutch cable is simply removed by loosening

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.640
the adjusting bolts right here. Once you have
loosen the adjuster all the way, I can go

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:08.020
ahead and pull the cable out. Now, I can slide
this all the way through each of the holders,

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:17.480
up from the top here, and I'm gonna make the
adjusters line up here, so that we have a

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:26.190
line that goes all the way across, and, reach
on up in here, I've removed the barrel.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.050
Now just like the throttle cables, we're gonna
go ahead and lube this clutch cable. Now that

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.400
we got this lubed, we're gonna slide it dow
through the factory harnesses. We're gonna

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:45.500
slide the barrel up in the holder here.
We're gonna reinstall our front adjustment

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.010
nut; reconnect the cable.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.930
Now, it's just a matter of taking this bike
outside and adjusting the clutch so the friction

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.000
zone is in the perfect spot.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.230
We've just completely transformed the look
and performance of the front of this motorcycle

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.770
with chains from Baron's. This is the Baron's
complete kit. It comes absolutely complete

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.100
with everything you need to get your motorcycle
on the road with a particular riser and bar

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.100
accommodation.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:23.100
There we have it! Look at these gorgeous lines
and cables, risers and bars on this Vstar

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:33.250
650 Classic. We've just done adjusting the
clutch, making all the final adjustments and

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.600
now we're gonna let her rip.
