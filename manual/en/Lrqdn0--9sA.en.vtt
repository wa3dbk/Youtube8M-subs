00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.410
crossing in front of me

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.439

couple nights a week

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.819
rachel helicopters are currently very
busy that seems to be probably one of

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.169
the biggest growing segment of the hobby
right now the with michael helicopter

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.140
apartment door

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.630
overall people just really lovely

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.310
swept the an airplane a cargo whatever
it's it's all there for whatever persons

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.640
we have a lot of

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.690
fathers and sons a common race or

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.250
applying feel once we get their
attention

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.240
this really can be a lifelong

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.240
i mean i've got a fellow

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.410

everyday

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.780
talking about model has a ten-year-old
kids so it's it's being life-time

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.230
passion in some cases slot cars i'm sure
any of us have probably play with sought

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.120
cars no matter how old you are that
continues to be very popular

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.720
rockets are something that would really
like because it's basically get young

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.770
people involved in something that is
beyond just building it and then display

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.790
it actually has an operation to it

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.140
what i really like about the rockets is
that

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.710
they do have the time to sit down be
creative

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.250
have the time to make it their own pain
it whatever color they want but then to

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.400
have a glock function and if you have
seen these rockets ago

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.530
they're very coming the performance on
the sock standing plastic models more

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.270
often not us it's not about building for
a model the building

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.330
models

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.340
doll house is a kind of the same way

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.500
basically taken taken build that dream
house and what we would consider

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.900
miniature scale

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.900
where one inch represented

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.590
but they can take and create this house
in wallpaper and decorated

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.380
doesn't carry pretty extensive inventory
of trains one of things that we try to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.630
happier a pretty good kaufman a bomb of
what we consider building supplies that

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.730
would be the paints in the schools

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.180
two-piece computer creepy actually
layout

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.239
whether people landscaping materials or
the woods in coburg materials that are

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.840
needed to him to do that faults
landscape paints the glues and the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.650
general building supplies

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.390
it's one thing to play a um... a video
game and have a blocking battle on t_v_

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.349
where there's really nothing ever asked
you to reset replying

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.009
whatever the case today

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:27.719
when you're racing at your friend but
when you're flying warnings model

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.239
airplanes and helicopters yet a
real-life were asked

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.649
it's pathetic

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:37.359
you can get the the race the biggest
thing is it's a real life experience as

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.189
opposed to any impatient

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.840
where actually pretty convenient right
off of exit fifty three main turnpike

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.519
come through the toll plaza

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.689
you're looking at the must come across
and shopping plaza

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.010
