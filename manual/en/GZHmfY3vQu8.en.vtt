00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.930
In looking at the description of Color Sheep
in iTunes, the game is not recommended to

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.120
those with color blindness.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.830
This is indeed a smart recommendation as what
we have here is a color matching skill tester

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.340
disguised as a sheep defending his land from
a pack of wolves by firing lasers out of his

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.340
mouth.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.710
It's a good disguise... a wolf in sheep's
clothing if you will, but people with color

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.890
blindness aside, this might only appeal to
a certain type of gamer due to the reaction

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.920
time involved in progression.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.870
The tutorial shows you the basics.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.980
You have three color buttons and a light and
dark button.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.920
Tapping a color and either light and dark
will turn the sheep that color in a bright

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.320
or dull tint, and pressing the reset button
will turn the sheep black.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.260
When the sheep is tapped, a laser will fire
out of its mouth, destroying any wolves that

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.989
color, and scoring you multipliers if you
happen to take out more than one with a single

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.059
blast.

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.970
Along the way power-ups may float down that
when tapped on give you slow-down or screen

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.200
clearing abilities, but the main issue here
is how fast the wolves move, and how quickly

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.040
new mechanics are added.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.890
Introduced in the second stage is the mechanic
of combining two colors plus the light button

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.000
to take on different colored wolves.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.160
Then in stage three, it's combining all three
colors to take on gray and white wolves, and

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.430
then in stage four with all this behind you,
you learn now to combine two colors plus the

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.580
dark button.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.750
The game mixes up all these mechanics right
away, and if a wolf gets to you, that's it.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.750
Game over.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.970
Time to start again.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.860
The fast pace means you succeed or fail based
on how quickly your eyes, brain, and memory

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.720
process and respond to the wolf onslaught,
and while like anything, the better you get

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.170
the more you play, those that don't respond
well won't wish to continue.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.600
But for those that gel with this game, the
world is very colorful (you would hope given

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.140
the title), with a lot of the power-up effects
being quite impressive.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.030
The classical music backing also adds an epic
quality to the gameplay, which is kind of

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.030
amusing considering the premise.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.390
If you enjoy tests of skill, rising to the
challenge, and what this game asks of you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.530
with its simple, yet complex mechanic, Color
Sheep should entertain.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:08.050
Other gamers will probably just end up frustrated.
