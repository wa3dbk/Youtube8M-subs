00:00:01.932 --> 00:00:04.022
- Oh, man, it's like a calculator.

00:00:04.022 --> 00:00:08.620
(techno music)

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.895
- I know that if a flip phone
falls, you don't have to worry

00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:12.741
about it breaking the screen.

00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:17.082
- I know that they flip and they're old.

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:19.915
- Kind of basic as far as cell phones go.

00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:24.915
(techno music)

00:00:26.452 --> 00:00:27.822
- What is this?

00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:30.098
- This isn't real, this
isn't real, it's a toy.

00:00:30.098 --> 00:00:32.152
- It doesn't even have a screen.

00:00:32.152 --> 00:00:35.113
- Dang, this is hella basic.

00:00:35.113 --> 00:00:36.633
- Where's the on button?

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:39.060
(cell phone dialing)

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.799
- I'm guessing this is some
sort of a pager kind of thing.

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:42.972
- Wait, is it only for calling?

00:00:42.972 --> 00:00:46.815
That's so sad, and it's ugly
too, this is really ugly.

00:00:46.815 --> 00:00:51.713
- When I hold this, I think I
could be in the 19-whenever.

00:00:51.713 --> 00:00:56.713
(techno music)

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:03.184
- So this one's got a screen, two screens.

00:01:03.184 --> 00:01:04.868
- This one is taking forever to turn on.

00:01:04.868 --> 00:01:08.327
- Maybe if I whip out the
antenna, it'll go faster.

00:01:08.327 --> 00:01:09.429
(cell phone music)

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:11.287
- Oh, it has music.

00:01:11.287 --> 00:01:13.981
- It's got a nice moving fish background.

00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:17.882
- You can have pictures,
but you can't take them.

00:01:17.882 --> 00:01:19.650
- So no selfies for you.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.507
(cell phone dialing)

00:01:21.507 --> 00:01:23.352
- Hello?

00:01:23.352 --> 00:01:25.581
It actually works.

00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:27.485
- It's still alive.

00:01:27.485 --> 00:01:28.867
- Wow, it is pretty durable.

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:29.970
- Don't do that to my phone.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.970
(techno music)

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:39.026
- Here it is, the Razr.

00:01:39.026 --> 00:01:41.568
- I always wanted one of
these in elementary school.

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:45.164
- It's pink, it's cute, it's flat.

00:01:45.164 --> 00:01:47.939
- Okay, this one is pretty,
it looks more elegant.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.936
- And it is much slimmer
than the other ones.

00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:51.039
- Oh, look, the--

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.337
(cell phone music)

00:01:53.337 --> 00:01:54.661
- Tetris.

00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:56.576
- Looks like we got sent
a Greek text on this.

00:01:56.576 --> 00:01:58.260
- I'm sending a text to myself.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.815
- So you've got to press
the numbers multiple times

00:02:00.815 --> 00:02:02.985
to get to the letter that you want.

00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:04.076
- Where's your space bar?

00:02:04.076 --> 00:02:05.656
- Oh, no space bar.

00:02:05.656 --> 00:02:08.557
- Oh, I figured it out,
the space is the hashtag.

00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:09.753
- Hi one. It's one.

00:02:09.753 --> 00:02:11.482
- So I wanted to write, hey, how are you,

00:02:11.482 --> 00:02:14.780
but it turns out hem-mm how are you.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.881
- So it definitely takes a lot
longer to text on this thing.

00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:20.376
- Oh, it has phone camera, that's cute.

00:02:20.376 --> 00:02:21.653
- Selfie skills.

00:02:21.653 --> 00:02:22.523
(camera clicking)

00:02:22.523 --> 00:02:23.336
- I don't know if I took the picture.

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:25.798
(camera clicking)

00:02:25.798 --> 00:02:27.597
- This phone was built for selfies.

00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:30.221
- This is not a picture I
would post on Instagram though.

00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:34.620
(techno music)

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.478
- What is this?

00:02:36.478 --> 00:02:38.057
- Oh, my god, this is ugly.

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:40.054
- Oh, shoot, I remember these.

00:02:40.054 --> 00:02:42.573
- You'd see them all the
time in, like, Gossip Girl.

00:02:42.573 --> 00:02:45.185
- No, yeah, I don't know
what this is, this is huge.

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:47.971
- [voiceover] What?

00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:50.805
- This is hip, this is what
was cool with the kids.

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:53.011
- Does this thing not just fall right off?

00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:54.472
- Hold up, boom.

00:02:54.472 --> 00:02:56.725
- [voiceover] Okay, now it's powered on.

00:02:56.725 --> 00:02:58.177
It's got a nice jingle.

00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:00.193
- I like how the old
phones have nice jingles.

00:03:00.193 --> 00:03:03.478
- Instant messaging and
then text messaging.

00:03:03.478 --> 00:03:05.812
I guess back in the
day that was different?

00:03:05.812 --> 00:03:08.656
- I feel like it's easier to
cheat your way through class.

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:11.147
- Yeah, I'd probably use
this, like, during school.

00:03:11.147 --> 00:03:11.822
It's pretty straightforward.

00:03:11.822 --> 00:03:13.066
You just have it under the table

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:14.957
and then you can just do whatever with it.

00:03:14.957 --> 00:03:17.000
- This is the coolest.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.508
(techno music)

00:03:19.508 --> 00:03:20.541
- They were pretty cool.

00:03:20.541 --> 00:03:23.118
- That texting, it took forever.

00:03:23.118 --> 00:03:26.405
- The Razr is what began
the selfie revolution.

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:29.399
- I low-key kind of got excited
when I saw the Sidekick.

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:30.804
I guess that's like the silver lining

00:03:30.804 --> 00:03:33.544
in the bronze age of cell phones.

00:03:33.544 --> 00:03:36.620
- I think I'm going to
stick to my smartphone.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.478
- I'm going to keep my iPhone.

00:03:38.478 --> 00:03:41.357
I need my iPhone, I love my iPhone.

00:03:41.357 --> 00:03:43.098
- The best part about flip phones

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:45.200
is that when you're
hanging up on somebody,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.200
you can just be like,
click, bye, you're gone.
