00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.950
Hi, I'm Ken with hitchsource.com.
Today we're talking about the Aventa LX

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.390
Tow Bar from Blue Ox.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.920
There are really a couple of features that
sets this tow bar apart from the rest.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.520
One is its 10,000-pound capacity so it
will tow anything from the smallest

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.910
vehicle all the way up to your
Hummer H2's and Suburban's.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.460
And really the other feature that sets it
apart is it's unique head design - it's 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.410
a ball-and-socket head design, it's got
a built-in spring tensioner

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.710
and the way it works is as it wears over
time the spring tensioner

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.720
automatically compensates for that wear
and it really reduces the amount of time

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.550
you have to spend going through and
replacing bushings and that sort of thing.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.080
Some of the other features - 
it's got a built-in latch mechanism.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.800
This latch mechanism allows you to put
the tow bar up and out of the way when

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.160
you're not towing a vehicle
behind your motor home.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.030
And then another nice feature of it is
this auto-locking telescoping arm.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.380
And the way this works - you can 
disengage it and it makes it really easy

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.910
to connect up your vehicle.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.500
You can move it around, 
pack it wherever your vehicle's parked, 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.250
and then when you're ready to go you 
just simply drive away.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.020
As you can see it just locks into place
so it's really simple to use and really convenient.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.810
Another great feature of this tow bar is that
it comes with 10,000 pound safety cables.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.570
Usually with most tow bars in the industry
you get to buy them separately

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.940
 so you need to figure that in 
when you're looking at the price.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.530
And then finally it comes with a full
installation and maintenance manual that

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.670
takes you through all the details
on how to take care of it.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.010
So again, this is our favorite 
Blue Ox Tow Bar as a whole 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.720
and if you have any questions
about the right tow bar for your vehicle 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.950

Tow Bar from Blue Ox.

Thank you.
