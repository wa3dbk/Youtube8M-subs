00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:04.671
THIS HELICOPTER IS CARRYING
SOME PRECIOUS CARGO.

00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:07.441
THESE PRONGHORN ANTELOPE ARE
ABOUT TO TRAVEL

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:09.406
FROM THE PANHANDLE TO
THEIR NEW HOME

00:00:09.448 --> 00:00:12.008
IN FAR WEST TEXAS.
[pronghorn brays]

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:16.850
We have growing populations of
pronghorn in the Panhandle

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.048
and with that growing population
we get more and more

00:00:20.093 --> 00:00:24.056
farmer-pronghorn conflicts and crop
depredation issues.

00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:26.306
At the same time, in the
Marfa plateau

00:00:26.346 --> 00:00:28.955
the last few years
we've had huge declines

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:31.970
in the population around
the Marfa area.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.001
MILLIONS OF PRONGHORN
ONCE ROAMED TEXAS.

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:37.003
ONLY POCKETS REMAIN TODAY.

00:00:37.043 --> 00:00:39.038
BUT WHILE SOME HERDS
ARE THRIVING,

00:00:39.078 --> 00:00:40.673
OTHERS ARE IN TROUBLE.

00:00:40.713 --> 00:00:43.176
You used to be able to drive
from Valentine to Marfa

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:46.881
and maybe see 2-300 of them
just from the highway.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.748
And now you're lucky if
you see one.

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:52.046
TO BOOST THE DWINDLING HERDS,
TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE

00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:54.586
IS TRANSPORTING ABOUT
200 PRONGHORN

00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:56.823
FROM THE NORTHWEST CORNER
OF THE PANHANDLE

00:00:56.863 --> 00:00:59.425
TO GRASSLANDS AROUND MARFA.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.963
We recently did a genetic study
on the pronghorn in Texas

00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:05.731
and they're all pretty much
the same animal.

00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:08.201
We have some excellent habitat
we're putting them into around Marfa

00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:09.101
and they should do well.

00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:12.111
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH 
NORTH AMERICA'S FASTEST LAND MAMMAL,

00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:14.173
YOU GOTTA MOVE QUICK.

00:01:14.213 --> 00:01:16.943
We've got a contract helicopter crew
that is capturing those animals

00:01:16.983 --> 00:01:19.780
with a net gun. They then
sling the animals off the wheat fields

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.148
back to our processing facility here.

00:01:22.188 --> 00:01:23.865
We take samples on them.

00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:26.551
Pronghorn are notoriously 
high-strung. They're somewhat

00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:29.621
prone to being stressed out
during capture

00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:31.991
so we go ahead and give them a
sedative, kind of calm them down

00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:33.926
during transport.

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.795
IT'S A 9 HOUR DRIVE
ACROSS THE STATE

00:01:37.836 --> 00:01:39.831
WITH NO STOPS FOR SNACKS.

00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:41.968
We've got some pretty 
precious cargo with us

00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:43.436
so we try to be as careful
as we can.

00:01:43.476 --> 00:01:46.060
IT'S DARK BY THE TIME THEY ARRIVE.

00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:50.710
THE PRONGHORN TAKE THEIR FIRST
TENTATIVE STEPS INTO THEIR NEW HOME.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.145
Your heart's racing right up until
the last one gets out.

00:01:53.185 --> 00:01:56.348
TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE WILL
MONITOR THE RELOCATED PRONGHORN

00:01:56.388 --> 00:01:58.785
AND SURVEY THE FAWNS 
BORN IN THE SPRING.

00:01:58.825 --> 00:02:00.920
Look at it! Isn't that amazing?

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.185
The best feeling's going to be
when they start making babies

00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:05.858
and these populations come back
to what they used to be.

00:02:05.898 --> 00:02:09.128
FOR TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE,
THIS IS LYDIA SALDANA.

00:02:09.168 --> 00:02:11.296
It really is moving!
