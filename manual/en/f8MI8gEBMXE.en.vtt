00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.710
It's the new Samsung everybody!

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.750
It's the SL30 Digital 
Camera, and hey, listen.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.480
Everyone's on a budget 
these days including me,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.120
and this right here, is a 
budget friendly camera.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.360
It's got all the goods, 
it's got movie mode,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.600
it's got beauty mode, it's 
got, how many different?

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.940
11 other scenes! OK?
It's really got technology in here

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.840
that is very nice, useful, easy to 
use and it's a great digital camera.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.510
Makes for a great gift, point 
and shoot, very simply to use.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.550
And not too many complicated 
buttons, which is nice for

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.280
grandma, mom; if you have someone in your 
family who is not very technologically savvy,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.020
it's a great digital camera.
OK! So, let's get right to it.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.790
First of all, this is a 10 
megapixel digital camera.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.090
You have a 2.5 inch LCD screen. 
I'm going to show you right here.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.870
Now, you also have a 3x optical zoom,
nothing to right home about,

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.080
but you know what, it does the trick. It 
does the trick for you beginners out there.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.850
You also have image stabilization, so if 
you have someone with a shaky hand,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.220
the camera will compensate for that.  
And you'll definitely get brighter

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.720
more natural looking images.
You have face detection on here.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.980
You have movie mode. And the coolest thing 
about movie mode, on this camera, is

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.040
that you can pause while filming. You 
don't see that on all digital cameras.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.470
Producer Dan doesn't think that's 
the greatest feature in the world

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.180
but I do! And I look at these 
digital cameras all day long.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.380
Now, this camera only has 
11 MB of internal storage,

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.650
so you gotta get one of 
those SD, SDHC cards.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.810
Also takes MMC and 
MMC Plus cards as well.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.690
So in addition to Beauty Mode, you also have 
red-eye reduction, and you have ISO 1600.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.920
So if you're shooting in low light, 
the camera will compensate for that.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.900
And this camera takes two AA batteries.
No rechargeable batteries here.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.040
And I'll turn it over.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.000
Open up the battery 
door, and you'll see...

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.640
There you go... I don't
want to break it.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.330
There you go. You got your two 
AAs and your SD card in here.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.360
Alright, lets close her up.
Turn her over.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.380
Now this thing isn't... This camera 
is not the slimmest camera I've seen,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.870
but it feels very durable, very well made. 
I think it can take a drop or two.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.210
And still survive.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.010
Let's power this Samsung on.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.750
Here you have your power button. 
Your shutter release.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.360
You have your 3x optical zoom and your 
built in flash also, in the front right here.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.060
Turning over to the back of the camera,
again, you see your 2.5 inch LCD screen.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.600
You have your wide and your tight.
Right here, this button right here,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.370
is your menu button to set all the 
cool little features on this Samsung.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.180
And then you have some dedicated 
buttons around your wheel.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.840
You have your display right here.  So you 
can only show the basic information

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.720
or show all of the information. 
All your settings.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.920
You have your timer, your 
macro mode, and your flash.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.190
You have your playback 
button right down here.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.300
And you have your function/your 
trash button right down here.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.970
Now, the camera's really, 
really, really easy to use.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.370
Let me see what mode we're in.
We're in Program mode right now.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.510
But if you want to get out of Program 
mode you just hit the menu button.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.080
And you can see all your 
different modes here.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.950
You have Auto mode, Program mode, DIS, 
which stands for, Digital Image Stabilization

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.120
Again, for you people out there with shaky 
hands, this will definitely come in handy.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.770
Photo help guide.  Definitely 
for you beginners out there.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.370
You have Scene mode and 
you also have Movie mode.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.480
So let's go back into...
OK everyone knows what Auto mode does.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.440
In Auto mode the camera sets 
all the settings for you.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.770
But let's get out of Auto mode, let's be 
adventurous.  Let's go into Program mode.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.310
So we're going to go into Program mode. 
And I'm going to show you how easy it is

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.350
to really set all the 
features on this camera.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.090
You just hit the button right here, your
 function button, and it pops open a menu.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.300
So now you can set your exposure.  Moving 
down you can set your white balance.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.800
We'll go across and you can see that 
you can change the appearance

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.640
by setting these different 
light features.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.040
OK, we're going to stick to 
auto white balance.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.410
Moving down, ISO. You have ISO 1600, 
that's the highest it goes on this camera.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.320
Face detection, which is awesome, makes 
sure that all the people in the picture

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.530
come out clear and not 
blurry, and look their best.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.320
You're friends will appreciate that.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.480
OK, keep on going down.
Here you have your shutter types.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.410
You can do continuous 
mode, which is really cool.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.810
As long as you hold the 
shutter release button down,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.710
the camera will continue 
taking pictures.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.180
And you have a couple of 
different capture modes as well.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.450
If you keep on scrolling 
down, you'll see them.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.150
Motion capture, which is great 
if you're at a sporting event.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.760
Right here, photo style selector.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.590
Here you can add some really 
cool effects, some color effects.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.630
Like, Sepia, we'll go through a 
couple of them.  Calm. Classic.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.540
You can see... 
Look at Negative!

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.770
Look, you can set this effect 
right on your camera.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:55.120
You don't have to hook up to a PC, get into 
some expensive photo editing software.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.150
None of that needed 
here on this Samsung.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.450
Oh! There I am! 
Back to normal.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.650
I like myself not looking 
all funky like that.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.360
So that is Program mode. And that 
is why this Samsung totally rocks!

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.050
And best of all, it's
budget friendly.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.740
So again, this is the new 
Samsung, this is the SL30.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.040
If you're looking for something that is 
going to not empty your wallet,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.140
check this digital camera out.
