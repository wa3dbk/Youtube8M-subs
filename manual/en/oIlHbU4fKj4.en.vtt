Margaret, I need to see your layout.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.020
1... 2... 3... 4... What is it?! Oh, of course, coach!

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.520
Alright then, let's see it. Olivia, Margaret's about to do her routine! Watch!

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.270
Oh yeah! That sounds totally awesome! Here I go coach!

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.989
Routine time! Move it, you!

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.070
I'm sorry, don't pinch me again, please! And a-one....

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.250
And a-two... and a-

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.189
Wow, Margaret! That layout is coming out very well!

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.859
Just remember to stick your landing. Overall, that was quite impressive!

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:28.900
I know. I am the best gymnast on the
team

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.070
Is that the time? Girls, time to head home!

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.950
I'll see you all tomorrow!

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.580
Wow, Margaret! You did amazing today!

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.300
I loved that backflip!

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.580
It was pretty amazing, wasn't it.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.780
Toats! Anyway, how do you think I did today?

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.780
Oh... Charlie.... you were okay I guess

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.420
Really? Thanks! Well I'm going to go talk to Jordyn now. Hey bestie! What's up?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.799
I cannot wait for the sleepover! I know, I totally picked out the right movie!

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.479
And I got the popcorn! Oh my gosh!

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.159
Yess! Let's go.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.800
Oh my gosh, I love your shirt!

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.780
Thanks! I got it at Abercrombie! No way! Hey Margaret, where did you get your outfit?

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.930
I got it at a second-hand store. But I colored on it!

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.200
So it's really cool, right? Yeah! Of course!

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.079
It's awesome! Ugh, it's a designer handbag. Like I haven't seen enough of those.

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.680
Down you go. Oh hey,  there's my backpack.  She's
gone.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.200
Finally. Hey, you want to go to the AG store?

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.250
Yeah, I have like, a thousand dollars saved up! Me too! Let's get some new dolls!

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.370
Ya! And outfits. I finally got out of there, away from those snobs.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.579
 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.750
Oh hey, there's my bus pass. I really wish my Mom could afford a car.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.840
Those team girls are so annoying.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.540
But one day, I'm going to beat them all. I'm going to show them

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.530
that messing with me is a bad idea
