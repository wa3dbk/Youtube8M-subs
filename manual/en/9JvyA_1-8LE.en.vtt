00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.390
An important calculation to know when you
are designing a weight loss or weight gaining

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.580
program is how many calories per day you need.
This is Alice Monsaert and I'm going to give

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.699
you an easy way to calculate just how many
calories you should be ingesting during the

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:18.610
day. We are going to take the weight so your
current weight right now. We are going to

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:26.180
work for simplicity with a person who is 150
pounds so 150 pounds and we are going to multiply

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.540
by their activity that they do during the
day so I would multiply by 10 if I did moderate

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.300
activity which is going to be walking and
some lightweight training. Multiple by 12

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.380
if I do hard activity if you know I'm an endurance
runner or a cyclist and I maybe teach several

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.579
classes a day as a fitness instructor. Vigorous
activity is definitely a marathon runner.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.680
Repetitive activity would be someone who lays
brick all day long or delivers UPS boxes so

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.010
that is their activity level and we're going
to multiply that again by the weight to get

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.409
our basic calories per day. So let's do someone
who has moderate activity and we are going

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.490
to notice that they need 1,500 calories per
day and most people say wow that seems like

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.979
a lot. If you eat the right kind of food it
can be a lot of food if you eat the wrong

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.560
foods then you are just eating a little bit
of food. So 1,500 calories a day for a person

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.979
that is 150 pounds times their activity level.
Now if they're on a weight loss program we

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.380
want to subtract 200 to 500 calories per day
so they either need to exercise more or ingest

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.859
less. So this person would go down to about
1,200 calories per day. Never lower than 1,000

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:48.829
and really most people need about 1,500 calories
a day so again a simple calculation so if

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.119
this person needs 1,500 calories they would
really need to up their activity level in

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.289
order to stay in the 1,500 calories. So this
is Alice Monsaert and I hope that you have

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.599
great nutrition in your weight loss program.
