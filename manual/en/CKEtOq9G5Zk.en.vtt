00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.200
The 2008 Academy Award winner for best documentary
feature, this British film directed by James

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.740
Marsh is the amazing real-life story of Philippe
Petit: a charming French high-wire artist

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.700
who dared to the impossible: walk between
the Twin Towers in lower Manhattan.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.030
Retold through first-hand narration over original
film footage and convincing dramatizations,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.969
the story of how this amazing event unfolded
is a remarkably fascinating one: in 1974,

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:31.600
shortly after the World Trade Center towers
were complete, Petit and his team of foolhardy

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.770
companions traveled to America, snuck into
the building using falsified documents, hauled

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.039
thousands of pounds of wire and equipment
to the roof of both 110-story buildings, rigged

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.109
a wire and it's guy-lines in the middle of
a cold morning... before Petit danced above

00:00:44.109 --> 00:01:14.649
the streets of New York, over thirteen hundred
feet 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.229
in the air.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.009
His stunt caused quite a commotion obviously,
and although he was prompted arrested: it's

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.740
this timeless act that actually helped the
public fall in love with the new skyline,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.530
which until that point had been described
as "ugly and utilitarian".

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.049
No mention is made of the towers' eventual
fate on 9/11, but perhaps its for the best:

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.020
this is story about brazen determination and
hope -- and one man's ridiculous dream to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.229
walk between the world's two tallest buildings.

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.390
The execution of this stunt, and especially
the way its told here, play out like an expert

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.600
heist picture: rarely is documentary described
as "tense" and "thrilling", but the interviews,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.830
photos, and reenactments are really just that.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.719
Well paced, with some catchy music, and brisk
editing, I find it difficult to believe anyone

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:57.439
would be bored here, but inherently, documentaries
sometimes carry that stigma.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.950
The participants, all speaking in various
degrees of English are brutally honest as

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.020
they recount the defining moment of Petit's
life: none of them afraid to insult one another,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.300
or share their pessimism of what they were
attempting.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.230
Ultimately though: this is a fascinating and
extremely interesting 90-minute story focused

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.500
around a single, 38-year-old event... nothing
more, nothing less.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.680
A fun adventure that takes us deep into the
mind of a daring dreamer and performer, "Man

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.840
On Wire" is an "Exhilarating account of incredible
events".

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:37.680
Let's read your short reviews from the YouTube
comments.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.190
And now, our scores for "Man On Wire"... a
NINE and an EIGHT.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.010
You applauded the thrilling events, and cinematography,
you thought it was AWESOME.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.180
A beautifully made film with some unbelievable
imagery, it's a story worth experiencing from

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.040
the people who made it possible, I thought
this was a GREAT movie.
