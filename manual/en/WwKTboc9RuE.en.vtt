00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
In 1980, Fred Carl had a wild notion:

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.900
"What about a commercial-style range for the home?"

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.730
He knew from designing and building houses
in Greenwood, Mississippi that

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.219
he and his wife weren't the only ones
looking for more powerful options in the kitchen.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.018
So, he searched and he sketched.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.057
He called commercial range manufacturers.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.700
He met the manufacturers and came to the
unbelievable conclusion that no one

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.500
made such a range or even wanted to.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.140
They were horrified at the idea of their products
even going to the home on any basis.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.550
So he decided, he'd just have to build it himself

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.400
in Greenwood.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.269
Okay, well, here's a range. Now, what do we do?

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.300
His hometown stood behind him

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.551
and at the front of the production line.

00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:55.280
Together, they got to work on the world's first
professional range for the home.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.070
Well, I just prayed. I absolutely prayed over that stove.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.600
I said "Lord, forgive me for praying for a stove."

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.090
I said, "If that boy doesn't make it on this thing,
he's going to have to leave the country

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.190
move to Australia or way, way somewhere."

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.660
By 1987, they shipped the first Viking Range

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.830
and culinary revolution was born.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.520
Cooks around the world embrace the Viking Kitchen.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.200
Finally, they have the equipment to cook like their favorite chefs

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.200
and the Viking Kitchen quickly grew to include
cooktops, ovens, refrigerators,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.160
dishwashers, outdoor cooking, small appliances, and more.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.330
Instead of relocating for cheaper production,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.450
Fred refused to cut corners and proudly kept major appliance operations

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.460
in Greenwood, restoring most of the historic downtown in the process.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.400
Viking Range is more than a company. It's a shared passion

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.050
in Greenwood and kitchens around the world.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.500
A passion for quality, or hospitality,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.739
and authenticity.

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:09.100
He was the most persistent young man I ever saw in my life.
