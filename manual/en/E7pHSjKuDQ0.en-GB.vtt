00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.619
Hi I'm Kelsea Kelsea Brennan-Wessels and you
are watching Earth from Space

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.700
on the European Space Agency Web TV.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.000
This radar image is one of the first from
the Sentinel-1A satellite,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.530
acquired on 20 April

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.250
-- less than three weeks after its launch
on 3 April.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.250
The image shows the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia,
which is the largest salt flat in the world.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.660
Occupying over 10 000 sq km, the vast Salar
de Uyuni lies at the southern end of the Altiplano,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.890
a high plain of inland drainage in the central
Andes.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.270
Some 40 000 years ago, this area was part
of a giant prehistoric lake that dried out,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.760
leaving behind the salt flat.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.310
While the salt flat appears an almost homogenous
white in optical satellite imagery,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.270
here we see it in shades of grey, and it looks
almost like a lake.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.080
This has to do with how the radar signal reacts
to different surfaces:

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.810
areas where the radar signal is absorbed appear
darker,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.020
while areas where the signal is reflected
back to the satellite appear lighter.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.210
This gives Earth observation experts an indication
of how rough or smooth the surfaces are,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.200
differences in salt density or even the presence
of water.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
On the whole, the Salar de Uyuni is very flat,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.450
with a surface elevation variation of less than 1 m.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.740
This makes the area ideal for calibrating
satellite radar altimeters

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.659
-- a different kind of radar instrument that
measures surface topography.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.190
The future Sentinel-3 mission will carry such
a radar.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.080
The surrounding terrain is rough in comparison
to the vast salt flat

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.000
and is dominated by the volcanoes of the 
Andes mountains

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.040
forming part of the Pacific Ring of Fire.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.400
Sentinel-1A is the first in the two-satellite
Sentinel-1 mission

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.400
for Europe's Copernicus programme.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.990
Its radar data will be used for a variety
of applications,

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.590
including the surveillance of the marine environment,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.319
monitoring land-surface for motion risks,

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.870
mapping for forest, water and soil management,

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.870
and mapping to support humanitarian aid and
crisis situations.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.700
Well that wraps up this edition of Earth from
Space

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.300
Remember that we broadcasting online every
Friday at ten o'clock Central European Summer Time

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.010
Watch us on our website or through the ESA
App on your mobile device

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.230
