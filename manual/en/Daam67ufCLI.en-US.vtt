The iPhone 6S A9 processor and performance

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.500
Hello boys and girls how are you? Welcome to a new video technology news

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.190
where I speak of the latest rumors iPhone 6S

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.340
and above all

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.820
his new A9 processor
the processor also A9X

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.500
I could mount the next iPad

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.680
rumors that this processor is A9 would have the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.710
architecture SiP (System in package)

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.759
An architecture that was already used in Apple Watch

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.970
where in a pill is
integrated processor, GPU graphics

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.079
RAM

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.020
some extra sensors and circuitry

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.890
it seems that this same technology
A9 processor will use Apple

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.130
integrating in a single pill
processor, modem and also the

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.350
power control circuitry

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.540
This way you guys says
the processor will have 15% more

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.260
little

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.150
why in the iphone 6 in the A8

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.930
and this data gives us two pretty
the first we have more important

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.620
space because several

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.280
motherboard components
They are to be integrated into this

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.030
plus pill will be smaller and, therefore, the motherboard itself also

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.350
It will be smaller

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.060
perhaps leaving more room for more
battery but I tell them girls

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.210
why

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.950
It lacks much does the iPhone battery

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.850
on the other hand also to be a
the tiniest pill

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.600
components are smaller and
then the flow of electrons

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.640
really it is going to go the distance more
This makes short go faster

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.240
of course that the team
can be processed faster by

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.780
other side

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.329
but above all will make the
Energy consumption is much better

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.189
they spend less battery that is not
so hot this event will steal

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.560
something guys that this processor should at
Samsung are riding course as

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.579
usual in all
good teachers support it seems

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.439
It is not using technology
Samsung's 14 nanometer against

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.649
dente gross domestic technology
that is using the above

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.979
A8 processor perhaps harbored
empirical performance data

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.760
processor has to cost you
get in position

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.690
tel pri six with the processor
eight

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.830
He had a yield of the single core
1610 or creating intense final

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.300
I gave these points and not have to take
890 gave two thousand guys we

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.070
conques have this new processor
9 would have without the core 2000 90

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.650
in multi-core 3569

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.240
which would make it post

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.410
much more powerful than the previous
model and stick it in us x

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.670
Mr. Cole are more or less
2000 109 but as we had multi-core

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.669
five thousand percent one

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.389
guys points makes clear what needs to
end your evolution on your side no

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:38.349
having a processor

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.719
more powerful than we already knew
also 64 bit course but

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.409
especially I want to emphasize efficiency
Energy

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.870
more space for battery hairs
many guys do not know what to think

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.580
you

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.920
and especially since the end if this
processor will respect more in

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.260
energy as somehow also
consume less energy and if we put

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.229
more battery

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:01.340
I think to be in line with this
location so that we

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.849
Finally, a battery and some people
so far it does not have

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.390
plus prosthesis goes great battery
but since I have not touched iphone 4

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.980
over and also the font where bayamón
obregón matter before when it was

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.709
super happy Battery

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.519
ideally so far earthquakes iphone
because it has more battery because it is

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.180
larger

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.640
It has not been seen since and no equivalence
I hope this time with them nine

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.650
consume less and especially with all
This processor is smaller with

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.059
remove battery and more particularly with
more energy control

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:33.999
Well somehow the
valerian

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:38.199
back in the iphone 6 s forecasts
I do not know what to grant two I think

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:41.509
no need to leave me comments
we put our opinion

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:44.539
Vargas gave the base information
Today I hope that tasted of

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.140
how are you support me like you know

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.820
