Hello there unboxer! This is Sakis Karpas, your usual host, in another episode of Unboxholics.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:51.000
Today we will take a look at the PlayStation 4, Sony's new entertainment system which kicks off the eighth generation of video games.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.000
Let's cut to the chase.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:07.150
PlayStation 4 comes in a white and blue box that opens up like a suitcase.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.100
First up, we found some manuals inside but no one cares for that right now, so let's move on.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.500
Package contents: 1. HDMI Cable

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.600
Fortunately, Sony's new console comes with an HDMI cable this time around.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.650
2. A Micro USB cable

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.500
3. An AC power cord

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.300
4. A mono headset

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:48.700
Next up is the DualShock 4 which promises a lot of improvements over its predecessor but we will determine that in our upcoming PS4 review episode.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.800
It's time for our guest star of this episode. PS4 does not look like a behemoth next-gen console but it sure does look modern and pretty in terms of design.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.500
PS4 has a very compact design and it weighs only 2.8 kilos which makes it a quite lightweight console that will fit into any living room.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.000
The console is split into four panels: one made of glossy, fingerprint-prone, black plastic on top with the remaining three made with textured black matte plastic.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:23.400
The PlayStation 4's front is bisected by a LED light, which pulses blue when the console is starting up and white when it's on.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:33.400
The disc tray slot along with two USB ports and the power/eject buttons are located on the front side.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:46.900
Along the back top edge you find an AC power port, an optical port, an HDMI out port, a LAN port and an AUX port which is needed for the proper use of the PlayStation Camera.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Enough talking! Enjoy the PS4 in its full glory!

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.400
PS4 will be released in European stores on 29th of November for â‚¬399.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.000
PS4 will be available in Greece on the 13th of December. US gamers are already enjoying their PS4s since it has already been released there.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.150
Stay tuned to Unboxholics since we've got more PS4 videos coming up!
