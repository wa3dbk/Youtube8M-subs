00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.919
Hi this is Alex from MyPhotoCentral.com and today we are shooting with the

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:04.690
Sony's new

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.540
a7 Mark II full-frame digital camera

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.250
the new version of the camera is a little bit heavier

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.330
and its a little bit bulkier

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.449
they've also improved the grip, I can
actually hold it much better now

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.000
it actually feels sturdy in my hand

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.969
And its really easy to press the shutter button so it actually feels like a real

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.320
camera

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.280
the shutter noise

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.460
has been lowered a bit

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.460
lets see... lets try and see if you can hear this

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.719
its burst mode is also boosted up to 5 frames per second now

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.000
let me get it to burst for you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.580
This is JPEG and RAW

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.450
just keeps on going on

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.890
Sony has also implemented an additional
custom button 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.180
we now have total of four custom buttons but

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.760
you can also customize the other

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.870
buttons on the 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.500
on the interface as well

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.390
this camera can
now record in XAVC  S full

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.340
HD format but there is still no

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.040
4k no internal 4k 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.980
there's also
an option for the S-Log 2

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.020
video profile that gives you that

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.740
flat look that you can edit in
post-processing later on

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.770
one of the things that's missing from
the camera is actually the touch screen

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.540
I'm not sure how hard it is to implement

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.670
 but it seems like all the cameras have it
now and Sony was

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.269
in the front, leading the pack with touchscreens

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.739
and this camera for some reason doesn't have it
but it still has the

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.880
the same tilt as the previous

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.160
mark one has

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.450
so you can still shoot from below

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.980
or shoot

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.200
from up high

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.740
it seems that a lot of people are now jumping

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.810
from DSLRs to mirrorless camera and it looks
like Sony is now targeting those people

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.850
specifically this camera has

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.920
weather sealed body fully aluminium

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.900
it's a little bulkier, a little heavier

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.760
it shoots 5 frames per second

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.100
there is no lag when you press the shutter 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.100
and overall its a really nice travel camera

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.160
I personally wouldn't switch just yet
because I still like

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.200
the optical viewfinder

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.260
just a fraction better but it's getting
there

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.860
It's really really close

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.500
the quality is excellent

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.840
the speed is decent

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.760
auto-focus is pretty good and overall it's
a really good camera

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.740
it's auto-focus is noticeably faster now
and it does start

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.860
that tiny fraction faster than mark 1

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.270
the stabilization is clearly
noticeable in this camera

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.450
here you can see some shots taken with 1/10 of a
second

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.370
with and without stabilization on   

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.930
the best thing about this camera and
mark 1 one as well

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.850
is that you can use a range of other lenses

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.020
like your Leica, your Nikon, your Canon, with an
adapter

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.340
to shoot with this full frame sensor

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.670
on this tiny little body and this is

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.660
perfect for travel

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.860
you can use it in studio obviously

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.540
but for me personally this is a light body

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.310
can be used for travel and overall daily

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.820
small daily photo shoots where you dont want to carry around

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.260
large D SLR bodies

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.060
the panorama feature 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.330
can be pretty handy as well, especially for
travel

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.550
it's pretty chilly today so I have to wear these gloves

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.729
but the grip is good enough that I can
use the gloves without any problems

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.569
I have access to all the buttons 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.720
I can
scroll without any problems as well

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.340
so whenever

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.300
I have to get the settings just right

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.980
even using gloves this camera is just fine

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.100
this was a very cold and windy day

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.860
and its battery died

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.320
within a little over forty minutes

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.920
and since we didn't have a charger

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.590
because mark II still doesn't come
with a separate charger

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.040
you have to charge the body through a USB cable

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.169
we had to stop this shoot

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.060
so make sure you buy additional
batteries if you wanna extensively use

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.729
this camera

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.529
or buy a separate charger for the battery

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.599
and here's some of the images taken with
a this camera these are straight out of the

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:24.099
camera

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.119
unedited shots

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.440
I dont have so use Sony lenses if I dont want to

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.200
I can use my full Canon lineup

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.840
using the Metabones adapter

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.620
so all I have to do is

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.800
attach this Metabone adapter, its Mark IV

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.599
which has slightly improved interior

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.419
so just attached the adaptert and then
you could

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.740
put any of your EF or EF-S lenses

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.409
there are also adapters for Nikon lenses, your Leica lenses

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.480
basically any vintage or current lenses

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.320
you might have in you bag 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.980
there you go, I can now shoot with my canon L lens

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.500
Without any hitch

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.340
Although the focus is much, much slower

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:47.229
but you can always shift to manual focus

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:48.709
and just go with that

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.520
Thank you for
watching this quick video review

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.759
here are some of the most noticeable specs
for this camera

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.430
