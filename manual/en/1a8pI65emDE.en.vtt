00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.629
It's a question that has perplexed
humanity from as early as the anceint

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.569
greeks all the way to the twenty first
century, and we're still dying to know,

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.679
which came first?  The chicken, or the egg?
The question would be simple if we took

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.620
it literally.  Egg laying animals existed
far before chickens came about, so

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.730
technically the egg came before the chicken.
 But this question, better worded as the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.140
chicken or the chicken egg focuses
more on the cyclical cause and consequence.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.279
That is if a chicken is born from an
egg, where did the egg come from? Another

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.840
chicken presumably, which too must have
come from an egg, so which came first?  On

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.340
the one side we have team chicken.  Research suggests that the protein

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.700
essential for the formation of chicken
eggs, called OV-17 is only

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.289
found in chicken ovaries.  Without it the
chicken eggshell could not be formed.  

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.980
So without a chicken, you technically cannot get a chicken egg.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.350
But this all depends on the nature and
definition of a chicken egg in the

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.730
first place.  Afterall, is a chicken egg an egg laid by a chicken? Or one that

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.940
simply contains a chicken?

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.390
Obviously the OV-17 bearing
chicken had to come from somewhere.  

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.200
But if an elephant laid an egg from which a lion hatched, would it be an elephant egg or

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.620
a lion egg?  This leads to the other side
of the story, team egg.  During

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.370
reproduction two organisms pass along
their genetic information in the form of

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.970
DNA, but the replication of this
DNA is never one hundred percent

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.800
accurate and often produces minor
changes for the new organism.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.560
These small mutations in DNA over
thousands of generations create new

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.729
species. But these genetic mutations must
occur in the zygote or initial cell, so

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.630
a creature very similar to a chicken (which
we could call a proto-chicken) would have

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.380
mated with another proto-chicken and
because of a small genetic mutation

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.979
created the first chicken,

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.939
which grew in an egg.  So the egg came
first?  Well team chicken might argue

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.229
that this was simply a chicken growing
inside of a proto-chicken egg.  However no-one

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.329
mutation can ever really constitute a
new species.  Even though we humans like

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.140
classify all creatures into
different groups and names

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.310
this is based on how things currently
are, and not how they were millions of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.320
years ago.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.749
The process of evolution is so gradual
that no one proto-chick to chicken birth

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:12.000
could really be considered a new species
at the time.  Much like how dogs have

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.040
come from wolves, as humans began to
interact with and domesticate wolves

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.430
there was no one single point where a wolf gave birth to a dog.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.159
But rather as particular traits came
about from selective pressures such as,

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.779
choosing wolves who were not afraid of
humans, or ones that were less aggressive

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:31.549
over many generations we conceived big
genetic and behavioral trait differences.

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.040
So where does this leave us?  We are left
with two scenarios.  Some early egg laying

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.950
species gradually lead to the creation
of the proto-chicken which laid proto-chicken

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.849
eggs.  In one of these eggs there
was a mutation causing a slight change

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.689
and selective advantage and this was
ultimately the first chicken which then

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.340
went on to lay chicken eggs.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.909
In this case the chicken technically
came first.  Or we have a

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.150
proto-chicken which gave birth to a
chicken inside of what we would classify

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.450
as a chicken egg and as such the
egg came first.  Which brings us back to

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.310
the nomenclature and question of, what is
a chicken egg?  Which is a fairly

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.170
meaningless question, but at the end of
the day, what we can all agree on is that

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.370
regardless of whether it was a chicken
egg or a proto-chicken egg, the first true

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.409
chicken came from an egg. The egg

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.989
came first.

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.019
