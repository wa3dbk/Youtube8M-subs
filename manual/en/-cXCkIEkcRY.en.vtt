Hi. I'm Melina and I'm with Expert Village
and I'm going to show you how to make a beautiful

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.660
transfer polymer bracelet. For this next step
we're going to create the beads that go on

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.360
our transfer bracelet. We're going to take
a device to slice the log. You can use a regular

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.100
log or you can use a piece of plastic. And
you're going to cut it into 5 different pieces.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:36.710
3, 4, 5. The next step is to take your roller
and what you're going to do is you're going

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.839
to want to flatten the pieces to about a 1/4
of an inch thick. And work the pieces until

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.329
you get kind of a square shape. And don't
worry if it's not perfectly square because

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.479
after we make our shape we're going to take
our slicer and we're going to even out the

00:00:54.479 --> 00:01:05.750
edges. So you're going to take your slicing
device or anything like a ruler, anything

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.200
that you can comfortably hold and use to shape
the squares. So you're going to take them

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.740
and you're going to try to give them a more
square like shape, a more even shape. Just

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:28.189
trim off any excess that you may have. And
once you have a perfect square you can go

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:35.790
ahead and trace that square and then you can
mold all the other squares after it. I find

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:45.130
it's a lot easier to just trace one bead and
then do the rest just like it. That way they'll

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:54.881
be somewhat even. And you take your tool and
you press against the sides like this. Use

00:01:54.881 --> 00:02:09.629
your finger to push the clay. Keep the tool
on the other side.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.810
And now we have nice, even, beautiful square
beads.
