Hi, my name is Alex, In this tutorial I'm going to explain to you

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.900
how you can render out

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.430
your objects

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.150
depending on your material ID. So here I
have a simple Box

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.689
that I converted into

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.410
editable poly and assigned

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.600
different materials to the different
polygons.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.160
I set different Material IDs for each polygon.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.690
Press M on the keyboard to open up Material editor

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.690
and click on standard and 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.920
select Multisub objects

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.030
Under Diffuse click where its shown

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.409
select bitmap.

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.960
Render / Render Setup

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.549
or press F10 on keyboard.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.909
These window pops up and under Render
elements you have to Add

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.330
and select MaterialID.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.210
If you

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.610
render out now the MaterialIDs wont show.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.480
it's not enough to only select the
polygons

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.320
In Material editor

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.940
select a material

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.300
I material and here

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.000
you can see material ID channel you have
to change this numbers.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.640
Now it should work. Render out.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.269
