00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:07.990
Hi! I'm Captain Ray Varner with the Page Police
Department for expertvillage.com. What I want

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.580
to do today is the down position with a new
dog. Most people when they train the down

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.670
position do a corrective measure to make the
dog go into the down position. The dog doesn't

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.310
know the down position and you start with
a correction, then you're starting off on

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.039
the wrong foot all together. If you tell a
little kid that he's going to take an algebra

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:39.371
test and he's only 5 years old, how can you
correct him for that if he doesn't know what

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:47.120
you're teaching. So what we want to do is
we want to physically show you how to do it.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.320
With the dog's sitting here in the heel position
and we say down. He says I don't know and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.791
he's just looking around. What we want to
do is we want to take the leash and put it

00:00:55.791 --> 00:01:00.350
on the small of his back. Then we want to
say down and we want to swoop both legs so

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.850
he's like this, and then we place him in the
down position. What we want to do is have

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.180
my hand on his back and holding him here and
say, "Down, good boy, down." We emphasize

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.490
the fact that this is the down position. Then
after we get him stable then we stand up.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.830
We say good boy and then we say stay, and
now he's in the down position. As you can

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.200
see from his face, he's learning the down
position. You can see from his face, there

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.310
was no negative here; it's a conditioning
mode. We want him down there and this is where

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.009
he's supposed to be. We want him parallel
with you; you want him comfortable. Then I

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.140
come back up and I hold it; I hold the leash.
Then you can praise him. Remember anything

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.040
from the heel position is physical praise.
So I can actually come down and pet him and

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.860
praise and say, "Good boy, you did a good
job." This is the down position. You want

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.350
to swoop the leg, take it off, swoop the leg,
and then push him straight down. If you have

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.670
to you can put your forearm on his back and
bend down to help you push him down. If he

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:11.659
rolls over, then bring him back to the heel
position, praise him and start over. If he

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:16.909
comes back up here and he broke the position,
then instead of jerking him down when he doesn't

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:22.099
know what's going on, you say, "No, down."
This is the hand command and you swoop the

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.579
leg so he's like that and then put him in
the down position and then say, "Good boy,

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.850
stay." Then praise him. Good boy.
