The President:
Hi everybody.

00:00:02.277 --> 00:00:06.515
Today we pay tribute to
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

00:00:06.515 --> 00:00:08.750
We reflect on the
lessons of his life;

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.353
that extraordinary change
begins when ordinary

00:00:11.353 --> 00:00:13.288
men and women are
willing to stand up for

00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:15.690
the progress they seek.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.260
We draw strength from
his unbending commitment

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.163
to justice and his
unwavering conviction

00:00:21.163 --> 00:00:24.533
in the moral force
of nonviolence.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:28.503
And just as we celebrate the
progress he helped inspire,

00:00:28.503 --> 00:00:31.573
we recommit ourselves
to our unfinished work;

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:35.710
defending the dignity and
equality of all people.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.648
That's why today we come
together in a national day

00:00:39.648 --> 00:00:42.951
of service, because as
Dr. King once said,

00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:45.987
"Life's most persistent
and urgent question

00:00:45.987 --> 00:00:49.024
is 'what are you
doing for others?'"

00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:51.193
Today, Americans across our
country are answering that

00:00:51.193 --> 00:00:54.129
question through their
actions, they're cleaning

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.300
up parks, visiting hospitals,
working at food banks,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.503
and reading to children;
they're doing their part

00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:05.373
to honor Dr. King by
heeding his call to serve.

00:01:05.373 --> 00:01:08.210
To everyone out there
volunteering today,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.644
thank you.

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:13.215
And to everyone who wants to
join in, it's not to late.

00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:17.719
Just go to www.mlkday.gov

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.290
to find a project happening
right now near you.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.125
Dr. King is an
inspiration to millions

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:26.828
around the world
including me.

00:01:26.828 --> 00:01:30.198
We feel his legacy all
around us; in our schools,

00:01:30.198 --> 00:01:33.401
our communities, our
halls of government,

00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:37.105
and most importantly in our
hearts, how we treat each

00:01:37.105 --> 00:01:39.875
other, and the simple acts
of kindness and respect

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:43.211
that bind us together
as one American family.

00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:45.947
That was Dr. King's dream
that one day all Americans

00:01:45.947 --> 00:01:48.850
would treat each other as
brothers and sisters.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.419
Let's all do our part
to make that dream real.

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:53.455
Not just today,
but every day.
