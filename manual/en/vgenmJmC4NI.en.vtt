00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:14.137
In the majority of the cases,

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:18.171
all plans for the future of a person
contemplate the creation of a family.

00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:21.011
For this, a home
is required.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.700
It is well-known on the Island,
that homes are over-populated.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.588
With whom do you live?

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.012
Me? I live with my mother,
my wife, and my children.

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:33.078
I live with my mother, with my
grandmother and with my aunt.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.430
Well, I live with my father
and three brothers.

00:00:37.777 --> 00:00:42.259
The possibility that in Cuba the young
people want to live alone is difficult.

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:43.675
Why do you not
become independent?

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.759
Well, I have still not yet become
independent, aside from my age, right?

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:52.268
Also, because it can harm
your economic development,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.670
the home situation, where there may or
may not be homes, of the zone,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.863
of the abilities that one
has to develop themselves.

00:01:00.904 --> 00:01:02.380
I live here with my father.

00:01:03.097 --> 00:01:03.725
You say you do not have.

00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:04.157
I do not have.

00:01:04.243 --> 00:01:05.027
Why do you not own a home?

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:09.265
Because I have not been able to do so. I
have not had the opportunity to do so.

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:11.741
Is it difficult to have
a home here in Cuba?

00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:14.020
Yes.

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:15.276
Obtain one?
Why?

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.790
A lot of resources are needed and
many things like that,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.850
which make it difficult for one to
obtain the things in life.

00:01:26.247 --> 00:01:30.850
The current economic difficulties
are a concern that greatly

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.585
affect when the time
comes to choose to live alone.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.035
Purchasing a home is not
very simple and the State,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.730
in great measure, does not
offer that possibility.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.104
Do you know if the State
does or does not sell homes?

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.820
Well, not that I know of.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.518
I have not found out if
the State sells homes.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.847
Does the State sells or
does not sell homes?

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.497
Do you know if the State sells
or does not sell homes?

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.700
I do not know.

00:01:57.082 --> 00:02:00.785
I have no information about that.
I do not know if I am misinformed.

00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:07.003
What I am always informed
about are delicate microbial

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.540
programs and that type of rare things to resolve
the housing problems of the population.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.480
However, whether they sell homes to
the population, that I do not know.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.017
On the Island, the impossibility of
owning a home has obliged Cubans

00:02:21.022 --> 00:02:26.989
to live together with various family generations,
almost always resulting to be problematic

00:02:27.138 --> 00:02:31.880
when the time comes to raise their
descendants with the desired values.

00:02:32.015 --> 00:02:33.001
Do you own a home?

00:02:33.015 --> 00:02:33.323
No.

00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:35.047
Why do you not
own a home?

00:02:35.357 --> 00:02:37.517
Because I have no material, nor
do I have land to build on.

00:02:37.705 --> 00:02:39.192
Is it difficult to have a home in Cuba?

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:40.880
Very difficult.

00:02:40.883 --> 00:02:41.590
Why?

00:02:42.368 --> 00:02:46.601
Because sometimes they do not have
the materials, there are none.

00:02:47.103 --> 00:02:50.982
One wants to go to the mountains
and buy boards, there are none.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.332
They have even gotten to where they
have no paper and due to many things.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.054
Is it difficult to have
a home here in Cuba?

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:03.000
Look, in parts, in parts.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.365
Because the work that I am doing...

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.944
I do not live here, I live over there.

00:03:07.878 --> 00:03:10.195
And the work that I am doing,
I have to pay for the land.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.127
I have a daughter
who is sick.

00:03:11.243 --> 00:03:15.129
So, I have to be here, because I have no
one over there. Do you understand me?

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.066
And I have the certificate of my
daughter that my daughter is sick

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.769
and they do not want to put in the electricity
until I pay for that land from over there.
