00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.750
Hey guys welcome to a quick video on how we
can give ourselves a mini tricks and gain

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.740
10% in damage in the opener for all specs.
Now it doesn't require anything special of

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.060
you, a simple macro will do the job and you
can gain 10% damage in your opener.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.160
What we need is to farm or get out our old
T14 set, the 4P bonus gives us 10% damage

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.210
if we use Dark Soul, where as it used to give
you a reduction to the Dark Soul cool down.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.120
Now because Blizzard choose to change this
set bonus into a damage modifier as a buff,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.380
we can now abuse it.
The trick is that because we can make gear

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.820
swap macros, we simply just start before a
fight with the old 4P on us and right before

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.600
the pull we use a macro to use dark soul potion
and swap gear. Now because we pop Dark Soul

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.710
before we swap gear, we gain a 20 seconds
buff with 10% damage, that snapshots onto

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.140
our dots or simply just increases our damage
from spells.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.800
It's rather huge if you can imagine getting
this modifier on top of a tricks of the trade

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.324
for Affliction as well. On protectors and
Dark Shamans you can cheese the shit out of

00:01:06.324 --> 00:01:11.240
the encounter by adding on this trick because
the 10% damage will last for 1Â½ minute.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.160
But even for the general opener it's rather
insane, since we don't use the last seconds

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.209
of Dark Soul as Affliction anyway. Demonology
and Destruction can get big use out of it

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:22.259
too, so you can use it for all 3 specs without
a problem.

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.920
The macro you can make look like this
/cast Dark Soul

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.859
/use Potion of the Jade Serpent
/equipset 4SETPOSTPULL

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:34.090
The 4 pieces you want to get is head, shoulder,
chest and legs. If you have the gloves instead,

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.270
just make sure you use them together with
the macro as switching gloves puts the engineering

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.229
on-use effect on a 30 seconds cooldown.
Meta gem is RPPM and resets on boss pulls,

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.159
but it doesn't work on trash mobs or dummies.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.460
If you deleted your set, you shouldn't worry.
You can simply go in LFR and coin with the

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.119
old coins since the drop chance is increased
and it shouldn't take you that long to get.

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.210
The helm drops from Sha of Fear, shoulders
from Lei Shi, Chest from Grand Empress Shek'zeer

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.399
and the legs from Amber-Shaper. If you are
going for the gloves, those are from Wind

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.499
Lord in Heart of Fear.

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:04.079
Now for most people, including myself this
isn't really something super interesting and

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.619
I generally hate these types of cheeses, but
for those who want to use it, now you know

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:22.660
at least.
