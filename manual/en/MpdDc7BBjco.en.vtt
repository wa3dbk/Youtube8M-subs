Every business has a story.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.290
AdWords helps you tell your story to the people
most interested in hearing it your customers.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.420
No matter who your customers are... or where
they are...

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.529
AdWords lets you create ads that bring your
customers and your business together.

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.060
Here are a few tips on how to use AdWords
to connect with your audience.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.710
• Try Different Ad Formats
• Make it Easy For Your Customers

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.200
• Experiment!

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.040
TIP 1: TRY DIFFERENT AD FORMATS

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.180
AdWords is far more than just text ads.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.600
Want to showcase a new product?

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.909
Use image ads to grab people’s attention
on the Google Display Network.

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.640
Looking for an engaging way to reach customers?

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.190
Use video ads to connect with people on YouTube
and other popular websites.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.379
TIP 2: MAKE IT EASY FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.020
Avoid creating roadblocks for your customers.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.070
When people click your ad, they have an expectation
about what they’re going to see.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.119
Start by writing clear and descriptive ad
text that matches your landing page.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.490
So if your ad promotes men's shoes for $50
or less, make sure that your ad links to a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.610
page with just that: men's shoes priced under
$50.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.240
Better yet, make it easy to complete the purchase
from that page.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.549
And, since it’s likely that your customers
are on the go, remember to write ads that

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.299
make sense across devices.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.289
The easier you make it for your customers
to find what they’re looking for, the more

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.780
likely they are to make a purchase.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.909
TIP 3: EXPERIMENT!

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.009
You can’t tell your business’s story without
first getting people’s attention.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.960
To stand out from the crowd, experiment with
your messages, offers, and ad formats.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.920
If an ad promoting a product’s color isn’t
working for you, try one that promotes price.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.750
If people aren’t clicking your text ads,
try using image ads to encourage customers

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.749
to come to your site.

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:12.640
Let the metrics that matter to you guide you
to what works, and what doesn’t.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.769
And adjust your campaigns as often as you
want to keep up with changes in your business

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.010
and your customers.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.810
Not sure where to begin experimenting?

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.690
Start with ads for your top-selling products.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.150
Getting creative about how you tell your business’s
story is a great way to set yourself up for

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.629
success and get the most out of your AdWords
investment.

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.870
