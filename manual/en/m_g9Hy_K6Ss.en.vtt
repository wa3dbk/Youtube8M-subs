00:00:02.165 --> 00:00:06.587
The only way you car really look at this car
is when it's standing still.

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:23.080
And now we're off!

00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:42.300
You know that I'm a fan of the regular GT-R...

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.543
...It's a great car and it's very fast.

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:50.310
So fast that it gives Porsche
a run for their money on the Nuerburgring.

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:53.469
But this car is also great for tuning...

00:00:53.683 --> 00:00:57.387
...with its V6 with two turbos.
You can tweak the engine management.

00:00:57.522 --> 00:01:01.991
Or you can go much further,
that's what they've done with this car.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.629
This is a Nissan GT-R by Switzer.

00:01:04.906 --> 00:01:07.839
The official name is P840.

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:12.033
That 840 stands for
the number of horsepower.

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:29.231
I don't want to talk too much...

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:33.548
...but just show you how fast is.
It's truly bizarre.

00:01:33.717 --> 00:01:37.484
It's a bit wet and cold today,
but this car's got 4wd...

00:01:37.592 --> 00:01:39.663
...and still you get wheelspin.

00:01:39.728 --> 00:01:44.828
At 8 mph that's understandable,
but at 80? That's insane.

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:09.588
The regular GT-R has about 485 hp...

00:02:09.614 --> 00:02:15.233
...and the Japanese version has some more.
And this one's got 840 hp.

00:02:15.555 --> 00:02:19.000
The regular GT-R does 0-62
in about 3.5 seconds...

00:02:19.061 --> 00:02:21.655
...and this one does it in 2.8.

00:02:26.614 --> 00:02:30.518
We'll show you how fast it really is later on
when we film the speedo.

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:33.696
But first I'll talk about how it is to drive it.

00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:40.247
You'd think that an extremely tuned car
would be equally unpleasant to drive.

00:02:40.434 --> 00:02:43.500
But it's not so bad, the car copes very well.

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:50.000
The kit has been developed to make it
easy to drive if you drive it normally.

00:02:50.038 --> 00:02:55.387
I'm now doing about 60 mph
in 6th gear, and it's all fine.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.317
Speed bumps are no problem either.

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.151
The time has come to show you
the speedo when we floor it.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.700
You'll experience how fast this car is
with all those horses under the hood.

00:03:47.276 --> 00:03:51.372
Did you like that? Let's go again!
