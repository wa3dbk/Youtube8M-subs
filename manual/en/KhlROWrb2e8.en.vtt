"Treating Dry Eye Disease
with Diet: Just Add Water?"

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.430
Dry eye disease is one of the
most common eye disorders,

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.570
causing irritation and discomfort,
and can decrease functional vision,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.680
and sometimes cause a dramatic
deterioration in the quality of life.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.710
About five million American men
and women over age 50 suffer

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.680
from moderate-to-severe dry eyes,
and tens of millions more have mild

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.120
or episodic manifestations of the
disease at a cost of more than $50 billion.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.920
In terms of treatment there are a bunch
of drops and drugs that can help.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.120
We spend hundreds of millions of
dollars on things like artificial tears,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.640
but currently there is no therapy
available to actually fix the problem.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.989
If drugs don't work, doctors can try
plugging up the outflow tear ducts,

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.579
but that can cause complications
such as plugs migrating

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.350
and eroding into the face
requiring surgical removal.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.140
Or surgeons can just go and cauterize
or stitch up the ducts in the first place.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.890
There's got to be a better way.
What about prevention?

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.109
Well, dry eyes can be
caused by LASIK surgery,

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:16.259
affecting about 20-40%
six months after the operation.

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.159
With a million LASIK procedures
performed annually that's a lot of people,

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.369
and sometimes the long-term symptoms
can be severe and disabling.

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.950
There's a long list of drugs that can
do it: antihistamines, decongestants,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.149
nearly all the antidepressants,
anticonvulsants, antipsychotics,

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.600
anti-Parkinson's drugs, beta-blockers,
hormone replacement therapy,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.920
as well as a few herbal preparations.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.740
In the developing world, vitamin A
deficiency can start out as dry eyes,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.170
and then progress to become the leading
cause of preventable childhood blindness.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.409
Vitamin A deficiency is almost never
seen in the developed world

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.479
unless you do it intentionally.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.950
There was a report in the '60s of a guy who
deliberately ate a vitamin A deficient diet,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.139
living off of bread and lime juice for
five years and his eye turned into this.

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:11.000
But better than this poor woman,
the member of some cult

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.950
that tried to live off of just
brown rice and herbal tea,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.890
whose eyes literally
melted and collapsed.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.730
There are also a couple case reports
of autistic children who refused

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.890
to eat anything but French fries, or
bacon blueberry muffins and Kool-Aid,

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.870
and got vitamin A deficient.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.460
There was a case in the Bronx written up
as vegan diet and vitamin A deficiency,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.010
but it wasn't the kid's vegan diet;
he refused to eat vegetables,

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.280
consuming only potato
chips, puffed rice cereal

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.170
with non-fortified soymilk,
and juice drinks.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.880
His parents lacked the skill
in overcoming the child's tendency

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.140
to avoid fruits and vegetables.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.920
A plant-based diet may actually
be the best thing for patients

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.450
with dry eye disease,
those who wear contact lenses,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.760
and those who wish to
maximize their tear secretions.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.350
People with dry eyes should be
advised to lower protein, total fat,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.790
and cholesterol intake, and
increase complex carbohydrates,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.350
increase vitamin A content by
eating red, orange, yellow, and

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.320
dark green leafy vegetables,

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.490
increasing zinc and folate by
eating whole grains, beans,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.520
and raw vegetables, especially spinach,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.040
ensure sufficient B6 and potassium intake
by eating nuts, bananas, and beans,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.710
ensure sufficient vitamin C
by eating citrus,

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.480
eliminate alcohol and caffeine,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.880
reduce sugar and salt intake,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.370
and increase water consumption
to six to eight glasses per day.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.960
Well, we know dehydration
can cause a dry mouth.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.150
Might dehydration cause dry eyes?

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.530
Seems kind of obvious, but evidently
it was never studied, until now.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.370
Is the answer to just drink more water?

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.460
Well, we know that those suffering from
dry eye are comparatively dehydrated.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.010
They figure that tear secretion decreases
with progressive dehydration

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.300
just like saliva secretion decreases,
giving us a dry mouth.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.240
And indeed, as one gets
more and more dehydrated,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.850
the urine concentrates,
and so does tear fluid.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.069
But one can reverse that with rehydration,
raising the exciting prospect that

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:21.660
improving whole-body hydration by
getting people to drink more water

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.599
might confer important therapeutic
effects for patients with dry eyes.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.199
The researchers recommend eight
cups of water a day for women

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.000
and ten cups a day for men.
