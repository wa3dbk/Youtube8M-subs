00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.299
Boneless breasts might just be the most
versatile chicken cut.

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:15.000
So many recipes call for chicken breasts.
You can saute or grill them. Stuff them,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.889
slice them for stir fry dishes. Or cube
them up for kabobs.

00:00:18.889 --> 00:00:22.669
The delicious possibilities are nearly endless.

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.689
But boneless breasts are one of the most
expensive chicken cuts. If you want to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.289
enjoy this premium cut, and save cash at
the same time,

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.920
then buy breasts with the bone in,
and remove it yourself.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.650
We'll show you how to devote abreast in
just three easy steps.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.000
You need the simplest kitchen tools. A clean
cutting board and a sharp boning knife

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
A boning knife features a narrow flexible
blade which is ideal for removing meat.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.370
Make sure the knife is really sharp.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.680
Be safe. Always cut away from your
fingers and hands. Chicken this slippery,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.470
so be careful. Step one: Separate breasts
from the breast bone.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.330
Bone in chicken breast from the market often
comes split into two halves. But if both

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.200
halves of the breasts are still attached
to the breast bone, separate them.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.220
You're gonna want to place the chicken
breasts skin side up on a clean cutting board.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.850
Cut through the center of the
breast bone from neck to tail.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.130
Step two: Remove the meat from the ribs.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.820
Place the breast on the cutting board
skin side up. Start at the breast bone, and

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.610
cut along the length of the bone.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.270
Make sure it's scraping cuts close to
the ribs, while gently pulling the meat away

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.500
with your other hand.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.430
Continue to cut close to the bone,
pulling back the meat as you go.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.369
The long, narrow piece of breast meat
is called the tenderloin,

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.400
or tender.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.610
This cut is ideal for stir-fry recipes.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.000
Or, roll them in breading, and bake or
fry it to make your own chicken tenders.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.800
Step Three: Trim Up.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.130
The final step of deboning a
chicken breast is to trim away tendons

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.560
and excess fat.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.000
If you want skinless meat, a great way to
reduce calories and fat, just slip it off.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.029
And that's how easy deboning a chicken
breast is! Use fresh deboned breast meat

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:26.090
in your favorite recipes. Or wrap and
freeze extra chicken breasts use later.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.329
Frozen chicken breast will keep for
about nine months.

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.229
Also, save more cash, and use the bones
and scraps to make your own flavorful

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:38.269
chicken stock. You can even freeze the
scraps to use in stock later.

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.319
Remember, anytime you handle raw chicken,

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.560
wash everything you've used: cutting
board, knife, and your hands with warm

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.349
soapy water. Enjoy low-calorie breast meat
and save money when you debone it yourself.
