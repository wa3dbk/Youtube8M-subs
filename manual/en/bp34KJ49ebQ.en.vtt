00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.700
My name is George Manoli.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.349
I'm 44 years old and I'm an Ice Cream Man.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.470
I've worn my glasses since I was 12 years
old.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.500
I had to wear my glasses on a daily basis,
without them I’d feel rather lost.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.750
I hated my National Health glasses like most
children did and really didn’t like to wear

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.750
them.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.830
At school I’d have to sit at the front of
the class and did everything I could just

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.080
not to wear glasses.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.550
I’ve never considered wearing contact lenses.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.260
It’s just something that doesn’t suit
me.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.460
It’s not an option that I’d want to go
down.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.370
I’d thought about laser eye surgery for
many years.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.550
It was last year when I decided to have laser
eye surgery and I undergone the operation

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.640
in January of this year.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.420
I did ask for recommendations and once I’d
got up to the Trafford Centre, where I had

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.950
my surgery done, I looked through many books
and did some research on the internet as well.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.950
Actually I’ve got a friend of a friend who
had laser eye surgery and the feedback that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.810
I got from visiting this friend was fantastic.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.000
Her vision has gone just unbelievable and
she recommended it to her friend who recommended

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
it to me.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.110
It was very, very good the information that
I found online.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:34.700
There’s many people doing laser eye surgery,
but I opted to go with Optical Express.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.840
Laser eye surgery these days is in the press
all the time and you turn the telly on and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.970
there’s many adverts and it got me thinking
it’d be really nice not to wear glasses

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.659
and I decided to give Optical Express a call.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.310
After the initial enquiry I booked in for
the consultation and I had the procedure within

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.820
2 weeks.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.820
There was a few things online that actually
put me off and made me dig a bit deeper for

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.560
some additional research.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.480
I asked the questions at Optical Express and
they explained everything to me and it put

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.180
me back at ease.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.250
My wife and daughter actually helped me to
make my mind up and both encouraged me to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.470
go for it.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.199
My treatment cost me £1,200.

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:30.190
On the day of surgery I was rather nervous
to start with.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.459
I was put at ease by the Optical Express staff
and it was over in moments.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:43.100
100% worth it, I’d do it again tomorrow.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.050
Once I’d had the surgery the first person
I called was my big brother.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.820
I told him that I had had the surgery and
he couldn’t believe that I’d had it done

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.090
and it was just ditch the glasses.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.940
Within days I noticed an improvement in my
sight and the eye really heals quite quickly.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:11.090
I was quite astonished actually.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.790
Since having laser eye surgery my life has
really changed for the better.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.840
I still play football for the veterans and
my game’s just improved as I’ve got older.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.760
I play snooker now without my glasses and
my game’s improved.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.130
Just every day, from driving, it’s a pleasure
now to drive, especially at night.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:39.760
Driving’s also my job and driving is now
a real pleasure since I've had the surgery.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.640
My experience with the Optical Express team,
it was just fabulous.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.669
Very professional, put me at ease and the
aftercare was just superb.

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:54.700
I would 100% recommend Optical Express to
my friends and family and even my customers.
