00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.800
That coffee has got balls!

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.000
Try try the best coffee in Melbourne right here

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In Melbourne, people line up for their coffee.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.610
I would absolutely rather abstain than drink crap coffee

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.320
And if I take a sip of a coffee and if I take a sip of a coffee and  it's not

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.320
made right, bin straight away!

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.300
Luckily, we're totally spoilt for choice here.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.579
You know anywhere in Melbourne I can kind
of pick the specialty coffee place within

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.500
a kilometre to get to so.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.200
I think this place is cool because it's run

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.369
by a social entrepreneur. It runs as a normal
business and the profit gets sent back to

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.030
where the alcohol comes from. They have Mexican
beers. They have Cuban rums all that sort

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.789
of stuff. So, yeah, social entrepreneurship.
It's business with a cause not business for profit.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.789
I would say a vast vast majority of people

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.189
would drink a milk-based coffee, espresso
or latte.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.490
Uhm, but there are a lot more people experimenting
with and enjoying filtered coffee. Especially

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.920
with single origins and blends suited for
filter. I think it's just testament to Melbournians

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.060
generally having a curious palette.
So espresso generally you're talking about

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.369
different lengths of the shot and different
ways that you can put the milk in. Basically,

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.329
we're looking at a 30ml shot and you go from
there.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.439
With filter styles, there's a few different
ways to brew filter. You're probably looking

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.280
at a pour over, aero press, vacuum pot or
syphon, and then my favourite kind of filtered

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.880
coffee is cold drip. And all it does is it
requires a slightly different roast in the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.760
coffee. So I would say slightly controversially
slightly lighter roast.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.760
Cold water in the top. Coffee in the middle
drips through collected in the bottom here.

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:31.049
Ah and eight hours later you've got a gorgeous
brew here. You are drinking cold black coffee

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.390
but if you can reconcile that it's a beautiful
flavour.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.680
Hi, I'm Monique from Walk Melbourne Tours.
We share Melbourne stories while we share

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.150
food. If you are interested in joining one
of my walks, pretty easy to do at walkmelbourne.com.au

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.260
Otherwise, pick yourself up a copy of Devouring
Melbourne Uncovering a Delicious City. Ah

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.190
what I've done is put Melbourne's food stories
from past and present together as well as

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.840
there's six guided walks. If you want to take
yourself out on a chocolate walk, wine walk,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.780
rooftop bars, they're all in there.
