00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.180
When you pick up a pattern, it’s always
really clear about what kind of yarn you need

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.280
to use for that pattern.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.020
But you’re never limited to using the yarn
they call for.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.410
We’re going to talk here about substituting
yarns, and there are three things you pretty

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.500
much want to remember.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.650
The first is the fiber type. Patterns will
either call for an animal fiber, or a cellulose

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.510
fiber, or a synthetic fiber.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.760
And whatever they’ve called for you usually
want to kind of stick with what they are using.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.129
For example, if they’re using a wool, you
want to stick with an animal fiber, so you

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.590
want to use a wool, or a wool blend, or alpaca,
angora, cashmere, whatever.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.350
If they’re using a plant fiber, like cotton,
you usually want to stick with something like

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.539
that – cotton, linen, bamboo, corn.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.280
And then, of course, acrylic fibers, you can
use any of the acrylic fibers when they’re

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.600
using something like that. Makes it very washable,
of course.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.339
Of course, you can change that up. You can
take a pattern that is using, for example,

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.060
a wool fiber and knit it with cotton, and
there is always the chance that you will greatly

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.720
improve on the pattern as it is!

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.080
But chances are it’s not going to look like
it does in the pattern photo. Just keep that

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.080
in mind.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.630
The next thing you want to pay attention to
is yarn weight, so that you can get gauge.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.610
And kind of a new system that’s coming out
that you see in a lot of patterns and on the,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.450
uh, the yarn ball bands.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.420
It’s a little graphic, a little skein with
a number on it that tells you the weight of

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.420
fiber is.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.530
And we’re going to talk about those.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.600
But really, if you look at what the gauge
is on the yarn ball, on the ball band, it

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.060
will give you a number of stitches per inch,
using a certain size of needle.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.780
If you can match that up with the pattern,
that’s another way of doing it.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.611
But this new graphics techniques here is an
easier way of seeing what the yarn weight

00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:54.611
is.

00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:57.610
And we’re going to take a look at those
right now.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:06.160
Yarn weight zero is also what we call lace
weight, is very fine yarn.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.460
One is sock yarn, a little bit thicker. What
we normally use, of course, to knit socks.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:26.610
Two is sport weight yarn. Also called baby
weight yarn. Used for knitting baby things.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.270
Three is DK, which stands for “double knitting”,
a term that we don’t really use much anymore,

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.460
we just abbreviate it to DK. It’s also sometimes
called light worsted.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.100
Four, is worsted weight yarn. The yarn that
you see most patterns are created from this

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.020
weight of yarn. Um, if it’s a little bit
heavier, it’s also sometimes called aran

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.160
weight.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:02.640
Five is chunky yarn. For quick knit projects.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.620
And six, is bulky. Like this. It can even
get thicker than this. It can get much thicker

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.890
than this. But from here on up I think it’s
pretty much always referred to as bulky.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.450
The last thing you want to consider when you’re
substituting yarns is that you can always

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.250
go on Ravelry.com.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.420
Ravelry is a place where people keep track
of what they’ve knit, and keep notes on

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.140
it for the yarns they’ve used and everything.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.530
And so if you want to consider substituting
a yarn, or you have a yarn that you want to

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.230
use for a certain project, chances are someone
on Ravelry has already done it.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.150
And you can read their notes, and you can
see how they liked the yarn that they used,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.450
or you can get ideas for different yarns.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.410
Anyway, those are some things to keep in mind
when you’re substituting yarns.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.360
