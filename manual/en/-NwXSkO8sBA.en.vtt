00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.530
I'm going to show you how
you can lay a concrete pad.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.990
Now, these can be used
for driveways or paths,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.600
but the one we're laying
today is for a shed.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.410
First you have to decide where
your shed's going to sit.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.520
You need to allow enough
distance from hedges or fences.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.970
Now, the shed I'm going
to build is 1.8 by 1.5.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.700
This timber will be the
boxing for our concrete pad.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.890
I've already pre-cut
my timber to length.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.170
I'm using 100-by-25 rough
sawn untreated timber.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.270
I'm now going to nail the boxing
together, using 75-mil nails.

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:41.130
Just leave your nail
sticking out a little way.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.599
When we take the
boxing off, it's

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:43.890
going to make it nice and easy.

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:50.250
Now I'm just going to make
sure that our boxing is

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.760
nice and square.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.650
To do this, I'm just going
to measure the diagonals

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.560
and ensure both ways are
exactly the same dimension.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.680
I've got 2,472-- spot on.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.240
Next thing you want to do is
dazzle around the outside edge

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.870
of your boxing.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.530
Our concrete pad
requires 75 millimeters

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.620
of compacted basecourse
underneath 75 millimeters

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.610
of concrete.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.150
There are different depths
of pads for different jobs.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.590
Check Mitre 10's online
guide for the correct pad

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.950
for your project.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.120
Now, the pad can be level with
the ground or raised above it.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.060
We want our concrete pad
level with the ground.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.630
So this means we need to
remove 150 millimeters of soil,

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.180
to allow for the compacted
basecourse and concrete.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.490
The boxing is pegged in place.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.280
Make sure the boxing is
level, so the shed sits flat.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.150
Then fix the pegs to the boxing.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.450
And then just rake and
remove any loose dirt.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.760
Because our concrete
pad is for a shed,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.710
we have decided to
put in a rebate.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.970
This is for the walls of
the shed to slot onto.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.263
Right, now we can put
in our basecourse.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.910
And this is your chance
to hire a compacter.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.319
They're really easy to use.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.110
Next we add a layer of
sand, and then we're

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.110
going to give it a rake.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.610
The sand will fill in the
holes in the basecourse,

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.020
making a nice smooth surface.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.617
Now it's time for the polythene.

00:02:48.617 --> 00:02:49.950
Make sure you tuck it in neatly.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.677
A pad this size doesn't
really need mesh,

00:02:54.677 --> 00:02:57.260
but I'm going to add it anyway
just to show you how it's done.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.680
We're using little
concrete blocks

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.760
to hold the mesh
off the polythene,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.680
so it sits in the middle
of the concrete slab.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.020
Time for the main event--

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.260
mix your concrete in a mixer,
according to the instructions,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.850
and then pour it
into the boxing.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.410
I've tapped the boxing,
to settle the concrete

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.770
and get the air bubbles out.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.700
For the first stage of
the finishing process,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.100
I'm using this 4-by-1
to screed it off.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.350
Next, we're going to use
the magnesium trowel.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.620
This stops drawing the water
up and out of the concrete.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.590
And finally, a steel trowel, to
give us a nice smooth finish.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.890
Wait between one to two
hours, and then repeat

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.230
this final step, for an
even smoother finish.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.441
Now we just need to wait
for the concrete to cure.

00:03:55.441 --> 00:03:56.190
Keep an eye on it.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.460
Concrete that dries too
fast can crack or shrink.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.710
So you may want to give it
a light spray with a hose,

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.770
in sunny conditions.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.770
For something this size,
you'll need to leave it

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.610
for around 48 hours.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.940
Right, now it's time
to take our boxing off.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.330
First thing you want to do, just
give the boxing a light tap.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.246
This will make it
easier to remove.

00:04:19.246 --> 00:04:20.579
Take our screws out of the pegs.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.137
Now we'll just pull our
nails out of the boxing

00:04:26.137 --> 00:04:27.220
that we left sticking out.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.380
And just very
gently lift that up.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.660
And there's our finished pad,
with rebate ready for our shed

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.620
to fit onto--

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.480
Easy As.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.540
For all the help and advice you
need to get the job done, just

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.900
head down to Mitre 10.
