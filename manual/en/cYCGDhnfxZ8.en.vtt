00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.270
Saddle valves come in little bags like
this.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.660
You can buy them at Home Depot, Lowe's and any other hardware supply store.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.830
They're used to divert small amounts of
water for applications like

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.969
water supply for the refrigerator, ice
maker in it

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.609
and for a humidifier. For the

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.880
refrigerator, you need to take the water
from the cold water supply.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.810
However, for the humidifier, depending

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.670
on the specifics, you may want to take it
from the hot water supply.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.640
If you're using a standard humidifier with a heat pump system,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.070
then you definitely need to attach to
the hot water supply.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.000
In this house this wasn't done and the
water is being taken from the cold water supply,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.850
which reduces the humidifier's efficiency.
So, we're going to rectify it today

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.800
by replacing the saddle valve. Taking out the
old one and

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.219
putting in the new one. Most types of
pipes like CPVC,

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.510
PVC and copper will take saddle valves. Saddle valves can come in different sizes.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.750
For the purposes that we're using them
for, for refrigerators

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.590
and for humidifiers, quarter inch saddle valves are

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.119
the most common ones. But there are
other sizes that are available

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.610
for your specific needs. Procedure for
installation is same.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.619
Opening the envelope, you will see all of these parts

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.640
along with the set of instructions. Instructions,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.290
unfortunately only talk about flaring the pipe and attaching it

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.009
to the saddle valve. It doesn't tell you how to
assemble the saddle valve.

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.790
If you've done it before, it is incredibly easy,
but if you're a first-timer

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.869
it may be a bit intimidating. So, we are going to show you how to do that.

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.300
We don't need to flare the pipe here,
because we're just gonna be taking a

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.950
pipe that's already been flared

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.420
from the old saddle valve to the new
one, from the cold water

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.619
to the hot water for our humidifier;

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.000
just move the pipe that's already there
and we're going to

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.979
show you what is not in the instructions.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.719
Assemble the saddle valve like it's laid out
here;

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.420
little rubber piece fits the channel of the
pipe, hug the pipe

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.430
there; the actual saddle valve is going to get  inserted

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.479
into the saddle and twisted on. Here
we're going to use the adjustable

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.489
ranch to tighten the top

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.319
of the the saddle valve to prevent it from wobbling

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.940
when we insert it into the pipe. We don't want it to leak. So,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.530
the smaller the wobble, the lesser the chance of that happening.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.230
Again, using this Crescent wrench, so it's
nice and tight.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.700
I like it perpendicular, but there's
nothing that says that you have to do that

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.790
 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.000
 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.400
Of course, with the pipe going right in there...

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.580
When choosing a location to put your saddle valve, consider that

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.150
in case anything leeks, you'll want to
be able to shut off the supply to it;

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.000
so, you probably want to put it past the shut off valve

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.900
You don't want to go too far away
from the hot water heater.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.409
So, we're going to choose a location
somewhere right here.

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.650
So, here's the saddle valve secured. Make
sure that it's not overtightened, its not

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.760
squeezing the pie.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.170
You don't want deform the pipe with the saddle valve. Now, we can easily move the water supply

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.600
for the humidifier from the cold water to the hot water, simply by shutting off the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.180
saddle valve and then disconnecting the
supply.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.800
We then move it over and

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.280
insert it into our saddle valve and tighten it with our

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.600
adjustable wrench. After you make sure that the

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.409
compression fitting connection you just
made is good, pierce the pipe

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.040
by twisting the valve all the way in

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.250
and then turning it back over halfway.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.629
You can now check that the water flows

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.290
and you're done.
