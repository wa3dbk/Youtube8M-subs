Hello, my name is Eric White. We're going
to talk about how to install a Dell Photo

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.129
Printer in Windows XP. First things first,
you've got to go get the driver from the Dell

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:19.171
website. So I went to www.dell.com. In the
upper right hand corner you're going to see

00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:25.349
a support link. Go ahead and click it. Now
on the far left side, you're going to see

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:33.530
product support link. That's going to pop
up this dialog box. You're going to want to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:42.640
select your model, choose printer, and then
printer again, scroll down near the bottom,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.880
here we go. Well I guess it's about halfway.
The 720 personal ink jet. That's it. Go ahead

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.550
and confirm your choice and the web site for
the printer 720 Personal Ink Jet is going

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.300
to pop up. To the right of the picture of
the printer are the drivers and downloads.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:12.640
Go ahead and click on that. It defaults to
WinXP, English, category doesn't matter, importance

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.229
doesn't matter. Now this link over here is
broken. I found this out earlier. So let's

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:31.049
go ahead and click on the Dell Driver title
in this link. Now click the download now button.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.469
Go ahead and save it. I'm going to just save
it right to my desktop. It's going to take

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:45.100
about five, six seconds longer for the driver
file to get down. So while it's downloading,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.619
go ahead and take your printer out of the
box, set it up on the desk where you want

00:01:49.619 --> 00:02:02.119
to put it, plug the power in, and then plug
the printer cable into the USB port. Once

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:09.920
it's plugged in, Windows XP is going to alert
you that it found a new device. It's okay

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:19.021
to just cancel that alert. So cancel those
alerts and then come over here and you're

00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:25.310
going to find this file wherever you put it.
I put mine on the desktop, and double click

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.940
it. And then go ahead and run if you get a
security warning. Now what this is going to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.920
do is it's going to unzip these files into
the Dell 720 directory it's going to create

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:48.640
in the C drive. Go ahead and just leave everything
as is and hit unzip. It's going to tell you

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.130
the file's run zip successfully and you hit
okay. It's going to run the Dell Printer Driver

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:07.410
setup. At this point, all you have to do is
hit yes and the next all the way through the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.130
install, next, it's going to look for the
printer. Now I actually don't have the Dell

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:21.550
720, Dell Photo 720, so it's not going to
find the printer. But since you do have it,

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.380
just hit your way next all the way through
until you hit finish. Then you're done installing

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.080
the Dell Photo Printer 720.
