00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.279
Hello, my name is Baljit Chandhoke and I’m
the Product Marketing Manager of Timing Products

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:07.419
at IDT.

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:14.929
Today, I will give you a brief introduction
of our new low power programmable clock family,

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.850
VersaClock 5.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.130
VersaClock 5 is a low power, programmable
clock generator with best in class jitter

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.710
performance with less than .7ps RMS phase
jitter from 12KHZ to 20MHz.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.500
The highly integrated device consolidates
four differential or eight single-ended clock

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.960
generators and can store up to four different
configuration settings, helping to minimize

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.970
board space and bill of materials.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.430
It also has a buffered reference clock output.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:57.890
The high performance clock generator operates
at less than 100mW core power, 50% lower than

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.780
competing devices, with typical total device
power of 300mW with all outputs operational,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.250
helping to ease system tunnel constraints
and reduce operating power expenses.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.360
VersaClock 5 has four universal output pairs.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.910
Each output pair can be configured as HCSL,
LVPECL, LVDS, or two LVCMOS outputs.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:31.800
VersaClock 5 has in-system, programmable clock
generator via I2C as well as IDT’s Timing

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.630
Commander Software.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.700
This slide shows the block diagram of VersaClock
5.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.110
VersaClock 5 can take a crystal or clock input.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.090
It has four fractional output dividers, which
allow programming of four independent frequencies,

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.400
up to 350MHz.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.549
The four universal output pairs are independently
configurable as HCSL, LVPECL, LVDS or dual

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.310
LVCS outputs.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.110
It also features a reference clock output.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.200
The fractional output dividers driving each
output pair are easily programmed via I2C,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.220
while the device is operating in the system,
enabling system tuning and margin testing.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.540
Unlimited in-system reprogramming is possible
via I2C, whereas four banks of one-time programmable

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.480
non-volatile memory provide flexibility for
multi-project imagery consolidation or design

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.910
changes in field.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:41.349
Upon request, the devices may be factory programmed
to customer’s desired configuration.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:49.640
VersaClock 5 has excellent phase jitter performance
with 610fsec RMS phase jitter, as shown on

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.160
the phase noise plot.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:00.260
With RMS phase jitter less than .7ps or the
full 12KHz to 20MHz integration range, the

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:08.360
new device meets the stringent jitter requirements
of PCI Express Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3, as

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.970
well as USB3.0 and 1G/10G Ethernet.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:22.010
IDT’s new Timing Commander Software platform
enables customers to configure program VersaClock

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:29.379
5 with an intuitive and flexible graphical
user interface, as you see on the slide.

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.989
You can program the four fractional output
dividers, providing four independent output

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.710
frequencies with 0 ppm error.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:44.090
You can configure universal output pairs as
differential LVDs, HCSL, LVPECL, or two single

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:53.379
unit outputs, as well as program each output
independently with spread spectrum, if needed.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:04:01.740
VersaClock 5 is useful in high-end consumer
applications, networking applications, computing

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.459
applications, industrial communications, broadcast
radio and medical applications.

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.900
The block diagram shows a typical application
of VersaClock 5, which has a 125 LVPECL output

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:24.740
for gigabit Ethernet, a 156.25MHz LVDS output
for 10 gig Ethernet and a 100MHz HCSL output

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.849
for PCIe Gen3, as well as a 25MHz reference
output.

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:36.870
With all the different outputs operational
and the cross-talk – including the cross-talk,

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.520
we get 700fsec integrated phase jitter from
12KHz to 20MHz.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.310
The key application issues solved by VersaClock
5 are shown on the slide.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:56.270
In summary, VersaClock 5 is a low-power, programmable
clock generator with best-in-class performance

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.169
and design flexibility.

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.759
It has excellent phase jitter performance.

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:06.400
Our wide range of frequencies provides design
flexibility with less than .7ps RMS phase

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.169
jitter from 12KHz to 20MHz.

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:15.039
VersaClock 5 has significantly less power
consumption, which enables easing thermal

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.680
constraints in the system.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.909
IDT VersaClock 5 programmable clocks are ideal
clocking solutions for a wide range of applications

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:28.430
replacing crystal oscillators, clock generators
– allowing for in-system programming, saving

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.360
BOM and board space, as well as improving
time to market and shortening design time.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.879
IDT VersaClock 5 provides industry’s most
versatile, low-power clock generation solution

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:46.800
for consumer, computing, industrial, communications
and networking applications.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.530
