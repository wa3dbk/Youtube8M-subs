00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.760
Hi everyone.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.760
I'm Rincey and this is Rincey Reads.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.050
Today I'm going to be doing a book haul for
you guys.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.110
Now for those of you guys who saw my 2015
booktube resolutions video thing that I did

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.310
earlier this year, you may have seen that
I am currently doing project 10, which is

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.650
where I read 10 books before I buy one.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.449
But I definitely broke that one.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.460
Not too badly, I only bought one book.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.560
But I saw this one and it was just like a
deal I couldn't pass up.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.800
Now, in my defense, I'm currently at 8 books
and I'm reading 2 books so theoretically this

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.149
could count as my one for my project 10, which
I'm going to do.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.530
So the book that I bought was PURPLE HIBISCUS
by Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.969
I found this one for $3 and I was just like,
oh, that's a really good deal that I just

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:46.969
couldn't pass up.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.670
And I knew that this was going to be a book
that I would want to own.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.949
But the rest of the books that I'm showing
are books that were given to me.

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.709
The first book is DISCONTENT AND ITS CIVILIZATIONS:
DISPATCHES FROM LAHORE, NEW YORK, AND LONDON

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:58.709
by Mohsin Hamid.

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:03.500
This is a collection of essays that Mohsin
Hamid wrote while he was traveling.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.500
Um.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.910
This is an ARC copy I received from someone
who works at Book Riot and they had an extra

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.530
copy so they sent it to me because they are
nice.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.570
This book comes out on February 24, which
is just in a couple of days.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.770
And I'm really excited, I'm going to get started
with this one pretty soon.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.850
For those of you who have been with my channel
for a while you know that I read HOW TO GET

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.270
FILTHY RICH IN RISING ASIA in 2012? or 2013?

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.540
I think that it was 2013 that that book came
out.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.690
And I adored it.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.690
I thought it was so great.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.810
I've heard mixed things about this one so
far, so I'm trying to, you know, not expect

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.850
too much from this book.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.730
But I hope that I, you know, enjoy it because
I like his writing style and it'll be interesting

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.500
to read some non-fiction work from him.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.150
Next up I got a package from Susie from read
susie read.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.050
I will have a link to her channel down below.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.300
But she recently mentioned how she has been
knitting a lot.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.211
And so one of the things that she has been
knitting is a scarf for me, which is very,

00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:54.620
very kind of her.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.500
At some point, I think it was last year, she
like offered to make me a scarf for some reason,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.190
I don't even know what the reason was.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.220
But then she never did and then I guess now
that she's been knitting a lot she decided

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.520
to finish my scarf.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.820
So I'm just going to open the package.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.740
I think there's also a book in here because
she texted me with like a picture of some

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.420
of the books that she was giving away and
asked me if I wanted some of them.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.489
Holy cow, there's a lot of tape on here Susie.

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.930
Oh, this is wrapped so cute.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.940
OK I'm going to show you guys the -- oh.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.519
First there's an adorable card inside.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.739
Oh this is only her second knit scarf ever.

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.349
Thanks Susie.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.010
OK this is the packaging, like super adorable.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.599
Oh and it said in the card Happy Galentines
Day, which is very sweet.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.139
She sent this to me while I was on vacation
so I didn't even get to open it until now.

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.249
So I knew it was coming again, but.

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:47.489
So here is the scarf that Susie knit.

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.840
Very perfect for the frigid weather we are
currently having in Chicago.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.799
Oh this feels like super warm.

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.819
This is really nice.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.370
Thanks Susie.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.180
One fun thing that I learned, uh, because
of Susie is that apparently scarves are supposed

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.419
to be the length of the person that's wearing
them, which is not a thing that I ever connected

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.419
in my head.

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:11.919
But then I went home after Susie told me that
and asked me my height and I checked all of

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.049
my scarves and they're all about my height,
which is very interesting.

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.389
And then she sent me a book.

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.189
LOVE AND OTHER FOREIGN WORDS by Erin McCahan.

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.930
First of all, I like this cover and this font.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.829
Also I picked it up because I kind of wanted
cute things.

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.950
One thing that I realized recently is that
I own a lot of like heavy books, meaning like

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.370
heavy in subject matter, very like literary,
things like that.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.939
And I kind of miss having more, um, lighter
books like, I guess you could consider them

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.160
romance-y, love stories, things like that.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.730
So I asked for this one because it sounded
the most interesting out of the pile that

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.730
she had.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.730
And then finally, I have one more package.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.700
This one is from Susheela over oh hey sush.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.700
Sush?

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.700
Sus?

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.700
Something.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.700
I can't talk.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.700
Um. [laughs] Link to her channel down below
as well.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.519
But she was actually in Chicago because the
American Library Association's Mid Winter

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.780
conference was in Chicago.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.269
And we were supposed to meet up but then there
was like a crazy blizzard and I couldn't get

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.269
to her.

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.309
She picked up some ARCs for me, which was
very, very, very kind of her.

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:14.120
And so since she couldn't give them to me
in person she mailed them to me from Toronto,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.100
which, again, is just very, very, very nice
of her.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.170
I have no idea what's in this package by the
way.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.170
So this will be a surprised to me.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.260
If I can open it.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Oh.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.280
Oh she got me.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.750
Oh it's a tote from Penguin Random House.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.010
Oh and it has the release, this is clever,
good job Penguin.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.990
It has, um, some of the authors who have books
coming out this year and their release dates.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.292
So March has Cara Black, Sara Gruen, Erik
Larsen, April is Toni Morrison and Jo, Jo

00:04:46.292 --> 00:04:47.292
Nesbo.

00:04:47.292 --> 00:04:50.080
I have no idea if that's how you say it correctly.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.620
June has Judy Blume.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.610
And July has Karen Slaughter.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.050
So that's quite nice.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.640
And, you know, no such thing as too many tote
bags for a reader.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.160
She provided a little adorable postcard.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.560
I really like this post card a lot.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.530
And then the 2 books that she included is
WHEN YOU LEAVE by Monica Ropal, which comes

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.020
out in April 2015.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.450
I think this is a young adult book.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.000
Oo, it takes place at a prep school.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.030
I like it already.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.270
And it looks like it might be a murder mystery.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.210
I'm not completely sure but this looks beautiful.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.210
Thank you.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.630
And then the next one is the new Dennis Lehane
book.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.000
I've never read anything by him.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.450
But, you know, he's one of those New York
Times bestseller type authors.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.740
This one's called WORLD GONE BY and comes
out in 3/15, March.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.710
March, it says it on the spine.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.710
That's really inconvenient.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.340
But yeah, I know nothing about Dennis Lehane's
work, but if you guys know anything about

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.430
it, let me know.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.050
So yeah, those are the books that I received
this month.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.390
Really, who needs Project 10 when you have
friends sending you books all the time.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.750
If you've read any of the books that I have
mentioned in this video, feel free to leave

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.560
a comment down below letting me know what
you guys thought of it.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.080
Also if you guys want me to read any of these
books sooner rather than later, always leave

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.120
that down in the comment section as well because
I do sometimes take that into account when

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.540
figuring out what I want to read next.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.540
So yeah, that's all I have for now and thanks
for watching.
