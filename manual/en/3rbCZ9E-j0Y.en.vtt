Hi, this is Andrew on behalf of Expert Village.com
and today I am going to be showing you how

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:15.709
to sew a button clasp onto a dress shirt with
a cuff to wear. You can pull the button open

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.750
or press it shirt without having to use one
hand to fish the button through a slot. The

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.710
next thing you want to do is begin to actually
thread the button. So we have placed the mark

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.330
on the back side. You want to place the center
of the button over that mark. This is going

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.320
to be just adjacent to the button that is
already in that area. Then you want to take

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.050
your needle and come in through the back side
because that is where the material is going

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.760
to build up and you do not want that to be
showing on the outside. You Just want to go

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.100
through the mark and come out through any
one of the first holes and typically with

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.480
these what I would do is unlike the buttons
where you can form a criss- cross pattern.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.369
With these I just like to go between two on
one side and then two on the other side and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.751
you are done. This side has a lot of holding
force for this type of button and you just

00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:20.590
want to go back and forth and come back, and
come up through the hole (the same hole I

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:32.600
came out of) and then cross back over and
keep doing that. Once I do that I just want

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:45.490
to go across to the other holes on the other
side of the clasp (you want to cross over

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.460
again) and you just want to keep repeating
the same pattern until you have made it your

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.749
way all around the button. Now once you do
that then you are on the back side you want

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:02.509
to basically cut it off and repeat this same
pattern with the other side of the clasp so

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.940
that it is on the other side of the cuff.
Once you are done, you just want to take the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:22.510
thread and slip if off and this works beautifully.
You just snap it together and it looks the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.060
same and when you are done, you just pull
it apart and you can pull your arm out of

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.459
the sleeve.
