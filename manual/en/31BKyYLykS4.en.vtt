00:00:01.025 --> 00:00:05.285
Well, welcome to another tutorial and
in this one we are going to do miniatures

00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:12.140
and we are going to do this little tree 
out of string, or twine.

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:18.761
Now the first thing we are going to need
is some string.

00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:23.021
and we are going to take a length
around about twice the size of your tree

00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:28.366
something like 4 inches or 10 cm
around about there.

00:00:30.226 --> 00:00:38.361
Now about an inch in , or a couple of cms
in from the end of the twine

00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:42.252
We are going to get some white glue 
and we are going to put some on

00:00:42.252 --> 00:00:46.829
and then twirl it around

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:52.371
to glue that as the trunk

00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:55.498
and it is going to finish something like this

00:00:55.498 --> 00:01:01.993
and we are going to take a comb and
comb out those fibers at the end

00:01:03.093 --> 00:01:10.130
Then, we are going to open up the ends 
of those fibers and flatten them out

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.233
and put a little dob of glue in the center
of that there

00:01:19.153 --> 00:01:24.613
and it will dry like that, then we are going
to separate some of those out

00:01:24.613 --> 00:01:30.454
like that, and then put a little drop,
twirl it around

00:01:30.454 --> 00:01:38.498
and put a little drop of glue also on that

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:44.894
but not all of the way. And let that dry, 
and do several at a time.

00:01:46.174 --> 00:01:51.284
And it will finish something like this, 
then you are going to repeat the process

00:01:51.284 --> 00:01:57.033
subdividing each one of those roots, 
and if you can, subdivide it into a third.

00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:02.148
Then your roots are going to finish
something like this.

00:02:02.148 --> 00:02:04.969
So that's the root system done,
and that will be able to

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.480
glue down on your base board.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:15.790
the next thing to do is to subdivide
those, now the branches

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.423
down to where the glue of the trunk is.

00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:24.672
and apply some glue.

00:02:27.802 --> 00:02:35.101
Just a little bit, and just for that
first part of the branch.

00:02:41.273 --> 00:02:48.676
Then, the same as with the roots,
start subdividing those branches

00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:53.362
and adding little drops of glue.

00:02:59.502 --> 00:03:03.062
and do it to as many as you can.

00:03:04.553 --> 00:03:12.284
then subdivide, and subdivide,
and keep subdividing all of the time.

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:21.643
This is similar to a wire one ,
but it is doing it with string.

00:03:37.615 --> 00:03:42.167
Then eventually you are going to end up
with a tree with its branches

00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:46.281
spread out like that.

00:03:46.281 --> 00:03:51.452
Now is a good time to start painting
with some paint.

00:03:51.452 --> 00:03:54.747
A good idea is, if you have got
a lot of brown for example

00:03:54.747 --> 00:03:57.541
just dunk it straight in and
let it drip off

00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:00.861
But if you don't have that, well, 
you are just going to have to use

00:04:00.861 --> 00:04:04.921
a brush and start painting.

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:09.275
The next thing to do,
is the final branches.

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:14.644
Take some of that twine again and
take about half a centimeter

00:04:14.644 --> 00:04:21.026
or quarter of an inch and just start
cutting a little bit, like that

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:25.981
To get some stuff like this.

00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:31.696
So the next thing you are going to do,
is you are going to take your glue bottle

00:04:31.696 --> 00:04:37.843
and you are going to dab little globs of
glue on the ends of all of those branches.

00:04:38.668 --> 00:04:43.794
Then, you are going to take
those little fibers that you made

00:04:43.794 --> 00:04:48.101
and just sprinkle them on.

00:04:49.728 --> 00:04:53.901
So there we have the tree
with its little peripheral branches

00:04:53.901 --> 00:04:58.444
and then we are going to take 
some white glue watered down

00:04:58.444 --> 00:05:05.806
to about 50% , and we are going to
just take a bit of that and then

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:12.650
dab it on the ends of those fibers.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.213
Then with a piece of paper,
over that we are going to get some

00:05:22.213 --> 00:05:29.041
colored sawdust, which you can make by
following this link on the screen.

00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:32.750
and then sprinkle.

00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:40.601
Now you may have to do that
a couple of times.
