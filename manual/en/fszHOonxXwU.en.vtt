Holiday Bread

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:08.861
You can find the list of the ingredients in our site or during the narration on this video.

00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:12.577
In a bowl combine water,
(2 cups warm water)

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.445
oil,
(3/4 cups oil)

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.629
dry yeast,
(1 package active dry yeast - 10 grams)

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:20.548
sugar,
(8 TBSP sugar)

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:29.852
and salt.
(a pinch of salt)

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.647
Then add flour and beat until dough becomes soft and pliable.
(Unbleached all-purpose flour until dough becomes pliable. I used between 500g and 1 kg of flour, which is about 1 to 2 pounds.)

00:00:34.023 --> 00:00:36.527
This means the dough won't stick to the bowl.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.061
Make sure the dough is smooth and elastic.

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.110
Grease a round pan with vegetable oil.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.513
Cut the dough into a small portions and shape into a ball that fits in your hand.

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:24.342
Place the balls into a round greased pan, end to end so that they form a circle.

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:32.545
Cover the pan with a kitchen towel.

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:37.436
Let the dough rise until doubled.This will take about 15 minutes or more.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.430
Pre heat the oven and bake for 25 minutes or until golden.

00:01:42.417 --> 00:01:44.530
While the bread is baking, make the toping.

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:46.940
In a bowl mix sugar,

00:01:47.417 --> 00:01:48.730
coconut milk,

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:55.030
raisins,

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:57.470
and crystalized fruits.

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:03.330
Remove the pan from the oven, but keep the heat on.

00:02:03.828 --> 00:02:07.340
Spread the toping over the bread and bring it back to the oven.

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:11.120
Bake it again until the toping dries and is crystalized over the bread.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Done!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.190
Since I was a little kid, I loved cooking.

00:02:19.083 --> 00:02:21.080
But, I always had a hard time dealing with dough.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:24.540
This recipie that my mother in law gave it to me, is so incredible easy

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:27.920
that even people like me can make it!

00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:30.460
We wish Happy Holidays to all!

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.750
And wait for the next year news!
