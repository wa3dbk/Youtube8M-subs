This episode of A
News is brought to you

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.100
by the BuyPower Card
from Capital One.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.763
Every purchase brings you
closer to a new GM vehicles.

00:00:10.272 --> 00:00:12.480
Hi guys, I'm Catie Wayne,
and this is Animalist News.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.120
Tomorrow, on
Wednesday October 8th,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.590
a Supreme Court
case will be open

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.860
arguing that chimpanzees should
be recognized as a person,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.250
on behalf of Tommy
the pet chimpanzee.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.060
Tommy belongs to
Patrick Lavery and is

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.530
being kept in a metal
cage, and that is not cool

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.820
so says the Nonhuman
Rights Project.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.010
They feel that Tommy
and all chimpanzees

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.280
should be recognized as
people, and therefore

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.380
entitled to a writ
of habeas corpus,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.884
or the right to due process.

00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:37.300
And as a result,
should be allowed

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.210
to live in a sanctuary that
mimics his natural habitat.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.520
Last December, the Supreme
Court rejected the case,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.530
but the organization
has asked for an appeal.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.450
And so, tomorrow they will
appear in front of five judges

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.690
to argue their case.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.870
Now, to be clear, if
this case passes this

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.670
does not mean that chimpanzees
will be considered human,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.620
nor is the organization
fighting to achieve

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.497
human rights for chimpanzees.

00:00:57.497 --> 00:00:59.830
They're only arguing that
chimps are highly intelligent,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.570
self aware,
autonomous beings that

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.230
fit the profile of a persons
in the eyes of the law.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.480
But what is really
interesting about this case,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.150
is the fact that
if it passes, it

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.700
could open the
door to personhood

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.630
for all kinds of different
animals, like dogs and cats.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.120
Veterinarians may be concerned
about malpractice lawsuits,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.480
which would obviously become
more complicated if dogs

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.360
and cats are granted personhood.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.850
Similarly, farmers are concerned
that if cats and dogs are

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.400
granted personhood, cows
and chickens could be next,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.200
and then the livestock
industry could no longer be.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.970
Not to mention,
scientists may no longer

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.240
have the ability to use
animals in research, which

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.874
is used in basic science
and clinical treatment.

00:01:33.874 --> 00:01:35.540
Other countries, like
Spain and Germany,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.250
have faced similar
debates and ended up

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.470
awarding apes another
animal special rights

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.780
into their constitutions.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.440
What do you guys think, should
animals be granted personhood?

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.360
Why or why not?

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.410
I'm pretty torn on
this, personally.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.307
Be sure let me know
in the comments below.

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:50.640
And if you'd like to see just
how smart chimpanzees are,

check out this video
about how they're actually

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.050
better at video games
than humans are.

Bye.
