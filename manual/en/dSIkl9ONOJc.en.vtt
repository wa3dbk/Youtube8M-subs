Just relax

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.099
and harmonize mind-body and breath as we
create a free flow of chi

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.320
Imagine a ball

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.320

chest - squeeze the ball in

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.320

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.620
breathe into the center and out - we come down

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.560
as we splash the colors of the rainbow

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.560
across the sky

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.230
