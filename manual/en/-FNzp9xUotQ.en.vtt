00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:39.690
&gt;&gt;This kinetic blue Ford Figo diesel we are
driving did turn a lot of heads wherever we

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.690
went.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.079
But it’s not just the colour that’s new.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.989
The Figo has got a makeover that makes it
look fresher and more contemporary, with some

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.329
welcome convenience features too.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.290
The headlamps now have the indicators towards
the centre.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.500
The bumper gets a new design with a new fog
lamp housing.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.710
In profile, the only thing you notice is the
new alloy wheel design.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.140
At the rear, only the tail-lamps have been
redesigned, swapping the indicator and brake

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.439
lamp positions.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.500
Ford says there are 140 new changes in the
car, but only few are visible.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.470
On the interiors for instance, you notice
new seat fabric and better plastic quality

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.890
on the dashboard.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.280
The big change is the addition of steering
audio controls – mounted behind the steering

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.280
wheel.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.260
The integrated music system with Bluetooth
phone connectivity has one of the best sound

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.890
qualities you can get in a stock system.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.970
Power mirrors are standard on this variant.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.330
Ride quality and handling in the Ford Figoare
really good.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.479
The Figo’s steering is precise and feels
great to drive.

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.080
The gearshifts are quick and easy and the
car stays planted on the road, giving the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.659
driver a lot of confidence.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.940
ABS equipped brakes and airbags add to its
safety.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.930
The Figo diesel is powered by a 1.4 litre
engine putting out 68 bhp of power and 160

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.280
newton metres of torque.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.520
Now that’s not a lot if you want outright
power, but there are two things that are good

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.140
about this engine – there is virtually no
turbo lag, making it a great car for linear

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.849
pick up in the city and it is pretty fuel
efficient, with a claimed mileage of over

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.470
20 kmpl.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.730
During our test we got about 17 kmpl.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.540
The rear seats of the Figo are pretty comfortable,
giving it a big car feel with plenty of legroom.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.410
However, one bugbear of the Figo continues
– and that is there are no power windows

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.540
at the rear, while the window too only rolls
down half-way.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:39.189
But when it comes to luggage space, the huge
284 litre boot can swallow a fair bit of luggage.

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.329
The rear seat backrest however does not fold
fully flat.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.970
Ground clearance was a concern with the Figo,
and Ford claims to have addressed that.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.370
As long as you maintain the right tyre pressures,
the Figo should handle most roads easily,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.569
with a slightly stiffer suspension.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.510
Overall, the Ford Figo is one of the most
value for money, fuel-efficient diesel hatchbacks

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.730
you can buy.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.400
The new looks and improvements to overall
quality have only made the car better – you

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.559
get big car space for small car money with
the Figo.
