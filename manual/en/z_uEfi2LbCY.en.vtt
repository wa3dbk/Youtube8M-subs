00:00:01.748 --> 00:00:04.932
Zara zara bahekta hai, mahekta hai 
"With Little Temptation, little intoxicated, It is becoming fragrant"

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:09.899
Aaj to mera tan badan, main pyaasi hoon
 "This is how my body today, its thirsty too"

00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:15.961
Mujhe bhar le apni baahon mein 
"Grab me in your arms"

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.434
Zara zara bahekta hai, mahekta hai
 "With Little Temptation, little intoxicated, It is becoming fragrant"

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:26.091
Aaj to mera tan badan, main pyaasi hoon
 "This is how my body today, its thirsty too"

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:29.776
Mujhe bhar le apni baahon mein
 "Grab me in your arms"

00:00:30.137 --> 00:00:36.341
Hai meri kasam tujhko sanam, door kahin na jaa 
"Swear, I have a vow for you lover, don't ever go far"

00:00:36.813 --> 00:00:47.184
Yeh doori kehti hai paas mere aaja re 
"This separation(distance) is calling, come close close to me"

00:01:10.784 --> 00:01:14.670
Yunhi baras baras kaali ghata barse 
"Dark black clouds are showering heavily"

00:01:15.224 --> 00:01:23.488
Hum yaar bheeg jaaye is chaahat ki baarish mein 
"We will be drenched in this rain of love"

00:01:23.797 --> 00:01:27.486
Meri khuli khuli laton ko suljhaaye
 "Untangle, my open hair"

00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:36.285
Tu apni ungliyon se main to hoon isi khwaahish mein 
"With your fingers, Its my desire"

00:01:36.922 --> 00:01:42.663
Sardi ki raaton mein hum soye rahe ek chaadar mein "Today's cold night we will sleep under one blanket"

00:01:43.188 --> 00:01:49.160
Hum dono tanha ho, na koi bhi rahe is ghar mein 
"We are both alone, no one else is in this home"

00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:54.177
Zara zara bahekta hai, mahekta hai
 "Body is becoming a little intoxicated, It is becoming fragrant"

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:58.893
Aaj to mera tan badan, main pyaasi hoon 
"This is how my body beahving, its thirsty too"

00:01:59.134 --> 00:02:06.461
Mujhe bhar le apni baahon mein 
"Grab me in your arms"

00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:15.614
Aaja re aa re
 "Come, oh come"

00:02:56.438 --> 00:03:00.150
Tadpaaye mujhe teri sabhi baatein
 "All your words make me craving"

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:08.826
Ek baar ae deewane jhootha hi sahi pyaar to kar 
"One time, crazy lover, love me whether true or not"

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.090
Main bhooli nahin haseen mulaaqaatein
 "I have not forgotten our beautiful meetings"

00:03:13.514 --> 00:03:21.967
Bechain karke mujhko mujhse yun na pher nazar 
"Making me restless don't turn away your eye sight from me like this"

00:03:22.307 --> 00:03:28.142
Roothega na mujhse, mere saathiya yeh vaada kar 
"My soulmate, make a promise that you won't get upset with me"

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:34.843
Tere bina mushkil hai jeena mera mere dil mein
 "Without you, its difficult to live in my heart"

00:03:35.187 --> 00:03:40.844
Zara zara bahekta hai, mahekta hai
 "Body is becoming a little intoxicated, It is becoming fragrant"

00:03:40.844 --> 00:03:44.691
Aaj to mera tan badan, main pyaasi hoon
 "This is how my body beahving, its thirsty too"

00:03:44.986 --> 00:03:48.611
Mujhe bhar le apni baahon mein 
"Grab me in your arms"

00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:54.546
Hai meri kasam tujhko sanam, door kahin na jaa 
"Swear, I have a vow for you lover, don't ever go far"

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:01.911
Yeh doori kehti hai paas mere aaja re
 "This separation is calling, come close to me"

00:04:02.924 --> 00:04:06.378
Aaja re, aaja re, aaja re 
"Come, come, oh come"

00:04:06,612 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
Aaja re, aaja re, aaja re
 "Come, come, oh come"
