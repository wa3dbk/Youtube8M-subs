Hi everyone and welcome to another episode
of Kids Toy Videos.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:23.650
Today we have a Spongebob Squarepants Series
1 mystery bag by MegaBloks

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:32.560
The mystery bag of figurines are from the
Spongebob Squarepants TV Show

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.400
There are seven figurines of Spongebob Squarepants
characters that you can collect

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.610
There is a mystery figurine that you can get,
but no one knows what that is

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.010
Here we have all of the figurines that you
can collect

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.420
As you can see on the top
the orange sea shell means it's just a common

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:12.680
one that you can get easily
The blue star is rare it means it doesn't 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:22.580
come around often
If you get a yellow diamond that means you

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:34.490
got an ultra rare one!
But that secret rare one! no one knows what it is...

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.180
and who did we get?

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.520
Mr. Fish
let's put him together

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.770
We have Mr. Fish from Spongebob Squarepants
TV show

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.740
I'm hungry, I think I'm going to go get some
crabby patties to eat!
