00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.010
Whether your current watch band is worn out,
or you would just like to give your watch

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:12.010
a new look, you can easily replace your metal
watch band with this guide from Esslinger.com.

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.250
How do you know if your watch case does or
does not have holes? Check the watch lugs,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.390
the metal part that sticks out to hold the
watch band. If it is smooth like this one,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.390
it does not have holes and you should follow
these steps to remove your watch band.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.370
You will need:
A spring bar tool

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.680
A replacement watch band
A parts tray

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.329
And an optional: new spring bars

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.960
The first step in changing your watch band
is to remove the existing watch band. Start

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.039
by holding the watch so that it is sitting
on its side with the watch crown pointing

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.000
up.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.480
Hold the watch case so one side of the band
is facing you, take your spring bar tool and

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.660
slip the forked end under the top lug. When
the point catches on the spring bar, push

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.840
down and then to the side to pop the spring
bar free. This may be a little tricky depending

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.390
on your watch case.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.270
When the spring bar is free you can pull that
end of the watch band out of the case. Take

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.270
out the spring bar and set it aside in the
parts tray in case you can reuse it.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.310
Turn the watch case so that the half of the
watch band that is still attached to the watch

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.340
case is accessible to your tools.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.670
Take your spring bar tool and repeat what
you did before. Move the forked end in under

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.840
the case lug and then push down and to the
side to slide the spring bar free of the watch

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.840
case.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.950
Remove the watch band from the watch case
and take the spring bar out of the band. Set

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.390
the spring bar in your parts tray.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.210
Then lay the band aside so you remember which
side of the watch case it belongs on. By doing

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.469
this, you will ensure that the clasp of your
new watch band will close the same way as

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:08.410
the one on your original band.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.240
Next you need to measure the watch band to
determine the size of your replacement band.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.240
For help doing this, follow this link.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.780
Now that you have the size of the watch band
needed, you can choose a size and style that

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.780
you prefer.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.340
You can now place the new watch band onto
the watch case. Take one side of the new watch

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.170
band and determine which side of the watch
case it belongs on from the old band.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.560
Once you know where one end of your watch
band belongs, hold the end in your hand and

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.280
insert one of the spring bars into it. If
the spring bars aren't damaged you should

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.220
be able to reuse them if necessary.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.060
With the first spring bar in place, pick up
the watch case and hold it on its side again

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.340
with the crown pointing to the ceiling. It
should be positioned so you can access the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.310
side where the first end of the band belongs.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.210
Position the spring bar of the watch band
in the indent in the bottom lug. Be sure that

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.900
your watch band's finished side is facing
the same direction as the watch face.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.770
Take the forked end of the spring bar tool
and position it so that you can push one of

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.090
the spring ends of the spring bar down so
it fits under the lug.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.650
Carefully move the watch band around in the
lugs until you feel the spring bar pop into

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.660
place. This will happen when the spring bar
finds the indentation on the underside of

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.030
the watch lug. Don't worry if it takes you
several tries to get the spring bar in position.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:00.030
Now, turn the watch case so that you can access
the other set of lugs.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.940
Grab the second spring bar and insert it into
the free end of the watch band.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.540
After the spring bar is in place, position
the other end of the new watch band between

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.930
them. The spring bar should sit in the hole
for it in the bottom lug and the finished

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.100
side should be facing the correct way already.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.340
When it is place, use your spring bar tool
to push the top part of the spring bar down

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.290
so it can slide under the top watch lug.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.100
Just like you did with the first end, wiggle
the watch band around under the top lug until

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.940
it slips into place in its indentation.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.190
Once both halves of the watch band are securely
attached to the watch case, you are ready

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.810
to wear your watch again with its brand new
look.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.900
