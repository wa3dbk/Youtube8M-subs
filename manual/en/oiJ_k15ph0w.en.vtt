00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.580
Hi this is Chuck Byros for Expert Village
and I'm at Jacksontrigs winery with chief

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.679
wine maker Marco pickoldy. What we are looking
at now is a shaking table and salting table

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.831
which are two very important tools to perform
and to maintain the quality of the grapes

00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:22.690
from the vineyard. In the vineyard we pick
the grapes by hand and we put them in baskets

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.109
of fifteen to twenty kilos each this is very
important because in this way the grapes are

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.340
not going to be squeezed by their own weight.
The grapes arrive here, the boxes arrive here

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:41.680
and one of our guys dumps slowly the grapes
onto the shaking table. This shaking table

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.530
pushes the grapes in this direction under
this fan. The fan is useful to remove all

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.150
kinds of water or juice from the grapes, and
to remove everything is all the wet and the

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.300
dew that we can have from the grapes at this
point. The juice and that water are collected

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.790
in this tray and after will be disposed. At
this point is where the real salting happens.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.970
The grapes gently fall on this salting table,
this belt that is going toward that direction.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:19.290
Then the people here remove all the damaged
grapes, the damaged berries actually, not

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.140
the grapes, they literally remove berry by
berry, leaves, and other kind of residue that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.460
can come from the vineyard. So in this way
we have the pure, healthy and clean fruit.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.740
The fruit at this point will fall inside the
container, a bin that is posed underneath

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.120
the salting table and gently put inside this
conveyor that moves everything, transports

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.960
everything, inside a press. That press, is
very, very technically nice and advanced,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.701
because this gives me the tool to press the
grapes at the proper pressure. It is very

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:12.890
important you don't over-press

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:25.780
the grapes.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:40.530
In

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.440
the way,
