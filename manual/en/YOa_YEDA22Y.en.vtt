Lisa Schneider-Cipriano:&nbsp; I am here with
Paqui Kelly, the co-founder of the Kelly Cares

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.490
Foundation.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.199
Paqui, why is it so important to expand your
network of medical experts to assist you with

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:18.199
your care?

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:26.060
Paqui Kelly:&nbsp; Well, depending on your location
and even getting a mammogram in some more

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.640
rural area is not an easy task.&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.770
I was fortunately living in places that had
those type of facilities available.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:46.440
We had a friend in our family that was actually
in part of that research and of breast cancer

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.440
specifically.&nbsp;

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:55.010
So she was able to recommend some of the area,
you know local doctors and area doctors that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.180
would be beneficial.&nbsp;

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.270
So look at my files and some of the treatment
I had done surgery-wise was like an hour-and-half

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:13.610
away and some of the radiation was right there
locally.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.870
But everyone has to feel comfortable with
who they are getting treated by and again,

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.130
that’s being proactive and owing your health
and you would need to be well.&nbsp;

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.970
I know some generations, I think even in the
last ten years that has changed quite a bit.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.840
&nbsp;Like I said, although I am getting older
everyday but it used to be whatever the doctor

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:44.350
says and that’s what you do, but there are
many qualified people out there that you know,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:02:07.740
you got to be in tune with your body, how
you feel, what you are comfortable with, and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.939
also what your doctors prevent.
