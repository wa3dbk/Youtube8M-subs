00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hello, friends!
My name is Sergey Polyansky,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.000
today I'd like to tell you about
the Marshall MG50CFX combo.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's a 50-watt combo with 4 channels,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
12" speaker and a wide set of effects.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
On the front panel of the amp
there are channel switching buttons,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
a 3-band equalizer,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
effects buttons with adjustment knobs,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
external effects button

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and a built-in tuner, which is activated by

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
simultaneously pressing Damping and Store buttons.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Also, the Damping button allows you to switch 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.500
between two sound modes: classic and modern.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
On the rear panel there are
Send-Return connectors,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
line input for MP3 player

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and a jack for included foot switch.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.000
Let's listen to the Clean channel first.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Let's listen to the Crunch channel.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.000
Now, let's try Overdrive 1 channel.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.500
Now, Overdrive 2.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Let's listen to some effects.
