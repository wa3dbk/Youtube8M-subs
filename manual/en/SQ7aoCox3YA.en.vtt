00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.120
Hi guys, it's Simon and I'm doing this week's TLDR

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.320
by myself because Martina unfortunately has food poisoning and she's feeling

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.180
a bit too sick to handle this week's TLDR. I didn't want to skip this week's TLDR though

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.980
because it's about a very important topic.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.760
I'll be talking a bit about the Sewol Ferry Crash

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.240
and about what it means here in Korea.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.380
As a lot of you might have noticed,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.520
we haven't been posting any videos since Thursday because

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.960
of the Sewol Ferry Incident.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.280
Most of the videos that we post are very lighthearted

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.120
and silly and have us goofing off

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.460
and I just didn't feel like it would be right for us to be this silly

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.960
in light of how serious it is here in Korea right now.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.020
We're not the only ones who have postponed our videos

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.660
a lot of entertainment companies in Korea also have stopped posting their comedy shows

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.780
and live music performances

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.840
because Korea, right now, is kind of in a state of mourning.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.360
For those of you who don't know what the Sewol Ferry Incident is,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.640
I'm going to give you a brief rundown.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.980
Basically on April 16, a ferry carrying 476 passengers capsized

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.460
Another thing that makes this tragedy such a severe one is that a lot of the people on the boat were

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.660
students. At the time I'm filming this video, 174 people were rescued

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.240
64 were confirmed dead, and another 238 are missing

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.720
It's feared that the wonder for saving these people has passed

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.820
So it's also feared that the 238 people are probably...dead.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.880
Now, that major problem that I'm going to have with this week's TLDR is this:

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.540
Majority of the TLDRs that we do mostly involves us telling stories about personal experiences that we've had here in Korea.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.300
When it comes to this ferry incidence, though, we don't have any first hand personal experiences with this whatsoever.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.980
The closest experience that we have is that two of our closest friend were actually teachers to a lot of these students.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.480
And, we personally can see how devastated our friends are by this whole event.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.500
In fact, there is now one person in Korea who I have spoken with about this event that is in complete distraught as well.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.120
In the six year that we have been in Korea, this has to be the worst thing that has ever happened.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.240
I know a whole lot of people that didn't give a sh*t whatsoever when Kim Jong Il died.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.360
And, every year, when North Korea gives a whole bunch of threats about covering us in a ocean of fire

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.580
Nobody blinks an eye.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.420
But I haven't met a single person who isn't visibly upset about what is happening on this boat.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.360
A lot of the sentiment here, though, isn't one only of sadness. But, also of extreme frustration.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.700
In our TLDRs, outside of talking about our personal experiences, we also try and talk about any reports or any news that we see about specific events.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:10.440
The frustration that we're feeling and that a whole lot of other people are feeling as well is that the news covering this event has been extremely unreliable.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.720
It has been very unhelpful; It has often been hype sensationalist. And, many times, it has given out false reports.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.440
For example, when news of this first broke, we read reports that everybody on the boat was saved and we were very relieved.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.300
Turns out, that in fact, it was all false.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.980
Soon afterwards, the reports of text messages being sent from people trapped in the boat, sending them to their families and friends, and giving a lot of people false hope.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.780
Turns out, that all of these text messages were fabricated as well.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.420
There was also a false interview given by a girl that pretended to be one of the divers on the scene.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.420
And that was aired on a news network as well.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.100
Basically, the feeling that I'm having right now is that I'm very nervous about is what  I can say in this video.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.840
I don't want to speculate and I don't want to comment on a lot of the developments  that I've heard because I'm not sure if they are going to be true or not.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.800
Because, probably tomorrow, someone is going to say that everything that we read today is, in fact, false.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.120
I know that CNN did a terrible job of handling the Malaysian airlines flight.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.200
And, the news here in Korea is doing a pretty piss poor job as well.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.320
Which is why I'm so hesitant to state anything but the basic fact about what's happening here.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.520
The second feeling of frustration that a lot of people are having are with the captain of the ship.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:17.800
The major issue that a lot of people are having is that: when the ship began to capsize, the captain told everybody to stay put and to not evacuate the ship.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.300
And the sentiment that a lot of the people are feeling is that; if these people didn't stay put, and that if their captain actually ordered them to evacuate,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.220
They would have probably been alive right now.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.840
On top of that, not only did they not help the people get off the ship, but he was one of the people to get off as well.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.940
Now, I don't know every single detail about that, but to me, it seems exceptionally cowardly.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.160
Also supposedly, the accident itself was entirely preventable.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.280
As a lot of the conditions for sailing that day, were not up to standards

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.300
And the third feeling of frustration is sadness, and comes from both us and from what a lot of people have said it online.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.480
What can we do to help? Are there any charities we could support or is there anybody we can donate to?

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.360
I'd like to be support to some cause or some charity or donate to somebody, but I don't know what charity is the right one to give to.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.940
Another feeling of frustration is coming from a lot of the things that are bring written about this accident.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.900
I've read a few articles that are trying to say that this is indicative of South Korean culture as a whole

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.140
which is entirely unfair for anyone to think.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.100
The terrible actions of a few men does not represent the over 50 million people that are in Korea.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.220
No more than the videos that I do on YouTube represent all of Youtube as a whole either.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.640
This is a terribly unfortunate accident and the only people that should be judged are the people that caused the accident, not the not country or the culture altogether.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.220
So that's it for this week's TLDR.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.400
I wish that there were something that I could teach you apart from nihilism.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.400
I wish that there were something better that I could have shared with you.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.220
Don't trust everything that you read or see about this event.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:42.720
Because even though the news is supposed to tell you what's happening, in the spirit of getting hot breaking news, a lot of the times, they don't do a lot of fact checking.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.700
And they are going to post anything to get views rather than truth.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.880
And this isn't something unique to South Korea either.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.160
I'm sure there are a lot of examples of sh*tty news reporting in your country as well.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.600
I'm going to write a little more about this in our blog post. So, make sure you click on the link here if you want to read some more thoughts or if you want to engage in the conversations in the comments.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.100
Our deepest condolences, here, in the EYK studio go out to all the people affected by this.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.100
South Korean families and South Korean schools.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.460
To all the families, friends and schools that are affected by this tragedy.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.740
And, hopefully, we can all find a reason to smile again soon.
