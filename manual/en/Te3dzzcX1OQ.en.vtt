00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.730
 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.400
Well now when it comes to impression, that's
a whole new animal

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.230
because both the Grandmaster and the
stallion we're starting with an

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.030
original car.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.590
An impression started with just napkin
sketch

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.420
where I went to dinner with Ken Reister.
We were talking about building another car

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.710
for

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.690
Ken and he said he wanted to build like a 36 to 44

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.960
so I did several sketches and we picked on
this one where I

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.500
kinda picked a 34 style body with 36 fenders

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.620
mid-thirties European influences

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.750
and then we actually built a quarter
scale model,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.890
sectioned that, built a wooden buck. We built
the frame we build all the suspension

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.920
we actually hand shaped the entire body
and every single component on that car

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.950
is hand-built other than starting with
the

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.190
ls1 motor 700r4 transmission

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.700
and the center section from a Corvette
in the rear end. I used 34 Chevy gauges in

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.800
changing colors on them but every component
is handmade for that car.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.620
The best part of impression is the
fact that

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.760
we weren't having to work around
existing lines.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.670
I got to design what I wanted to build.
There is no place on that car

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.000
that you'll find a piece of sheet metal
or bracket

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.080
that is bolted to another surface. If
there was something that needed to be

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.390
bolted to a surface

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.680
that surface was sunken and that piece
was bolted in

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.840
radius to fit and every single line on
that car

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.990
inside outside underside everywhere

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.600
is treated like a door gap on a car.
There is nothing

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.250
that isn't flush with just a line through it. I
chose a color that was very muted I did

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.560
not want the color to be the statement
the car

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.350
I wanted the car to be the statement. The
other reason for this is it's

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.880
timeless. It's just a beautiful color and

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.320
when someone is going to spend this kind of
money on a car I don't want them looking at

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.930
the car five years from now saying

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.270
wow that color really dated the car, I
need to change it. And the other thing is

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.470
I also studied

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.599
Ken Reister's wife Leila. I looked at the
color of

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.919
clothing that she wore. I looked at the way
she decorated her house

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:16.099
and I knew that she would like this
color

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.120
I'm building it for Ken, but he's got a wife
and you gotta make the wife happy to and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.590
she absolutely loved the colors on this
car. I chose that real deep green

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.989
kind of an olive almost gray canvas top and we
used that color even in the seats

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.389
and I really tested Jim Griffin on that
one because

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:39.069
I want to use these little v8 logos and
out of the v8 logo comes a French

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.569
seam.

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.450
In front of the v8 logo is the same piece
of material but there's no seam in it

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.400
and when I asked him if he could bring a
French seam out of a piece of material

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.840
starting from a logo, he says oh I've
never seen that done because usually

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.120
you're cutting the materials sewing it
together and then

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.029
stitching on both sides of it. This is
something where we had to

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.359
cut the material, cut a v out of it be able to
wrap it

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.120
then sew it together put the v8 logo
and stitch around it

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.459
and it was a real test but we are able
to do it and there are seven pieces of that

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.069
example

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.549
through the car. You know I've never done
the research I don't know if

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.219
there's ever been another complete
concept car

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.590
that has won the river but would be nice
if this was the only one

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.590
 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.159
 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.650
