Hello! Welcome to Expert Village. My name
is Wayne Peterson and I'm the director of

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.330
the Important Bird Areas Program for the Massachusetts
Audubon Society. Today we're here at the Daniel

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.599
Webster Wildlife Sanctuary in Marshfield,
Massachusetts where we'll be talking about

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.369
bird identification and some of the equipment
and essential tools that are useful to get

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.659
one started in this incredibly interesting
pastime. One of the groups of birds that are

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:33.239
fairly easy to regularly pick out and recognize
as part of a group are the waterfowl. By this,

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.070
I mean birds like swans, geese, and ducks
of various species. These are birds that typically

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.989
are found either swimming in the water or
in some cases, like the Canada geese behind

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.120
me here, they'll regularly come out of the
water and graze on land. But in all cases,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.909
they're characterized by having predominantly
webbed feet as we saw in our little stuffed

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.710
bufflehead earlier in the segment. Also, they
typically feature, at least in the males,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.890
predominant color and patterns at certain
times of the year that can be very useful

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.979
to recognizing them. Both when they're swimming
in the water or when they're in flight. In

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.620
which case, the pattern is almost as important
as the color. And the location of dark and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.719
light areas on the head and on the body are
also very critical to their ID. In flight,

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:32.659
the wing pattern of many waterfowl is quite
distinctive. Lot of the ducks have a colored

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.990
iridescent patch on the trailing edge of the
wing called the speculum. In some cases, this

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.060
is blue or violent or green. Sometimes there
are white little markings that border the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.111
speculum area. In some other species, there
may be patches on the lead edge of the wing

00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:55.070
that are very distinctive. Some ducks like
scads have a wing stripe that runs out the

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.750
length of the wing. These would all be the
sorts of features that for ducks as they take

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.280
off or are seen in flight can be very useful.
On the water, then we can look for other patterns.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.110
For example, the mallard duck has a dark green
head with a very prominent white ring around

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.380
the neck. In the case of the Canada geese
behind me, it looks like somebody has pulled

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.090
a black stocking over their neck and then
given them a white chin strap. A very distinctive

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:30.420
combination of features that radiately distinguishes
Canada geese. In some of the other waterfowl,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.290
it's important to recognize that the males
and females look different. In geese, for

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.840
example, and in swans, the males and females
are essentially the same, but in many duck

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.570
species the females are often times considerably
less distinctive. Typically, being more brown

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.010
and modeled in their plumage. So in some cases,
you can determine the sex of a particular

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.080
female duck by the company that she's keeping,
because often times you'll see pairs of ducks

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.010
together and you can sort of deduce that the
female is the brown individual with the more

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.560
brightly colored male.
