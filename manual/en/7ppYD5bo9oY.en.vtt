00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:43.260
while you fuck if he is george bush is
upset that he's not getting enough

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.180
credit well why did he disagreed did
turn down imitation

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.170

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.769
at ground zero

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.439
but oh bombers claiming all the credit
and a lot of other people deserve it the

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.809
source added

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:01.749

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:04.589
road for you please

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:08.469
obama gave no credit whatsoever to the
intelligence infrastructure the bush

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:09.529
administration setup

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:12.899
that is being hailed from the left and
right as setting in motion the operation

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:14.190
i got ben laden

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.519
it rubbed a bush the wrong way

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.659
well frankly we know

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.009
that the torture regime that george bush
put in place

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:30.969
the only information we got was the fake
name of this car here

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.799
we also know that george bush

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.789
sometime in two thousand five right
around the time that

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:40.470
they were building this compound for
some of them live in pakistan

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.269
shut down the c_i_a_ unit

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.829
that for ten years up to that point

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.290
started by bill clinton

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.109
was looking for some of the blood

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.879
and in fact i also believe he said
something to think about i'm not that

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.549
concerned about him anymore won't think
about them

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.589
