00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.820
A: It was 20 below.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.910
I went to start my car and the battery was
dead.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.130
There's nothing worse than that.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.540
B: I had an important meeting with the CEO.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.420
I went to go start my car,
turned the key, and all I heard was, you know.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.610
I almost died.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.349
C: A dead car battery happens to the best
of us at the worst times.

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.109
Fortunately, a quick jump start can bring
a dead battery back to life.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.589
But,
it's important to do it the right way.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.579
To properly jump start your car, the first
thing you want to do is park the

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.710
working vehicle close to the one that needs
to be jumped, but don't let

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.920
them touch.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.289
Next, shut off the ignition on both cars.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.690
Be sure to turn off
your lights, radio, and anything else that

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.690
can drain power.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.800
To connect the jumper cables, connect the
red positive clamp to the dead

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.050
battery's positive post.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.160
You'll see a plus on the battery.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.390
Connect the
other red clamp to the good battery.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.949
Make sure the cables don't dangle into
either engine compartment, where they can

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.840
get tangled onto moving parts.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.350
Now, connect the black negative clamp to the
working vehicle's negative

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.370
battery terminal.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.020
Once set, connect the other negative cable
to any

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.970
unpainted metal surface on the engine of the
dead car.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.220
Do a final check to
make sure the cables are set and not near

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.950
any moving engine parts.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.200
Now, start the working car.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.290
Let it idle a few minutes to feed juice to
the

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.570
dead battery.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.290
When you think it's got enough charge, start
the dead vehicle

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.960
and let them idle together.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.710
Once the dead car is running smoothly,
disconnect the cables in reverse order.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.170
Be careful not to let the dangling
cables fall into the engine compartment or

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.550
touch each other.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.520
Finally, make sure you drive the revived vehicle
somewhere safe before

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.610
shutting it off.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.110
And, remember, always carry jumper cables.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.180
It will save
you and your battery the next time you get

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.340
stranded.
