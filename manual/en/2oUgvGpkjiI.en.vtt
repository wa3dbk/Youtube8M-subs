00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.020
Hey guys, this is Austin and today I’m here
with part two of my gaming PC

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.090
tutorial.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.540
Last time we did the prep work, installed
the CPU, heatsink and RAM

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.690
into the motherboard and got it all set up
inside the case.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.950
Now it’s time to
install the graphics card, here we’re using

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.780
a Radeon 7850.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.610
Included is a Molex
to six pin power adapter which we don’t

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.340
need for this build, a Crossfire
bridge, a quick start guide for installing

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.160
the card, a disc with some drivers and
software and finally the graphics card itself.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.440
Just like the motherboard you’ll
want to be careful with it and handle it by

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.110
the shroud and PCI bracket so set it
on the box before we get it installed in the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.110
case.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.910
Take a closer look and you’ll
see the two fans mounted onto the heatsink

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.370
but beyond that it’s a pretty
straightforward card.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.840
Just remove the plastic protectors over the
PCI

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.410
connector as well as your display outs and
it’s all ready.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.900
Come over to the case
and remove the thumbscrew holding the covers

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.070
in place and then pop them
out the back.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.250
Then remove the screw above it and pull out
the bracket so we

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.200
have room to install the graphics card.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.760
Bring the GPU inside and line it up with
the PCI connector on the motherboard then

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.860
press it down until it clicks into
place.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.820
Replace the bracket above the rear slots and
screw it into place.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.890
Now
take two more thumbscrews and secure the graphics

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.530
card in so that it isn’t
going anywhere.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.210
That’s it, the graphics card is installed!

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.630
Time to drop in the
hard drive, in this case a Western Digital

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.860
Caviar Blue.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.930
Come over to the
bottom drive cage and pull out one of the

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.400
drive rails.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.180
Just bend the plastic
back a bit and line the four metal pegs inside

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.570
the corresponding holes in the
hard drive.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.120
Then just slide the hard drive back into the
case until it clicks into

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.120
place, the Prodigy makes this incredibly easy.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.710
The power supply is up next.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.070
Included is a bit of paperwork on the warranty
and safety info, the power

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.890
cable, some electrical ties to tidy up our
cabling and finally the power supply

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.930
itself and all of the cables.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.230
First thing is to remove the four thumbscrews
holding the bracket in place.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.840
Now grab four more screws that came with the
case as we need to attach the bracket to the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.119
power supply.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.600
Line it up so that
each of the four screw holes are visible and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.490
then just like the motherboard
screw one corner in first followed by the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.170
opposite corner and finally the last
two screws to make sure it’s secure.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.920
Like always go back and tighten each
screw once you double check everything is

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.920
lined up.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.380
Now we need to feed
the cables into the chassis.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.250
First of all find a six pin connector and
bring it

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.750
through on the right side, this will be plugging
into the graphics card.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.960
Next
find the 8 pin CPU power cable and you should

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.700
be able to break it into a pair
of 4 pin connectors, pull that through the

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.700
left side.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.390
Now bring the remaining
cables through the hole on the left side so

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.349
we have room to mount the power
supply.

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.739
Pull the loose cables out of the way making
sure nothing is wedged

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.719
anywhere until it fits flush against the back
of the case.

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.889
Make sure the power
supply fan is pointing downward.

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.700
Just screw the four thumbscrews back into
the bracket and you’ve got the power supply

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.700
installed.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.980
Time to get everything
wired up.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.370
You should see cables with much thicker connectors,
these are

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.959
Molex and really aren’t going to be used
here except for connecting a fan.

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.639
Tuck these back in beside the power supply
to get them out of the way for

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:39.639
now.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.139
If you grab the side panel you’ll find all
of your front panel connectors

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.129
along with USB ports.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.950
First grab the large blue cable, this is for
USB 3.0 and

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.939
needs to be plugged into the motherboard with
all the rest.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.829
Find the light
blue connector to the right of the heatsink

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.950
and plug it in, thanks to a notch
it only goes in one way.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.970
The rest of the cables are a bit more tricky
so keep in

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.379
mind the little arrows.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.549
This means that side is positive which is
important to

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.230
pay attention to as we connect everything.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.669
First grab the cable labeled HD
Audio and connect it to the motherboard behind

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:07.859
the graphics card.

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.769
It might be
easier to remove the graphics card if you

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:10.769
can’t get at it.

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.439
Now find the manual
for the motherboard and look up the pin out

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.540
labeled system panel connector.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.310
This is the easiest way to see where the rest
of the cables connect but be

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.331
mindful of plugging the positive and negative
ends correctly or else you’ll

00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:23.170
have to go and fix them later.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.989
Behind the RAM is where you’ll find the
connectors, I won’t go over each and every

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.760
one but they just slide into place
like the audio.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.419
Take your time and make sure each is inserted
correctly, it’ll

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.400
save you a headache later if your power button
isn’t connected for example.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.719
At this point you should have everything from
the side panel connected, it is

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.879
a bit tedious but no big deal really.

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.829
Now find the lead we ran from your power
supply labeled PCI-E which should be a six

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.010
pin connector.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.469
Plug it into the back
of the graphics card, it should click once

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:48.510
it’s inserted.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.750
Next up find the large 20
+4 pin cable from your power supply, this

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.230
goes to the motherboard.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.879
Plug this
into the light blue connector behind your

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.159
RAM and again, it will click once it’s
properly connected.

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.900
Next up find the cable with the long flat
ends, these are

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.199
SATA which are what you’ll use to power
hard drives and optical drives.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.829
Thanks to the little notch these will only
go in one way.

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.030
Attach one to the
hard drive, it doesn’t click so make sure

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.209
you’ve got it inserted fully.

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.459
This is the
same process if you wanted to use an optical

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.559
drive in your build except in a
five and a quarter inch bay.

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:18.680
Grab the CPU power connector we ran through
earlier and if you haven’t yet break it

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.350
apart as this motherboard only needs
four pins instead of the full eight.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.449
Click it into place and you’ve got the CPU
powered and ready to go.

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.069
Now grab the fan header that’s wrapped around
the processor heatsink and plug it into the

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.530
motherboard beside the CPU
power connector.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.440
Make sure the wires are out of the way of
the fan.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.560
You’ll
also see a three pin connector attached to

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.849
the rear 120mm fan, this connects
to the header right beside the SATA ports.

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.689
Move to the back of the case to
find the second 3 pin for the rear fan.

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.520
Here you’ll need a 3 pin to Molex
adapter which I’ve got linked in the full

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.770
build guide.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.439
Pull a Molex lead out
from beside the power supply and attach the

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:53.159
adapter, then tuck it back so it’s
out of the way.

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.030
Then attach the fan to the adapter and you’re
done here.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.720
Find
a SATA cable that came with the motherboard,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.949
we just need to attach the
hard drive now.

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.120
Like the SATA power connectors these are notched
so they’re

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.370
easy to install.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.069
Plug your hard drive or SSD into one of the
white SATA ports

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.070
and then the other end into the hard drive.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.970
Both ends should click into place.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.620
Now that everything is cabled up it’s a
good time to double check it’s all

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.759
properly connected and ready to go.

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.509
Come back to the power supply and plug
it into the wall and flip the switch on.

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.159
Connect your build to a monitor and
keyboard and then reach around to the power

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:22.530
button and give it a shot.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.100
You
should see all of the fans in the build begin

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.300
to spin and after a minute it will
post and give you information about your parts

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.349
on screen.

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.889
If not no worries,
just power the system off and double check

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.340
everything is connected.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.240
The last
step is cable management which is basically

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.449
just tidying up your wiring with
the electrical ties.

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.360
I won’t go step by step here but basically
just group cables

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.830
together and tuck them out of the way.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.370
Once you’re done close the side
panels up.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.300
Congratulations, you’ve build a computer!

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.509
If you’re interested in
more check out part three where I go over

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:51.000
setting up the BIOS, installing
Windows and doing some performance tests to

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.280
see how well it performs.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.130
Don’t forget to hit up that Like button
and I will catch you guys next time!
