00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's incredible to see what all of these characters can do...

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
...when they're pushed to the very edge.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In Mrs.Weasley's case...

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
...one of her children is about to be taken away from her and...

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
...you see Mrs.Weasley in this incredible fight with Helena Bonham Carter.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's a great moment in the book, a real crowd-pleasing moment.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Who's next?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It was a great pairing, neither that we could have anticipated that when we casted them initially.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They were dueling when the camera wasn't on, they were having fun playing it out and having a laugh.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It was lovely working with Helena, she's such fun.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Right from the day when we came in I said "You're gonna get it, you are.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You're gonna get it in a couple of weeks".

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's great that she killes me, I feel very honoured that she kills me.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Bellatrix doesn't expect to be so good so she's caught off guard.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It's good to see two girls fight.They worked very hard for it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We've done that in the afternoon.We rehearsed the moves for a few days...

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
...and we showed it to them and they put some their own stuff in there.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I think Mrs.Weasley's a little bit rustier, and you know she's not as fit.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And so her style probably isn't fluid and dramatic as Bellatrix's style.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
When we are doing of course nothing's coming out of the end. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So it's hard to kind of react.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
That's why we had to have the first assistant shouting: "Block.One, two".

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Three, four.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
You gotta make sure that what you do it with real venom. You just have to go for it.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You have to just play.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I've seen actors just explore and play. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And in it you'll find something that is really interesting.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
That's a sword fight isn't it?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And I just say: "That's not good, that's great, that's really interesting.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
That's really wierd and inapropriate."

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
But that's fantastic.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And they really enjoyed that.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It was really quite something to watch.Quite scary almost.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Because you could see the tenacity in each of their faces.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Helena and Julia are both two of the nicest actress in the whole industry.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And as soon as they yell "action" you think they're going to kill each other

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Yeah..it was really great because you wouldn't expect to see this motherly character to have this agression.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I love the fact that she sais 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Not my daugther, you bitch.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I loved it.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And you would expect Bellatrix to be the most powerful, the most fit...

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
...because she doesn't care.You know, that gives you a certain strenght.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Bellatrix doesn't really get this family.She just feels, "What are you on about?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You've got a spare.You've got other children.Why are you so hurt?"

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You know, because she's got no conception of love

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
You know, she loves inflicting pain, and that's her only joy.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
This shows what a powerful witch Molly Weasley really is.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And so I could take on anyone now.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I think, really, I should have defeated Voldemort.But anyway...

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I left that to others. HA,ha...
