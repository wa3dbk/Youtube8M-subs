Argument Essay, a la Shmoop.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.440
Is Bieber’s hair more awesome than Cousin It’s?

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.160
Should weekends be extended to four days
instead of the measly two we currently have?

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.400
Are dogs better than cats?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.240
No matter how you answered any of these questions,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.140
you’re already in the thick of an argument.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.420
And hopefully you didn’t tick off 
any cats in the process. 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.920
They are unforgiving creatures.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.730
In writing, arguing has nothing to do with
the decibel level of your voice…

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.040
An argument essay persuades your 
readers to make a change.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.730
This change could be a mental change
—a different way of thinking—

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.150
or an actual change in a policy or practice.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.360
It’s wide open.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.000
Here’s a classic example:

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.480
“I’m sixteen years old and I just 
got my driver’s license. 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.920
Therefore, I’m clearly more than capable 
of driving your new Porsche Turbo.”

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.020
Try saying that to one of your parents and he  
or she will probably say, "Yeah...right."

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.980
But give them evidence and support your claim.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.540
Show them how you can drive in reverse 
in a straight line for one hundred feet...

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.120
and parallel park a Hummer into a 
parking spot meant for motorcycles...

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.180
and you just might succeed in changing their mind.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.140
So when you're presenting an argument your reader must see things from your point of view

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.800
you can't let them brush it off because 
they don't agree with you right off the bat.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.860
It's on you to persuade them by 
providing support for your arguments

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.340
and effectively shooting down any
potential counter argument

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.020
All through it keep your tone civil and polite...

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.020
or your reader will toss aside your paper.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.120
So how is this puppy organized?

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.220
You've got your intro, a thesis
that states your overall opinion,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.820
the body of the essay will have your supporting points, 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.000
and finally your conclusion in which
you wrap things up neatly.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.060
If that seems like a bit much don't panic.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.540
Shmoop's writing guide has help 
and more info on these terms.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.060
The argument essay is the most important kind of academic paper because

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.380
most essays have an element of argumentation,
even if it isn’t immediately obvious.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.960
After all, why are you writing anything at
all if it isn’t to convince someone of something?

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.709
The personal statement that you will be writing
to get into college?

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.649
It’s an argument that …you’re awesome.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.800
That long Facebook status you just posted 
about how Taken 2 is the best movie of all time?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.160
That's right. 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.120
You're trying to persuade your reader that
the oft-derided film is, in fact, misunderstood.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.780
If you’re going to turn anyone to
your side in this instance, though…

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.440
… let’s hope you have… 
a very particular set of skills.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.970
See what we mean?

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.200
Now, go on—argue. 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.680
We can see you’re chomping at the bit.
