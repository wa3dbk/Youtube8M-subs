Jaystepher here today with a tutorial on a Spiro staircase

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.260
Jaystepher here today with a tutorial on a Spiro staircase

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.700
that is fully customizable and will work perfect with any

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.040
that is fully customizable and will work perfect with any

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.040
Lego castle, office building, or modern house.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.309
The first thing we're going to start with is assembling the stairs for a staircase.

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.510
So take a 2 by 4 plate

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.550
and a 2 by 2 rotating plate,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.580
place it along the edge here,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:56.199
and we're going fill this little void here by using a 1 by 2 plate.

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.100
Next, just going to use a 2 by 2 tile,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.640
place it here.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.710
And finally, a 1 by 2.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.680
Now I'm going to make another step. The same way as before, but this time,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.220
Now I'm going to make another step. The same way as before, but this time,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.410
I'm just going to come in here and I'm going to alternate my tiles

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.800
just to make it look more like brick.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.800
Let's start assembling steps.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.490
We're going to need to make eight of these in total.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.580
This is is going to be a very fun project. Very easy.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.729
So, we'll just keep continuing along here.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.729
 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.840
As long as I keep the alternating.... You can do this anyway you want.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.280
You can put any color you want on here. This is just for demonstration purposes.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.280
You can see everything's pretty alternating.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.740
Some always ask me, "Why do I work fast?"

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.200
Oh because I've done this several times.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.200
Okay, this is our last step.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.230
There is our eight steps.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.159
Now I want to make a top step for

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.459
to connect to a second floor.

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.739
Instead of using a rotating plate,

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.489
I'm going to use just a 2 by 2 black plate, stick it here.

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.500
A 1 by 2. And to keep everything alternating ....

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.500
There's our top step.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.280
There's two different types of spiral staircases:

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.310
counterclockwise in clockwise.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.250
I'm going to build mine counterclockwise.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.730
So I'm gonna come in here and take one of the steps,

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.879
I'm just going to place it on my plate.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.530
It doesn't matter where it goes. So we have something that's on the ...

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.310
to set our first step.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.310
Now take our step. We're going to flip it over and I'm going to stick a 1 by 1 stud right here.

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:16.049
Now take our step. We're going to flip it over and I'm going to stick a 1 by 1 stud right here.

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.209
We're going to need to make several of these.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.630
Start flipping these over.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:34.630
This is going to be for our counterclockwise. Clockwise can be built the same way.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.919
Now for the last two steps,

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.139
I'm going to place the stud right here at this corner here

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:08.030
to keep everything evenly lined up. I'll show you here in a second.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.620
There we have it. So now let's assemble our Spiro staircase.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.729
Just going to take the steps, we're just going to start setting them on these rotating plates.

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:17.229
Just going to take the steps, we're just going to start setting them on these rotating plates.

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.900
Just going to take the steps, we're just going to start setting them on these rotating plates.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.020
Sometimes you have to play around with it to get it lined up.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.190
Sometimes you have to play around with it to get it lined up.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.000
But as you can see, the studs here prevent the steps from folding under.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Just keep adding on layers.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:47.060
Very easy process.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.490
There we have it,

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.350
a complete spiral staircase. Now this thing will spread apart like this,

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.750
but if you look on top, it's pretty ... it's straight.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:28.280
So when we come in and attach our floor, you just attach it up to here.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.560
And you can see the construction here is very simple

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.220
And you can see the construction here is very simple

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.400
just by using revolving plates, and 2 by 4 plates.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.770
This will be great in any castle, modern Lego home, and office building.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.470
So I hope this tutorial helps you guys out!

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.050
Thank you for watching!
