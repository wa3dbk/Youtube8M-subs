00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.090
Today, on our 2012 Chevrolet Traverse, we&amp;#39;ll
be installing the Westin Sure-Grip running

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:12.630
boards, part number 27-6620 in conjunction
with the custom installation kit, part number

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.960
27-1835.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.130
To begin our install, we&amp;#39;ll first go ahead
and identify our attachment points.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.829
For each attachment point we&amp;#39;ll be using
pre-drilled holes in the frame or subframe

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:25.829
of the vehicle.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:43.360
First, we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and lay out our
hardware and identify the four brackets.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.199
We&amp;#39;ll have two on each side, one on the
front and one on the rear.

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.600
For each side both forward brackets are similar.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.309
Once we identify the correct bracket, we&amp;#39;ll
go ahead and mark them with a yellow paint

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.309
stick.

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.499
The rear brackets for each side, although
they&amp;#39;ll mount the same, the configurations

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:03.930
are slightly different.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.290
Starting with the driver&amp;#39;s side forward
bracket, to secure it to the vehicle, we&amp;#39;ll

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:19.710
be installing two T-bolts into the frame.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.700
Once we have the T-bolts in place, we&amp;#39;ll
go ahead and put the bracket up against the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:02:18.740
bottom of the frame and then 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:39.980
secure it with a flat washer, split lock washer
and nut.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:04:18.530
Next, we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and install the hardware
for the rear bracket.
