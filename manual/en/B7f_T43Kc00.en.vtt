00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.400
The cold won’t let up

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.520
This freezing night

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.320
I shiver all alone

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.500
There’s no more wood to burn

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.880
My temperature keeps falling

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.200
I can’t move anymore

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.820
A black cat starved to death

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.420
On the side of the road

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.260
I pass with a glance

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.380
Waiting for dawn

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.420
“I won’t end up like you,”

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.200
I scorn,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.560
Waiting for dawn

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.460
When was the last time I ate?

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.400
I wouldn’t have any idea

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.200
“I’m sure your bones would burn well…”

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.960
Shut up!

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.440
Just let me sleep.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.880
Just leave me alone.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.260
Even now as I cough up blood

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.700
Drawing near to death

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.700
I act as if I’m fine

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.840
Searching for tomorrow

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.820
In my heart I cry,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.760
“I won’t end up like you!”

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.880
Stilling my breath

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.840
Of course,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.360
Everyone lives their life like this

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.820
Everyone knowing there’s

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.300
No worth in doing so

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.820
That black cat starved to death

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.200
On the side of the road

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.140
I pick up and hold in my arms

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.240
Waiting for the dawn

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.400
“I won’t end up like you,”

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.300
I smile,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.400
Searching for tomorrow

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.560
“I won’t end up like you,”

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.420
I whisper softly,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.500
Gently carressing it.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.380
“I won’t end up like you,”

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.480
Holding it close,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.200
Waiting for the morning sun.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.720
Even now,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:22.400
It isn’t cold anymore is it?
