00:00:05.108 --> 00:00:11.099
Hello again! We're back with GrandCanyon.com's "10 Most 
 Frequently Asked Questions About the Grand Canyon..."

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.743
..."and Questions You SHOULD Be Asking About the Grand Canyon." 
 We hope you've enjoyed what you've seen so far...

00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:18.901
...and that you'll stick with us for each and every video of this series.

00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:24.752
Yesterday, we addressed the second most frequently asked Grand Canyon 
 vacation question, which is about Grand Canyon hotels...

00:00:24.752 --> 00:00:28.328
...and why booking a room inside the park 
 isn't as easy as it sounds. 

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:33.530
Today we're moving on to Question #3: How can 
 I book a Grand Canyon Rafting Trip?

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.870
Grand Canyon rafting is the ultimate adventure and 
 the trip of a lifetime, for sure!

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.768
Unfortunately, it's something most of us won't get the 
 opportunity to do, at least ... not literally!

00:00:44.768 --> 00:00:49.876
Rafting trips that occur within the actual borders of Grand 
 Canyon National Park have a few things in common:

00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:54.335
1. They're all white water trips and the Grand Canyon 
 has some of the biggest rapids in the world!

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:59.397
2. They're all multi-day trips, requiring a time commitment 
 of anywhere from 4 to 20 days.

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:02.322
And 3. they tend to be booked a year or more in advance. 

00:01:02.322 --> 00:01:07.067
Most of you may not be looking for that kind of trip 
 anyway. You're looking for something you can do in one day...

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:14.072
...and many of you don't want to do any rapid at all. All that 
 is possible, just not in the Grand Canyon... at least, not literally!

00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:19.505
So the better way to phrase this question is 
 "how can my family experience the Colorado River?"

00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:24.242
The Colorado River of the Grand Canyon is long: close to 300 miles long!

00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:29.258
It is also "bookended" by two dams on both the 
 Western and Eastern sides of the Grand Canyon: 

00:01:29.258 --> 00:01:34.180
the Hoover Dam, near Las Vegas; and the Glen Canyon Dam near Page, Arizona.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:41.560
These dams provide vehicular access points to the Colorado River, from which thousands 
 of families annually enjoy what are known as "float trips." 

00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:50.110
As the name suggests, a "float trip" is a rafting trip that does not 
 traverse any rapids. Occurring on calm, gentle stretches of the Colorado River...

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:55.450
...and requiring no strenuous activity. These trips can be 
 taken by children as young as 4.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.120
Our most popular float trip is the Colorado River Day Float Trip.

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:06.830
One of Arizona's most popular family tours, this is a wonderful, 
 relaxing day full of beautiful scenery and educational adventure...

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:14.260
...for people of almost all ages. This 12-hour tour starts bright and early 
 in the morning with pickup at your hotel or other designated location.

00:02:14.258 --> 00:02:19.830
Then a motorcoach ride along the East Rim Drive of 
 the Grand Canyon and through the Navajo Indian Reservation.

00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:26.290
Along the way, you'll view the rugged escarpments of the Echo 
 Cliffs and Chinle rock formations unique to the Painted Desert.

00:02:26.286 --> 00:02:31.300
Finally you arrive in Page, Arizona, where you're transported to 
 the base of the Glen Canyon Dam. 

00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:35.850
After meeting your captain and boarding your raft at 
 the base of this 700' (235m) structure...

00:02:35.852 --> 00:02:43.470
...you'll embark on an unforgettable journey down 15 miles of the Colorado River 
 through one of the last remaining intact sections of Glen Canyon.

00:02:43.794 --> 00:02:50.530
On this trip you can kick back and relax, marveling at sandstone 
 canyon walls as they rise 1,000' (333m) before your very eyes.

00:02:50.527 --> 00:02:56.700
Midway through your trip, you'll stop for a short walk to view 
 a panel of ancient petroglyphs inscribed into the sandstone walls...

00:02:56.704 --> 00:03:03.340
...by Native Americans hundreds of years ago. Afterwards you'll stop to enjoy 
 lunch on the very bank of this fabled American river.

00:03:03.345 --> 00:03:09.520
On warm summer days, you'll even have the opportunity to refresh 
 yourself with a splash in the cool, clear Colorado River!

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:14.960
Finally, you'll dock at Lees Ferry, site of one of 
 the earliest Anglo-American settlements on the Colorado River.

00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:18.620
Here, your motorcoach is waiting to transport you back to Grand Canyon South Rim.

00:03:18.623 --> 00:03:24.480
If time permits, you'll make a brief stop at the historic 
 Cameron Trading Post to shop for authentic Native crafts...

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:26.010
...or other souvenirs of your visit. 

00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:31.530
The most popular upgrade option to the Colorado River 
 Float Trip is called the Canyon River Adventure.

00:03:31.534 --> 00:03:38.920
This has become GrandCanyon.com's #1 selling tour over the years. Instead 
 of the motorcoach ride from Grand Canyon to Page...

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:45.560
...you take a scenic sunrise flight in a fixed-wing airplane. This 
 beautiful aerial tour shows you not only Grand Canyon...

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:50.390
...but Marble Canyon, Lees Ferry, the Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell!

00:03:50.388 --> 00:03:57.030
Upon landing at the Page Municipal Airport, you'll take a short break 
 for a light breakfast, then board 4-wheel drive vehicles... 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:01.440
...for a tour of one of Northern Arizona's "little" surprises: Antelope Canyon!

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:07.570
Antelope Canyon is an example of a formation known 
 as a "slot canyon," a surreal geological oddity...

00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:14.820
...formed by flooding waters and blowing sand. After enjoying Antelope Canyon, you'll 
 then be transported to the base of Glen Canyon Dam...

00:04:14.816 --> 00:04:21.320
...where you'll take the exact same float trip described in the previous 
 tour, then ride the motorcoach back to the Grand Canyon.

00:04:21.317 --> 00:04:27.630
Planning on going to Page Arizona anyway? Consider the 
 Colorado River Discovery. A mere half-day in length...

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:33.710
...this trip begins in downtown Page Arizona, where you check in 
 at the Colorado River Discovery office and ride a motorcoach...

00:04:33.707 --> 00:04:39.100
...to the base of the Glen Canyon Dam. Your trip 
 covers the exact same stretch of the Colorado River...

00:04:39.104 --> 00:04:46.260
...as in the trips described previously, including the petroglyph walk. The 
 Colorado River Discovery is approximately 5 hours in length.

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:53.310
The cost of your trip includes water and lemonade. Food is not provided, 
 but you are welcome to bring snacks or a picnic lunch.

00:04:53.314 --> 00:04:55.820
But please, no ice chests or alcoholic beverages. 

00:04:55.822 --> 00:05:02.790
The Colorado River Day Float Trip, the Canyon River Adventure, and 
 Colorado River Discovery Tours are offered March - October.

00:05:02.788 --> 00:05:08.040
They take place weather permitting, and operation may be 
 contingent on a certain number of passengers traveling.

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:13.140
For more information, or to reserve the Colorado River 
 Day Float Trip, the Canyon River Adventure...

00:05:13.144 --> 00:05:17.280
...or the Colorado River Discovery Trip from Page, visit GrandCanyon.com...

00:05:17.277 --> 00:05:23.920
...and scroll down to the paragraphs on tours from Grand Canyon South 
 Rim or Page Arizona and click on the appropriate link. 

00:05:23.918 --> 00:05:30.420
Visitors to Las Vegas may also consider the Black 
 Canyon Adventure. Originating at Boulder City's Hacienda Resort...

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.460
...the Black Canyon Adventure begins with transportation to the base of Hoover Dam. 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.610
After meeting your river captain and boarding your pontoon rafts, you'll begin 
 your scenic float down the Colorado River to Willow Beach Marina.

00:05:41.612 --> 00:05:48.950
Just 12 miles downstream. Along the way, you'll encounter unique 
 geological features, such as hot springs and waterfalls.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:53.590
You might even be fortunate enough to see a herd 
 of bighorn sheep who reside in the canyon.

00:05:53.593 --> 00:06:00.190
The price of your tour includes lunch, and you even get to keep 
 your Black Canyon Adventures lunch tote as a souvenir of your trip!

00:06:00.188 --> 00:06:07.430
Transportation from the Las Vegas Strip or Downtown is available for an 
 additional fee. Otherwise, trip length from the Hacienda and back...

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:13.610
...is approximately 6.5 hours. Other package tours from the 
 Las Vegas area that we've previously addressed...

00:06:13.609 --> 00:06:19.280
...such as the Las Vegas Grand Voyager Tour and the Rim 
 to River Expedition, do include a brief float trip...

00:06:19.275 --> 00:06:25.540
...along with round-trip helicopter transport to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. 
 But the float trip component of these tours is very short...

00:06:25.544 --> 00:06:30.510
...maybe 20 or 30 minutes. For more information on these, 
 go back to the first video in the series...

00:06:30.513 --> 00:06:37.620
...or visit GrandCanyon.com, scroll down to the paragraph on tours from 
 Las Vegas Nevada and click on the appropriate tour link.

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:44.260
If you're still up for some white water, yet only have one day 
 to spare, such a trip is offered by Hualapai River Runners...

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:51.970
...out of Peach Springs Arizona. Originating at the Hualapai Lodge,  this 
 42-mile trip down the Colorado River on Hualapai Indian Tribal Lands...

00:06:51.968 --> 00:06:59.490
...features 9 sets of Class II and III rapids. Access to the river at 
 the beginning of the trip is by bus down the Diamond Creek Road.

00:06:59.492 --> 00:07:05.760
Takeout at the end of the trip is usually done by helicopter; but in 
 the event of inclement weather, you will be motored to South Cove...

00:07:05.761 --> 00:07:12.820
...on Lake Mead and driven back to Peach Springs by motorcoach. 
  Trip length depending on take-out method is 10-12 hours.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.280
Also, since the Hualapai Lodge is fairly remote and 
 the trip starts early in the morning...

00:07:17.278 --> 00:07:21.500
...it's best if you stay in the Peach Springs area, 
 or somewhere close by, the night before the trip.

00:07:21.504 --> 00:07:29.350
If you're interested in the Black Canyon Adventure, the 1-Day White Water 
 Trip, or a multi-day Grand Canyon White Water raft trip...

00:07:29.353 --> 00:07:35.020
...keep watching for further instructions on how to receive this 
 information in our complete Grand Canyon Travel Planner. 

00:07:35.158 --> 00:07:40.220
Thank you so much for watching. We hope this 
 video has given you the information you need...

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.400
...to book a safe and memorable Colorado River rafting trip for your family.

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:50.760
Watch your e-mail for tomorrow's video, where we'll be talking about how 
 to get from Las Vegas to Grand Canyon South Rim...

00:07:50.761 --> 00:07:56.470
...without driving; and why you may just want to drive 
 anyway. Til tomorrow, make it a "Grand" day!

00:07:56.473 --> 00:07:58.380
