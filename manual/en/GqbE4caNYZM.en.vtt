00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Welcome once again to TheFNDC.com's YouTube channel.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And, the holidays

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
are coming up, so we're going to be making

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
an Apple Pie Cocktail.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This is the traditional version of the drink.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I scoured the Internet

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
for different recipes;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
this is the one I settled on

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
as being the most like actual apple pie.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And, anyway...let's commence.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You've got a shaker full of ice, 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and to that we will add

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
an ounce and a half

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
of apple cider, not apple juice.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
[ pours apple cider ]

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Half an ounce of rum,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
[ pours spiced rum ]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
uh...My recipe is different from some of the other versions.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I add a half ounce of apple flavored vodka.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The important ingredient here is 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
half an ounce of sweet vermouth.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Not dry, like you would put in a martini.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It has to be sweet vermouth.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Very important.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
[ adds sweet vermouth ]

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
A splash of brandy.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
[ adds brandy to Apple Pie mixed drink ]

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
About three dashes of grenadine.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
[ adds grenadine for color ]

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
That'll give it a little color, too.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And one teaspoon of lemon juice.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
[ adds lemon juice to cocktail ]

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And that will help with the flavor.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Shake that up.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
[ shakes Apple Pie Cocktail ]

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I pour that out, and it looks pretty crisp.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It looks good.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We add a little garnish [ apple wedge ].

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Just like so. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Let's see how it tastes.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Mmm. That tastes good. Good, good, good, good.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
OK. TheFNDC.com -

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We have drink recipes.
