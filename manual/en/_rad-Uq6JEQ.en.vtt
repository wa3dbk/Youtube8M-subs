Gingham Chambray Sheeting 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.689
For over one hundred years, the medieval city 
of Guimaraes in Portugal 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.859
has been associated with textiles.

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:17.379
In 1948, our company, Lameirinho Textiles, 
was founded here by the Coelho Lima family, 

00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:22.100
and is today, among Portugal's oldest textile companies, 
and most modern suppliers.

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:27.100
A strong family tradition along with constant 
modernization 

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:33.100
has elevated the company to a permanent position
on both a national and international level.

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.100
Although we have replaced many of our traditional 
manual processes,  

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.100
we place a lot of importance on the human touch.

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.379
After all, weaving yarn dyes is an art, and
a passion that is shared among all the work here.

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.379
Many of our technicians have been with us 
for over thirty years,

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.379
passing on their expertise to the younger 
generations.

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.379
Our modern equipment enables us to 
optimize production

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.379
while maintaining a consistently high 
standard with minimal defects.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.379
Gingham and chambray sheeting is 
made from dyed long-stable cotton yarns.

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:13.379
We only use the finest selection of cotton.

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.379
Our range of colors are prepared in the lab,

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:20.379
After dyeing and drying, the first quality 
control is performed for color accuracy,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.100
and the yarn is ready for weaving. This is the most 
beautiful part of the process,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.100
and is where gingham and chambray really come to life.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.100
After an additional quality control, 
the fabric is off to finishing.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.100
For gingham and chambray, finishing operations 
include singeing, 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.100
where excess loose yarns are burned form the 
surface 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.100
which help to enhance durability.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.100
Our self-rising machine, guarantees minimal 
shrinkage and a 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.100
finish that is extremely soft and 
smooth to the touch.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.100
After the finishing phase is complete, 
the fabric is sent to be cut and sewn.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.100
Great care is taken over this final step, 
before our sheets are ready to be packaged.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.100
We know Pottery Barn Kids is very selective 
in its partnerships,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.100
and we believe that our gingham and 
chambray bedding 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.800
lives up to their high standards.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.800
The lush softness and unique quality of 
our sheets will bring comfort and  sweet dreams to your kids.
