00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:24.770
Well, well.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.770
Remember this game?

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.770
I do.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.980
I remember my roommate buying this thing in
college.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.289
He was psyched out of his mind over the thought
of an awesome shooter with an awesome Wild

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:35.289
West theme.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.589
This game certainly delivered on the latter,
but is Gun the shooter as awesome as Gun the

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:41.589
concept?

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.999
Well, yes and no.

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:55.329
Released in 2005, which is already eight years
ago, holy crap, what happened...Gun comes

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.500
from Neversoft, the same developer that did
the Tony Hawk games.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.260
In fact, you look at their resume, and it’s
basically three things.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.920
A bunch of Tony Hawk games, then Gun, then
a bunch of Guitar Hero games.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.409
This is one of the only games they’ve ever
done that was...well, something original and

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.409
different.

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.150
Sadly, it was also the last one they ever
did.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.840
Then, back to the mega-franchises.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.049
Bang, bang!

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.789
And it’s a shame, too.

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.310
Because with Gun, Neversoft really got to
flex their creative muscle a bit.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.200
Playing as a hunter from the Old West, you
soon find out the guy you thought was your

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.350
father isn’t.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.259
Thing is...he tells you minutes before he’s
killed.

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.450
So clearly, revenge is step two.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:48.860
And it’s a dish best served with a side
of hot lead.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.759
The story is actually really good.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.960
It’s interesting, it’s presented well...I
mean, for better or worse, video games have

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.979
gotten even more cinematic since 2005.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.320
So Gun can feel a bit dated at times, but
it’s still very well done.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.719
The settings, the characters...Gun really
nails that Old West feel.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.349
It’s dusty, it’s hot and it’s dangerous.

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.090
And that’s just Jenny.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.720
But the gameplay, on the other hand...that’s
a different story.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.790
Don’t get me wrong.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.400
It’s perfectly fine.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.050
But...story and presentation are the strengths
of Gun.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.310
This is game you play for that, and when you’re
done, that’s what you remember.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.500
The gameplay works, but it’s not quite as
A-list as the game’s cast and concepts.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.439
Fortunately, though, Gun is still a really
solid third-person shooter.

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.400
And one of the game’s central mechanics
is Quick Draw.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.910
Basically, you fill up this meter by pulling
off cool kills—headshots, combos, things

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.910
like that.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.930
And with that meter, you can go into a kind
of slow-motion bullet time sequence.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.500
You flick between targets with the analog
stick, you fire off rounds...it’s really

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.459
cool, and it’s a defining element of Gun.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.250
Even though it’s...kind of been done to
death since.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.150
There are a lot of things about Gun that have
been done to death.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.590
Even the game’s structure—that kind of
open-world design with optional side missions—is

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.549
even less unique now than just eight years
ago.

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.150
Shooting isn’t terribly precise...the game
is definitely a bit short.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.270
The thing is...yes, Gun has its shortcomings.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.220
But its gameplay is just good enough to let
its character shine.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:35.299
And character is where Gun is right on target.
