00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:06.964
There are some things
I've been wondering for a while...

00:00:07.696 --> 00:00:11.894
...the Swedes are a quiet nation,
at least, that's how I see them...

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:16.079
...they live in a country that's almost
permanently covered in 4 meters of snow...

00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:19.077
...so why do they build convertibles?

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.158
Last year the C70 was the market leader
in its segment in the Netherlands.

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:27.821
Which segment?
Premium four-seater convertibles.

00:00:28.015 --> 00:00:30.838
Yada yada, it's a full four-seater.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.310
If I look behind me it doesn't
look like there's very much space...

00:00:34.312 --> 00:00:37.497
...but in theory you could fit four people in here.

00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:39.519
This is the facelifted model.

00:00:39.648 --> 00:00:41.679
I can't say I've driven the old version...

00:00:41.687 --> 00:00:44.154
...so I'm not going to say that
it drives very differently.

00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:48.275
Volvo themselves also don't say that,
they've primarily changed its looks.

00:00:48.597 --> 00:00:53.039
The looks are changed to fit into
Volvo's new design language.

00:00:53.194 --> 00:00:56.949
On the one hand the facelift was very necessary,
and on the other hand it wasn't at all.

00:00:57.047 --> 00:01:00.100
Even with the old design it was market leader...

00:01:00.142 --> 00:01:02.993
...and I also thought
the old design was quite alright.

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:07.515
It was very Volvo-like,
very much in line with the S40 and the V50.

00:01:07.597 --> 00:01:09.651
But those cars have also been facelifted...

00:01:09.758 --> 00:01:12.742
...so Volvo also had to do something with the C70.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.266
And if you're winning in your segment,
you need to keep it up...

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.184
...the competition doesn't stop either.

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:21.704
Is this car worth the effort?

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:25.191
Yes, I think so.
It's quite spacious...

00:01:25.442 --> 00:01:29.804
...it's got a retractable hardtop roof, so there's
no luggage space when you open it...

00:01:29.912 --> 00:01:32.125
...you can only get some
flat suitcases in there.

00:01:32.294 --> 00:01:35.125
But it is winterproof.

00:01:35.313 --> 00:01:39.108
And when it's closed
its lines are quite reasonable.

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:42.159
The boot lid is a bit too wide and too flat...

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.084
...but that also makes it look quite cool.

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:47.594
And it also pronounces its
Volvo-shoulders a bit better.

00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:50.977
The handling is also typically Volvo.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.590
Sometimes it's quite hard to grasp...

00:01:53.628 --> 00:01:57.256
...but it isn't very sharp or very sporty.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.730
It'll never be very playful.

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:01.899
it is too tame for that...

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:07.872
...it also doesn't fit Volvo's character
to build a car that bites back once in a while.

00:02:08.088 --> 00:02:10.235
Safety is very important.

00:02:14.257 --> 00:02:17.030
We're driving the T5,
the biggest engine available.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.157
230 hp, a lot of newtonmeters.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.300
It's a 5-cylinder turbo engine.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.601
It sounds very nice.
It's a diesel-like engine...

00:02:26.614 --> 00:02:29.279
...in the way that it's best
to drive it on its torque.

00:02:29.412 --> 00:02:34.390
It makes its revs but you don't
get a very big reward for that.

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:37.105
0-62, just under 8 seconds...

00:02:37.193 --> 00:02:39.548
...a top speed of 146 mph.

00:02:39.583 --> 00:02:43.526
Those numbers don't blow us away,
certainly not for the top of the range engine.

00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:46.994
In practice the car feels quick enough...

00:02:47.053 --> 00:02:49.629
...that's because of the torque,
that's pretty much always useable.

00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:52.600
One disadvantage is that
if you throw it around...

00:02:52.645 --> 00:02:55.313
...you feel some reactions
in the steering wheel.

00:02:55.377 --> 00:02:58.891
Especially when driving over bumps
you feel the chassis...

00:02:58.942 --> 00:03:02.596
...and the front-drivetrain working.

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:06.152
If you really want to drive it quickly,
you'd better close the roof...

00:03:06.158 --> 00:03:10.219
...because Volvo claims that
that makes the chassis 15% stiffer.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.991
We couldn't measure it,
we didn't bring the equipment...

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.654
...but I believe them, it feels a bit tighter.

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:25.026
You'll hate the roof sometimes.

00:03:25.148 --> 00:03:27.345
We were at the tollgate...

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.421
...you're stationary there for quite a while,
and you roll forwards slowly...

00:03:30.488 --> 00:03:34.909
...and then you want to close
or open the roof.

00:03:34.976 --> 00:03:37.598
That takes quite a while, about 30 seconds.

00:03:37.638 --> 00:03:41.804
But it's a big roof; three parts and
it's a four-seater, so it takes a while.

00:03:41.863 --> 00:03:44.321
But you'll have to keep your foot on the brake...

00:03:44.436 --> 00:03:47.800
...keep the button pressed and
absolutely not drive...

00:03:47.881 --> 00:03:50.668
...otherwise things'll start beeping
to tell you it's not okay.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:57.395
That's a pity. You'd want to start cruising
and open the roof while driving off...

00:03:57.432 --> 00:04:03.558
...it's a lot more practical, and in other cars
it is possible. Why isn't it in this one.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.310
Will the C70 again be market leader...

00:04:06.408 --> 00:04:10.562
...in 2010 an 2011,
and perform just as well as in 2009?

00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:14.079
You can doubt that because
the competition also moves forward...

00:04:14.198 --> 00:04:17.271
...and maybe there will be other models.

00:04:17.565 --> 00:04:20.315
But this is a nice convertible...

00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:24.750
...and Volvo has nice deals
to tempt possible buyers.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.868
There's an Intro Edition
with xenon and satnav...

00:04:27.882 --> 00:04:29.847
...and audio and nice wheels.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.869
That saves you 10 grand on this car,
that's quite nice.

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:41.065
I could tell you a lot more,
but the weather is nice for driving...

00:04:41.151 --> 00:04:43.100
...so here it is again.

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:46.052
Bye!
