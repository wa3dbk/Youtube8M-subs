00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.550
hello namaste

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.040
salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.100
session of Be Fit, Be Cool, the campaign by

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.470
AAPI, American Association of

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.290
Physicians of Indian origin, dear friends

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.200
today I'm going to show you another rice

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.980
preparation but this pineapple rice of

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.870
course we're going to use some nuts but

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.970
absolutely no fat very healthy

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.309
usually you can enjoy these kind of

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.600
rice along with nice roast meats but

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.510
at least this is going to be fat free so

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.000
far this you know i'm going to take some

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.440
nuts

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.360
I've got cashew nut and almonds both of

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.920
these I've roasted in the microwave

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.440
all you need to do is you know put it at

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.290
30 seconds and switch it on and do it

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.269
couple of times then you will get slight

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.519
coloring on these nuts and they'll taste

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.680
good in this we're going to add chopped

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.710
onion and bell peppers to make it

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.890
colorful I've got the green bell pepper

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.610
I've got some red bell pepper and yellow

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.789
bell pepper all this goes well with

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.950
pineapple and that kind of flavoring

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.590
also add some green chillies to spice it

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.439
up and without adding a drop of oil we're

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.170
going to slightly cook them on a medium

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.439
flame till the onions are slightly

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.780
transparent they're sizzling you can hear

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.630
this noise of sizzling without a drop

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.630
of fat now in this we're going to add

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.579
salt and also the pineapple ok just

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.280
make sure the pineapple is nice sweet

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.359
tender and just add to this you know

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.600
pineapple on the direct flame is a very

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.249
common thing especially on the grills

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:00.990
you know they put on the pineapple on

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.140
the hot griddle get it slightly burned

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.509
that gives a very nice aroma so we're going

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.910
to get such kind of aroma in this also

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.710
but you're not going to cook it so much

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.430
just saute for few seconds and in this

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.180
we're going to add mustard paste and the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.940
pineapple and the coconut are like the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.760
great friends you know their combination

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.319
you get pina colada or any kind of

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.299
flavors and so we're going to add some

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.360
grated coconut also in this and quickly

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.510
mix all of this as a combination now

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.500

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.120
I'm telling you this is super super

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.189

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.000
and in this add some mint and freshly

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.920
