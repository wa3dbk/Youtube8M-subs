Hi, everybody! My name is Phil

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.500
and today we'll examine this
Schecter Stiletto Extreme-4 bass guitar,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.000
Diamond series.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The instrument's body is made of
mahogany with flamed maple top,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the neck is made of maple with
the rosewood fretboard,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
24 frets, the neck is mounted
with 6 bolts.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This bass guitar has two Schecter
Diamond Bass humbuckers,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
an active dual-band equalizer,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a master volume knob and
a pickup balance knob.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.000
Let's listen to the each pickup
starting from the neck.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Now let's play with an overdrive.
