00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.160
-Hi, Fabio.
-Hello.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.400
-Everything's good?
-Perfect!

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.240
-Where to?
-To Roland Garros, please.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.280
If a player should inspire your game,
who would it be and why?

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.960
Federer, for sure.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.960
He's one of the best. To watch, he's the best one.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.840
Next question: the worst moment you have spent
on a tennis court was…

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.360
Maybe when I broke some rackets
or when I got a warning.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.920
So it's a habit
for you to break rackets?

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.280
I know it's bad but sometimes…

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.680
So you're not allowed to break rackets anymore.
I'll check it out, man!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880
-I'll follow you.
-I promise.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.920
If you could play a match against any player
of the history, who would it be?

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.160
John McEnroe, maybe.
I'd be a crazy match!

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.400
I saw him yesterday in the locker room.
We talked a few words.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.880
-Maybe we'll practice tomorrow.
-Oh yeah?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.760
Maybe. If I see him, I'll ask him
cause tomorrow I play a lefty,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.800
Klizan or Nadal, and McEnroe is lefty,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.920
so it's good to practice with a lefty one.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.160
But if you two guys get on the court,
how many rackets are you going to break?

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.800
I don't know…

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.240
Choose a thing in the funny box.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.600
You tried that before…

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.680
Long time ago
when I was maybe 10!

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.840
-OK, come on.
-Let's try.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.720
I don't remember.
My God!

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.280
Was good!

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.480
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.320
-Ciao!
-Good luck!
