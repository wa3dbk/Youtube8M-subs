00:00:00.264 --> 00:00:01.660
-Hi.
I'm Daron Nefcy.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.660
I work in animation,
I do storyboards,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.330
and sometimes I like to paint.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.132
I chose the theme "Wonder"

00:00:10.132 --> 00:00:13.528
probably because I'm always
in wonder of the world

00:00:13.528 --> 00:00:16.429
and of nature and of everything.

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:18.099
You know,
I definitely have a lot

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:19.495
of moments where it's like,
"Oh, you know,

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:22.198
I can't believe I'm here,"
and "I can't believe..."

00:00:22.198 --> 00:00:24.429
You know, like,
"Look at this tree.

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.660
It's such an amazing tree."
I do it all the time.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.726
Like, I just get really excited
about everything.

00:00:29.726 --> 00:00:31.099
I like to take a lot of walks

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.528
and look at trees and plants,
you know.

00:00:33.528 --> 00:00:36.660
Even when you're in the city,
I really like seeing some nature

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.594
and being able to just
kind of look at that

00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:40.693
and experience that.

00:00:40.693 --> 00:00:42.660
I think of a lot of ideas
that way.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.528
You know, you're outside
and you're feeling good, and --

00:00:45.528 --> 00:00:47.363
I spend a lot of time
in a cubicle, too.

00:00:47.363 --> 00:00:48.495
And especially now that

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:51.000
it's getting to be darker out
earlier,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I get kind of, you know, sad.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.198
You leave work and it's already
dark out, you know.

00:00:55.198 --> 00:00:57.495
I'd like to be outside a little
bit every day if I could,

00:00:57.495 --> 00:00:58.726
and it doesn't always work out.

00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:01.165
Today I started
with a thumbnail,

00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:04.297
that I did in Photoshop
on my Cintiq.

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:08.132
I have a Cintiq at home
that I can actually draw on.

00:01:08.132 --> 00:01:10.396
So, I did a little sketch,

00:01:10.396 --> 00:01:12.165
just to kind of figure out
the colors and stuff.

00:01:12.165 --> 00:01:15.132
It's actually changed quite
a bit since the sketch, too.

00:01:15.132 --> 00:01:16.330
But I started with that.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.594
So, then I could just
kind of dive right into it.

00:01:18.594 --> 00:01:22.297
And I did the sky first,
you know, as a backdrop,

00:01:22.297 --> 00:01:25.693
and the clouds, and, you know,
our foreground here,

00:01:25.693 --> 00:01:27.462
and then I went
and rendered out the mountains.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:28.561
That was really nice,

00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:30.528
'cause I could paint her
right over all of them.

00:01:30.528 --> 00:01:32.462
What I really love
about acrylics

00:01:32.462 --> 00:01:34.462
is if you let a layer dry,

00:01:34.462 --> 00:01:36.726
you can quickly sketch something
out on top of that.

00:01:36.726 --> 00:01:39.528
As I wanted to paint a girl

00:01:39.528 --> 00:01:42.660
kind of looking at
the landscape around her

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.330
and, you know, kind of being
in awe of everything,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.396
you know, and being in
this kind of fanciful landscape.

00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:52.396
It could be an alien planet,

00:01:52.396 --> 00:01:56.462
maybe, or another dimension,
or something like that.

00:01:56.462 --> 00:01:58.264
But I was thinking about that
a little bit.

00:01:58.264 --> 00:01:59.429
I mean,
I know it's sort of subtle,

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.429
but you got these little lakes
in here.

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.561
So maybe it could be
the world between worlds.

00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:07.528
It's kind of cool.

00:02:07.528 --> 00:02:10.033
She's got magic orbs.
That's always cool.

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:12.561
[ Laughs ]
I would like a magic orb.

00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:13.627
She has three eyes

00:02:13.627 --> 00:02:16.132
because I like painting
three eyes.

00:02:16.132 --> 00:02:17.528
But I do like to do
a lot of eyeballs

00:02:17.528 --> 00:02:20.693
in paintings, and a lot of --
There's none in this one,

00:02:20.693 --> 00:02:23.693
but usually I'll have some kind
of little character

00:02:23.693 --> 00:02:26.363
sort of watching
whatever the main focus is.

00:02:26.363 --> 00:02:27.759
You know, little animals
or a little something.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.396
And somebody told me

00:02:29.396 --> 00:02:31.561
that all my paintings were
sort of voyeuristic once,

00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:36.000
which, you know,
I guess that could be a thing.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.528
She's definitely
a human character,

00:02:37.528 --> 00:02:40.660
but maybe there's
some animal elements to her.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.528
Like, her nose
is not entirely human,

00:02:43.528 --> 00:02:46.330
and she's got the antlers.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.132
I don't think she has a name.

00:02:48.132 --> 00:02:50.330
I don't know why,
but "Lucy" popped into my head

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.462
for some reason.
