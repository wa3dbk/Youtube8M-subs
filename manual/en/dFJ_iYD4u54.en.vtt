On behalf of expertvillage.com my name is
Neal Jones with A Perfect Fit Alterations

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:19.670
and we are at 102 Main Street, Burleson, Texas
and our phone number is 817-447-3522. Continuing

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:27.390
with our threading we have to set the machine
up after we’ve threaded it and we need to

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.660
decide exactly the kind of sewing in the kind
of operation that we’re going to do with

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.100
the machine. The machine will do several different
things but the machine is much more complicated

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.359
than a regular sewing machine so in order
to guide us to be able to do these particular

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:55.480
things we have some cards here, now this particular
machine has cards that show us what we need

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:03.230
to do. Now if this were another a more expensive
model or a different manufacturer it may have

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.020
a computer screen up here that might have
this information on it but in this particular

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.770
case we’ve got this information on cards,
now this card is actually the card for if

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.899
you look at the top it shows a picture of
the thread that we’re trying to do. Now

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.619
we would look at the picture and say that
is what we want and we would have give us

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:34.320
the title up here and it says 3 thread, now
in order to have the machine do 3 thread serging

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.890
we then will follow the rules here. We have
the stitch length would be at 2.5 this would

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.880
be our stitch length the SL and we would turn
that here to 2.5 which is where its probably

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.970
set right now, the differential feed which
I’ll explain in just a moment DF would be

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.180
set on one which is where it is set right
here. Then we come down here and we would

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.719
actually remove one of the needles, now we
have left and right and then corresponding

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:10.510
on our needle head we have left and right
marked on here, so we would take our left

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:17.090
needle, would loosen this screw and we would
remove the needle that we didn’t need, so

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.819
we would have just the right hand needle,
now we would then remove the blue thread which

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.330
the adjuster is right here and here’s the
thread so we would completely remove that

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.530
thread and then we would then have the red,
the yellow and the green. Now continuing across

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.190
we would adjust the adjustment for our cutting
knife which the adjustment would be right

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.830
here and it has numbers this one’s 3.7 and
then there are numbers corresponding with

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.330
a little dot right here that would give us
the adjustment for our cutting head. This

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.989
next little window shows us that we need the
upper looper which if you can see the picture

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.160
here it looks just like this part right here
you can recognize it from the picture, we

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:15.530
need the upper looper with its thread in it
and also there is a thread device here that

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:23.330
will give us a thread width, that device there
which it looks like this is to be in place

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.159
which is what it’s telling us right here.
Now that would be what we would call a three

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:37.090
thread setup, now before we move on to the
fourth thread setup let me just explain that

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:46.580
we have the differential feed, the differential
feed is a device that covers our feed dogs,

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.570
now our feed dogs are setup so that we have
front and rear feed dogs and we would then

00:03:52.570 --> 00:04:00.319
use this device to control the speed of the
front and the rear feed dogs. If the fabric

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:07.579
that we’re sewing with requires the different
speed would be to stop the fabric puckering

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:15.560
or to make the fabric pucker if we were after
a certain look or making a certain garment,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.540
so the feed dogs are divided into front and
rear and this control here which is our differential

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:29.600
feed will make the dogs operate and the feed
operate at different speeds which will give

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.580
us that different affect.
