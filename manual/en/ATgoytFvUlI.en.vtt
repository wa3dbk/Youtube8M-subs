Hey everyone!

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.190
It's Goku, and I'm back to answer some of
your questions and comments!

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.759
Thank you all for the thousands of responses
we recieved!

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.599
I read each and every one of them, and I wish
I could answer them all.

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:23.880
Here's one from 1018ironman, who asks: Dear
Goku, what's your favorite food?

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.369
Gee, I'd have to say whatever's on my plate
in front of me at the time!

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.270
shadowXtras asks: What do senzu beans taste
like?

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.149
They sorta tingle when you crunch them, and
they taste kinda like a combination of edamame

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.399
and mountain dew.

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.850
wono30 asks Are you always hungry?

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.579
When I'm not busy trying to save the world,
yes...

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.160
I am always hungry!

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.219
I AM ALWAYS HUNGRY!

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.219
sonicisback wants to know: Goku, what is the
meaning of life?

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.250
HUH!

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.379
That's a tricky one.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.780
I'd have to say, to be the best you can be.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.870
To love your friends and family, avoid getting
a heart virus, and to eat lots and lots of

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.970
food.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.340
Benjamin Nolan asks: hey goku, are you still
scared of needles?

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.330
... NEXT QUESTION, PLEASE.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.520
Adrian S. Sese from Facebook asks: Goku, why
does shenron is always grumpy?

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.479
Probably because we keep waking him up from
his sleep to grant wishes!

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.240
A dragon that powerful needs his beauty rest!

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.610
JhayKhayCee2 commented: How do you keep your
hair so... uh... spiky?

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:35.110
Well, it's a little known fact that when Saiyans
perspire, we sweat hair gel. at LEAST THAT'S

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.780
WHAT vEGETA TOLD ME.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.619
Vegeta: YOU'RE AN IDIOT!

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.549
NationOfOranges696 says: Hey Goku, do you
like PewDiePie?

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:43.549
Sure!

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.979
I like ANY kind of pie!

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.619
Except for the CHART kind!

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.740
NiceGuyJesus asks: Hi Goku, is GT canon?

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.340
(pause) I'm sorry, I don't understand the
question.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.719
and Mi Pe from Facebook wants to know: Goku,
why does it hurt when I pee?

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.149
aaahhh...

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.369
Well, that's all the time we have for now!

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.739
But keep those questions and comments coming!

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.410
Goku, OUT!
