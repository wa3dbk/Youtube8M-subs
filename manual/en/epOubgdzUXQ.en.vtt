00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.290
Hi! today we're going to show you how to
make a charcoal slurry. A charcoal slurry

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.230
is simply charcoal and water mixed
together and that's it, nothing more. So

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.710
we're going to start with the very most
basic way. Just take a glass, just fill it

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.900
half full of water. Take your charcoal
powder, today we're going to be using the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.359
detox 1600, United States Pharmacopoeia
certified. Take the lid off very

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.710
carefully. It is important that you want
to take the lid off very slowly.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.850
Especially the first time, when you are
using your charcoal as the air can be

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.700
compressed underneath and kind of puff
out. So best place to do this is over the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.649
sink when you're doing your charcoal the
very first time. Okay. I'm just going to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.379
show you how much I actually take in a
day as a daily maintenance and I take

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.699
just about that just an teaspoon nice
and full and then I'm just going to put

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.869
that into the glass and just stir it
very carefully. Put your lid back onto

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.820
your charcoal powder. You don't want it
to spill, of course and then also you

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.570
don't want the charcoal to be absorbing
any odors in the home. Okay there you go.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:33.479
Just stir it up and that is it and we
are just going to ask Daniel our

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.549
manager, some of you have me talked to
him on the phone. Very knowledgeable

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:49.259
about charcoal and I asked him to drink
this for us. Thank you. There you go and

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.329
then usually drink it all the way back
and then we'll add a little bit more

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.880
water to it. Okay
just add just a little bit more water.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:11.220
Get the rest of your charcoal, stir it up
again and drink that and that is all

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.630
there is to it. That's your charcoal
Slurry. Very simple. Okay.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.860
Well now this is another way we can do
with charcoal slurry and this one is

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.030
actually Daniels favorite way. Also a
good friend of mine, Julie this is how

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.660
she does it.
Just take a mason jar. We're just using a

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.160
half quart here. Just again fill it with
it half a cup of water or less. However

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:45.490
much you want to use. Open up your
charcoal and this time I'm going to use

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:57.640
quite as much. Just about like that. Put it
in. My cap back on and now I'm going to

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.730
put the metal ring or excuse me, the
metal lid and the metal ring. I know that

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.440
they have these little plastic caps that
are really nice for storing food in the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.860
mason jars in your fridge. Don't use it!
It'll shake okay but when you open it up

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.990
the water just drips all over, it's quite
a mess. So just use the metal lid and the

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.490
metal rings they work the best. Put it on
nice and tight and then just shake it. There you go.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:40.560
Just a few good shakes and that should
be it. Okay open it up. Take the lid off.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.050
Now
I really don't want to get my lips dirty.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:51.210
So I'm just going to use a char... excuse
me use a straw...

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.180
and that's it. So there that's what we
call putting a cap on it.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.950
Okay next way that you can make a
charcoal slurry and this is what I call

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.930
the lazy girls way and this is my
favorite way of doing it. It's the least

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.549
messy, I feel, but of course you do have
the waste of a paper, little paper cup

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.780
and you just fill it half full of the
charcoal, first you just fill the

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.889
cup half full of water.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:46.800
Open up your charcoal and this is about
what I take on a daily basis. Just to put my

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:56.680
lid back on right away and then you just
stir it very carefully and you do have

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.600
to be very careful when doing this. You
just can't stir like you have a nice big

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.870
glass or anything. But you get really
pretty good at it and just turn your

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:18.640
spoon around just keep stirring and I
won't get it as nice as the cap glass or

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.250
stirring it because I don't have as much
room and I can't be as vigorous with the

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.320
spoon, but for me it really doesn't
matter I just am trying to avoid the

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.900
mess of charcoal and what I will
actually do as soon as I'm done stirring

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:45.400
it. I'm going to lick the spoon off and
so I won't have to really wash it with

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:54.220
one of my good dish rags. So I'll just
do this and then I just lick it off. Okay

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:01.410
get it really nice and clean and then I
just drink it back....

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.670
and that's it. I can add more water to
get the last bit of the charcoal which I

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:21.090
usually do and now my mouth and my teeth
are all full of charcoal. This would be a

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.110
very good time to brush your teeth with
charcoal. Which we will show you in

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.670
another video and that's it for now. We
have showed you how to make it the

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:35.010
charcoal slurry with just a regular
glass, with a mason jar where you cap it or

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:43.610
the Little Dixie cup. Thank you for
