00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:23.310
Krugerfarms.com Guide recommended gear.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:36.350
I haven't had my bait in the water for thirty
seconds yet.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.550
I bet ya it wasn't ten feet down.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.840
We started trolling and I got something with
some shoulders on it.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.539
Lots of people wonder where are the big pike
go in the summer, they leave those shallow

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.969
weedy bays and come out here on the rocks
where all the bait are.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.470
Not a giant but that's a pretty nice fish.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.089
That's a good start.

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.020
Were using this Lowrance here as part of our
deal here today too.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.780
This color sonor for doing this is so key.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.880
Look at this I'm coming up on my waypoint
number sixty-six, I'm a little bit on the

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.210
north side of it but I'm touching the end
of it.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.150
Sixty-six is a hump and here it comes.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.280
The other neat thing on this Lowrance unit
is I can see my speed right here also.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.049
Were staying at about four and a half, were
between four four and a half and that's where

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.070
were getting big pike fired up.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.650
Ya know a lot of people think you need to
have real specialized equipment like planner

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.600
boards and lead core but trolling you don't,
I'm just using my bass flipping stick with

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.609
and x30 on it and braided line and trolling
at about four miles per hour, really fast.

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:54.609
There's a fish!

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:55.700
This is cool.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:06.810
This is all the gear you need its easy its
simple and its fun.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:16.350
Ya know catching pike in the summer is a snap
you just find the basin of the lake get your

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.560
flipping stick get one of these big Rapala
Xrap thirties and start trolling fast and

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.530
you will find these things or they'll find
you.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.700
That was a lot of fun.
