Hey guys, this is Austin and today I’m here
with my latest browser test

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.670
comparing Chrome 17, Firefox 11, Opera 11.61
and Safari 5.1.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.009
For this test I’ve changed my method by
adding a very popular request:

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.820
a Mac. All tests were run on both a Core i7
desktop as well as a Core i5

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.119
MacBook Air. This isn’t useful for comparing
OS X vs Windows scores but

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.460
it will help you choose which is the best
browser for your OS.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.789
To start with we have the V8 Benchmark which
measures Javascript performance

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.180
for sites such as Gmail. On Windows Chrome
dominates as always with Firefox

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.020
and Opera behind. Over on OS X Chrome still
wins out however Safari does much

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.260
better here, not only beating the other two
browsers but also being better

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.740
than Safari on Windows. Not bad considering
the rest of the browsers are

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.730
roughly half as fast on the MacBook Air. Next
we have one of my favorite overall

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.650
benchmarks, Peacekeeper, which has been redesigned
since my last browser test.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.420
On Windows Chrome wins out over Opera which
typically takes this test and over

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.800
on OS X Chrome continues to win out over both
Safari and Opera. As Peacekeeper

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.430
not only tests speed but also compatibility
with various web standards winning

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.330
here means a lot. Continuing on we have the
Particle Acceleration test which

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.410
focuses on how well each browser takes advantage
of hardware acceleration. For

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.370
Windows Firefox 11 gets a perfect 60 frames
per second with Chrome also getting

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.010
a respectable score. On OS X it flips as Safari
is the one with the perfect score

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.560
with the other three browsers nowhere close.
As you can see this is another

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.180
example of just how much better Safari is
on Mac compared to Windows. Next up we have

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.680
the HTML5 Test. This has been a staple of
my browser tests for quite a while and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.340
it simply measures how well each browser adheres
to the latest web standards.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.670
Chrome ekes out a victory here however all
four browsers clear the test with a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.090
score of over 300 which gets two big thumbs
up from me. Lastly we have memory usage.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.729
Here I load up both of the browsers with five
tabs consisting of popular sites such

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.780
as Hulu. On Windows both Firefox and Safari
did very well with Opera not too far off

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.170
and Chrome being the clear loser. On OS X
I had some issues with the consistency of

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.900
my results for both Firefox and Chrome but
impressively Safari uses up just over 100MB

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.140
of RAM, making it the best browser for memory
usage I’ve ever tested.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.860
With two different OSes there are two different
stories here. On Windows Chrome and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.510
Firefox remain my top picks. Chrome is still
the fastest browser speed wise however

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.920
Firefox has better hardware acceleration and
tends to take up less memory which is

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.030
important on PCs with less power. On OS X
Chrome remains great but Safari is a very

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.690
strong choice with close to Chrome levels
of performance combined with excellent

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.570
memory usage and hardware acceleration. If
