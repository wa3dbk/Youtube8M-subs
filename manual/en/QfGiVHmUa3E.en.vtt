00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.330
K its Aaron the whole and here's
something you need to know about the

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.569
OtterBox preserver iphone 5s case

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.950
for watching this video head P speaker
is incredibly muted

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:15.059
this is a test voice message

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.320
Real Usage. Real Reviews. Mobile reviews - eh.ca

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.310
 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.820
now this is a follow up video for the
earpiece speaker feel that we had for

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.539
this Otterbox Preserver iPhone protective case

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.349
as well as an update to the score for
the OtterBox preserver

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.010
if you haven't seen either I'll we've
got the annotations phone somewhere on

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.630
the screen

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.809
will be in the description section as
well I do encourage you to watch this

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:39.280
first

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.559
if you have to give you some background
information about what I'm gonna be

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:43.710
talking about its

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.780
in the next few minutes I have to give
props to OtterBox customer service we

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.590
put a call in so them a bunch of thought
into the lot was wrong

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.250
this new Otterbox waterproof iPhone case came within two days which
is really impressive given that

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.250
it doesn't anything that comes the us in
Canada

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.469
takes more than two days and so to get
this replacement case in that short

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:01.309
amount of time

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.629
that is really awesome that's gotta be
props to OtterBox

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.350
ok just so impressed by that note the
new tough iPhone case which is

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.180
we marked it with the sticker with
Ashley Kepner the stickers are so that

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.130
we have a good sense of

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.310
which was all the new the fatal flaw
that we describe in a review

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.000
which was the unit cell come from the
headpiece speaker is gone

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.159
but don't get your expectations up too
high because the sound

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.830
though not muted has this weird echo
effect so

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.049
let me show you so I got my iPhone 5s
here

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.430
got the same voice message I wanna play
and record it through my mic

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.860
same way as a the first video and then
I'm going to do with the case I'm

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.390
just to give you guys a sensor what's
different this is a test always

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.869
message see how much the OtterBox

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.020
River the am coming from

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.880
your keys speaker from the iPhone 5s I'm
gonna install

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.000
this waterproof iPhone 5S case the newer one into it and I'm
gonna play back

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.560
the same message go

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.040
much ok cummick

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.709
the am coming from

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.250
your key speaker from the iPhone 5s so
as you can tell

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.500
there is a bit a Aquidneck we were kinda
this vibration at the end of every

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.370
single word that comes out of my mouth

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.720
in that voicemail now the outputs from

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.150
the earpiece speaker through the
OtterBox preserver that you just heard I

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.230
think that's kinda

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.290
baseline for all the tough iPhone cases several other
viewers have left comments saying that

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.670
that's what they're OtterBox kinda
sounds like and so I'm guessing this was

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.480
no different

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.160
so with the Otterbox preserver iPhone case you can
now take calls fairly

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.370
easily but it doesn't sound as good as
you know I make an iPhone which

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.879
can expected given that this is a
recognized waterproof iPhone case

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.209
now look at the school we really doing
this case in terms of

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.760
the handling of the iPhone inside the
case with the improvement to the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.810
earpiece speaker

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.459
entire score goes up to 4.2 is out of 5
up

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.330
from 4.1 90 that is a minimal increase
but we raid against

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.360
everything and so this Otterbox Preserver waterproof iPhone case performs
very well in all other categories except

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.870
for the hell alone and now it does a
little bit better

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.590
all in all this is a really good
recognize waterproof iPhone 5S case that is touch

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.879
it. compatible

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.519
now have in Singapore you there's
annotations for its I'm so we're on the
