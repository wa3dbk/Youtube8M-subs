00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:07.867
The 9.0 update brought a lot of important and interesting changes.

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:13.000
A new game mode was added, graphics was improved, and several maps were reworked.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.267
We’ll give you all the details in this review.

00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:24.267
The new game mode—Historical Battle—was introduced in the 9.0 update.

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:29.533
Now, every player can participate in reconstructions of some famous World War II battles.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:35.033
The main features of this game mode are that players can only use those vehicles that fought in the real battles,

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:39.933
in their original setups, and the team compositions are tailored to match those historical events.

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:43.833
Watch a special video to learn more about the new game mode.

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.167
Graphics were also improved.

00:00:48.267 --> 00:00:50.900
Now, everything looks even more beautiful.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.600
Metal, paint, and rocks look more natural.

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:58.233
The detail level on certain vehicle models was improved.

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:01.100
Now, you’ll be able to see scratches, fractures, scuffs,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.633
and new items on the vehicle hulls.

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:07.367
Take some time to examine the wheels, weld joints, tracks,

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:10.200
armor plates, shovels, and other details.

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:16.500
Most importantly, you can look inside the gun barrel at the beginning of the battle now.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.433
Different effects were also improved.

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:22.467
Now, shots from guns of different calibers and types look more realistic.

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:26.300
You can also easily see the difference between an armor-piercing shell

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.400
and a high-explosive shell when they hit the ground now.

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:38.100
Another new feature was added in 9.0 that should increase FPS rate.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.200
It’s called dynamic resolution.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.467
During battle, you can change the value of dynamic resolution

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:46.033
by pressing SHIFT and “plus” or “minus”,

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.600
or you can change it in the graphics settings menu.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.467
Lowering graphics quality will significantly increase your FPS rate.

00:01:56.167 --> 00:01:59.200
The following maps were reworked in the 9.0 update:

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.300
Serene Coast, Pearl River, Malinovka, and Severogorsk.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.533
On the Serene Coast map, a peninsula in lines 8 and 9 was widened,

00:02:07.633 --> 00:02:09.333
giving more room to maneuver.

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:13.667
In sector K6, bushes were thinned to counter-balance the advantage of the defense

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:15.300
when playing from the south base.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.500
The hill in sector F1 was moved to sector D1.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.033
Earlier, this hill gave an advantage when playing from the south base.

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:26.867
On the Pearl River map, base locations and the spawn points were changed slightly.

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:29.833
New paths leading to the gorge were added.

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:33.400
Now, action will also take place in the central part of the map,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.933
which is, in fact, another gorge.

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:41.033
The town was lengthened closer to the north base and widened in its central part.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.067
Now, you can move through the town while maintaining continuous cover.

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:49.400
The detour road changed very slightly—most changes were visual.

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:54.100
All these changes will bring more opportunities and diversity into battles.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.667
Players will have a whole new experience when playing on this map.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.567
Malinovka was transformed as well.

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:03.800
The hill underwent significant changes.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.767
Now it has two levels.

00:03:05.867 --> 00:03:08.233
Also, additional cover was added.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:10.233
There’s now a new hollow near the swamp.

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:12.933
This position can provide cover from enemy fire.

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:17.367
We also added numerous other changes that should improve map balance.

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:20.733
Major changes were also made to the Severogorsk map.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:24.267
Bases and spawn points were moved to the central part of the map.

00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:27.767
The hill in lines 2 and 3 was significantly changed.

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:30.600
Now, there’s only one spot that allows the opportunity

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.367
to fire at other parts of the map.

00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:35.100
It’s located right in the center of the flank.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.833
Taking this position won’t be an easy task to do.

00:03:37.933 --> 00:03:41.633
But in some situations, this position could provide a crucial advantage.

00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:44.200
The hill in the 9 line has disappeared.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.300
This area has been completely reworked,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.000
and should be the site of positional combat.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.267
Thanks to these changes, Severogorsk will no longer be a map

00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:55.367
for base camping and long hill-to-hill shootouts.

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:59.500
There are more opportunities for active, close-range combat now.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.100
All these changes are aimed at improving map balance,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.100
so that both teams are in equal conditions.

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:11.167
Game physics was also improved.

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:15.433
Now, a tank turret comes off if ammo rack explodes.

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:20.033
The force of the explosion depends both on the amount and type of ammunition on board.

00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:23.067
The detached turret can be moved or used as cover.

00:04:23.167 --> 00:04:26.967
It can also cause damage to another vehicle it falls down on it.

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:29.067
The behavior of wheels was improved.

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:33.000
Now, each of them interacts with the surface quite realistically.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.067
The behavior of the suspension is much more natural.

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:40.233
However, we will continue to work on these aspects of game physics.

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:43.133
In the options menu, you can turn on a lens effect

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:46.167
that activates when switching to Sniper Mode.

00:04:46.267 --> 00:04:51.233
Also, new Standard and Premium Garages await players in this update.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.067
We’ve told you about the most important changes in the 9.0 update.

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:59.567
You can find the full list of changes in the update on our official website.

00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:03.967
And don’t forget that 9.0 will be the starting point for future improvements.

00:05:04.067 --> 00:05:07.333
Watch “Developer Diaries” episodes to find out more about it.

00:05:07.433 --> 00:05:08.367
That’s all for now.

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:10.467
Good luck on the battlefield!
