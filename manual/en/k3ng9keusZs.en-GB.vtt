00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.350
Male Voice: The games industry stands out
from other sectors in a few

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.120
different ways. I'm sure a lot of sectors
will say that their staff are

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.840
passionate and very focused on what they do.
But I found that in video

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.110
games, people really embody that. Also, as
an industry, it allows you to

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.680
add your own flavor to the content. Really
have a creative edge that I

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.560
found you maybe don't get in other industries.
Things have changed quite

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.770
rapidly in this sector, especially over the
last year or so. We've seen

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.970
quite a split with this sort of high-end AAA
console and computer

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.180
development side, almost straddling the films
industry with actors such as

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.870
Ellen Page, Liam Neeson, Samuel L Jackson,
not only lending their voice

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.980
talents to games, but even theirphysical acting
abilities through motion

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.730
capture. At the other end, we're seeing a
huge growth within the mobile

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.120
division.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.920
Mobile and social games are a huge growth
market for industry. Of the app

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.470
store, over 800,000 apps in whole under a
quarter of games, however, those

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.320
games account for 80% of the revenue from
the app store. The most popular

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.390
rolls we have at the moment are mobile developers,
so for iOS and Android,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.659
and also games designers as well. I guess
the first advice is make sure

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.700
you're passionate about the industry. It's
not an industry for someone who

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.130
isn't extremely passionate about games. On
top of that, what's really

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.680
going to set you apart from other applicants
is your knowledge. Not only

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.930
being knowledgeable about what it is you do
and the role that you're

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.870
applying for, but being knowledgeable about
the studio that you're applying

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.440
to, about their products and their processes.
This can really set you

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.340
apart from other applicants.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.540
People who are passionate about the video
games industry is going to be

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.880
key. It's not the sort of industry to get
into if you don't love games. I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.870
think everyone in the industry does. But on
top of that, people seem to

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.980
excel when they're extremely knowledgeable
about the products and about

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.960
what they're doing, and on top of that, have
pragmatism. Things can go

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.820
wrong on a project. Things can change at the
last minute, but being able

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.039
to quickly adapt to that is really important.
We find that a lot of our

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.830
clients will ask for someone to be degree
educated. Having said that, we

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.390
find that experience can also trump this in
a lot of cases. If you have

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.109
experience, say, developing your own apps
or have worked in an internship

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.189
for the studio, if you have proven experience
that you can show to the

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:29.669
studio, we find that that will often counterbalance
that.

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:34.269
I recently had someone apply for a CART writer's
position. Now, as the name

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.049
entails, he creates the art for the characters
and the concepts being them.

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.170
He collated his work in a portfolio and used
the characters and took mug

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.139
shots of them effectively, creating what was
a police file on each

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.519
character. Through this, he explained each
character, how he created them,

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.409
and the motivation behind it. It's a really
innovative way to put it

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:02.370
together, and the clients act it out to really
like the work. I recently

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.019
place a candidate. He's a programmer. Now,
he turned up for his

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.639
interview. First day of the interview, he
spoke to the company for a half

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.659
an hour and they got on the phone and offered
him straight away. They

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.260
absolutely loved him. And what really excelled
and what really stood out

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.799
his application over the others was his knowledge.
He came in, he knew

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.129
everything about the product, he knew everything
about the company and he

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:26.790
knew exactly how to do the job.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.489
And he managed to demonstration that within
a half an hour and they fell in

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:37.199
love, and the best part was he absolutely
loved them as well. On occasion,

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.819
you do hear about things and it goes back
to having sort of good

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.319
preparation. I mean, sometimes people will
turn up and know nothing about

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.680
a studio, which is probably the worst thing
to do. Like I said, having a

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.029
knowledge base in place is a good start. One
of the other things that we

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.309
had recently was someone turned up to a interview.
The best way to

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:57.339
describe it would be the client said he looked
like a clown, which is

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:01.130
probably inadvisable when you turn up to an
interview. It's always best to

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.939
make yourself presentable. Although it's a
casual industry and people will

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.959
often wear dress down, it's always good when
making a first impression to

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.219
make sure you're smart and presentable.

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:16.389
2013, as I mentioned, it is the new consoles
coming out so you can't help

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.790
but get excited about those. On top of the
new consoles, I'm a big fan of

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.660
Madam sports titles and EA Sport's have a
new engine called, Ignite Engine

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.760
out, which promises to give a really in depth
exploration into the titles,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.630
really excited to that. As well as Ubisoft's
big new project, Assassins

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.030
Creed Black Flag, which currently, they have
over nine development studios

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.200
involved in the process. So, it proves that
it's going to be a really big

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.410
project for them. So I'm really excited for
that as well.
