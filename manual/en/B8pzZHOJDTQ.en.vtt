00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.060
I am Superman 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.100
This doesn't look like a job for Superman

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.493
You're less lethal than Lex Luther...Damn 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.380
He's only a human man

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.820
I'll slow your flash flood flow 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.320
Hover Dam

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.313
Nahh

00:00:32.313 --> 00:00:33.893
The Hoover Dam is overkill

00:00:33.893 --> 00:00:36.173
Wally I could leave it to beaver and still

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.700
run over your flow

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.200
Roadkill 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.897
The Scarlet Speedster 

00:00:39.897 --> 00:00:41.177
Must have scarlet fever 

00:00:41.177 --> 00:00:42.677
You're a meager little leaguer 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.180
Why so eager 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.040
To face the Justice Leagues hardest hitting

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.540
Home run leader

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.340
Here's a Daily Planet news flash 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.440
Yea you're fast but you'll run out of gas

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.940
You're outclassed 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.579
I'm the whole package

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.759
and this right here

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.620
is the definition of a mismatch 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.597
Hate to kill your vibe

00:00:57.597 --> 00:00:58.437
You can run

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.720
but you cannot hide

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.540
like Nationwide I'm always on your side

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.337
see I exceed

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.100
the universal laws of physics speed limits

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.040
going light years

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.440
in mere minutes

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.220
but unklike you that's not all I do

00:01:12.376 --> 00:01:13.736
your ran here right?

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.320
yea i flew

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.380
oh and I can see right through you too

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.733
and one small breath

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.380
I'll blow you up up and away

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.993
like a red balloon 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.020
right to the Darkseid

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.320
of the moon!

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.480
It's a bird it's a plane 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.120
nahhh

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.220
it's the absurdly lame

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.460
Superman...dang

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.580
they were right about

00:01:35.582 --> 00:01:36.502
you being plain though

00:01:36.502 --> 00:01:37.002
your story is so boring

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:38.040
and mundane bro

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.520
I got the fastest flow

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.560
you didn't know

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.080
well now you know

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.580
eff your s

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.080
is that for slow?

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.300
whoa im Usain Bolt

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.260
Ready! Set! GO!

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.360
This ain't a race

00:01:49.394 --> 00:01:50.434
but im not gonna

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:51.285
pace myself

00:01:51.285 --> 00:01:51.894
brace yourself

00:01:51.894 --> 00:01:52.784
at this rate your face

00:01:52.784 --> 00:01:53.466
would melt

00:01:53.638 --> 00:01:55.158
taste my infinite mass

00:01:55.334 --> 00:01:56.614
punch itself to the

00:01:56.714 --> 00:01:58.234
and get there in a flash

00:01:58.454 --> 00:01:59.574
Get it? That's me

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.280
Travel at the speed

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.780
of light

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:02.446
and I be

00:02:02.912 --> 00:02:04.512
traveling through time

00:02:04.512 --> 00:02:05.717
Superman I'm sorry 

00:02:05.717 --> 00:02:06.803
but you, you couldn't

00:02:06.803 --> 00:02:07.669
do that in your prime

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.570
you're not frightening

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.520
but me

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.020
I always bring

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.587
thunder and the lightening 

00:02:12.587 --> 00:02:14.767
don't underestimate Wally West

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.920
Ima put the S 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.226
on your chest to test

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.560
cut your cape off

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.456
and lay you to rest

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:20.551
run circles around you 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.499
i know you impressed, yes!

00:02:22.757 --> 00:02:23.877
and don't stress

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.500
wondering who's best

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.122
cuz uh obviously that's me

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.060
you fast

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.760
but me I'm the fastest

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.880
I swear Superman

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.975
you're slow as molasses

00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:33.291
nerdy Clark Kent

00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:34.248
in your black glasses

00:02:34.683 --> 00:02:36.923
isn't going to get Lois to like you

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.756
and I'm sorry I'm just being honest

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.260
my speed is so supersonic

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.720
an iconic comic

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.080
drowning my sorrows 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.580
in kryptonite 

00:02:45.406 --> 00:02:46.126
how ironic

00:02:47.094 --> 00:02:48.534
the Supes been stewed 

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:49.973
a quick flash in the pan

00:02:50.014 --> 00:02:50.814
we call that

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:52.089
fast food

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:56.593
Listen!

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:58.424
Don't ever say Lois's name again

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.550
or I'll make a small incision

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.556
using my precision laser heat vision

00:03:02.556 --> 00:03:04.627
and you'll be given a little circumcision

00:03:04.627 --> 00:03:07.034
you should have withdrawn from this fight

00:03:07.034 --> 00:03:08.594
or at least came equipped with

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.999
a little bit of kryptonite

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:11.774
cause you ain't the only one quick

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:12.834
like Twista on the mic

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.720
shit my gums bleeding with blisters 

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:15.837
from spittin tounge twisters

00:03:15.837 --> 00:03:16.794
at the speed of light

00:03:16.918 --> 00:03:19.318
no one rips on the last son of Krypton 

00:03:19.318 --> 00:03:20.798
Flash you're running slow

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.495
did you make sure you clicked Javascript on

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:24.799
your doomsday is looming

00:03:24.873 --> 00:03:25.673
I'm zooming 

00:03:25.673 --> 00:03:26.483
sonic booming

00:03:27.034 --> 00:03:29.354
and shit man I'm barely even moving
