00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.110
Nobody starves willingly
so you can get a war out of that.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.020
It is introducing a new chapter
in world food security.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.130
One that is fraught with risk.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:35.150
What are the possible results
of increased food security?

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.030
There will be a very delicate
military slash diplomatic problem

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.180
in terms of preserving the security,
the integrity of the borders,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.040
because we have borders with
the countries that will be impacted.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.170
And will be generating the refugees,
will be desperate,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.070
will perhaps be driven to what
you may call unreasonable measures

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.200
because otherwise they starve.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.010
The pressure of refugees,
climate refugees if you will,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.220
is going to be so great that it will get
beyond being purely a police problem.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.070
And borders will
to some extent be militarised,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.150
not against the threat of an invasion,
but against the waves of refugees

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.160
that are washing up against them.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.080
Like the fence that India is currently
building around Bangladesh.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.050
Now it’s there
to stop economic refugees,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.040
of whom there are millions in
the states surrounding Bangladesh,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.000
but you know, and if you go to Delhi
and talk to people they will admit it

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.210
that this is
also a precaution for a future

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.050
where half of Bangladesh, alright
20 percent, has gone under water

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.230
and there’s 30 million people
trying to get out.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.220
So, let’s get the fence up now.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:12.140
What is new
about 21st century food security?

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.040
There are a dozen or more
countries trying to acquire land

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.040
outside their boundaries
in order to ensure their food security.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.130
It’s not land, it’s land and water.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.070
Land without water
it’s not worth anything.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.110
Now we see a competition for land
crossing national boundaries,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.030
in a way that we’ve not seen before.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.230
And it is introducing a new chapter
in world food security.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.210
When grain prices rise again,
as they inevitably will,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.070
it’s going to become difficult
for the countries that have invested

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.120
in hungry countries, like Ethiopia
and the Sudan for example,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.210
to get that food out without facing
riots and potential insurgencies

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.240
from hungry people
when they see food from their country

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.030
leaving and going elsewhere.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.060
And a lot of the conflicts could ripple
around the world in different forms.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.240
They could translate into
economic constraints or embargoes,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.110
or what have you,
but the stresses are clearly building.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.140
What can be done
to address these problems?

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.130
No country is going to accept
30 percent of the population

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.120
being from way far away
and not speaking the local language.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.130
We stop it before that,
so, this has got to be stopped.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.050
Yes, there’s a border issue. How do
you keep them from sifting across?

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.010
There are other ways
of addressing the problem

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.040
in terms of giving the aid
so they can stay home,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.160
which will help the countries
that would be generating

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.000
these waves to feed their people.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.030
You saw at the Copenhagen
Summit in December,

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.110
although it was a failure,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.200
a remarkably large number
being bandied about:

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.140
a hundred billion dollars
a year by 2020,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.180
in aid which essentially would be
coming from the developed countries

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.010
to the developing countries
a) to help them get out of fossil fuels

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.130
and b) to help them deal
with the consequences,

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.150
which for them will be earlier
and worse, of climate change.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.060
In terms of being able
to feed their people

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.230
and the wellbeing of the population
which is under severe climate strain.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.010
The European Union’s frontiers
with the Middle East and,

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.080
across the Mediterranean with Africa,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.010
are going to be under enormous
pressure as things get worse,

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.060
because the sub-tropics
take a bigger, worse hit

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.010
than the temperate zone that we
live in. Now Europe is mostly NATO.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.180
And the rest of NATO,
that is to say North America,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.090
will have its own problems
with te border

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.200
between the developed world
and that former Third World,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.220
between the US and Mexico.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.030
Ways of controlling that pressure
without getting into confrontation

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:25.240
and possibly some new form
of polarisation, like the old Cold War,

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.050
have to be found. And I think
NATO is probably the organisation

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.130
that is going to play the largest role,

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.160
other than the diplomats,
in doing this.
