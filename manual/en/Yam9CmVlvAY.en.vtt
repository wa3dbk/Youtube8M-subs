{ draft lyrics - help to improve &amp; correct }

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.500
[Verse 1]
This is the part,
I'm such a waste.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.200
And the home that you bring,
Can not be replaced.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.200
Voice floods my head around,
I shelter me.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.000
The way that you move,
Could make a blind man see.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:41.000
[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's safe to say,
When I'm better off this way.
(Yeah)

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
[Verse 2]
Beautiful ghost,
Looks just like you.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.400
And I start to feel,
Like I used to.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.000
In a crowded room,
In solitude,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.200
I follow your voice,
Like you want me to.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:30.700
[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's safe to say,
When I'm better off this way.
(Yeah)

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:42.400
[Chorus]
I'm waking up on my own,
Trying to forget you.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:53.200
Now I stand on my own,
Starting somewhere new.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.000
[Verse 3]
When we're in love,
In xx xx.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.300
I try to ignore it,
But I belong to you.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:15.300
This love is a prison
Because I made a decision,
To put my faith right back in you.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:25.500
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's safe to say,
It's not better off this way.
(Yeah)

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:37.200
[Chorus]
I'm waking up on my own,
Trying to forget you.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:48.000
Now I stand on my own,
Starting somewhere new.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:57.000
[Bridge]
I've been staked to awake,
But I know it tears me apart.
(But I know it tears me apart.)

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:10.000
I hope that you're loving me,
Yes I'm crawling back to you.
(Yes I'm crawling back to you.)

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:24.000
[Ending]
I'm waking up on my own,
I'm reaching for you!

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.200
Reaching for you.
(Yes, I'm reaching)

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:43.000
I'm waking up next to you,
I belong to you.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:50.000
I know where to stand,
Hand in hand.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.900
I finally found,
Bring me home.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.200
(Reaching,
I'm waking up on my own.)

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:18.000
Yes, I'm reaching,
I'm waking up on my own,
I finally found
Bring me home.
