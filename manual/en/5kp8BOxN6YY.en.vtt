On tonight’s episode of What The **** Is
A Pokémon, we visit the creatures in their

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:38.500
native habitat in an attempt to answer some
of the most mysterious mysteries of the Pokémon

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.500
universe.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.989
Can an electricity Pokémon charge its devices
wirelessly?

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.350
Do water-based Pokémon cry tears of bubbles?

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.839
And of course, how does a Pokémon poop?

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.750
Frankly, it seems impossible.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.910
I’m glad you’re optimistic, oh white Pokémon.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.670
But based on your anatomy, I have scientific
concerns about how you Poké-poop.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.960
How is this done with no orifice?

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.960
Of course you can’t!

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.159
I’m the narrator!

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:24.300
And this is PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.240
Released just last month for the Nintendo
Wii, PokéPark 2 is, first and foremost...a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.280
Pokémon game.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.740
And for millions of people, a new Pokémon
game is always a major release.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.400
So this is an excellent addition to the Wii’s
fairly sparse 2012 lineup.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:55.130
It also happens to be adorable...it’s impossible
not to like this.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:12.430
PokéPark 2 is a sequel to the 2010 original
PokéPark, and frankly, not much has changed

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.430
in this one.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.230
This is another very simple action-adventure
game in which you play as Pikachu.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.090
I said...in which you play as Pikachu.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.430
Geez, more like Sleep-achu.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.959
Come on, wake up!

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.560
And why is that thing watching you sleep?

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.760
There is a story, but it makes absolutely
no sense...and frankly, I was lost within

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.420
a matter of minutes.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.470
Something about a parallel dimension in which
birthday cake has hallucinogenic properties.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.650
What it really boils down to is that you’re
Pikachu, and you have to rescue Pokémon,

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.440
make Pokémon pals and do lots of fun Pokémon
things.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.930
If you’re expecting more than that, this
obviously isn’t a game for you.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.510
And you’re probably an *sshole.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.180
But PokéPark 2 obviously skews young.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.280
There’s a little combat, platforming, side-scrolling,
even some old-school Wii minigames.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.560
So there’s actually a nice diversity to
the gameplay, although it’s all very simple

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.560
stuff.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.120
But even so, I mean...I don’t even like
Pokémon, and I had fun with this game.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.489
It’s not even remotely challenging, but
it’s an entertaining game set in a very

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:28.629
charming world.

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.860
In fact, the presentation is one of its strong
points.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.739
It’s not technically impressive, but the
graphics are tastefully done.

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:56.530
Very colorful and vibrant with great Pokémon
models and some nice effects.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.000
So what about the drawbacks?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.790
Well, as you can probably tell, it’s very
repetitive.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.409
Also, you play with the Wii Remote held sideways,
and moving with a d-pad in a 3D world can

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:09.690
be a bit clunky.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.100
But if you’re a big fan of Pokémon, or
casual adventure games...or perhaps birthday

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.260
cake, it’s hard to go wrong with this adorable
little Wii game.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.410
It’s PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond.
