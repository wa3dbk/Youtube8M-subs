00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.170
"What we've got we've got a uh... laptop;
a Toughbook laptop that we use to download

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.579
the engine management unit systems in
the vehicles. Uhm...

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:14.889
we use this to determine if there's any
uhm... parameters set

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.349
uhm... wrong in the vehicle, uhm... to help us
determine whether there's a speed tampering overide

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:26.349
device.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.020
It's a tool to help us

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.660
try and work out if the vehicle does have one fitted.
Uhm... we do have

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.940
other tools as well, uhm... including

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.940
climbing over the truck and
physically locating."

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.810
"So what it shows

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.090
pretty easy, what the

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.050
truck's been doin', so that's

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.970
the time and that's the amount of revs;
so it's spends most of it's time between

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.970
fifteen to sixteen hundred revs, which would be
about right for a deisel engine."

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.920
"We've had that for around twelve months now
so,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.360
uhm... it's probably been successful

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.490
uhm...

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.410
in probably four or five, uhm...

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.780
instances and probably checked

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.660
probably 40 or 50 vehicles with it."

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.740
"... Can even give us 'intell' on
trucks we may sus... suspect are speeding.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.980
Uhm... so we can check them further

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.510
in, in due time."

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.219
"In the fight against speed, yeah it's pretty much
another tool to help us uhm...

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:41.490
ensure there's compliance on the road."
