00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.280
You're holding the gun there... but look there... With your eyes! 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.560
Pull

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.500
Now! Now! - Just! That's so close!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.020
Do not miss this one! Hit it, kill it, smash it!  Ready - Our shot, pull! Pull!

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.300
Here it comes, just there!

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.440
Now, come on! Hit!

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That's way too slow.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.900
Let me just have one go. I'll probably miss it. 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.900
The camera is pointing this way - so whatever happens you say "good shot" and they'll think I got it.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.420
OK, pull!

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.000
But it was very cold when you tried it, wasn't it?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.940
Yes it was really cold. It was at the end of January.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.660
 It had snowed before and it was not dry enough 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And with the undercling, it gets really wet and the last day it was frozen.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.000
Makes it a bit harder when you're climbing with icy holds...

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
But, the good thing is, my fingers were... warm. So, it was ok.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But the feet, it was incredible! The toes, I can't feel it. 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.600
Which were the underclings where you do the traverse? They were the ones that were wet, weren't they? 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.440
Yes, this was actually the hardest move for me. 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.000
The undercling moves?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.500
Yeah, down there. 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.620
The move with the undercling, I did only once. But after, it was too wet or frozen and that's why.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.620
But It felt ok for this temperature it's like - I was not expecting more.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
No, it was pretty hard and especially when it was freezing.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
For me, back in 1983 the hardest part was around the face move but I think it was more about the ethics, the way we did it

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.800
Because, I could not practice all the moves, the way how you're viewing it 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.960
Every time I Iowered down, I rehearsed and the bottom became easier. 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.860
So, the hardest bit was always the bit the higher up because you don't know what you're doing.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:07.260
But then, once I did it, once I got through the face move and then the next two moves on pockets. Then I did all of the top part on sight.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.160
With this temperature I was not expecting more.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.940
No, it was pretty hard, and on top if it is freezing...

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Now, I have to wait until it's open. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.500
When is the ban to end?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It's closed from February till the end of June. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
In July it might be too hot, but in autumn it maybe good.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.500
I kind of drifted out of climbing when I got to my forties. 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I had done nearly all the goals, all the new stuff that I wanted to do

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.000
and then I made a decision that I did not want to climb my whole life

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
...cause of other things which I enjoyed which I could not do while I was climbing, 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.000
like surfing is one of my big passions, playing some golf, doing a little bit of shooting

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.500
Yeah a little bit of shooting

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Good shot! Good shot!
