Hi, this is Jimmy Hartman on behalf of Expert
Village and in this clip we'll be finalizing

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.950
our product box tutorial. Now let's see this
all come together here. Let's go to our layers

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.850
here and we're going to select everything
that goes on the front of the box here, the

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:24.009
front area, swirls and the two text layers.
We're going to go layer, you can't see it

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.529
on here, but merge layers or control "e".
That makes it one big layer that we can move

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.440
around here. Then we're going to do the same
thing to the side bars. Select both the swirls

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.600
copy and the side area and hit control "e"
to merge those. Now I've got two single layers

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.660
for the front and the side. So let's go ahead
and have our side selected and we're going

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.719
to go ahead and move it holding shift to the
left. I've got my snaps on, but make sure

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:02.339
it lines right up with the front of the box.
So, right about there. Now we're going to

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:09.710
go into our layers again. And our background,
we'll leave that black for now. Let's go ahead

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:17.610
and select our front of the box here. We'll
hit control "t" to transform. You can right

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.970
click in this transform area and go to perspective.
Now, you can grab one of these corners. Perspective

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.240
basically lets you add a perspective. Which
you'll see here. Click one of the corners

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.340
on the upper left and drag down. If drag in
this way and it adds perspective like that,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.320
if you bring it down, it kind of makes it
fade off left into the distance. So, not too

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.670
much. Then we'll go and right click again
and hit free transform. We'll bring it back

00:01:48.670 --> 00:02:00.090
in. Looks good, we'll leave it there and hit
return to apply it. Now we'll do the same

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.911
thing with the side bar, hit control "t",
and right click perspective, bring it down

00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:18.670
a little bit, right click free transform,
bring it in and you can see our box starting

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.319
to come out now. Go to our layer here. And
our background, we'll go ahead and make it

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.790
white. Now, it doesn't look very good right
now, but let's go ahead and merge the two

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.849
copies we just tweeked in perspective. Control
and select both of those layers and hit control

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.940
"e" to merge them and now the final step will
be converting this background to a layer,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.560
we'll go ahead and double click it to make
it a layer, hit okay. Now, in this box layer,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:58.680
we'll go ahead and bring up our layer styles,
add a drop shadow, so you can kind of see

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.930
it and now we'll add our distance at one or
two and bring our size up a little bit and

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:14.319
our opacity down. We'll click okay and see
how it looks. That's pretty good. It could

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.660
definitely use a little tweeking. As you can
see the text didn't come out clear. You can

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.180
use a finer text or a larger resolution. This
is a quick way to do it and you get a pretty

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.270
decent looking result.
