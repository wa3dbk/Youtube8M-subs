Hi Class of 2017. Welcome to BU!

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:13.870
2017? I'm probably going to have a wife and
kids by the time they're graduating.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.690
[Laugh]

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.810
We're seniors from the Class of 2013, and
we're here to give you some tips to make this

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.800
year really awesome and hopefully not too
painful.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.980
Good luck!

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.480
The first thing I'd have to say is to get
to know your floor-mates.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.410
Just go knock on doors. This is the time to
really meet people with different ideas, different

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.340
points of view.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.840
Just go up and talk to random people. They're
in the same position as you. They're definitely

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.870
looking for friends as well.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.079
When you meet people, ask them why they chose
their major instead of just what their major is.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.140
That way you get to actually know them rather
than know about them.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.670
Bring a fan. It's so hot when you first get
here! That's definitely the number one thing

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.470
I would bring.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.010
Bring more winter clothes than anything. Layers,
layers, layers.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.310
There have been days where I wear ear-muffs,
and then a hat on top of that, and then a

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.360
beanie on top of that, and then even my winter
coat.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.970
And the wind still slaps me in the face.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.080
The rain here comes from all different directions.
Umbrellas aren't really useful.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.700
Get a golf umbrella--one of those big, massive
ones. It may take up the entire sidewalk,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.180
but it won't break.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.500
Guarantee that.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.500
Definitely.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.880
Don't overpack.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.390
You don't need as much stuff as you think
you do coming in, moving in on your first day.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.670
Coordinate with your roommates. It's definitely
easier if one person brings a TV, and one

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.290
person brings a refrigerator.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.799
Everyone's going to tell you, but I'm going
to tell you one more time because it's the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.000
best thing that you can do.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.670
Get involved.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.420
Join a club, or just do something different
that you've never had the chance to do before.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.780
You know, sometimes there's things that are
outside your realm that you might not have

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.549
done at high school, but you'll actually end
up having a lot of fun.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.049
Take some electives at FitRec. I mean, there's
so many cool ones you can take. You can take

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.100
sailing, and actually be out on a boat on
the Charles River.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.659
Find a job. Definitely find a job. You're
going to want that pocket change to get

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.000
you out and about.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.349
Get on Twitter. When you come to BU, get involved
with social media. Follow Dean Elmore, our

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.600
Instagram--there's so much information.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.709
Every day there's something that, when you
log-on, you can see it and it just makes you

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.969
feel more a part of BU and makes your day a little better.

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:22.799
Try to perfect your time management skills.
Get a planner, plan your days, plan out your

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.510
weeks, set goals, know what you want to do.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.939
Oh yeah, one more thing--

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.989
A pot of coffee is not an adequate substitute
for a good night's sleep.

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.200
That's the most important piece of advice
I could give anyone.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.079
So that's all of the advice that we have for
you, but get ready for the best four years

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:40.659
of your life.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.769
I would like to wish you a lot of luck and
a lot of success here while you're at Boston

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:45.819
University.

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:46.819
Make the most of your time.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.409
Let me tell you, these four years go really
fast.

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.779
It's going to be the greatest time of your
life, so cherish every single moment that

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:54.370
you have.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.450
This is the best college that you could have
chosen, and you're going to love it.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.559
The person you start out to be is not the
person you'll end up being.

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:06.170
So good luck, have a great time, and see you
in the real world!
