[Theme song]

00:00:17.514 --> 00:00:25.722
Kate: Oh hi! I'm Kate T. I'm a freshman! I'm a ChemBE 
 and I live in AMR II Clark. Welcome to my crib!

00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:29.472
[Music]

00:00:36.805 --> 00:00:38.756
I use my JCard to get in. 

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:54.036
Come on in to my crib! 

00:01:10.347 --> 00:01:18.485
Ah this is my wall! Over there I have a poster from when I went 
 down to DC for the Rally to Restore Sanity/March to Keep Fear Alive. 

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:25.078
I have two maps of Paris. I'm a french minor here so 
 I really love Paris and would love to study abroad. 

00:01:25.078 --> 00:01:31.090
I have street art; I'm really into that. There's actually some 
 street art in Baltimore which is pretty cool. 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.207
I volunteer at a children's museum and we did Valentine's Day cards and I got a 
 little Valentine's Day from one of the boys there which was really cute. 

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:56.100
I'm on my bed with stuffed animal: a big giant bear wearing an orientation T-shirt. Um, then 
 I also have a mattress pad underneath and I would definitely suggest one of those.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.470
It makes it really comfortable. 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.940
Um, this is a painting that I did over the summer. I filled up balloons 
 with paint and threw darts at them. It's a really good conversation starter. 

00:02:08.453 --> 00:02:11.520
People would come in my room and be like "Did you 
 do that?" and I'd be like "Yes I did!" 

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:20.340
One of the really cool things about my room is that you can see the baseball field from it. And 
 sometimes, in the middle of the day, when my roommate and I are doing homework or just 

00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:26.620
hanging out, we'll hear "Good job!" or the clink 
 of the baseball. So it's kinda cool. 

00:02:30.373 --> 00:02:38.510
This is my desk. I do a lot of studying here, but I also kinda leave a lot of Hopkins 
 mementos on here so that I can be kinda reminded of them.  So I have like 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.430
a ticket from the Orioles and a ticket 
 from the comedy show from Orientation. 

00:02:45.512 --> 00:02:50.800
One of the cool things about Hopkins is that the Social Network was actually filmed at 
 Hopkins. They gave us free tickets to go see there which was really cool. 

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:56.150
because we got to see in advance and I was telling all my friends that 
 I got to see the Social Network first which was really cool. 

00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:59.280
These are my books. I like to read them in my spare 
 time.
Roommate: Kate! Come on! We're going to be late! 

00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:59.280
These are my books. I like to read them in my spare 
 time.
Roommate: Kate! Come on! We're going to be late! 

00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:05.200
Kate: Oh my gosh! I forgot! I was filming my cribs video! 
Roommate: Well, 
 everyone is waiting for you and we're going to be really late! 

00:03:05.202 --> 00:03:07.760
Kate: Oh! I'm so sorry. 

00:03:12.308 --> 00:03:14.310
Thanks for coming! We're going to movie night! Hope you enjoyed seeing my crib!
