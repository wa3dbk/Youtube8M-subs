00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.209
Hi, I’m Dan Gray for MPGomatic.com and this
is a Ford Focus

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:17.460
The 2012 Ford Focus is equipped with a 2.0-liter
four cylinder engine producing 160 horsepower

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.480
(HP) and 146 foot pounds of torque . The GDI
inline four can be mated to either a five-speed

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.070
manual or six-speed PowerShift automatic transmission.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.840
The official fuel economy estimates for the
2012 Ford Focus are 27 city / 37 highway MPG

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.290
with the automatic or 26 / 36 with the manual.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.680
The Super Fuel Economy (SFE) Package raises
the figures to 28 / 40.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.480
We traveled nearly 500 miles in our automatic-equipped
Titanium Red Candy Metallic review unit and

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.400
inched past the official mileage estimates,
scoring an average of 39.2 MPG on the Interstate

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.750
highway and 31.3 MPG combined in temperatures
ranging from the forties through the seventies.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.500
While it’s no powerhouse the direct-injected
2.0-liter and fast shifting dual-clutch transmission

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.693
delivered significantly faster zero to sixty
times than the last Focus we tested (a 2008

00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:11.693
automatic.)

00:01:11.693 --> 00:01:15.270
We were disappointed to find that the Focus
lacks a real-time fuel-economy display to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.789
go along with its trip meters, driving range,
average vehicle speed, elapsed time, and average

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.310
fuel economy displays.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.009
The Focus is smooth and solid out the road,
with class-leading ride and handling enabled

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.799
by Ford’s electronic power steering and
torque vectoring technology.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.049
The six-speed PowerShift transmission offers
Sport and push-button SelectShift manual modes.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.189
The cabin is world class.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.719
Our Titanium tester was fitted with Charcoal
Black leather seating surfaces and a six-way

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.100
power drivers seat with manual lumbar control.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.529
The Winter package adds five-level seat heating
for the front buckets.

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.969
The leather-wrapped steering-wheel is loaded
with a dizzying array of controls.

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.740
SYNC is standard in the SEL and Titanium,
and includes Bluetooth audio support.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:13.400
The Titanium model is fitted with a ten-speaker
Sony audio system (with subwoofer).

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.720
Our test unit was equipped with the MyFordTouch/HD
Sirius/Navigation and Parking Technology Packages.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.920
The Focus provides two twelve-volt outlets:
one centrally located on the console and one

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.650
at the back of the console.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:37.170
There are two USB inputs, auxiliary A/V input
jacks, and a card slot inside the center console.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:48.219
The second row seats provide 37.9 inches of
headroom and 33.2 inches of leg room.

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:53.069
The five-door hatchback’s cargo area provides
23.8 cubic feet of storage behind the second

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.650
row.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.909
Folding down the 60/40 rear seats allows for
44.8 cubic feet of storage.

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:07.030
All-in-all, the 2012 Ford Focus provides superior
ride and handling, a brilliant interior and

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.830
a slew of technology that befit a more expensive
European car.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.120
While we really dig the five-door hatch, to
hit the magic EPA-spec 40 MPG highway, you’ll

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.310
need to order the SE Sedan with the SFE Package.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.580
