00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.820
I screamed on the radio.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.290
I said, "Are you kidding me?

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.590
Are you kidding me?" The next words were, "God is so good to

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.460
us."

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.910
Man, this is cool, intense.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.320
I've dreamed about running the Daytona 500 my whole life.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.490
Getting fired up-- it's just going to be cool if we make

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.640
the race and get to do it.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.690
Once they say, "Gentlemen, start your

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.150
engines," it's such a blur.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.410
Here we go.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.740
Looking out at the crowd-- all you see is the race track.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.140
It requires so much focus.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.440
It just seemed to get faster and faster and faster.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.070
We ended up qualifying really good.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.030
We make it in the race.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.260
We do everything we needed to do.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.815
Are you nervous?

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:32.659
Are you scared?

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.170
Here I am on the last lap, and find myself leading the

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.310
Daytona 500.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.850
Intense.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.520
Powerful.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.080
Overwhelming.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.930
Any time there's a leader on the last lap at that track, he

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.230
finishes second, third, fourth, whatever, because the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.940
way the drafting works-- just go.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.070
Man, there is no way that we're going to win this race.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.690
And then I come out of Turn 4.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.150
Going to school, racing gave me something

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.370
to set myself apart.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.379
My dad's dad used to race cars, and then my mom's dad

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.240
used to race boats.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.580
So, I think there's speed in the bloodline somewhere, and

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.970
then once I got into it, it was something that I had a

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.200
passion for that I can't describe.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.030
I moved to North Carolina by myself at 15 years old.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.060
I started thinking, "Trevor Bayne's got this." I've gotten

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.070
to this point because I'm good at driving race cars.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.140
I'm good at everything I do.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.390
I can handle it.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.030
When I got to that point, God said, "Oh really, you think

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.330
you can handle this on your own?" And He gave me a few

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.580
wake-up calls.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.030
One was a crash.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.130
I had a H2 Hummer.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.380
I flipped it into head-on traffic.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.950
Three cars hit it in the roof.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.590
It took the top of the steering wheel off, the top of

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.460
the seat off.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.670
I shouldn't be sitting here.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.960
But He gave me another chance to open my eyes.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.820
I still didn't see it.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.005
I didn't see what kind of miracle had just happened.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.820
What ended up happening was He kind of let me slip away from

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.170
the thing that mattered most to me at that

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.070
time, which was racing.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.270
I was saying, "I got this.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.040
I got this." And so He kind of pulled the rug

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.770
out from under me.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.860
I had been racing 42 weekends out of the year,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.300
three times a week.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.090
I was supposed to be racing Nationwide the next year.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.010
Big time--

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.850
it was going to be the best year my life, and I ended up

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.930
sitting still on the sidelines for six months because we

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.010
didn't have sponsorship.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.880
At that point I was like, I understand exactly what's

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.750
going on here.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.260
God was in control the whole time.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.360
I tried to take control, kind of push him aside--

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.890
not on purpose, but by not being intentional about study

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.330
and prayer and just spending time with Him.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.080
I was always busy, 15-year-old, 16-year-old

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.260
thinking, I got to be on the go, hanging out with friends,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.420
doing all my stuff.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.070
But I didn't take time to build that relationship which

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.100
was the most important.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.930
Right after I realized what was going on and started

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.800
getting back into the word and getting fired up, and then

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.760
prayer and just spending time with Him. 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.920
I meet a guy, we went to another team and put me back in a race car.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.970
Not even two weeks later, after I kind of surrendered

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.760
again, and I'm like, "God, You did this all along.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.760
Here I was thinking I've got the talent to do it.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.850
I've got all these things, but really You've supplied all the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.510
opportunity.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.660
So, I'm tired of trying to do it by myself.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.030
Come back, whatever it takes.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.480
I'm willing to do whatever You want."

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.480
[Trevor Bayne joined Roush-Fenway Racing to run in the Nationwide Series in 2011.]

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.480
[Through a partnership with the historic Wood Brothers team, 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.480
he also secured a handful of Sprint Cup starts - including the Daytona 500.]

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.030
Before the race, we're talking about

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.030
reading books and studying.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.980
Finally, I'm just like man, I'm kind of tired of reading.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.350
I don't know if that's right or wrong or what, but I'm

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.850
tired of trying to learn who God is.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.060
I'm tired of trying to see what everybody

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.150
else's take on God is.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.940
I'm just ready to know Him.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.910
I want to experience His power in some way, and Him just say,

00:03:51.910 --> 00:04:06.120
"This is who I am."

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.970
I'm feeling a little bit of butterflies for the first time

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.140
the whole race.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.710
The whole time I had been patient, just waiting and

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.780
riding it out.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.709
And then here we are on the last lap, leading.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.930
It's getting hotter in the car.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.020
I start to just feel this overwhelming, man, what's

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.940
going to happen?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.690
This is the first time I've been nervous.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.720
I'm thinking, "There is no way that we can win this race." I

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.520
mean, it's impossible pretty much.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.050
And then we're coming off Turn 4, and I just feel this

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.280
feeling, sitting back in the seat, and kind of looking up

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.650
in the mirror and seeing everybody behind me.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.210
And we get to the start/finish line, and we were

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.530
still in the lead.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.120
Even at that point, I'm still thinking, "There is no way

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.680
we're going to win this race." And then my crew chief and

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.815
spotter come over the radio, and they're like, "We just won

00:04:51.815 --> 00:04:56.454
the race."

00:04:56.454 --> 00:05:00.850
Man, I screamed on the radio, "Are you kidding me?" Because

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.920
that's what it felt like.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.390
It was like, how is this even possible?

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.350
It's never happened.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.830
Nobody has ever won that race in their first attempt.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.560
And to know that He did it, to know that it's because of His

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.450
power, and just surrendering that.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.040
Saying, "Whatever it is that you want to do, whatever it

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.070
takes, I just want to know You." And at that moment, it

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.840
was just a change.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.650
It was just, this is who I am.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.585
To experience that is incredible.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.750
God's in control, and He's powerful, and He can do

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.870
whatever He wants to, whenever He wants to, with

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.275
whoever He wants to.

00:05:36.275 --> 00:05:39.510
The Daytona 500 win, that stuff's great, but it

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.340
doesn't define me.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.480
Christ defines me.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.020
Part of being a champion is that you have more of a

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.540
platform and more of a voice to speak to people, so that

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.090
drives me to be better every day.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.220
On the track, yes, coming across the checkered flag

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.850
first defines you as a winner.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.750
But off the track, there's a lot more to it than that.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.790
Me becoming second makes me feel like the biggest winner

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.190
in the world.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.440
I want to yell it, man.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.150
My name is Trevor Bayne, and I am Second.
