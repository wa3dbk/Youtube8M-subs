00:00:13.487 --> 00:00:16.361
The dead coming back to life sounds scary.

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:19.376
But for scientists, it can be
a wonderful opportunity.

00:00:19.376 --> 00:00:22.570
Of course, we're not talking about zombies.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.189
Rather, this particular opportunity
came in the unlikely form

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.068
of large, slow-moving fish
called the coelacanth.

00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:33.242
This oddity dates back 360 million years,

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:36.662
and was believed to have died out
during the same mass extinction event

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:40.492
that wiped out the dinosaurs
65 million years ago.

00:00:40.492 --> 00:00:45.382
To biologists and paleontologists,
this creature was a very old and fascinating

00:00:45.382 --> 00:00:50.265
but entirely extinct fish,
forever fossilized.

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:56.501
That is, until 1938 when Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer,
a curator at a South African museum,

00:00:56.501 --> 00:01:01.981
came across a prehistoric looking, gleaming
blue fish hauled up at the nearby docks.

00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:06.895
She had a hunch that this strange,
1.5 meter long specimen was important

00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:10.960
but couldn't preserve it in time
to be studied and had it taxidermied.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.004
When she finally was able to
reach J.L.B. Smith, a local fish expert,

00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:20.088
he was able to confirm, at first site,
that the creature was indeed a coelacanth.

00:01:20.088 --> 00:01:24.640
But it was another 14 years before
a live specimen was found in the Comoros Islands,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.436
allowing scientists to
closely study a creature

00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:30.437
that had barely evolved
in 300 million years.

00:01:30.437 --> 00:01:32.953
A living fossil.

00:01:32.953 --> 00:01:36.437
Decades later, a second species
was found near Indonesia.

00:01:36.437 --> 00:01:39.604
The survival of creatures
thought extinct for so long

00:01:39.604 --> 00:01:42.960
proved to be one of the
biggest discoveries of the century.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.937
But the fact that the coelacanth
came back from the dead

00:01:45.937 --> 00:01:48.482
isn't all that makes
this fish so astounding.

00:01:48.482 --> 00:01:52.442
Even more intriguing is the fact that
genetically and morphologically,

00:01:52.442 --> 00:01:55.507
the coelacanth has more in common
with four-limbed vertebrates

00:01:55.507 --> 00:02:00.264
than almost any other fish,
and its smaller genome is ideal for study.

00:02:00.264 --> 00:02:04.858
This makes the coelacanth a powerful link
between aquatic and land vertebrates,

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:09.516
a living record of their transition from
water to land millions of years ago.

00:02:09.516 --> 00:02:12.576
The secret to this transition is in the fins.

00:02:12.576 --> 00:02:17.085
While the majority of ocean fish
fall into the category of ray-finned fishes,

00:02:17.085 --> 00:02:21.801
coelacanths are part of a much smaller,
evolutionarily distinct group with thicker fins

00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:24.417
known as lobe-finned fish.

00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:28.909
Six of the coelacanth's fins contain bones
organized much like our limbs,

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.459
with one bone connecting
the fin to the body,

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.850
another two connecting the bone
to the tip of the fin,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.329
and several small,
finger-like bones at the tip.

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.220
Not only are those fins structured
in pairs to move in a synchronized way,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.815
the coelacanth even shares
the same genetic sequence

00:02:43.815 --> 00:02:47.520
that promotes limb development
in land vertebrates.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.413
So although the coelacanth
itself isn't a land-walker,

00:02:50.413 --> 00:02:53.215
its fins do resemble those
of its close relatives

00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:55.854
who first hauled their bodies onto land

00:02:55.854 --> 00:02:58.411
with the help of these
sturdy, flexible appendages,

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:02.182
acting as an evolutionary bridge
to the land lovers that followed.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:06.200
So that's how this prehistoric fish
helps explain the evolutionary movement

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.517
of vertebrates from water to land.

00:03:08.517 --> 00:03:10.698
Over millions of years, 
that transition

00:03:10.698 --> 00:03:14.744
led to the spread of all
four-limbed animals, called tetrapods,

00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:19.267
like amphibians, birds, and even
the mammals that are our ancestors.

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:21.331
There's even another powerful clue

00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:24.422
in that unlike most fish,
coelacanths don't lay eggs,

00:03:24.422 --> 00:03:28.189
instead giving birth to live, young pups,
just like mammals.

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.736
And this prehistoric fish will continue to
provide us with fascinating information

00:03:32.736 --> 00:03:38.003
about the migration of vertebrates
out of the ocean over 300 million years ago.

00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:42.349
A journey that ultimately drove
our own evolution, survival and existence.

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.468
Today the coelacanth remains the symbol
of the wondrous mysteries that remain

00:03:46.468 --> 00:03:48.605
to be uncovered by science.

00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:52.817
With so much left to learn about this fish,
the ocean depths and evolution itself,

00:03:52.817 --> 00:03:57.760
who knows what other well-kept secrets
our future discoveries may bring to life!
