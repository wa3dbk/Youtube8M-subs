00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.860
Qigong is an everyday practice that Chinese
people have used for thousands of years to

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.660
achieve a more natural state of human life,
as well as to develop further its unlimited

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.050
potential.
It is a form of Qi exercise based on the Chinese

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.779
holistic understanding of the Universe and
Human life, where ‘Heaven, Earth and Human

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:38.190
are seen as inseparable one’.
Similarly, the human being is seen as a micro

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.520
cosmos system where the mind, Qi and physical
body are one’ as well.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:53.230
QIGONG utilizes the body and mind together
to improve the flow, quantity and quality

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.680
of Qi in the body.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.690
What is Qi?
Everything in the universe can be seen as

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.460
a form of Qi.
One can say that Qi is the most fundamental

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.300
element in the universe; the basic building
block of everything.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:24.680
Qi is everywhere. It consists of energy, information
and material and is constantly transforming

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.740
from physical to non-physical form and vice
versa.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.890
Qi is also the vital force of human life.
Once Qi is healthy the body and mind will

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.210
be in harmony.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.920
Zhineng Qigong is a modern Qigong system developed
in the early 1980s by Professor Pang Ming.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.730
Zhineng Qigong combines scientific research
and thousands of years of experience in a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.220
form of training, that improves the physical
and mental capabilities of human beings.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:14.549
Zhineng Qigong exercises are safe to use and
they gradually work on one’s general well-being,

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:23.019
longevity and intelligence, as well as redeveloping
our special capabilities.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:30.120
How does Qigong work?
Since Qi is the vital force of life, when

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.400
Qi is unhealthy, the body cannot function
properly and problems can start to develop.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.830
Our Qi can become unhealthy in the course
of our lives by gradually being depleted and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:51.320
blocked. From Traditional Chinese Medicine
point of view, most of the health issues first

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.510
exhibit on qi-level. At this stage usually
people are able to feel that something is

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:06.310
not quite alright but it is hard to detect
anything with medical equipment. If the qi

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.010
imbalance is not dealt with, after a while
it will manifest on physical level as well.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.470
Unhealthy Qi can also have negative effects
on the mind.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.090
Qigong practice can clear blockages, replenish
Qi and nourish the physical body and the mind.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:36.950
This means unhealthy gatherings of Qi (from
where most diseases and abnormal growths originate)

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.079
can be transformed and cleared.
Qigong practice helps the body to normalize

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:52.190
and balance itself by activating the body’s
own self-healing abilities. Qigong works on

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.549
a very fundamental level and is therefore
effective in dealing with health problems

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.229
of all sorts.

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:11.609
What are the benefits of Qigong practice?
Qigong Prevents and heals illness; Enhances

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:19.449
health; Prolongs life;
Develops the power of the mind and our inner

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:20.829
wisdom.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:29.230
Qigong has been proven to work effectively
on overall health as well as specific problems

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.010
such as
Energy Levels, Muscular skeletal problems,

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:44.360
Headaches, Sleeping disorders
Digestive disorders, Hormonal and organ disorders,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.430
Emotional &amp; mental stress

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:57.050
Apart from practicing Qigong, healing can
also occur through Qi or Qigong therapy. A

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.030
trained Qi therapist can transmit Qi to the
patient’s body to replenish Qi and clear

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:11.230
blockages, and thus activate the body’s
self-healing process. Qi therapy can be given

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:18.440
to an individual as well as to a group.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.741
Those who already enjoy good health can use
qigong to explore further the unlimited potential

00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:33.730
of the mind, improve their ability to focus,
stay calm, see clearer and gain more control

00:05:33.730 --> 00:06:44.880
of life as a whole.
