Hey Guys, Mike with Mike’s Road Trip here…I’m
a travel blogger and videographer.

00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:20.410
Today I’m going to give you a look at the
new Feiyu Tech G4 Handheld stabilization gimbal

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.780
for use with a GoPro cameras.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.290
First, I’m going to unbox, then I will give
you some close-up shots and show off the capabilities

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.750
of the G4.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:42.260
As you can see, the packaging is quite nice…almost
Apple desk

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:50.160
The aluminum construction is both attractive
and durable.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.910
After you’ve removed the G4 Gimbal, you
can unscrew the base and insert two rechargeable

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:13.619
batteries.

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:25.820
Also included are two additional batteries,
a micro usb cable, an AC usb charger, an extra

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:36.400
set of screws for mounting the GoPro, a European
adapter, and finally, a charger that uses

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:48.600
the usb cable.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.939
Once you’ve gone through the contents, the
next step is to install the camera.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.130
You’ll notice I have a filter to protect
the GoPro lens.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.970
This BlurFix Air filter by SnakeRiverPrototyping.com,
only weights 7 grams and is the lightest and

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.360
best quality filter I’ve found.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.549
Next, all you have to is turn on and wait
a moment for the gimbal to initialize and

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.099
balance itself.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:29.969
The on/off switch is located at the bottom
of 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.870
the handle.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:46.549
There are three modes in which you can operate
your G4, I’ll go into those in just 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.439
a moment.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:55.749
Now, as a travel video blogger, I’m always
looking to improve the quality of my work…and

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:58.809
one of the best ways to do so...is with stabilization.

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:06.029
The tripod of course is our oldest and simplest
tool for stabilizing the camera, however it

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:09.000
doesn’t help much for hand held shots, which
is getting more popular at the pro-sumer/consumer

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
level.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.810
I’ve used a number of Steady cam devices,
such as this one…and while they work great,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:24.400
there are a number of drawbacks, such as all
the adjusting necessary to get the camera

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.549
to level out.

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:38.659
The Feiyu Tech G4 handheld gimbal takes all
of the guess work out of the equation.

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:59.859
The devise is pre-balanced for the GoPro,
so all you have to do is turn it on and away

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:20.540
you go.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.389
The light was really poor when I shot those
first two examples, so I’m going to shoot

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.750
one more and you can judge for yourself what
you think about the stabilizing capabilities

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.060
of the G4.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.300
You may also have to play around with the
different modes to get the right one for the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:54.770
shot you’re trying to achieve.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.539
I just started using the G4, so like any new
tool, it will take some time to learn best

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.310
practices in order to capture the best possible
footage.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.840
With that said, I think the Feiyu Tech G4
is a great addition to my camera bag of tools,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.509
however at $375, it’s not for everyone.

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:41.379
If you own the G4, I’d love to hear your
thoughts.

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:45.550
Or, if you’re thinking about buying one
and have any questions, please leave a comment

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.290
below and I’ll try and answer it.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.810
Thanks so much for watching.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.889
Until next time, we’ll see ya on…

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:53.599
