Hey Guy's today we're looking at the Regalo
Easy-Open Wide Gate retailing around 35.00

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.410
dollars.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.950
Regalo is headquartered in Burnsville Minnesota.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:32.150
It fits openings 29 point 5 inches to 52 inches
wide and is 31 and a half inches tall.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.020
The Regalo baby gate comes complete with two
extension kits and hardware,which contains

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.150
4 Threaded Spindle Rods 4 Wheel Cups 4 Adjustable
Wheel Spindles and 4 screws.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.700
This will comprise all the hardware you ll
need.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.650
Please follow these instructions carefully
to ensure that your gate extension is properly

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.840
installed.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.260
Improper installation could result in the
gate becoming dislodged from the doorway,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.480
or unstable.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.970
Always make sure the extension is securely
attached to the gate before using.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.710
Here is a look at the wheel cup that's been
screwed to the center part of the door frame.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.150
You can also see the adjustable wheel spindle
that's assembled to the Spindle Threaded Rod.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.550
This gate features an all-steel construction
for added protection and extended durability.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.830
This was why I found the Regalo gate worth
reviewing as its incredibly sturdy with practical

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.790
functionality.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.390
The one handed door opening handle may require
a few practice openings to familiarize yourself

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.180
with its function.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.570
The maroon colored safety lock is spring loaded
so you have to practice your hand placement

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.460
so you can release the safety and left the
handle.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.720
Once the handle is lifted it will disengage
the lock allowing you to open the gate.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.000
During assembly you will notice a slight gap
between the gate door latch and the frame

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.440
tube.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.140
This is not a defect.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.310
The gate is pressure mounted and this gap
will disappear once you rescuer the handle.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.869
To reiterate my point about the gates construction
I wanted to show you these welded joints.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.340
The price may lead one to believe that the
durability is questionable but I have been

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.720
incredibly impressed with its stability and
over all construction.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.840
The door reaches its widest point at about
80 to 70 degrees allowing plenty of space

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.079
to move through it.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.700
This review illustrates the gate in a door
frame however it can just as easily be assembled

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.250
at the top of your stairway.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.980
Most reviews on this product have been favorable
and I for one can vouch for the gates quality

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.840
and reliability.
