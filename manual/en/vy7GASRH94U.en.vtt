00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.330
Today we are going to show you an install
on part number 65050.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.180
This is a front mount hitch and we are installing
it on 07 Chevy Silverado 3500 HD.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.620
To begin our install we have to remove our
license plate holder which is the square object

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.890
in the center there.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.599
That has to come off and whats next is we
have to cut a hole in the bumper so that the

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.599
receiver can poke through.

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.419
The plate is riveted on so we will have to
drill out these rivets and just pop them off.

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.400
What seems to work is grab the backside of
the rivet with a pair of pliers and drill

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:43.110
out the front and it comes right apart.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.460
Our next step is to start measuring so we
can knock out our hole in the bumper.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.550
We are going to start with a common measurement.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.690
Basically we are going to start from this
bolt right here.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.830
Center this bolt then we are going to measure
it all the way to the ground and get a reference

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.900
point from there.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.540
We got our measurement and it came out to
26 inches of course yours might vary.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.000
Our next step is subtract 3-1/4 of an inch.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.380
Then that gives us 25-1/4.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:49.079
Then we mark that difference from the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:57.270
front of the bumper to the ground.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:03:36.019
The next mark we have to measure from here
up 3-1/4 inches.

00:03:36.019 --> 00:04:19.250
Off the mark you made from top to bottom you
have to go right and left 1 inch and 5/8 and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.900
make your marks.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.620
Measure across and double check yourself with
3 inches and 1/4.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.120
You might want to double check the bottom
edge to your marks and make sure they are

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.120
square.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:47.060
Then go ahead and drill 4 holes and we will
take 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.500
our knife and cut it all out.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.500
What we need to do is take this nut off and
loosen this bolt up.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:06:15.300
One this side starting from the the toe hook
but then do the same thing on 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.460
the other side.
