Hi this video is about How To Link Your YouTube
Channel With AdWords

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.850
Before you set-up your video ad campaigns
you first have to link up your YouTube channel

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.059
to your Google AdWords account.

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.269
This will also enable to you to create call-to-action
(CTA) overlays and view additional statistics

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:14.480
within your adwords account.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.800
Call to action overlays enable you to share
more information about the content of your

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.000
video, raise interest in your channel, other
videos, or additional websites.

Here are the steps to link your YouTube Channel

00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:29.630
To Your AdWords Account:
Log into your YouTube Channel

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.050
Click on your profile image
Click on Creator Studio

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.579
Click Channel
Make sure your account is verified and it

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.829
is in good standing so all these buttons should
be green

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.750
Click Advanced
Scroll down where it says "link an adwords

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.949
for video account'
Click "link an adwords account"

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.329
Here it says "Sign in to adwords for video"
so you got to get your customer id

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:01.390
Here's my customer id so I am going to copy
that and then you paste the customer id into

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.360
the box
Then you just click "next"

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.850
It says "assign a name to the adwords account"
And you can leave all these boxes checked

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.800
because you want to see view counts and call
to action, view remarketing and engagement

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.740
Just click "finish"
Now you can see that my adwords account is

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.940
linked to my YouTube channel
That's it!

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.550
Here are 3 important things to keep in mind:
1.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.930
Linking your YouTube channel to an AdWords
account allows you to promote your video and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.500
view additional statistics.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.500
2.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.340
You can control the data that the AdWords
account can access.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.210
This includes view counts, remarketing, and
earned actions.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.210
3.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.090
You can link more than one AdWords account
to your YouTube channel or vice versa.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.840
