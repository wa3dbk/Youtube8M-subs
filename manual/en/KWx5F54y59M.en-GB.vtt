00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.400
Hi guys,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:08.299
This Burmese Tofu salad is far from traditional
but it's a tasty dish to have as a side or

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.570
main in the summer months when it's too hot
to cook.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.759
The flavour is tangy, sweet, and a little
spicy with crunch from fresh veggies balanced

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.100
with a soft, creamy texture from the mild
tasting Burmese Tofu.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.699
Start by putting together the sauce.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.080
The first ingredient is a half teaspoon or
so of reduced balsamic vinegar.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.070
Then the same amount of soy sauce. You could
also use tamari or liquid aminos including

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.550
coconut aminos.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.269
Next for more tang, I'm adding a teaspoon
of white vinegar and a teaspoon of lemon juice.

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.479
You can use any type of vinegar you like.

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:46.899
Then, finely minced ginger and garlic.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.649
Add a tablespoon of chopped scallion, just
the white part for the sauce. We'll use the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.850
green part later.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.109
And finally, a quarter teaspoon of chili flakes.
More or less depending on how much heat you'd

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:00.489
like.

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:10.259
Obviously, for Burmese tofu Salad, you're
gonna need some Burmese Tofu, also known as

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.960
Shan or yellow tofu. I'm using two servings
of plain Burmese Tofu made from just chickpea

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.070
flour, water and salt.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.270
If you don't know what the heck Burmese tofu
is, go over to my recipe tutorial for it.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.950
It's great stuff, full of protein and iron,
and I highly recommend trying it at least

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.140
once.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.289
This has been sitting in the fridge for four
days already so it's quite firm.

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:45.719
Slice it up into thin ribbons or cubes. Whichever
you prefer is fine. I like ribbons because

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.100
they are kind of like jiggly noodles.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.969
Then slice up the lettuce across the rib to
make ribbons.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.270
This celery is very fibrous so I'm peeling
away the top layer of string things as these

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.079
tend to get stuck in the teeth.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.670
Then, slice up the celery as thin or thick
as you like.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.690
So once you have all those parts ready, place
your tofu in a large bowl.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.510
Add the sauce and fold it into the tofu gently.
I like to do this first so that the tofu has

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.200
a chance to soak up the flavour.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.390
Then add the veggies and fold those in as
well.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.840
And just like that, your spicy, sweet and
tangy Burmese Tofu Salad is ready. Finish

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.909
it off with a sprinkling of chopped scallions,
the green parts, and cilantro if you like.

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.330
Delicious!

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.790
