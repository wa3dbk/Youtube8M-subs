00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:27.830
I don’t know what it is, but I’ve been
on a huge Batman kick lately.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.160
Like, I’m watching The Dark Knight, I’m
watching the animated series from the 90s,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.449
I’m buying Harley Quinn crap…I’m even
going back the old show from the 60s.

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.390
Holy nostalgia, Batman, I’m all over this
crap.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.359
So when I sat down to play this, I thought,
“Oh, perfect.

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.679
Perhaps my current obsession with Batman stuff
will help me see past the inevitable boredom

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.739
that comes with just another LEGO game and
see something more than just another LEGO

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.670
game in what is probably going to be just
another LEGO game.”

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.839
Uh, sorry, pudding.

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.729
LEGO Batman 3 is just another LEGO game.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:14.250
Now, that doesn’t mean it’s a bad game.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.060
It’s just that it’s exactly what you’d
expect it to be, which means it’s a very

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.060
good game.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.930
It’s kind of like when certain bands release
a new album, and you know exactly what it’s

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.520
going to sound like, but you buy it anyway
because they’re a good band?

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.310
That’s what this is like.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.420
LEGO games are the AC/DC of video games.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.960
And that ain’t a bad place to be.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.920
Even if it doesn’t shake your foundations.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.780
So LEGO Batman is back in black and spoilin’
for a fight.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.259
Alright, I’m sorry about the AC/DC references,
but listen…that’s the way I want to rock

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.259
and roll.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.450
If you played LEGO Batman 2, this is pretty
much 90 percent the same game.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.100
But if you’ve played any LEGO games before,
you probably expected that.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.429
Hence the AC/DC comparison.

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.820
LEGO Batman 3 has zero interest in reinventing
the bat wheel, or anything like that.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.590
It’s not trying to Rush here.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.329
It’s the same riffs you liked on the last
album, played a little differently.

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.319
And even that’s kind of subjective.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:18.600
I mean, there’s no sense beating around
the bush.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.580
So the catch is that, even though it’s called
LEGO Batman, the game’s more like LEGO DC

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.580
Universe.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.820
So it’s not just Batman against The Joker,
or anything like that.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.630
It’s Batman and the Justice League taking
on a crazy super villain.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.430
And with the help of some unlikely allies,
too.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.940
Obviously, that might surprise people who
are just Batman fans…

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.890
But if you’re a DC fan, this is pretty awesome
stuff.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.960
And if you’re a LEGO fan, this is more of
the same stuff you’ve always liked.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.030
So the only question is, are you tired of
it yet?

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.570
Or more specifically, are you interested in
more of it?

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.780
I mean, on its own merits, this is a really
good LEGO game.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.630
It’s got the simple beat ‘em up action
you’d expect, with the presentation and

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.810
sound and humor and destructible LEGO objects
that make these things so mindlessly addictive.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.690
And I mean that in a good way.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.340
It’s a game you play when you don’t want
to think, when you just want to break stuff

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.340
and have fun.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.010
And I’m all about breaking stuff and having
fun.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.410
The only drawback is, in taking that approach,
these games have really settled into a groove

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.530
where everything’s kind of indistinguishable.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.540
Like, you could mix and match levels from
all the LEGO Batman games…and it’d be

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:35.690
really hard to tell which is which.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:46.510
Honestly, not much has changed here at all
from the previous game.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.370
In fact, if anything feels different, it’s
that the game is more streamlined.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.470
Like, in LEGO Batman 2, you could explore
the city and go at your own pace…but in

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.320
this one, it’s like, “Okay, now you have
to go here.”

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.890
Not a bad thing when it’s done right, but…obviously,
it can feel a bit limiting sometimes.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.610
But then again, there is a ton of content
here.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.290
And characters, and suits and hidden things
to find…I mean, these LEGO games really

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.980
try to wow you with content, as opposed to
design.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.650
I mean, I like this game…and I’m pretty
sure DC fans will like this game…but you

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.010
have to have the right expectations.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.420
Like, that’s what’s become of LEGO games.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.790
They’re in a groove, and it’s a very successful
groove, and you either love it or used to

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.430
love it and got tired of it.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.180
I can’t see anyone never loving it, because
it’s so good the first time.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.310
And if this is your first time, holy addictive
gameplay, Batman!

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.320
You’re gonna love this.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.320
But if it’s not…meh.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.910
Holy…oh, it’s another one of these…Batman.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:57.139
It’s LEGO Batman 3, for the Nintendo Wii
U.
