“Gerson Therapy for Cancer”

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.540
A number of recent documentaries
have renewed interest in Gerson therapy,

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.020
a largely diet-based alternative
treatment for cancer—

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.860
invented by the late Dr. Max
Gerson about 80 years ago.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.910
According to a recent review out of
Sloan-Kettering in the journal Oncology,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.010
for about $16,000, you can
fly to a clinic in Mexico,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.570
and spend three weeks consuming
“fresh, raw fruit and vegetable juices,”—

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.570
Okay—

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.070
“eliminating salt from the diet…”

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.070
So far, so good.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.710
And, “taking supplements
such as potassium, [vitamin] B12,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.969
thyroid hormone, pancreatic enzymes,”
and, supposedly, “detoxifying [the] liver

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.120
with coffee enemas
to stimulate metabolism.”

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.059
I do not dispute that coffee enemas
would not be stimulating,

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.340
but would not recommend them, due to
the whole “they could kill you” thing.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.670
To their credit, modern Gerson
practitioners have moved away

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.780
from the original tenets of the plan—

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.390
which included feeding people
raw calf liver smoothies—

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.780
after too many people died
from systemic blood infections.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.490
After learning of the outbreak,
staff at the Gerson Institute

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.810
decided the policy of drinking
blended liver was to be altered,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.030
and instead started
injecting raw liver instead.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.840
But, hey, conventional cancer treatments
are no walk in the park, either, right?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.500
You do them in hopes that they’ll work.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.380
So, how does the
Gerson therapy compare?

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.270
The first formal investigation into
the treatment was back in 1947,

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.650
and in the 65 years since,
there’s been about a dozen studies

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.880
published in the scientific literature.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.249
And, most came to the same conclusion—

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:51.479
that Gerson therapy
is useless, or, worse.

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:00.780
In tomorrow’s video,
I’ll show you some of the data.
