00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.540
Joe is a hamster

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.780
and this is his story. A pet shop he lived and not a single worry

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.190
Across from Joe a beautiful lady

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.890
Judy's her name and boy does he fancy!
a match made in heaven

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.390
this blossoming love, until a dark shadow

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.340
came from above. Judy was snatched and
taken away

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.590
by a mysterious man to Joe's dismay

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.020
Joe screamed and shouted at the man

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.720
his love lost and taken, his hear broke, sank

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.809
and shaken. All hope seems lost for

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.309
this poor little hamster. Till he
spotted seeds drop from the man red cannister

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.369
A trail, a path, a lead to Judy he said,
such luck I shall follow these odd seeds instead

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.390
Joe worked up his will his courage
steady

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.630
"I will not falter" he declared ever so loudly

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.009
so he gripped the bars of his hamster cage

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.750
flexed his muscles with all his range

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.640
the bar shook and began to bend!

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.330
the bar shook and began to bend... with all his might he tried it again!

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.539
Um... Okay...

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.990
Nevermind... and just like that

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.290
Joe broke free from his cage

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.950
his wit sharp, his mind engaged.
 what perils

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.560
these seeds lead to he does not know, yet
something inside him

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.110
begins to grow. So here's where I leave
you at this stage

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:00.110
the start of Joe's journey of Furball Rampage

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.970
Hi everyone I'm Edward, co-founder of Twitchy Finger Games

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.490
I hope you like our trailer. We are new
mobile game company

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.640
We started out as five guys who love
gaming and decided to quit our jobs and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.920
start making games we'll love

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.860
Being our first game we wanted to make
something that is enjoyable

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.200
and at the same time feasible for a small
studio like ourselves

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.860
that's why we chose the running game
genre. One of the main themes that we set

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.470
out to do

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.730
was the theme of contrast. We tried to
achieve this

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.990
through art style and gameplay. The art style for Furball Rampage

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.459
is cute in cartoony. We wanted
something at first sight that

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.160
is appealing and approachable. That's one
of the reasons we chose a hamster

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.790
as a main character. Meanwhile, we wanted
the gameplay to be fun and quirky

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.060
so we added an action element to the
game in a mode we call "Kata-Mode"

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.180
In "Kata-Mode" we set out to give
the players an experience that differs from

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.680
what our cute cartoony art style suggests

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.660
in this mode Joe transforms from an
innocent hamster

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.380
to a grotesque monster of destruction!  You run around smashing things, creating panic

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.380
and literally eating the people running
away from burning buildings. As you eat them

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.019
you ___ gold. That's right! You literally ___ Gold!

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.160
we got this inspiration from playing Katamary Damacy

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.300
and Rampage. Like Katamary Damacy, our
game shows a contrast between being small

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.540
and being ginormous. As for Rampage, well we just like how we could smash things

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.080
and eat people

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.860
So, if you like the idea of a soft
cuddly hamster

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.450
wrecking havoc and eating people while ___ing gold, help us out by
becoming a supporter for this campaign

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.140

add to this game to make it even more

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.450
awesome and unique

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.760
and with your help, we can make that happen
There's a lot of cool perks and gifts for

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.739

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.010
