00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.740
Reid offers an amazing course, called Relationship 10X Live.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.879
And some people that had attended it

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.790
last weekend, two weekends ago, were raving about it. They said it really helped them walk

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.059
through their issues,

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.210
and feel a lot closer. But now they've suddenly run into the fact that one of them's a saver,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.820
and one of them's a spender. Dun, dun, dun. Now this issue had kind of been

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.130
covered up with all the other things, the lack of communication they had

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.869
before. But now that they've cleared that up, and they've feeling much closer and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.149
happier, they're like they want to resolve this. So Reid, what do you recommend?

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.790
I'm Reid Mihalko, from http://ReidAboutSex.com. She totally blew the intro, by the way.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.260
Who are you? I'm Cathy Vartuli from http://TheIntimacyDojo.com.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.370
And this video's about money. All right, what was the question?

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.840
If you have a couple.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.129
Who one of them's a saver, and one of them's a spender.

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.300
What can you do? Because that can be a big conflict. One of them wants, one person wants to save

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.789
and budget. And the other person, someone who

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.080
is a lot more free thinking about money, and doesn't want to budget or plan. And is just like, "Oh, that's

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.350
pretty. I want it."

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.049
That can cause a lot of conflict in a relationship.
My quick advice is just

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.320
first just recognizing that you guys have different ways of

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.920
handling money. And not making it wrong.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.070
And similar ways, if you haven't heard the videos about the five love languages,

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.490
It's almost like money languages.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.540
That's a good idea for a book.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.869
But basically, you guys have different dialects. What I would do is sit down and have a conversation.

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.520
One, so that you both realize you're different. But not make

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.220
each other wrong. And then figure out how you guys can support each other

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.070
in being right, so that you both win-win.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.259
And then the way that I think I did it when I was

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.509
answering that question for the couple, was

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.600
set some sort of allowance.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.119
Which can seem childish, but is actually quite smart. Where

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.320
Where you have a set amount of money that goes into savings, like the savings

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.009
allowance.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.090
And then you two have your allowances for yourselves

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.209
that you can spend however you want. Now, for the saver,

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.420
don't take your allowance and save it,
and then use that you saved more money than

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.770
the other person against them.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.430
That's not cool. Yes. And it can be really useful

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.849
to look at what your intention for the relationship

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.400
is. That's another thing that Reid talks about in Relationship 10X

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.489
that I just really loved. I hadn't heard people talking about what's our intention for the

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.680
relationship? And it made me think a lot about what I want to do.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.900
And I think that clarifies when to combine money and

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.340
and when not to. Because some people just may not be a good fit for having joint accounts.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.700
So deciding on that. If each person can specify what they need to feel safe

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.879
and abundant in the world. You know, the saver may want to save

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.349
30% of their income. And the spender's like,

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.620
"Whoa, not even close." So if you each identify what you need,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.680
and then that gives you some place to start from. Rather than like,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.319
"You're wrong, you're wrong. We're not doing this right." So each of you identify what

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.510
you need to feel secure. And it might be a conversation

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.629
in the same way that you would create your shared intention for the relationship.

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.920
What's your shared intention around finances? And the best way

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.720
to look at that, I think, is talk about the end of your lives.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.760
Where do you guys want to be at the end of your lives?

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.040
What's going to make you feel safe emotionally and physically,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.310
from a finances perspective, when you're older.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.000
When you're not able to work anymore. And then work backwards from there.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.200
Because so many people aren't happy about

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.319
not being on the same page financially money-wise?

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.489
If you try to create your shared intention for what's happening right now,

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.690
or for the next year? You're usually just going to continue arguing.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.760
So rather than looking at right or wrong,

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.420
knowing where you want to end up, and seeing if you're a good match for that.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.629
And that doesn't mean that you have to end the relationship if you're not. But it may

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.810
mean that you want to separate your money more,

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.299
or find different ways to, like the allowance. Different ways to find agreement in that.

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.080
Just having that conversation, even if you're both savers or you're both

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.120
spenders. It doesn't matter what your language around money is.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.139
It's really useful to have that discussion, because it can

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.820
ease so much going forward. And if you can't figure out what to do with your

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.229
money

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.699
just send it to us. We'll gladly spend it. I mean I'll spend it.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.120
She'll save it.
