00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.759
Hey welcome to another episode of Proko. Today
were going over the nose!

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.270
We have noses of all shape and sizes, but
there are things they all have in common.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.770
It's important to understand these similarities
so that you can solve any nose from any angle.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.080
In the next few minutes we'll simplify the
nose into its major planes to understand the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.320
perspective from various angles. Then well
go deeper and explore the anatomy, and finally

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.530
based on the anatomy, break up the major planes
into the minor planes.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.460
MAJOR PLANES

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.640
In my portrait drawing classes I see a lot
of people struggle to get the nose pointing

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.949
in the right direction and to look 3-dimensional.
To do this correctly it's important to understand

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.739
the nose as a simplified box. There are the
side planes, the top plane and the bottom

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.309
plane. As the head turns side to side or up
and down, all the angles and shapes of the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.799
nose will change. This could get really complicated,
and that's why it so important to first solve

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.210
the perspective of the box, and THEN add the
anatomy.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.810
So, let's see what happens to the major
planes as the head moves. From the front view

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.619
the tip of the nose is aligned with the center
line of the face and the side planes are the

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.649
same width. As the head turns to the side
the tip of the nose will extend away from

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:36.649
the center line. The far side plane will get
thinner and the closer one will get thicker.

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.100
At about the 3/4 view the further side plane
is hidden and eventually at side view even

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.689
the top and bottom planes are no longer visible.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.749
Now let's see what happens when the head
tilts up or down. Pay attention to the heights

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:54.679
of the top and bottom planes. From straight
on, you'll generally see a little bit of the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:00.219
bottom plane. As the head looks up, the bottom
plane gets taller and the tip of the nose

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:06.280
gets closer to the eyes. Eventually it will
even cover a portion of the eye. The tendency

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.819
for many artists is to lower the tip of the
nose, but if you do that, then the

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.720
nose will point in a different direction than
the rest of the face.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.380
That's just weird!

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.409
At a down tilt, the top of the nose will extend
down from the nostrils. Remember that the

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:26.989
bottom of the middle third, indicates the
connection of the nostrils to the face, not

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.200
the tip of the nose.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.989
ANATOMY

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.010
Once you establish the perspective of the
nose, it's time to add some details. But if

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.840
you don't understand the anatomy, it's hard
to know what details to put in. Understanding

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.040
the anatomy helps you to design your shapes
to indicate the subtleties of the nose.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.620
The nose is made up of interlocking pieces
of cartilage and fat attached to the bone

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.620
of the skull. Lets group these pieces into
3 groups: The Bridge, Ball, and Nostrils.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.620
Bridge: The top half of the bridge of the
nose is the nasal bone and the lower half

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.659
is the lateral cartilage. The side plane is
a bone called the Maxilla. And at the top,

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.129
the nasal bone connects to the forehead at
the Glabella, which is a keystone shaped plane

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:21.040
that faces downward. The edge of the nasal
bone and lateral cartilage has a thin, sharp

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.280
ridge as it transitions to the side plane
and then connects to the maxilla. The lateral

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.439
cartilage is pointy and wedges between the
two pieces that make up the ball of the nose.

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:37.620
Ball: Interesting to know that the ball of
the nose is actually made up of two pieces

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.159
of cartilage called the greater alar cartilage.
Sometimes you will see the separation between

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.299
these two pieces and sometimes it will be
too soft to see. These two pieces together

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.879
make a rounded form that hooks in under itself
at the septum and you will typically see a

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.379
bump where it connects to the skull inside
the nostrils.

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:04.849
Wings: Finally on the sides of the ball, there
are two wings made of fatty tissue. These

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.209
wings also hook around and under. Viewed from
the bottom, they connect to the face further

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.859
back then the septum because of the roundness
of the tooth cylinder.

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.549
The fact that the septum and wings hook into
the inside of the nose is important to avoid

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.520
drawing a cartoony nose. These are two common
mistakes. The first is just a 2-dimensional

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.710
outline of the nose. The second is focused
only on the hole of the nostrils, and lacks

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.710
any volume of the wings and septum. By focusing
on the volumes, your drawing will look much

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.160
more 3-dimensional.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.710
MINOR PLANES

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.789
You should memorize the subtle plane changes
in all the different parts of the nose. These

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:55.419
plane changes are usually seen as subtle shapes
and edge variations, which to the untrained

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:01.289
eye appear to be kinda random and unclear.
Once familiar with the minor planes, you can

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.180
easily identify them and design them to be
more clear in your drawing. This gives the

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.949
drawing a better sense of 3-dimensional form.
And this applies to anything, not just to

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.030
the nose.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.210
The minor planes are basically a simplified
and geometric version of the anatomy. So,

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.210
let's take a look at the minor planes of
the nose.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.360
Minor Planes of the Bridge

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.660
The top plane of the nasal bone faces upward
and then slightly more downward at the lateral

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.610
cartilage. From the side, you can see this
slight angle change from the nasal bone to

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.199
the cartilage. The connection between the
bone and cartilage is usually the widest part

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.910
of the bridge.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.080
Minor Planes of the Ball

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.349
The ball of the nose isn't a perfectly smooth
ball, but has very distinct plane changes.

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:51.259
It has a top, front, and bottom plane as the
septum curls under itself and connects to

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:57.919
the skull. The side plane acts as a step down
to the nostril. It's also important to indicate

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.310
the thickness of the septum.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.810
Minor planes of the Wings

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.979
The wings curl into the nostrils similar to
the septum. And so they each have a wide top

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:14.509
plane and a thin side plane. The wings are
not paper thin, so an indication of the front

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:18.669
planes is crucial to give them some thickness.

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:24.490
The shape of the nose varies a lot from person
to person. It can be soft, chiseled, wide

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.509
and bulbous, thin and pointy, and so on..
Next time you're in public, be a creeper

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.410
and observe people's nose shapes.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.910
Next week, I'll show you step by step how
to draw a 3-dimensional nose.
