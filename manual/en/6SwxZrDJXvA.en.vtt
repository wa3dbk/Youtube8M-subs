00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:10.380
Hello, this is XboxAhoy and this is the third
episode of my Black Ops 2 Attachment Guide.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.060
In this episode we're covering the Laser Sight.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.859
Essentially just a visual representation of
Steady Aim, in the original perk form the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.560
hipfire-tightening effect was first introduced
in COD4.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.990
With Black Ops 2, we see the replacement of
Steady Aim with the laser sight attachment,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.450
so the effect is now limited to weapons with
the attachment equipped.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.580
It manifests as a red laser emitted from a
module attached to your weapon: and while

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.110
in the first person view the laser extends
some distance away from you, your enemies

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.670
will not receive any meaningful degree of
notice while you have the laser equipped.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.460
The Laser Sight is available for the SMGs,
LMGs, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, Assault Rifles

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.200
and the Pistols - a comprehensive section
of the arsenal available.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.740
Its effect is relatively straightfoward: the
laser sight will improve your hipfire performance

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.000
with any given weapon - any shots fired while
not aiming down your sights will strike within

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.009
a smaller area than without the attachment.

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.390
Hipfire falls within a random area of a certain
radius - so a smaller cone of fire means more

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.119
consistent performance from the hip.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.799
The magnitude of the laser sight's benefit
varies with weapon class: some boast better

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.570
gains than others.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.999
It is the LMGs that see that greatest increase
in hipfire accuracy with the laser: a 45%

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:39.310
linear reduction in hip spread radius, amounting
to a whopping 3.3x improvement in terms of

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.189
spread area.

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.429
With their impressive magazines and considerable
stance benefits, an LMG with the laser sight

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.180
can be a formidable close-quarter weapon.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.959
Next up, the handguns and shotguns see a 37.5%
linear reduction, equating to around a 2.6x

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.380
performance increase from the hip.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.409
Assault rifles see similar benefit, with 35%
reduction granting a 2.4x benefit.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.599
In a recent patch, some figures were changed
- both the Snipers and SMGs receiving less

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.430
benefit with the laser.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.750
Post-patch, the sniper rifles have a reduced
27.5% linear spread, granting a 1.9x improvement

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.620
to shot accuracy.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.310
Finally, the SMGs have the least to gain,
with a post-patch reduction of 20%, or a 1.6x

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.310
improvement.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.260
However, given the SMG's suitability for hipfire
- this lessened benefit is still worth considering,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.040
as it's likely you'll be hipfiring more often
with such weapons.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.060
The Laser Sight is a universally beneficial
attachment that will greatly improve your

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.780
weapon's performance in close quarters battle.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.240
As such, it benefits close-quarter weapons
the most: it is a particularly worthy option

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.819
on most shotguns and the SMGs, as the ability
to instinctively fire from the hip is a boon

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.640
in rapid-paced gunfights.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.189
Similarly, aggressive assault rifle and LMG
builds will benefit from the attachment too,

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:14.000
massively improving close-range performance
when facing opponents with nimbler loadouts.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.829
I'd recommend giving the laser sight a miss
for those weapons designed for long-ranged

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.700
engagements, however - the slow rate of fire
on the sniper rifles makes hipfire a crapshoot

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.000
- I would instead spend the point on an able
secondary.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.239
Similarly, the LMGs and assault rifles with
a slower rate of fire are generally best used

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.830
while aiming, as the lower level of output
will give you inconsistent performance once

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.090
random spread becomes a factor.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.140
For such weapons, Quickdraw is usually a better
alternative, permitting more rapid aiming

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.280
for pinpoint precision.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.829
I'd also avoid the laser sight on the pistols,
as your points are usually better spent elsewhere

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.750
unless you're going for a pistol-only build
- and avoid the laser on the KSG too, as you

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.379
should try to avoid hipfiring due to its single
slug fired.

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.120
Still, for any close-quarters build the laser
sight is usually a sensible addition, and

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.959
well worth the point spend: equip this attachment,
don your goggles, charge up your laser...

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.750
...and prepare for a blinding success.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.210
Thanks for watching, this has been XboxAhoy.

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.110
Join me for the next attachment guide, when
I'll be covering the Holographic Sight, along

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.000
with its available reticles.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.550
Until then, farewell.
