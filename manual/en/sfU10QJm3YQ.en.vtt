00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.670
Well, ISO was covered a little bit earlier,
but now I'm gonna show you how easy it is

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.800
to change on your camera. Now, my camera has
two ways that you can do it. If you have it

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.280
in the fully automatic function, it really
makes it simple for you. Just on the back,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.019
you just press up on this disc and it chooses
your ISO and you only have two choices. You

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:26.300
have auto ISO or high ISO. Now the reason
that's important is because of how I explained

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:34.610
how low ISO and high ISO's work. If you are
in a dark situation then you know you need

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.760
a high ISO. If I go back to the aquarium example
and you've turned the flash off so you're

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.080
shooting through the glass and now you know
there's not enough light for you to capture

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.250
a decent image so you need to turn the ISO
to high. The camera will go ahead and pick

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.690
a nice high film speed so that it can get
as much light as possible and stop your image

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.780
so that you don't have a lot of blurring or
camera shake. I know on this one, if I turn

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.710
my camera to manual, which a lot of these
cameras have this awesome manual function,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.710
I can just go to here, I move it to manual
and now when I press ISO, I can choose everything

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.081
from auto and high like we just talked about,
but I also have the option of one hundred

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:27.619
speed film, two hundred speed film, four hundred,
eight hundred or sixteen hundred speed film.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.710
So, if I'm shooting a sporting event, I might
go ahead and put it on sixteen hundred speed

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.130
because I know I'm gonna want to stop that
action or if I'm just taking some nice portraits

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.211
and I have a lot of light coming in I might
go ahead and decide to put it on one hundred

00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:46.819
speed film especially if I'm shooting a maybe
a macro or a very close up type of image.

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:52.289
It's so easy to do and the great benefit of
having a digital camera over a film camera

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:59.060
is you can change your ISO every single time
you take a picture where traditionally you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.830
would have to use twelve, twenty-four, or
thirty-six exposure, whatever the roll of

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.370
film is that you bought at that same film
speed. Whether it be two hundred, or four

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:15.189
hundred or one hundred, you were sort of stuck
using that film speed. Here it's great so

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.609
make sure you change it when you need to and
it's a great tool for you to use.
