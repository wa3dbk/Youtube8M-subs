00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.719
Welcome to Final Cut Pro X in under 5 minutes.
I’m Steve from rippletraining.com. In the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.510
past several years, aerial videography has
become increasingly popular do to the low

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.420
cost barrier of entry for a complete system
like this DJI Phantom 2 shown here.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.029
We took one out for a test drive recently
and shot some go pro footage our house in

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.779
northern arizona. After viewing the footage
later on my Mac, I began to notice things

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.640
in the shot that weren’t so obvious while
flying the camera around and looking at the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.290
tiny image the drone was streaming to the iPod touch.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.230
Here is one example; in the foreground you
can see the hard shadow the drone as it flies

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.660
over the scene. I learned the hard way that
on bright days like this one, I need to be

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.350
aware of my shooting angle and direction if
I want to avoid seeing the camera in the shot.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.170
But since this was my first shooting experience
and I was more enamored with the fact that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.080
I had a new toy to play with, I cut myself
some slack.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.860
Be that as it may, I very much like this shot,
and wanted to see if I could remove the shadow

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.150
in post using Final Cut Pro X. I’m going
to be using an effect called the RT Cloner

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.340
that is part of our Ripple Tools 2 collection
of plugins to see if I can’t salvage the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.130
shot.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.020
If you want to know more about our Final Cut
Pro plugins, click the link in the info section.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.689
I’ll start by selecting the clip, then pressing
X to set a range for the entire clip. In the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.759
Titles Browser, I’ll locate the Ripple Tools
2 collection, then select the RT Cloner. Press

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.069
Q to connect it above the clip in the timeline.

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.429
In the center of the screen is an onscreen
control called a target. Drag it over the

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.439
pixels you want to clone out. The RT Cloner
works by defining how large a section of neighboring

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.429
pixels you want to use for cloning. Press
Command 4 to open the inspector. In the published

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.130
parameters section, reduce the size of the
target until the gray circle is just covering

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.920
the object you want to remove.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.079
In order to see the pixels you are cloning
from, turn off the Show Target button. Now

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.630
using the Clone Offset hot-scrubbers drag
up or down for the X value. Dragging upward

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.979
clones pixels to the left of the target, and
dragging downward clones pixels to the right

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.599
of the target. I’ll drag up because the
tonal range of the pixels to the left are

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.420
a much better match. In order to reduce the
hard line of the clone patch I’ll crank

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.629
up the feather amount.

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.790
In order to track the target to drone shadow,
set keyframes at the playhead location. Move

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.530
the playhead to the beginning of the clip
by pressing Home. Now I’ll drag downward

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.260
on the X Target Position to clone from different
source pixels. Notice a new keyframe has been

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.209
set for the Target position at the current
playhead location.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.670
Using the right arrow key I’ll step through
the clip looking for any frame where the target

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.629
is not covering the drone shadow. At any point
I can refine the target position to get the

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.659
clone back on track.

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:01.659
Let’s see how it looks playing back in real
time… not bad…. If I press the V key I

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:08.769
can see a before and after. I can even make
adjustment to the clone parameters while the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.939
clip plays back. Depending how much movement
is in the shot and where you are cloning from,

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:20.319
you may have a perfect clone or you may have
one that’s passable. But for me, the real

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:27.319
benefit was how fast I was able to fix it
in post.
