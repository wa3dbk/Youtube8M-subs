00:00:10.134 --> 00:00:13.534
You know, I've often wondered
why it is we have children.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.297
And the conclusion
I've come to is...

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:20.417
We want someone to get it right,
this time.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.520
But not me.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.318
Personally speaking,
I can't wait to watch life

00:00:28.443 --> 00:00:30.239
tear you apart.

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:38.622
India, is something wrong?

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.082
Yes.

00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:42.568
My father is dead.

00:00:43.826 --> 00:00:45.712
Richard Stoker was a family man

00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:49.466
taken from us
by a cruel twist of fate

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:51.343
the reasons for witch are unknown.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.555
India.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.266
Come and say hello
to your uncle Charlie.

00:00:58.035 --> 00:00:59.017
Hello, India.

00:00:59.183 --> 00:01:01.019
I'm curious
about what happened to my father.

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:14.157
Stoker?

00:01:14.323 --> 00:01:16.285
Or do you go by Stroker, now?

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:19.413
Because I hear that's what your mom
has been doing to your uncle.

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:25.627
Couldn't we talk about you living here

00:01:25.793 --> 00:01:27.045
with Charlie like this?

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:29.440
It's a bad habit.

00:01:30.506 --> 00:01:31.717
Sneaking up on people?

00:01:32.427 --> 00:01:34.177
Following uncles around.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.731
You were supposed to love me,
weren't you?

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:51.468
She's of age.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.031
Of age for what?

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:55.574
You have no idea.

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:01.705
- Too cold down there?
- I don't think so.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:04.625
People disappear all the time.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:05.876
Pack a small bag.

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:09.713
- What do you want from me?
- To be friends.

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:13.884
We don't need to be friends.

00:02:17.432 --> 00:02:18.430
We're family.
