00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:07.149
Hi! I'm Karen for Expert Village. Now we're
going to remove the inside of the fruit. You

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:17.990
can use a melon baller. If you just work like
this, you can eventually remove all of the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:27.950
fruit and have nice little ball sized pieces
to put back in for your display. You just

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:39.250
continue like this. You just keep making.
I'll turn it this way so you can see it. You

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.320
just keep taking that melon baller and scooping
around in a circle. It makes a little ball.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:01:04.460
You do this until you've removed pretty much
all of the fruit or as much as you want. If

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:14.490
you're not interested in reusing the fruit,
you can leave the fruit in the bottom. In

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:25.200
the neck section, let's just take our knife
and carefully, very carefully, cut away evenly

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:35.850
the excess fruit. You want to be very careful
of that neck section. You can similarly trim

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:48.520
away just the inside of that very carefully
all the way around to neaten up the feathers

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:57.439
of our bird. Continue melon balling. When
you've removed as much fruit as you want to

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:04.659
take out, we're just going to clean it up
a bit with a big spoon and you can just scrape

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:15.579
the sides just to neaten it up. Scrape it
down. It makes a lot of juice. Just dump that

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:26.739
into a bowl. Remember to be very careful around
the neck section. Just scrape that pretty

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:37.719
smooth all the way around. Now it's ready
to make the tail sections.
