00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.870
Now that winter’s here, the weather fiends out

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.379
there are waiting for the next big snowstorm.

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:05.669
But before the flakes fall, armies of trucks

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:07.249
are loaded full of one of the most important

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:10.010
road safety tools out there – salt.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.240
Along with keeping our french fries on point,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.760
salt, like sodium chloride,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.530
has actually saved a lot of lives,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.759
and probably even more fenders thanks

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.609
to its incredible deicing abilities.

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.589
(REACTIONS SPLASH)

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.300
So here’s a truck throwing salt

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.449
all over a wintery road.

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.579
Like everything else in the picture,

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.029
you can bet that that salt is pretty cold.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.020
This begs the question – how be that

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.050
something that isn’t hot is melting the ice?

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.360
Turns out, salt isn’t actually about melting.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.580
It’s all about freezing.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.640
The freezing point of pure water rests at

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.190
32 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0 degrees Celsius.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.670
When the temperature of water reaches

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.030
the freezing point, its normally

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.860
free-flowing molecules get trapped

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.000
into an organized crystal structures.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.830
This is how ice is formed.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.600
Salt disrupts this process.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.850
Upon hitting water,

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.579
salt breaks up into two ions:

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.460
one sodium and one chloride.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.690
These two ions then move around

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.920
and take up space in between

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.740
water molecules, pushing them apart

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.940
and frustrating their potential

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.110
links to form ice. This disruption

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.630
is called freezing point depression.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.330
So to put it simply, salt lowers

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.770
the freezing point of water.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.360
But there’s a limit.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.640
Salt can only act as a stable

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.240
deicer in temperatures above

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.720
16 degrees Fahrenheit (-9 C).

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.920
And there’s another drawback to salt.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.800
Considering that over 20 million tons of

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.100
road salt is used annually in the U.S.,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.380
all that salt has to go somewhere in the spring.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.549
Of those two ions split from dissolved salt,

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.200
the chloride ions can have a potentially

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.150
negative effect on the environment.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.710
Chloride can kill small aquatic critters,

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.340
dehydrate and kill plants,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.690
alter the composition of ground soil

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.530
near roads, and can limit water

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.590
circulation that keeps lakes healthy.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.729
All that salt is also corrosive to metal,

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.940
wreaking havoc on infrastructure.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.150
And oh yeah, your wheels too.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.430
For these reasons, Sand is used as

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.990
an abrasive for an alternative.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.380
Sand is often used because it’s

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.549
cheap and maybe cuz folks want

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:58.960
to avoid the chloride issues.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.220
The thing is, salts have a

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.010
chemical advantage: because you get

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.659
2 or more ions when they dissolve,

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.010
you get way more melting power

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.840
for the same handful of deicer.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.340
So sand might be cheap, but you have

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.700
to use way more of the stuff, and

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.260
that can leave quite the mess.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.120
Now for super cold temperatures,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.569
sodium chloride in sand won’t do the job.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.310
Some alternatives that melt ice better

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.340
include Magnesium Chloride, Calcium Chloride,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.310
Potassium Chloride, and Potassium acetate.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.120
Potassium acetate is particularly incredible

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.760
at deicing because it works at temperatures

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.150
as low as -75 degree Celsius, while the rest

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.590
of the bunch work around the -20 degree mark.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.810
Although these alternative chemicals

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.130
are better at deicing at lower

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.590
temperatures, most of them have that

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.160
environment damaging Chloride too,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.950
not to mention that they cost

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.160
way more than that table salt.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.450
And if you’re buying 20 million

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.270
tons a year of the stuff… well,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.239
that’s a lot of money!

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.090
So people, keep your eyes on the road, and

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.890
thank salt for the fine driving conditions.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.550
Or, on the other hand, you can shake

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.810
your fist at it, if you didn’t get

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.170
that snow day you know you DESERVE.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.190

ice here, check out this one about
