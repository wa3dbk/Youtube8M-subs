00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
Many people question whether you can be abducted in The Sims 3 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.770
Then we get lots of rumors ... 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.000
Now let's try and prove if it's possible or not

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.910
First Test: Watch the stars alone in a room

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.170
Note: The Look Through interaction turns watch the stars at night, you realize that watching the Sim's thinking balloons

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.360
After spending a week watching the stars ... 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.200
Fail 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.660
Second Test: Watch the stars outdoors 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.300
Again: The Look Through interaction turns watch the stars at night, you realize that watching Sim's thinking balloons

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.540
After spending another week watching the stars ... 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.560
Fail 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.840
Third Test: Scour the galaxy in a room alone 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.800
After spending a week scouring the galaxy ... 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.840
Fail 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.100
Last Test: Scour the galaxy outdoors 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.180
After spending another week scouring the galaxy 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.140
Totaling 670 hours at the telescope 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.120
BUSTED 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.150
There is no abduction in The Sims 3 
 (now, waiting for expansion packs)
