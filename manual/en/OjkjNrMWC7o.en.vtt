Hey what's up guys, Sean Nalewanyj here of
BodyTransformationTruth.com and in today's

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.590
video I want to address the topic of how to
get rid of lower abdominal fat.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.430
Now, I fully understand just how frustrating
this can be.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.610
You've been training hard and dieting for
weeks, you're making consistent ongoing progress,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.740
your entire body is looking decently lean,
you've got some nice vascularity going on,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.860
but you've still got that one last roll or
two of lower belly fat that won't seem to

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.329
go away no matter what you do.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.859
Well, it may not be the answer that you were
hoping to hear, but this is really the dead

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:49.020
simple reality, and that is that there are
no special techniques or special strategies

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.469
that will specifically allow you to target
your lower belly fat.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.030
The only way to get rid of that last bit of
fat is by continuing with your fat loss program

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.230
and focusing on lowering your overall body
fat percentage.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.770
As I've covered many times before, it is impossible
for you to spot reduce fat from specific areas

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.880
of your body.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.401
The resistance based exercises that you perform
in the gym only train the muscles that are

00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:20.740
involved in the specific movements that you're
performing, but this has no affect on the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.430
fat stores in and around the area that you're
training.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.800
Bench presses do not burn fat off of your
chest, bicep curls do not burn fat off of

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.260
your biceps, and lower ab exercises do not
burn fat from your lower abs.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.120
Fat loss only occurs on a holistic total body
scale as you maintain a net calorie deficit.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.320
Over time through proper nutrition and increased
activity level and due to the way that our

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.870
bodies are genetically programmed to store
fat, the very last area that fat will be burned

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.590
from is the lower abdominal region.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.290
So just because you have some excess fat remaining
on your lower stomach, it doesn't mean that

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.610
you're doing something wrong or that there
is a specific fat burning technique that you

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.860
aren't properly employing.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.099
All it really means is that you haven't lowered
your overall body fat percentage far enough.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.120
The only solution is to stick to your diet
plan, keep hammering the weights and stay

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.700
consistent with your cardio.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.560
Losing lower belly fat is really just about
patience and perserverance.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.790
Now, if your overall fat burning progress
has plateaued then you simply need to create

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.930
a larger calorie deficit in order to stimulate
ongoing fat loss and you can achieve this

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.650
by either shaving one or two hundred calories
off of your daily intake, increasing your

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.220
activity level with some additional cardio
exercise, or through some combination of both.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.260
As you continue to lean down further and further
eventually that lower abdominal fat will begin

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.980
to melt away.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.020
One other note that I'd like to mention before
closing out this video is to keep in mind

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.650
that for the vast majority of people and even
for those who are in really good overall shape,

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.580
having some degree of noticeable lower belly
fat is perfectly normal.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.819
Don't let your perception be skewed here.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.580
All those pictures that you see online and
in the magazines of fitness models with ripped

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.500
8-packs all year round, you know, this only
represents an extreme minority of the population.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.190
It would require a very high level of time
effort and dedication to achieve a mid-section

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.530
of that caliber assuming that you have average
genetics and that you're not "chemically enhanced"

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.900
in any way.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.959
Wanting to reduce your lower abdominal fat
is obviously fine but just keep in mind that

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.140
being perfectly flat and ripped in this area
does require you to be quite lean overall

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.660
and to maintain that level of leanness on
an ongoing basis, and for most people this

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.599
is definitely not going to be easy.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.620
Personally I'm content at remaining at a body
fat percentage in the 10 or 12 percent range

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.319
most of the time with visible but certainly
not shredded abs and with a bit of extra lower

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.319
ab fat.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.349
For me the input/output that would be required
to have a ripped six pack all year round just

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:07.349
isn't worth it.

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.500
That's just me though, and the degree of overall
leanness that you truly want to achieve and

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.680
the amount of time and effort that you're
willing to expend to reach that goal is totally

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.030
up to you and it's something that you'll have
to decide for yourself.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.060
