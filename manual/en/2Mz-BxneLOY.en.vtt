bjbj Announcer: Welcome back to The David
Pakman Show. David: So I'm actually thinking

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.710
of reading George W. Bush's book "Decision
Points" that's coming out. He's doing an interview,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.430
he did the interview already with Matt Lauer,
it's going to air tonight. So by the time

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.840
some people hear this, it'll already have
aired. We'll have clips from it on our next

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.801
show. And one thing that's interesting I read
is that he's saying, remember when Kanye West

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:32.140
after Katrina said George W. Bush doesn't
care about black people? Louis: Oh, yeah.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.649
David: George W. Bush is saying that was the
worst moment of his presidency. [Laughs] There's

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.899
something just silly but also a little bit
insulting, I mean, what about the decision

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.460
to send people to war that ended up being
for reasons that didn't actually exist and

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.210
your Secretary of State made false claims
before... Louis: You'd think just having to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.410
make a decision about going to war might be
the worst... David: Than an entertainer calling

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.050
you a racist. Louis: Right. David: This is...
I actually think the clip is hilarious. He's

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.280
next to... Kanye West is next to Mike Myers,
we actually have it here. It is, it's just

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.490
one of the funniest things that's out... for
George W. Bush... Louis: Mike Myers is lie

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.570
frozen. He doesn't know what to do. David:
For George W. Bush it was one of the worst

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.860
moments, for me, it was one of the funniest
moments. [CLIP] Mike Myers: ... many ways

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.290
more profoundly devastating is the lasting
damage to the survivors' will to rebuild and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.650
remain in the area. The destruction of the
spirit of the people of southern Louisiana

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.770
and Mississippi may end up being the most
tragic loss of all. Kanye West: George Bush

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.100
doesn't care about black people. [Laughter]
Myers: Please call... Chris Tucker: In the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.040
past few days... [END CLIP] David: OK, and
then it switches to Chris Tucker, who just

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.540
seems completely shellshocked, and he doesn't
know what hit him. He's just been handed a

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.160
grenade, a live grenade, from Kanye West,
where he says, "George W. Bush doesn't care

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.140
about black people," and he has to somehow
run with it now. So this is addressed in the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.110
interview with Matt Lauer, so I look forward
to seeing that. And Matt Lauer asks him, we

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.270
have a transcript, "You remember what he said?"
And George W. Bush says, "Yes I do, he called

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.080
me a racist." And Matt Lauer says, "Well,
what he said, 'George Bush doesn't care about

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.640
black people,'" and Bush says, "That's...
that's 'he's a racist', and I didn't appreciate

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.470
it then, I don't appreciate it now. It's one
thing to say I don't appreciate the way he's

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.170
handled his business, it's another thing to
say the man's a racist. I resent it. It's

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.530
not true. And it was one of the most disgusting
moments in my presidency." Hmm. Interesting.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.970
I mean, as much as I can understand not liking
being called a racist, if Kanye's remark was

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.660
one of the "most disgusting moments" of the
presidency, this guy is out of touch with

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.770
what went on during his own presidency, is
he not? I mean, I would've put the senseless

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.750
war in Iraq, the economic crisis, ahead of
Kanye West saying, "George W. Bush doesn't

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:52.880
care about black people." Louis: Do you think
his book is just a way to improve the way

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.840
people saw his presidency? David: Well, it's
interesting, now when you talk to people about

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.290
George Bush, many of them still say what they're
saying about Obama already, he's the worst

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.530
president ever, but there is less of the kind
of rage that you, that we were getting, don't

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.260
you think, Louis? The anger and the vitriol
about George W. Bush, it seems you do need

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.530
a few years to start looking at things more
objectively. In a sense, though, thinking

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.850
back, some of the things that went on, with
cooler heads prevailing now, with a few years,

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.290
actually seem more crazy, right? I mean, some
of the things that Bush said, some of the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.319
things he did, the way that the Iraq war was
sold. When we think back to it, it almost

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.410
has taken on less of an emotional component
but more of a "how on Earth did that happen".

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.931
Louis: A logical component. David: Exactly.
Louis: What were we thinking? David: What

00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:45.060
on Earth were people thinking at the time?
What was George W. Bush thinking? And apparently

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.730
he also admits to a bunch of waterboarding-related
stuff, and I have some of that here as well.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.130
We'll go through more of this once the interview
actually airs, but here's just a little bit

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.730
of an excerpt. I think we have it. Here we
go. [CLIP] Matt Lauer: ... "be impossible

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.040
to reach definitive conclusions about my presidency
or any recent presidency, for that matter,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.240
for several decades." So having said that,
though, isn't that the purpose of a book like

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.990
this, to at least either cement perception
or change perception? George W. Bush: Well,

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.252
I... kind of, but the main purpose of the
book is to have a starting point... no, not

00:04:21.252 --> 00:04:27.710
a starting point, just a data point for future
historians. I, I... you got to... I... this

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.940
may seem strange to you, I don't really care
about perceptions at this point in time. I

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:40.530
served, I gave it my all, and I'm a content
man. And the book has been a part of the transition

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.460
process to private life, and it's a way for
me to put the reader in the environment in

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.520
which I had to make decisions. [END CLIP]
David: Interesting. I look forward to actually

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.650
seeing this interview if that is any indication.
If this part right here at the beginning is

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.022
any indication, then this is going to be one
very interesting interview. [CLIP] Lauer:

00:05:00.022 --> 00:05:04.160
 ... isn't that the purpose of a book like
this, to at least either cement perception

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.370
or change perception? Bush: Well, I... kind
of, but the... David: [Laughs] You got to

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.300
love it, Louis. I mean, this, it's just, it's
compelling video, is it not? Louis: It's compelling

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.770
video. It's always compelling when you've
got George W. Bush. David: It's... the more

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.451
I see that now, I am brought back to when
he would do the press conferences, and I look

00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:29.100
forward to seeing that interview. I might...
I never even read any of these typs of books,

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:41.320
I'm curious as to what he says in it. Announcer:
