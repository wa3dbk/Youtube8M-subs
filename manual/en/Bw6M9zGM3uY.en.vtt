&gt;&gt;Joe Bereta: Hello, welcome to SourceFed. I'm Joe Bereta. 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.060
[MUSIC]

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.320
Conditions in the Mississippi River in
the Wisconsin region were perfect earlier

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.969
this week for the annual emergence of the
mayfly, a delicate dance dedicated to rising

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.650
from the mighty Mississippi as one gigantic,
horny swarm, to take to the sky and make sweet

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.449
sweet love, lay eggs and die. Tis the tragic
sexy life of the Mayfly. These little buggers,

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.529
spend up to 4 years developing underwater,
munching on plant and algae stuffs, until

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.500
they rocket through insect puberty, sprout
wings, and accept a mission to boogie and

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.340
die. Adult mayflies live for one day, knock
boots and then their done

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.000
No more existence.  No awkward next morning. No

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.870
is she gonna call me? Just sexy sexy death.
And oh, bonus, they have two penises and two gonopores.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.800
So it's like sex squared. The massive flying
death orgy is a natural, yearly occurrence

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.490
that is as expected as Spring's first fragile
flower and the gentle cascade of winter's

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.480
first flake...except this is all sorts of
messy and gross... and huge! This year's swarm

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.530
was big enough to be considered a MAJOR EMERGENCE...and
their sexcapdes were so colossal and vast

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.570
that they lit up weather radar screens like
it was Christmas. Sex Christmas. The swarm

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.720
was thick and on July 20th, La Crosse, Wisconsin
was treated to quite the show courtesy of

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.330
these insect-a-bitionists. The mayflies coated
walls, street lights, gas stations, atms,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.560
roadways, and everything as they quested for
mates and diddled. Male mayflies die right

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.560
after ejaculation, best orgasm ever, or worst,
and their carcasses are everywhere. The ladies

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.320
quickly find a water source, squirt out some
offspring, and die. In 2012 the body count

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.460
was so high they enlisted the snowplow brigade
to clean things up.&nbsp; This year, at least

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.620
one car accident was attributed to slick conditions
created by the mayfly jelly smeared all over

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.580
roadways. Now, although this may send the
heebie-jeebies crawling through your body

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.930
spots, this momentary inconvenience to humans
is actually a really good thing. A great swarm

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.799
is an indicator of healthy water conditions.
If mayfly counts are low, it's a sign that

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.040
pollution levels are high. Animals also love
when the Mayfly cult takes flight to drink

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.820
the sex kool-aid. It is an all you can eat
buffet of biblical proportions. So, natures

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.160
is cool ya'll. It's too bad, when I was a
kid, I came across this VHS tape that had

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.920
a performance art piece of some guy doing
the life cycle of the Mayfly.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.280
I wish I could show you guys,
but I can't. I don't know why I even brought it up.  So instead, why don't you guys

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.040
in the comments down below create a little Mayfly poem about the love cycle and the life cycle of the Mayfly.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.860
And I'll read it and I will indulge in in.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.190
And it will be just for me. 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.190

I am Joe Bereta and before you go, I have a little bit of word play for you. 

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:47.395
What did the male Mayfly say to the female Mayfly after they consummated their relationship?

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.340
Nothing. Because he was fucking dead.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.340
