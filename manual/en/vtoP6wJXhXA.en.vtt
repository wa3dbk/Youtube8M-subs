00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:37.369
             Every year is the same Years, yet the time Is the day you left me

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:57.229
Memories still at the door positions
And you're still in my heart

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.840
Every year I ask about you the way We walked in
Where are you dear friend Give me back my life

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:12.069
l dream to go with you in the same way again under the rain and talk

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:25.520
Every year I ask about you the way We walked in
Where are you dear friend Give me back my life

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Every year I ask about you the way We walked in
Where are you dear friend Give me back my life

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.510
Every year is the same Years, yet the time Is the day you left me
