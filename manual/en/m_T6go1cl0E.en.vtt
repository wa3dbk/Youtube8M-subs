Hi, I'm Karen for Expert Village. Now we are
going to pull the bedding section down like

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:24.039
this. Then turn it over and there is our sleepy
time bear and again we are just going to stitch

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.130
a little bit here on the sleepy time bear.
We don't have the arms sticking out cause

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:43.690
he is all tucked in bed nicely. Just rethread
your needle and just tact those sides. It

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:58.510
goes almost flat across when you just a little
tack in here to hold it in place. I'm going

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:21.119
to put the knot on the back so we don't see
it. (sewing) Reknot your thread and just tact

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.869
the other side. You want it to be pretty tight
cause you don't want when the bear is being

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:36.859
when the clothing is changed from bedding
to dress you don't want it to be slipping

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:44.189
up over the bears head. So you want to pull
it fairly tight before you tack it down right

00:01:44.189 --> 00:02:10.330
here on the side. I would put a little bit
of a knot right here on the back. (sewing)

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:20.690
Trim any thread that is sticking out of there
and there is our sleepy time bear and if we

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:31.069
flip it over and just pull down the cloth,
you have a awake bear. This is a great bedtime

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:37.319
toy for a child. You can talk about this bear
is awake and this bear is asleep.
