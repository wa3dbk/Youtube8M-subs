00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:08.000
Cost wise, I'm in the San Francisco area--I
mean, I'm in San Jose. And the price between

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.660
San Jose and San Francisco can be a thousand
or two thousand or three thousand different,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.360
which I think is ridiculous. And then who
you go to. On average, I heard dental implants

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.680
with crowns and the whole sha-boom can be
from fifteen hundred all the way to eight

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:34.210
thousand dollars per tooth. So, there's got
to be some room for in between, but I think,

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.000
on average, it depends again on materials
which you use. And the other thing is the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.790
practitioner. Does this practitioner have
some experience or not and are they going

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:53.469
to be able to be confident to guarantee their
work. That comes into major play, because,

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.309
you know, like for my office you put the implants
in, but you know on average it takes the human

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.389
body one year for that bone to become totally
solidified, meaning totally healthy and strong.

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:12.259
And in between that, we just don't know. And
that's the uncertainty that we just cannot

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.619
control. And so in my office we basically
say when we put the implant in, we'll give

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.159
you one year--one year of warranty. Anything
that happens. I mean you can open a beer bottle,

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.299
the thing cracks, don't tell me that, just
come in, something broken, I'll fix it for

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.789
you at no charge. But after that one year,
we know that the dental implant is there to

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:39.299
stay. If it can stay that long, it'll be there
to stay unless something happens, and ninety-nine

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.409
percent of the time, it's because of home
care. If the home care is not good, then the

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.919
implant will fail. The other one percent,
well, a small portion could be due to accident

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:56.470
or due to some type of, unfortunately, diseases.
But, in general, it's really home care. So

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.599
we know that if you have good home care, no
problem. Stuff will stick around and it'll

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:10.509
give you good mileage so to say. But on average
the cost, I say, if you're looking at a dental

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:19.250
implant that is of quality, and a good practitioner
with some good experience, it should really

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.500
be between three to four thousand, around
there, per tooth. Granted, if they don't have

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.250
to do any bone augmentation or other gum adjustments--you
know a lot of other things. But straightforward,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.671
it should be about three to four thousand,
mainly because of the cost of the materials,

00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:40.450
the laboratories, and the whole aspect of
doing this treatment.
