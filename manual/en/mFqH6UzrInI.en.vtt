00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.260
How does being perfect cause you to lose???

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:18.110
John, a 13-year-old basketball player, had
been playing basketball, since he was 8 years

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.820
old and absolutely loved the sport.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.660
His coaches commented on how hard he always
worked to improve his game and how he was

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.310
an inspiration to his teammates.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.739
However, John has not been getting as much
playing time lately as he used to.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.770
He still worked as hard as ever to fine tune
his shot and advance his ball handling skills,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.770
but not getting "played" had affected his
mood on and off the court.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.160
His mom has noticed he was more grumpy and
less patient with his little sister.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.440
John asked his coaches what he needed to do
to get more playing time.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.100
They told him he looked timid out there on
the court and that he needed to get more aggressive.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.890
This made John feel frustrated and stuck.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.010
He asked his Dad how he suggested he o I get
more aggressive.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.530
His Dad recommended what worked for him, to
carry himself with a certain confident "swagger",

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.560
which made him more confident on the court
and therefore more aggressive.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.350
This advise actually confused John even more,
because he did not remember acting like that

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.740
when he was star of the team a year ago.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.450
It just seemed like everything came naturally
to him.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.570
What John is not realizing is that his problems
began, when started to adopt a "perfectionist"

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.610
mindset.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.659
Somewhere between being the starter and leading
the team in scoring and today's troubles,

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.700
John taught himself he had to be perfect.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.350
...and this mindset eventually starting affecting
his game.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.950
As a mental trainer, I hear the word "perfectionist"
used by some people as a sort of "badge of

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.450
honor" they feel proud of.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.590
Unfortunately though as you see with John,
trying to be "perfect" causes all sorts of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.030
problems.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.009
The problems show up, when the perfectionists
fail to achieve perfection and then they beat

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.920
themselves up for it.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.669
They start by over-analyzing the game, picking
apart their mistakes and thinking a bunch

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.760
of negative thoughts about themselves.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.030
This leads to playing "scared", because they
are in fear that they will make a "mistake".

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.849
A self-defeating, never-ending cycle is created.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.250
Think about it...can you ever achieve perfection
in anything?

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.909
Are there any perfect players out there?

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.930
In fact, in most sports, players make many
mistakes and still win.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.459
In baseball, getting 3 out 10 hits is a success.

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.239
In basketball, most pros only make 50% of
the shots they take.

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.650
Are you getting the picture?

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.420
In every sport, we expect to make more mistakes
than do things "just right".

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.129
Failures are acceptable and you can still
win!

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:05.189
If you are a perfectionist, you are expecting
something that is impossible and setting yourself

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.209
up for repeated failure!

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.849
It is a formula for mental weakness.

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.659
Thinking you need to be perfect puts you in
a state of constant fear of not getting it

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:17.659
"right.

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.040
It's much better to set goals for yourself
that are achievable, but a bit of a stretch.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.239
There's a subtle, but powerful difference
between these 2 thoughts.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.329
See if you can see the difference...
1.

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.629
I'm a perfectionist and I must do everything
perfectly.

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:34.739
2.

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.439
I strive for perfection, but I don't have
to be perfect.

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:45.409
Sentence 2 gets you where you want to go by
allowing you to be human, while still striving

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.370
for continuous improvement.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.469
Sentence 1...well, that WAS John until he
came to see me.
