Hi! I'm David Kaynor and on behalf of expertvillage.com,
and I have my own website www.davidkaynor.com,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.449
and I hope you’ll visit it and find out
more about me and what I do. Fiddles are made

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:21.470
of variety of materials, but traditional materials
are wood. And at some point it was found that

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.359
some specific woods from South America were
preferable, had the best combination of weight,

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:36.220
stiffness, and handling factors and beauty.
This bow has the stick made out of pernambuco,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:46.380
which is an exotic wood of which there is
less and less. The hair is on this bow is

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:55.960
horse hair; horse hair has become somewhat
of a debatable matter because the current

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:04.989
focuser is Sumerian horse hair, which is considered
the best, is less and less available. Most

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.290
bows have a grip of some kind—this is leather—and
the winding is made of nickel silver; there

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.250
are some windings that use to be made of whale
bone. That is not politically correct anymore,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.720
and so they are made out of plastic. It looks
like whale bone. And the grip can be made

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.740
of different sizes and weights in order to
help effect the over all weight and weight

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:39.220
distribution of the bow. The frog, called
that for some reason,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:47.690
both holds ends of the hair and also changes
the tension of the hair. You have the frog

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:54.640
screw; there is a threaded screw inside, and
turning it one direction allows the frog to

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:02.240
move towards the tip, loosening the hair.
Turning the other direction holds the frog

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.269
away from the tip, tightening the hair tighten
gradually, until when it is about a quarter

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:19.439
to a third of a inch off the stick, it is
considered to be at a reasonable playing tension.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:25.519
Playing with a really wide dynamics range
between soft and loud, a fiddler will often

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:32.969
tighten up the hair somewhat tighter; and
then if it is all going to be played in a

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:38.290
uniform soft volume, the fiddler might leave
the bow slightly loosened.
