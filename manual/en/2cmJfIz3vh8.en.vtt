00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:14.334
If you going to take a Vitamin D supplement you might be wondering how safe are they.

00:00:14.334 --> 00:00:18.728
It turns out that Vitamin D is much more safe than people used to think.

00:00:18.728 --> 00:00:26.674
The current upper recommended intake level is now 4,000 international units or IU/day.

00:00:26.674 --> 00:00:33.779
It depends however what age group you're in, you are not going to give 4,000 IUs to your children.

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:38.004
Infants will only get a 1,000 as a maximum.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:44.135
6 months - 12 months you can give as much as 1,500 IU/day.

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:49.769
Young children below the age of 3 could get 2,500 IU/day

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.680
and then children 4-8 years could get 3,000 IU/day.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.221
All other groups, as I said before, could take as much as 4,000 IU/day.

00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:03.968
Based on our current evidence, these would be safe for you to take.

00:01:03.968 --> 00:01:09.380
Now the question is what happens to you if you take too much of a Vitamin D supplement.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.776
A lot of the symptoms of Vitamin D toxicity are somewhat general.

00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:20.049
You would lose weight, you'd lose appetite, you'd feel some muscle weakness.

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.806
This is really because your serum calcium levels are becoming too high.

00:01:24.806 --> 00:01:28.342
The only way you can learn whether that's happening is go to your doctor.

00:01:28.342 --> 00:01:34.090
Some supplements are more likely to get you in a place where there's some danger,

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.874
and you're going to have high vitamin D.

00:01:35.874 --> 00:01:41.766
This is a liquid supplement and by itself it is actually a fine supplement.

00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:47.798
Four drops will get you 400 IU's, which is a little bit less than the current recommendation for an adult.

00:01:47.798 --> 00:01:51.722
If you use the supplement that has a flavor to it

00:01:51.722 --> 00:01:55.638
your kids might think it is something fun to drink and take too much of it.

00:01:55.638 --> 00:01:59.183
If you're going to use a liquid supplement you should be a little bit more careful.

00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:06.307
Other supplements in pill form usually will be in the neighborhood of 500-1,000

00:02:06.307 --> 00:02:09.570
but sometimes as much as 5,000 IU/pill.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.683
You should just be careful about taking these, especially taking multiple ones.

00:02:13.683 --> 00:02:16.350
Be careful to read what's on the label.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.600
As with any other supplement if you're going to start taking a Vitamin D supplement make sure you talk to your doctor.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.180
Especially if you're taking medications.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.851
While we don't know of a lot of interactions between Vitamin D and drugs yet,

00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:33.095
there might be some and it's best if your doctor knows what you're doing.
