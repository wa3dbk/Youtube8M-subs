[SERIOUSLY DISTRACTED]
[presented by Glaceau fruit water]

00:00:17.493 --> 00:00:20.703
[Victoria] And Topshop is going to
design her dress for the VMAs.

00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:27.813
JD. What's going on?

00:00:27.813 --> 00:00:30.683
[JD] I just joined Tinder
and I'm obsessed.

00:00:30.683 --> 00:00:33.353
[Victoria] Oh, I love Tinder.
&gt;&gt;[JD] Well, here's my profile pic so far.

00:00:35.573 --> 00:00:42.143
[Paige] Oh. I suppose it says I am
a super catch and hang out easily.

00:00:42.143 --> 00:00:44.233
[JD] I was hoping it would
say I like carrots.

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:48.123
Hey, can you girls come look at my matches
and help find a good step-daddy for Serena?

00:00:48.123 --> 00:00:50.253
He's got to be in here some place, right?

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:58.013
[Victoria] Woah. Oh. Wow.
Okay, you certainly have a type.

00:00:58.013 --> 00:01:04.753
[JD] I like them big and strong. I want my man
to know his way around a GNC and my body.

00:01:04.753 --> 00:01:08.053
And then there's this guy. Cute, right?

00:01:09.783 --> 00:01:12.003
[Victoria] Hey, are you sure he doesn't
look familiar to you at all?

00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:16.773
[JD] No. He's a little pudgy and a little
pale. He probably doesn't eat meat.

00:01:16.773 --> 00:01:20.023
He probably needs a steak and
a vitamin but he's not that bad.

00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:23.793
He likes Springsteen, cheese fries, and
letting the wind carry him

00:01:23.793 --> 00:01:25.853
wherever it may be. He's kind of a poet.

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:29.943
[Victoria] Can you trust a poet?
Aren't poets just fancy liars?

00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:33.673
[Paige] Yup and in that one, he's
doing a duck face. Just don't. No.

00:01:33.923 --> 00:01:36.283
[JD] Alright. Well, listen.
Here's my message so far.

00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:39.273
Hey, babe. Loved your profile.

00:01:42.793 --> 00:01:44.623
[Paige] Ask a question?
&gt;&gt;[JD] Oh, good idea.

00:01:44.623 --> 00:01:47.933
Okay, let's see. Do you want
to have kids someday?

00:01:48.813 --> 00:01:52.563
[Lily] Maybe not something so intense.
How about, "Loved your profile.

00:01:52.563 --> 00:01:56.153
Where do you live? How many credit
cards do you have? Which ones are they?

00:01:56.153 --> 00:01:57.613
What are the numbers on them?
&gt;&gt;[Victoria] You know what,

00:01:57.613 --> 00:02:00.933
why don't you just try, "'sup?"
That's what I do.

00:02:01.963 --> 00:02:03.303
[Paige] Does that work for you, V?

00:02:03.303 --> 00:02:06.893
[Victoria] Chicks love it.
&gt;&gt;[JD] Hmm. Minimal. I like it.

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:10.953
Hey, babe. Loved your profile. Sup? Send.

00:02:20.943 --> 00:02:23.483
Okay, did he?
&gt;&gt;[Paige] No, not yet. Give it--

00:02:23.483 --> 00:02:24.843
[Lily] Oh, I heard it.
[excitedly screaming]

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:27.123
[Lily] Oh no, I didn't.
&gt;&gt;[Paige] False alarm.

00:02:27.523 --> 00:02:30.513
[drums]

00:02:30.513 --> 00:02:32.783
[Paige] Dan.
&gt;&gt;[Victoria] Dan. It has come to

00:02:32.783 --> 00:02:34.483
our attention that you
have matched JD on Tinder.

00:02:34.483 --> 00:02:37.023
[Paige] Are you trying to destroy
this PR firm inside out?

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:42.273
[Dan] I didn't mean to. It was a subconscious
boss fantasy. It was like a Freudian swipe.

00:02:42.273 --> 00:02:45.093
[Paige] No.
&gt;&gt;[Lily] No. Dan, no.

00:02:45.093 --> 00:02:46.553
[Dan] She sent me a really weird message.

00:02:46.553 --> 00:02:48.553
[Hey babe, loved your profile. Sup??]
[Paige] We never approved that many emojis.

00:02:48.553 --> 00:02:49.823
[Victoria] Is that a smiley poop face?

00:02:49.823 --> 00:02:52.803
[Dan] Do I have to ask her out now?
Is she going to fire me if I don't?

00:02:52.803 --> 00:02:53.803
Is she going to fire me if I do?

00:02:53.803 --> 00:02:56.173
[JD] [shouting] Girls. Get in here.

00:02:56.173 --> 00:02:58.533
[Paige] Just stick to your own kind. God.

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:02.253
[Lily] Gah.
&gt;&gt;[Victoria] I'm watching you, Dan.

00:03:02.253 --> 00:03:04.173
[Dan] Is that a threat?

00:03:04.173 --> 00:03:08.773
[JD] As my deputies at this PR firm, I put
a lot of trust into the three of you.

00:03:08.773 --> 00:03:10.653
[girls speaking at the same time]

00:03:10.653 --> 00:03:14.073
[JD] I'm not finished.
I require your honesty.

00:03:16.403 --> 00:03:19.323
The guy from Tinder hasn't messaged me
back yet. What does it mean?

00:03:19.323 --> 00:03:21.143
Is the internet not back up yet?

00:03:21.143 --> 00:03:22.913
[Lily] I asked the IT guy to stop by.

00:03:24.513 --> 00:03:28.593
[JD] Okay. Here's my message
so far. I will read it.

00:03:28.593 --> 00:03:33.183
[Lily] Hey, just thinking about you. Like
Frank Ocean. Do you know him?

00:03:33.183 --> 00:03:36.183
He is music.
&gt;&gt;[JD] No. I meant musician.

00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:38.603
[Lily] I accidentally sent it.
&gt;&gt;[JD] No. Now I have to redo it.

00:03:38.603 --> 00:03:42.343
[message alert tone]
[JD] I meant musician. My bad.

00:03:42.343 --> 00:03:43.223
[message alert tone]

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:46.883
[JD] God, I can't get enough of
his picture. I think he's kind of

00:03:46.883 --> 00:03:52.913
beautiful now. He looks smart and sexy.
He likes pancakes. He has a goat.

00:03:52.913 --> 00:03:56.983
He's perfect for me. Serena.
Someone's got a daddy.

00:03:58.163 --> 00:04:00.843
Is the internet not back up yet?
&gt;&gt;[Dan] Okay. It's back up.

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:09.233
[JD] You're the poet? Oh no.

00:04:12.143 --> 00:04:14.853
Did you know this was going on
the whole time it was going on?

00:04:15.823 --> 00:04:19.402
Oh. I trusted you. Oh.

00:04:20.703 --> 00:04:24.113
[Dan] So, do you want to go on a date?
&gt;&gt;[JD] Don't talk to me.

00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:26.553
[Paige] Okay, it's time to go, Dan.
&gt;&gt;[Dan] It was a Freudian swipe.

00:04:26.553 --> 00:04:30.443
[JD] Oh god, please. Don't ever discuss
this when you leave this office.

00:04:30.443 --> 00:04:36.323
Do you understand me? Not a peep.
I am humiliated. Oh please. Just go.

00:04:36.323 --> 00:04:42.123
Go to lunch... I wanted his baby. Oh.
&gt;&gt;[Paige] Should I bring him back?

00:04:42.123 --> 00:04:44.693
[JD] No.
&gt;&gt;[Paige] I don't know what to do.

00:04:44.693 --> 00:04:45.943
[JD] Let's kill him.

00:04:45.943 --> 00:04:49.003
