00:00:00.735 --> 00:00:04.435
Hello everybody, some may already know NES and SNES Collector.

00:00:04.435 --> 00:00:06.886
Today I'd like to show you N64 Collector

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:13.398
It is an app for iPhone and iPod Touch and 
 it manages your entire library of Nintendo 64 games.

00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:18.019
In this list you will see every Nintendo 64 game ever released.

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.633
As a demo, let's try to add one of my games to 'My Collection'

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:27.701
You can type the name of the game at the 
 top, in this case 'Star Wars - Rogue Squadron'

00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:32.485
Boxart is available for every game.
We select that 
 we have the 'Cart' in this case

00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:38.383
When you tap on 'Info', you'll see the name, 
 publisher, rarity and value of the game.

00:00:38.383 --> 00:00:41.680
You can also view YouTube videos or buy the game of eBay.

00:00:42.864 --> 00:00:50.411
Let's try to add another game, in this case a boxed Donkey Kong 64.

00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:53.801
Unfortunately the box has been damaged.

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:57.585
Again, you type in the name of the game at the top

00:00:58.948 --> 00:01:03.834
We select that we have the 'Complete' boxed version. 

00:01:04.923 --> 00:01:12.330
Let's note down that this box was damaged

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.508
On this screen you can also keep track of duplicates in your collection.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.010
Next up is the 'My Collection' list, you will see 
 all the games you have added in here.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:36.363
Some games have icons next to them. The first indicates whether you have 
 the manual, the second indicates if you have the complete set.

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:42.920
There's also a 'Remaining' tab, this shows you all 
 the games you still have left to collect.

00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:46.390
There is also a 'Wanted' tab, this shows you 
 all the games on your Wanted list.

00:01:55.328 --> 00:02:03.620
There is also the 'Analysis' tab, this shows you the amount of games collected, 
 how many left to collect the total value and the rarest game.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:07.760
You can also email your collection

00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:12.580
