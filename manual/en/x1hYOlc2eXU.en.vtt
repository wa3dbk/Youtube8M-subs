Hi everyone I’m Ryoya.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:19.660
I’m making soba noodles with deep fried mochi which often served at soba restaurants as one of a seasonal menu in summer.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.420
I personally love this menu, so let’s make it!

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:44.100
This recipe is so easy to follow. I think nobody would fail to make this.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.860
I’ve been doing Veggie Dishes for a year now.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:57.100
And my kitchen is kind of brand new, so I’m going to redesign Veggie Dishes a little bit next month.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:12.300
Accordingly, I’, going to do Q &amp; A next month. If you have any questions to me, feel free to leave a comment!

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:22.340
It doesn’t have to be related to cooking. You can ask me whatever you want to ask.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.360
I will answer to your question in videos of July.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.940
See you next week!
