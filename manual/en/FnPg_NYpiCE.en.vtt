00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.320
This video shows how to perform a factory
reset on an HP tablet with Android.

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.440
If your tablet is not working correctly, or
if you plan to sell it or give it away,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.779
you may want to perform a factory reset.

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.529
Resetting your tablet erases your personal
data and restores the tablet to its brand

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.570
new factory settings.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.330

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.140
and if it does not start.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.070
A factory reset erases all the personal data
saved on your tablet,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.640
including any downloaded apps, system data,
app data, and settings, music and photos,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.920
other personal data such as files, emails, and contacts, 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.920
and your Goggle Account.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.480
After the reset, you can restore your Google Accounts 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.980
and any data that you synced to the Web.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.249
To ensure your app data, Wi-Fi passwords,

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:08.809

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.189

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.530
In the Personal section, touch Backup &amp; reset.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.420

complete these steps to reset your tablet.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.940
Before you perform a reset, remember to back up any personal files, 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.540
such as photos and music,

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.740
to Web storage or to an external storage device.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.600
Next, plug the tablet into a power outlet.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.900

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.040

If the tablet does not start normally,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.499
 you may have to perform a reset without power to the tablet.

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:06.139
