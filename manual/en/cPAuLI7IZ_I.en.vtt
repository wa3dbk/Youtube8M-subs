00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:05.266
[ MUSIC ]

00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.396
&gt;&gt;IMAGINE A CALIFORNIA
WHERE PEOPLE LEARN HOW

00:00:08.396 --> 00:00:12.066
TO SOLVE THE GREATEST TECHNICAL
AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF OUR TIME.

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:14.646
IMAGINE A CALIFORNIA

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:18.136
WHERE PREMIUM EDUCATIONAL
OPPORTUNITY IS ABUNDANTLY

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:19.476
AVAILABLE TO ALL.

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:24.936
IMAGINE A CALIFORNIA WHERE YOUR
IMAGINATION CAN BE HARNESSED

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.546
TO REACH THE HIGHEST LEVELS.

00:00:28.406 --> 00:00:32.316
NOW YOU CAN STOP IMAGINING
BECAUSE THAT WORLD HAS EXISTED

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:33.846
FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS.

00:00:34.756 --> 00:00:38.866
THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY
SYSTEM IS CELEBRATING 50 YEARS

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:40.436
OF WORKING FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:45.456
IN THAT HALF CENTURY, THE CSU
HAS GROWN AND MATURED ALONG

00:00:45.456 --> 00:00:48.236
WITH CALIFORNIA'S CULTURAL
AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT.

00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:52.166
WITH THE CSU SYSTEM HELPING
TO BUILD THE FOUNDATION,

00:00:52.346 --> 00:00:54.296
CALIFORNIA IS NOW RATED AS ONE

00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:56.566
OF THE LARGEST ECONOMIES
IN THE WORLD.

00:00:57.056 --> 00:01:01.176
THROUGH ITS MANY GRADUATES, THE
CSU CONTRIBUTES SUCCESSFULLY

00:01:01.176 --> 00:01:04.486
TO OUR SCHOOLS, COMMUNITIES,
AND NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:01:04.786 --> 00:01:08.126
IT IS THE CSU'S ALUMNI WHO
ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:09.396
IN TODAY'S WORLD.

00:01:09.906 --> 00:01:11.206
&gt;&gt;I THINK THE IMPACT OF THE CSU

00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:13.426
IN CALIFORNIA HAS
BEEN CONSIDERABLE.

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:15.986
BUT WE DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF
MONEY WHEN I WAS GROWING UP

00:01:16.026 --> 00:01:17.596
AND WE REALLY STRUGGLED.

00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:20.666
AND THE FACT THAT I HAD
ACCESS TO THIS EDUCATION

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.986
AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE
AND THAT I WAS ABLE TO GO

00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:27.296
THROUGH THE SYSTEM, GET
A DEGREE, AND THEN COME

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:29.496
OUT IN THE END AS
A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER

00:01:29.496 --> 00:01:33.176
OF CALIFORNIA SOCIETY IS
A TRIBUTE TO THE SYSTEM.

00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:35.626
&gt;&gt;I WOULD SAY THE
TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTIONS

00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:39.186
IN THE LAST 30-40 YEARS HAVE
ALL STARTED FROM CALIFORNIA,

00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:42.576
THEN THE REST OF THE
COUNTRY BENEFITS.

00:01:42.576 --> 00:01:44.876
NOW THE REST OF THE WORLD
IS BENEFITING FROM IT.

00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:47.886
THESE TECHNOLOGICAL
REVOLUTIONS REALLY COME

00:01:47.886 --> 00:01:50.686
OUT OF THE ENGINEERS
PRODUCED BY UNIVERSITIES

00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:51.986
LIKE CAL STATE LA YOU KNOW?

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:56.006
BUT I DON'T THINK THE COLLEGES
ARE REALLY GETTING THE TYPE

00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:58.216
OF RESOURCES THAT THEY
SHOULD BE GETTING.

00:01:58.216 --> 00:02:01.156
&gt;&gt;FOR US TO BE COMPETITIVE
IN THE GLOBAL WORLD,

00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:04.916
WE NEED TO HAVE ACCESS
TO CAMPUSES AND PROGRAMS

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:07.576
THAT THE CSU SYSTEM OFFERS
AND HAS BEEN OFFERING

00:02:07.576 --> 00:02:08.736
FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS.

00:02:09.176 --> 00:02:12.456
THE CSU CAN BE A VERY
IMPORTANT FACTOR IN DETERMINING

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:15.976
WHERE WE GO AS WE MOVE
IN TO THIS 21ST CENTURY;

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:18.306
WHETHER WE'RE GOING
TO BE COMPETITIVE

00:02:18.306 --> 00:02:21.066
AND AT THE CUTTING EDGE OR
WHETHER WE'RE NOT GOING TO

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:22.896
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S
IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE

00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:26.146
TO SUPPORT THE CSU
SYSTEM OVERALL.

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:29.346
&gt;&gt;GROWING UP IN SOUTH
LOS ANGELES

00:02:29.346 --> 00:02:34.166
IN NOT A VERY WEALTHY FAMILY,
MY OPTIONS WERE FAIRLY LIMITED.

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:39.266
IT PROVIDED A FOUNDATION AND
A STRUCTURE FOR ME TO BUILD

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:41.706
ON AS I GREW IN MY CAREER.

00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:47.946
THERE'S NOT A DAY IN MY LIFE
THAT I DON'T DRAW ON SOME

00:02:47.946 --> 00:02:49.366
OF THAT EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE

00:02:49.716 --> 00:02:52.186
THAT I GAINED AT
DOMINGUEZ HILLS.

00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:56.256
IT WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO ME AND
I JUST HOPE THAT IT CONTINUES

00:02:56.336 --> 00:02:58.466
TO EXIST IN THE FUTURE.

00:02:58.816 --> 00:03:02.316
&gt;&gt;THE FACT THAT YOU
SEE GRADUATES WORKING

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:06.316
AND BEING SELF-PRODUCTIVE
IN SUCH A VAST NUMBER

00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:10.196
OF AREAS REALLY SPEAKS
TO THE VALUE OF THE CSU.

00:03:10.336 --> 00:03:13.866
IT WILL LIKELY ALWAYS
BE A CHALLENGE

00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:18.056
TO YOU KNOW SUSTAIN
THE CSU SYSTEM.

00:03:18.746 --> 00:03:21.686
&gt;&gt;THE JOBS THAT WERE AROUND
WHEN I GRADUATED DON'T EXIST.

00:03:22.576 --> 00:03:24.836
THE JOBS THAT ARE NOW HERE

00:03:24.986 --> 00:03:28.086
THAT ARE THE BIG HOT JOBS
DIDN'T EXIST BACK THEN.

00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:31.926
WE WEREN'T TRYING FOR A
LITTLE CUBBY HOLE JOB.

00:03:32.256 --> 00:03:34.296
WE WEREN'T TRAINED FOR
A SPECIFIC POSITION,

00:03:34.296 --> 00:03:36.636
WE WERE TRAINED WITH THE BASIC
SKILLS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE

00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:39.356
TO ADAPT TO WHATEVER
WE COULD DO ONCE WE GOT

00:03:39.356 --> 00:03:40.856
OUT INTO THE CHANGING
JOB MARKET.

00:03:41.146 --> 00:03:43.836
THIS PROVIDES PEOPLE
A LEVEL OF EDUCATION

00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:45.066
THAT YOU JUST CAN'T FIND.

00:03:45.456 --> 00:03:47.566
IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS
TO THAT, WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

00:03:48.596 --> 00:03:51.206
&gt;&gt;YOU KNOW FOR ME I THINK
IF I WAS IN ANOTHER STATE,

00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:55.156
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN IN THE HIGH TECH AREA,

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:56.456
MAY NOT HAVE FINISHED COLLEGE.

00:03:57.706 --> 00:03:59.106
IT REALLY KIND OF OPENED

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:03.916
UP TO ME YOU KNOW JUST THE
ABILITY TO ATTEND COLLEGE.

00:04:04.296 --> 00:04:07.056
AND ALL THE NEW BUSINESSES
ARE...A LOT

00:04:07.056 --> 00:04:07.896
OF THEM ARE VERY HIGH TECH.

00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:12.546
AND THEY KIND OF JUST...YOU KNOW
A GOOD EDUCATION, YOU JUST KIND

00:04:12.546 --> 00:04:15.916
OF GET IN THE DOOR AND I
THINK THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM

00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:16.546
FEEDS THAT.

00:04:16.716 --> 00:04:17.716
I THINK IT WOULD BE INTERESTING

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:21.126
TO SEE WHAT THE CSU SYSTEM
HAS PRODUCED 50 YEARS

00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:23.256
FROM NOW, YOU KNOW 100 YEARS.

00:04:23.256 --> 00:04:26.196
&gt;&gt;THE CSU IS AN INVESTMENT
IN CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE.

00:04:26.586 --> 00:04:30.766
THE LIFETIME VALUE OF A CSU
DEGREE WILL ALWAYS OUTWEIGH

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:31.466
THE COST.

00:04:31.466 --> 00:04:34.226
THE QUALITY OF A CSU EDUCATION

00:04:34.226 --> 00:04:37.436
AND THE MANY DOORS IT
OPENS ARE WORTH FAR MORE

00:04:37.436 --> 00:04:38.996
THAN THE ACTUAL EXPENSE.

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:43.086
IT IS THE CSU THAT MAKES
CALIFORNIA BETTER, STRONGER,

00:04:43.386 --> 00:04:44.766
AND ECONOMICALLY SOUND.

00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:49.326
IMAGINE A CALIFORNIA WHICH
CONTINUES TO PUT ITS CONFIDENCE

00:04:49.326 --> 00:04:52.826
AND TRUST IN THE CSU
FOR THE NEXT 50 YEARS.
