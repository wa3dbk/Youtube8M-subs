00:00:03.646 --> 00:00:04.727
Hello, everyone.

00:00:04.732 --> 00:00:06.568
I'm Amanda D'Annucci and I'm going 
to be talking to you about

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.862
storytelling, conflict resolution, 
psychology and neuroscience.

00:00:10.328 --> 00:00:12.679
Did you know that 
by telling someone a story,

00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:15.252
instead of spewing out 
a mouthful of data,

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:17.567
that you can engage a much larger 
portion of their brain?

00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:22.780
The art of storytelling has psychological 
and neurological basis

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.536
that scientifically explains the natural
human predilection for narrative.

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:29.859
A vast portion of a person's brain

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.746
is activated during the listening to,
and telling of a story

00:00:33.746 --> 00:00:35.014
For instance,

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:36.582
the amygdala hippocampus system,

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:38.876
which is responsible 
for preliminary encoding

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:42.358
of episodic and autobiographic memories
is engaged;

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:44.587
the left perisylvian region

00:00:44.597 --> 00:00:46.992
where language is created is engaged;

00:00:46.992 --> 00:00:50.071
and also, it has been proven 
that the same sections

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:52.506
of the brain lights up when the storyteller

00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:54.465
or the respective listener interacts.

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:56.589
Quite simply,

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.153
narrative engages the entire human brain,

00:00:59.153 --> 00:01:01.610
the entire human experience.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.475
If a string of word can affect a person
in such a profound way,

00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:08.747
how powerful can the art of story be?

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:11.564
Stories can heal, stories can teach,

00:01:11.564 --> 00:01:14.183
stories can inspire, stories can enlighten

00:01:14.183 --> 00:01:15.602
stories can resolve.

00:01:17.732 --> 00:01:19.668
For my master thesis here at Gallatin,

00:01:19.668 --> 00:01:22.665
I'm exploring the power of story

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.662
and relation to conflict resolution 
and peace making.

00:01:25.662 --> 00:01:28.779
Story is an influential tool which 
can mold the most obstinate of minds

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:31.631
by means of appealing 
to an individual's pathos.

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:34.741
By using story as a communication tool,

00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:38.320
a pessimist understanding can be 
made into a relatable situation.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.774
There's an ample evidence of storytelling 
in a multitude of cultures around mankind.

00:01:43.884 --> 00:01:47.733
Individuals and societies of all sorts 
intertwine narratives

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:50.578
from oral folklore 
and hunter-gatherer tribes

00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:54.942
to the numerous story writers 
here in New York City,

00:01:54.942 --> 00:01:58.000
typing away their stories to become 
movies, Broadway plays, television shows...

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.249
According to Shephren, the stories that 
we tell about our own and other's lives

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:08.676
are a pervasive form of text, that which 
we construct, interpret and share experience.

00:02:08.676 --> 00:02:12.854
We dream in narrative, 
day dream in narrative

00:02:12.854 --> 00:02:15.611
anticipate hope, remember, despair

00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:18.734
gossip, learn, hate, and love, by narrative.

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:22.303
We do all of these things through narrative.

00:02:22.883 --> 00:02:25.173
Storytelling has been used 
to foster peace

00:02:25.173 --> 00:02:28.663
in a number of conflict-ridden areas
around the globe.

00:02:28.663 --> 00:02:31.554
So, why are stories 
so fantastically successful

00:02:31.554 --> 00:02:33.251
in helping reduce conflict?

00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:36.262
Stories relate how
a series of events occur,

00:02:36.262 --> 00:02:37.524
whether fictitious or not.

00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:41.265
Additionally, a story does not only lift
this series of events,

00:02:41.265 --> 00:02:44.169
but it illustrates how these events interact.

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:46.219
According to Van der Rohe,

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.530
the goal of narrative comprehension

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.677
is to construct a memory representation

00:02:50.677 --> 00:02:53.904
which the various individual parts 
of the narrative

00:02:53.904 --> 00:02:55.964
are connected in meaningful ways.

00:02:56.994 --> 00:02:58.597
So believe it or not,

00:02:58.597 --> 00:03:02.095
there's a researcher named Michael Jackson, 
at the university of Copenhagen,

00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:06.992
and he argues that storytelling offers
insight into the way people evaluate,

00:03:06.992 --> 00:03:09.449
discuss, and negotiate social 
and ethical strategies

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:13.126
for making communal life viable 
in war as well as in peace.

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.860
Specifically in Sierra Leone 
where conflict is high.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.837
The study Jackson performed focuses
on storytelling

00:03:18.837 --> 00:03:20.574
with the Coronco people in Sierra Leone.

00:03:20.574 --> 00:03:22.932
Throughout his storytelling sessions,

00:03:22.932 --> 00:03:27.273
the stories told of great political and 
social significance of the people involved.

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:31.174
And during some of the stories,
the storyteller sometimes give

00:03:31.174 --> 00:03:33.601
the listeners a chance 
to participate in their story.

00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:38.228
This participatory aspect of this approach
gives the listeners a chance

00:03:38.228 --> 00:03:41.044
to truly understand 
the ethical implications

00:03:41.044 --> 00:03:42.960
of the politically charged story.

00:03:44.138 --> 00:03:46.218
Jackson proclaims that storytelling

00:03:46.218 --> 00:03:49.558
does not always work toward 
a unified opinion of a situation.

00:03:49.558 --> 00:03:53.939
However, simply by its being 
a shared accent of singing together,

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.407
sitting together, speaking, 
sharing various viewpoints,

00:03:57.407 --> 00:04:01.426
that makes possible
the momentary semblance of a fusion

00:04:01.426 --> 00:04:04.875
of desperate and often 
undisclosed private experience.

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:06.905
The study concludes

00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:10.857
that the mutual sharing of stories 
make the participatants feel more inclined

00:04:10.857 --> 00:04:12.629
to be committed to their community.

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.533
In addition, the very active participating
in a shared event

00:04:16.573 --> 00:04:19.193
and referring separate experiences 
to a common source,

00:04:19.518 --> 00:04:21.843
promotes not necessarily a unified opinion

00:04:22.104 --> 00:04:24.301
but a strong bond within community ties.

00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:27.313
Storytelling promotes the concept 
of civil society,

00:04:27.313 --> 00:04:29.881
free people discussing
their common issues,

00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:32.639
and it provides individuals 
the opportunities

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.417
for individual expression
in a group setting.

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:40.278
A similar technique has been used 
in studying a case of conflict

00:04:40.278 --> 00:04:43.183
between Israeli and 
Palestinian Israeli students.

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:49.049
Baron discusses the conflict 
as very much rooted in how each side

00:04:49.049 --> 00:04:52.070
sees the other as perpetrator 
and themselves as the victim.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.603
For the first few sessions,
the meeting of the groups

00:04:55.603 --> 00:04:59.136
spend significant amount of time

00:04:59.136 --> 00:05:02.671
fighting over which side was 
or had been more victimized by the other.

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:07.425
The storytelling approach used 
in this workshop made it possible

00:05:07.425 --> 00:05:11.743
for the two groups to acknowledge
aspects of other stories

00:05:11.743 --> 00:05:14.287
that up until the workshop 
had been unknown to them

00:05:14.287 --> 00:05:17.511
or difficult for them 
to understand or accept.

00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:20.265
In her journal, 
a Palestinian female student wrote:

00:05:20.606 --> 00:05:23.240
"When Israeli spoke about
her father's feelings

00:05:23.271 --> 00:05:25.064
of not being at home in Israel,

00:05:25.107 --> 00:05:27.319
I could identify with that feeling,

00:05:27.364 --> 00:05:30.171
for the first time I thought that
the Israelis are not only enemies,

00:05:30.472 --> 00:05:33.751
but have similar feelings to those I have."

00:05:33.775 --> 00:05:35.724
The stories that they told

00:05:36.007 --> 00:05:39.145
helped the group move beyond 
this victim/perpetrator dynamic

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.896
and into an arena of acceptance.

00:05:44.285 --> 00:05:46.677
Stories provide a pathway of connection

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:51.798
for an individual or a community's values, 
principals, hopes, fears and dreams

00:05:52.025 --> 00:05:55.151
that induces respect 
and acceptance in the listener.

00:05:55.476 --> 00:05:59.385
Stories are vehicles that navigate
intellectual understanding

00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:02.244
but additionally the heart and 
soul of the reader,

00:06:02.244 --> 00:06:04.919
the listener, the inner mind's eye.

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.386
Thank you.

00:06:06.388 --> 00:06:10.388
(Applause)
