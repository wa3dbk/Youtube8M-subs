00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:07.743
- Lovely ladies in the house

00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:08.711
- Whoo!

00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:09.948
- Are you ready to roll?

00:00:09.948 --> 00:00:10.879
- Whoo!

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:11.924
- What are we making?

00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:13.780
- [Both] Irish Trashcans!

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.645
- Okay, we made this before,
okay, because I know some

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:17.397
of ya'll are going to say--

00:00:17.397 --> 00:00:19.256
But we didn't really make it properly.

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:21.903
- That his jack up man.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.660
- How'd you know?

00:00:23.693 --> 00:00:25.095
- There was a chick on the counter.

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:26.739
I can't remember how she
got on the counter anyway,

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:27.689
but she was on the counter.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.376
-Maybe she drank a little of this.

00:00:29.826 --> 00:00:31.106
- Blue Curacao.

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:32.105
Pour.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.936
Stop.

00:00:34.936 --> 00:00:36.031
Bobby, drop some ice in there.

00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:37.139
- Alright.

00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:38.880
- Whoo.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.474
- Ha!

00:00:39.474 --> 00:00:40.674
- Without it splashing everywhere.

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:41.954
- Okay fuck it.

00:00:43.772 --> 00:00:45.316
- Vodka, Gin, pour.

00:00:47.804 --> 00:00:48.519
Stop.

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.832
Rum, Triple Sec, pour.

00:00:53.528 --> 00:00:54.635
Stop.
- [Bobby] (mumbling).

00:00:55.142 --> 00:00:55.964
- Ha!

00:00:55.964 --> 00:00:57.227
- This a strong drink.

00:00:57.227 --> 00:00:59.005
Now I'm going to hit with
some Peach Schnapps, why?

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:00.834
Because I'm sexy, I'm peachy.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.279
- That does look pretty.

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.866
- Yeah.

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.505
- Which lucky girl wants to do the honors?

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:09.811
- I'm scared, you do it.

00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:11.072
- What do you mean you're scared?

00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:12.074
Go ahead.

00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:15.508
I just turned it upside
down in there, okay?

00:01:15.688 --> 00:01:16.621
Go ahead.

00:01:17.365 --> 00:01:20.159
- Ooh, that does look pretty.

00:01:21.364 --> 00:01:22.564
I like that.

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:23.724
- Perfect.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:25.384
Just like that.

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:27.393
- Whoo, oh, perfect.

00:01:27.393 --> 00:01:28.830
- And there you have it.

00:01:29.306 --> 00:01:31.431
The Irish Trashcan.

00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:32.965
Go ahead, try it out.

00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:34.761
- Alright, I'm not scared.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.270
- Ya'll want me to stir it
up, to make it really green?

00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:43.138
- You know you actually
can't taste the liquor.

00:01:43.138 --> 00:01:43.643
- Really?

00:01:43.643 --> 00:01:45.376
- No, I don't think we're
mixing it all the way.

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:47.154
Like, the top half tastes delicious.

00:01:47.154 --> 00:01:48.416
- Let me try the very bottom.

00:01:50.608 --> 00:01:52.251
- Was the bottom intense,
or are we still good?

00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:53.141
- No.

00:01:53.141 --> 00:01:53.657
- Really?

00:01:53.657 --> 00:01:55.095
- Yeah, this is...

00:01:56.174 --> 00:01:57.192
This is impressive.

00:01:57.192 --> 00:01:59.129
- Let's get down there and
make the whole thing green.

00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:00.727
That's a pretty color.

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:01.689
- That is a pretty color.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:02.669
- Oh my God, yeah.

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:03.964
- Ooh it's so pretty.

00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:08.478
Yeah.

00:02:08.478 --> 00:02:09.257
- You like it?

00:02:09.257 --> 00:02:10.278
- Yeah I can't taste it.

00:02:10.278 --> 00:02:11.965
- Well who knew, I thought
it tasted like ass,

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.010
but I was wrong.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.848
(laughter)

00:02:13.848 --> 00:02:15.611
- What do you guys know about
trashcans, anything you have

00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:16.937
to share with us?

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:19.307
Your experiences with the
trashcan, have you ever made out

00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:20.479
behind a trashcan?

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:21.008
- [Both] No.

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:22.790
- Have you ever made
love next to a trashcan?

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.525
- [Both] No.

00:02:23.525 --> 00:02:25.197
- You haven't lived until
you've done that, okay?

00:02:25.197 --> 00:02:27.548
Every bartender's been
out by the trashcan.

00:02:27.548 --> 00:02:29.092
- Oh, doing it in the alley.

00:02:29.092 --> 00:02:31.322
- Are you trying to tell
us during your work hours,

00:02:31.322 --> 00:02:32.788
thats what happens?

00:02:32.788 --> 00:02:35.034
- Not me personally, but
all the bartenders I've

00:02:35.034 --> 00:02:37.858
worked with, have done
stuff next to the trashcan.

00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:40.636
- So all of your bosses
watching this, they're going to

00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:43.539
know now, when you go and
take that really long "break."

00:02:44.937 --> 00:02:47.843
- But let me tell you something,
in bartender life, that's--

00:02:47.843 --> 00:02:48.818
I mean it depends--

00:02:48.818 --> 00:02:50.551
- I think it's meeting random
girls at the bar, like,

00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:52.049
"Hey you want to go back
behind the trashcan?"

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.907
- No, listen, listen, see,
okay, because firstly,

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:56.449
a lot of people go to bars
to hook up anyway, right?

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.389
And usually, like if dudes work together,

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.857
guys are cool, we click.

00:02:59.857 --> 00:03:02.482
Like everybody got a
role, and so you be like,

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:03.584
"Hey look here man."

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:04.629
Not me personally, I've
seen this done though.

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:05.423
- Right.

00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:06.253
- Uh huh.

00:03:06.806 --> 00:03:07.938
"I got to make a move somewhere."

00:03:07.938 --> 00:03:08.559
You know what I mean?

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:10.696
And then he's like, "Okay"
and you cover for him.

00:03:10.696 --> 00:03:12.100
So if the manager comes over you say,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.974
"Oh, he's in the bathroom,
he'll be right back."

00:03:13.974 --> 00:03:15.768
"Oh, he went to change,
went to get some ice."

00:03:15.768 --> 00:03:17.436
"Oh, he's changing one of the kegs."

00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:17.953
You know?

00:03:17.953 --> 00:03:19.141
So you cover for your boy that way.

00:03:19.401 --> 00:03:21.381
The mojitos!

00:03:21.381 --> 00:03:23.781
Strawberry mojito by the way, the Mayon.

00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:25.894
- I got a small pain on that,
I wore my heels today, are--

00:03:25.894 --> 00:03:28.863
- No, no, what I see, a lot
of practice in this day.

00:03:28.863 --> 00:03:29.875
- Okay.

00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:32.118
You know I would get
on my knees if I could,

00:03:32.118 --> 00:03:34.149
but it's too tall for that.
