00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.980
In a parallel universe where life is in a 16bits form...

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.820
The music scene is being dominated by fake artists and DJs.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.340
They rise to fame and become super start in the media because of 2 important tools.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.320
The first are ghosts producers they hire to
make music for them

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.860
so they can release it under their names.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.240
The second is a dangerous power brought from the pits of averno.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.900
This mystical evil power is called … 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.700
Money.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.520
These evil creatures are known as:

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.740
Their goal is to destroy the love for the
music in this universe,

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.320
by making all of it to sound the same and stupid,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.400
using a terrifying and malicious artefact known as:

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.460
The template.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.180
The template is still not being used at its maximum power,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.380
so they can manipulate people.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.300
But experts estimate that once all the music sound exactly the same,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.160
there is no going back.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.160
The easy catch these template tunes have,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.460
will turn into hate for it,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.180
everybody will hate the music till the end of time.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.680
But there is still chance for real music to survive.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.480
Help Dr. Kucho on his crusade for the love of music.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.200
Fight the fake and avoid cheese music to poison the weak minds.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.160
Find the template and destroy it,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.300
so ghosts producers won’t be able to make music for anyone,

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.100
and fake artists will be forced to live by
their own merits...

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.400
if they have any.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.420
Its time to send these creatures back to the 16bits hell they came from,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.940
using musical supports,

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.900
as weapons.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.820
Ghosts’n DJs is a project born from the love of music,

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.860
and it’s a tribute to the arcade games from the 80’s and 90’s.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.280
No ghosts programmers were used in the making of this videogame.
