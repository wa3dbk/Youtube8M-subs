00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.180
Now that you have been introduced to this
topic of color correction by the

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.890
numbers, what I want you to do is apply what
we know to an image.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.020
Here you can
see I have two documents open: numbers.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.020
psd and robyn.psd.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.919
I have numbers.psd
just to illustrate what we are going to try

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:32.919
to do.

00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:35.730
What we are going to try to do is have our
cyan, that's 1/3 to 1/5 of our

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.620
magenta or yellow, magenta and yellow are
close, yellow is always higher.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.880
We
turned on that top layer, Group 1; there we

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.880
can see some good amount.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.829
Let's say
cyan is 10, magenta is 30, yellow 32.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.710
Well, let's go ahead and apply that logic
to this photograph of robyn.psd here.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.920
I'll press F to go to full-screen view mode.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.489
I'll grab the Eyedropper tool by
pressing the I key on the keyboard.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.890
Now when I do that, it will activate this
Eyedropper point that I have already set.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.370
Now if that point isn't there, all that I
need to do is hold down the Shift key

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.199
and then click to add a point.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.420
To remove a point, you will hold down the
Shift

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.789
key and click-and-drag it off the photograph.

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:11.210
Next thing you want to do is open up your
Info palette.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.960
If yours isn't open,
you can navigate to Window, and then choose

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.250
Info or the F8 key.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.429
Well, now that
the Info palette is open, you can see that

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:21.770
my point 1 has already been changed
to these CMYK values.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.119
You can change those by clicking on the Eyedropper
icon

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.160
and changing it from RGB down to CMYK.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.759
Now one of the things that I notice here is
that my magenta is much higher than

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:31.759
my yellow.

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:32.979
That is not a good thing.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.600
So I'm going to go ahead and add some
yellow to this image and I'll do that by clicking

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.600
on the Curves icon.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.090
Next what
I'm going to do is press Option+5 on a Mac,

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.630
Alt+5 on a PC in order to navigate
to the blue channel.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.380
This is where we can add blue or add yellow.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.929
So I'll click on the Target Adjustment tool,
hover over this little point.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.580
What
I want to do is add yellow, so I'm going to

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.930
click-and-drag down and I'm going
to watch my points.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.679
I'm looking to make sure that this yellow
is higher than my

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:57.679
magenta.

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.319
Well, so far so good, how about our cyan?

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:06.630
Now our cyan is currently at 11 %, three times
11 is 33, five times 11 is 55.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.510
So our cyan is much too high, right?

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.869
There is something there; there is a
problem with that channel.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.680
So we navigate back to our Red-cyan channel.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.590
Now
with this Target Adjustment tool, we will

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.930
then hover over this point and we are
going to click-and-drag in order to reduce

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.960
some of that.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.940
Now what we are looking to do is to try to
get this in range, three times 6 is

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.620
18, five times 6 is 30.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.620
Okay, yeah.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.030
Well, that fits in the range, although now
my yellow dropped down a bit.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.379
Back to the Yellow channel.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.811
In order to access the Yellow channel, do
you

00:02:31.811 --> 00:02:34.000
remember that shortcut to go to that Blue-
yellow channel?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.989
Well, it's Option+5
on the Mac, Alt+5 on a PC.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.020
You can also always select the channels from
the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.050
pulldown menu.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.590
I need a little bit more yellow, so I'll click-and-drag
down.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.120
Now this image is in a really good place.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.900
It is color correct.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.260
Let's go ahead and click off the eye icon
for a second.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.310
Here is our before,
here is the after.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.260
This image looks so much better and those
numbers fall right

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.549
within this recipe that we talked about in
the previous movie.

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.629
Now this is great because our skin is going
to look good and in addition, the

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.719
rest of the image is going to look good.

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:05.629
What we have done here is we have
color corrected our image based on a skin

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:06.769
tone.

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.870
We are going to prioritize the skin because
in people photographs and in

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.590
retouching, that is incredibly important,
right?

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.469
Now that we have that looking
good, the rest of the image will look good

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:24.909
as well.
