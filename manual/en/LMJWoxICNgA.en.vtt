Okay, the second to the last process of our
table is we're going to sand it. Sanding is

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.960
probably the biggest pain to do, but it's
one of the most important things to really

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.560
finish your piece out. With that I'm going
to use a palm sander. What I've done is I've

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:26.560
selected two different grits of sandpaper.
The way if you notice these numbers here I've

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:34.920
got 220 and 150. The smaller the number like
80 grit is very rough, the higher the number

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.870
the finer the grit is to finish it up. Now,
a lot of carpenters, high end carpenters they'll

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:49.100
go from the 60 grit up to like a 325 grit.
I basically use just these two. Something

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.360
like this, the fact that I used plywood and
scrap wood I'm kind of what they call a paint

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.350
grade wood. In other words I want to sand
all these lines out and get rid of a lot of

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.510
the discrepancies, but what I've got is a
situation where the staining might not look

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:13.170
the best. Probably the best thing to do is
to paint it. So we're going to start out with

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:24.439
the 150, it's a nice in between side
and just sand away.
