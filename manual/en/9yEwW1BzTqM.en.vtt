00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.784
You know Michael's has everything you need this holiday season to make beautiful gift baskets.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.120
So we've got just a few things you need to get. 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.188
And then I'm going to show you some tricks on how to make them

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:26.292
look just like the professionals. First, you're going to start with your cellophane. 

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:29.496
Now the cellophane comes in different colors but I like to use the clear

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:31.031
because I really like to see what's inside the basket.  

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:35.402
Now a lot of the baskets are deep and depending on what you want

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.704
to put in them, you may need to alter the depth of the basket.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.205
Because when things are really heavy

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.341
they just kind of all fall down and you want to be able to see them. 

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.910
So I've just taken some Styrofoam

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.212
we've kind of made some tiers in the basket

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.715
So look, we have some great gourmet foods

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.052
now these are in select stores in Michael's, so you may want to check your local Michael's. 

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.754
We're just going to add different things into our baskets. 

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:59.225
These are so cute, these are little mixes. Some little coffees, we are going to tuck in here. 

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:03.563
I'm going to add some shred down in here. I don't need a whole piece of Styrofoam.  

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:07.600
But it's just going to give me some more height and it's going to help fill my basket. 

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:10.370
Now what we are going to do is we are going to pull up our other piece of cellophane.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.506
Now I've measured that side, so I know about how high I need it. 

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:16.776
You should really give yourself some extra of the cellophane

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.843
because you know what you can always cut off but you can't add to it. 

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:23.783
We're just going to pull our cellophane up and around. 

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:29.089
So you'll notice, I'm going to gather it up tightly. 

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:32.058
And then I'm going to tie it with a chenille stem. 

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:38.131
Now this is going to give us a chance to have it nice and tight before I put a bow on

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:46.272
Now you can take it and kind of pull it up, and then I kind of just like to trim off the top. 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.877
I made a beautiful bow ahead of time. 

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:55.348
And look what we are going to do, we are just going to tie our bow around out basket. 

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:02.122
And you know, you maybe, you use want to add a fun little ornament

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:06.259
to the front and you've got a beautiful basket that anybody would love to get. 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.760
But I've got a trick for those of you who

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.430
are maybe a little intimidated by the whole cellophane. 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.733
This is actually a cellophane bag and it actually comes in different 

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:16.402
sizes so you want to check out the size basket

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.404
you are going to make before you buy the bag to make sure it's

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.006
certainly going to fit down in there. 

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:23.443
And now I'm just going to pull the bag up around and tie it. 

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:29.849
This is a basket that anybody would be so thrilled to get 

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.417
and you should be very proud to give. 

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.586
I'd love to see what kind of great ideas 

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:36.689
you've got for making your gift baskets this holiday season
