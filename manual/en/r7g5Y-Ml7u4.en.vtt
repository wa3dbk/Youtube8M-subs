00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.754
[SIRENS]

00:00:12.754 --> 00:00:17.236
 

00:00:17.236 --> 00:00:19.228
[EXPLOSION]

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:41.638
 

00:00:41.638 --> 00:00:43.806
Could I speak to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:00:43.806 --> 00:00:44.306
Yeah.

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:48.653
 

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:50.585
Straight down to resuss.

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:52.920
This is a high-speed
motor vehicle accident.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.010
She's got severe burns
all over her body.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.390
This is a patient for
Dr. Tom [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.990
We've got a trauma
coming-- a blast victim.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.146
He's got an open facial wound,
two open abdominal wounds.

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:07.483
[CRYING]

00:01:07.483 --> 00:01:08.566
Professor Melinda Truesdale.

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.398
Yes.

00:01:09.398 --> 00:01:12.260
She's been involved
in a gunshot wound.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.625
Vital signs have been stable.

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:14.750
She's slightly tachycardic.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.244
She's evidently distressed,
and her main focus is her baby.

00:01:19.244 --> 00:01:21.087
OK, it sounds like
there's bullet entry

00:01:21.087 --> 00:01:21.840
on both sides at the moment.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.506
Can we connect her
up to the ventilator?

00:01:23.506 --> 00:01:24.260
Yeah.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.551
OK, and if we can put a pulse
oximeter on her other arm

00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:28.144
and some ECG leads when you can.

00:01:28.144 --> 00:01:29.560
I know it's going
to be difficult.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.800
We're giving you something
for the pain now, OK?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.110
And we'll need to get
some bloods off as well.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.602
We're just taking the
pressure off your baby.

00:01:36.602 --> 00:01:39.060
Now, I want you to take a big
breath in and hold it for me.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.970
That's the girl.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.060
You've done really well.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.210
She may well have
significant airway burns,

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.471
so she's going to need
14 litres of fluid,

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:47.220
and half of that in
the first eight hours.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.760
We need to get plans for an
urgent laparotomy, and probably

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.780
an urgent cesarean C-section.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.084
His heart rate's come down with
some fluid and some analgesia.

00:01:56.084 --> 00:01:57.625
Can you get the
trauma surgeon?

00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:00.645
He's going to need his abdomen
looked at in theatre promptly.

00:02:00.645 --> 00:02:02.990
Nursing staff just going
to make you comfortable.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.750
We're looking after
you and your baby.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.732
The clothing's actually sort
of melted onto her skin.

00:02:06.732 --> 00:02:09.065
It's going to be something
we're going to have to do in theatre.

00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:10.810
So saturation's still 94.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.180
Peter, well done.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.070
Oh, thanks.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.040
We'll call it there.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.440
This is a simulated case.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.290
But from a real
file, we'd see

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.505
a patient that presented
to a military hospital.

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.355
How did you find it today?

00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:22.560
Oh, very challenging.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.110
Very sick lady,
lots of injuries,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.526
a lot of things that need to
be done all at the same time.

00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:28.360
I thought the simulation
was excellent.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.980
To think that this is
done in a field hospital.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.880
If you had a doctor
who had been involved

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.930
with this sort of stuff
overseas in the Air Force,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.880
being able to
treat such patients

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.320
in such difficult circumstances
would be an invaluable resource

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.720
in a trauma hospital such
as this one in Australia.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.250
For a young doctor to
join the Air Force,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.020
the experience and rewards from
a humanitarian perspective,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.770
but also from a
medical perspective,

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.620
would be fantastic.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:03.877
