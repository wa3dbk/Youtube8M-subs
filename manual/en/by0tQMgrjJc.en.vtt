-[whistling]

00:00:03.412 --> 00:00:04.714
Bored.

00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:06.802
-Oh, boy! This place is super-neat!

00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:09.403
-Hey! Hey look, it's Midget Umbrella!

00:00:09.403 --> 00:00:11.214
-Oh, hi. Hi, there.

00:00:11.214 --> 00:00:12.561
-Hey! Hey, Midget Umbrella!

00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:15.580
Are you worried about a "little" rain? [laughs]

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.580
[both laughing]

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:23.858
-[stops laughing] Okay. Wasn't that funny.

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:27.152
-[stops laughing] What's an umbrella?

00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:32.822
-Okay, so that's an umbrella.

00:00:32.822 --> 00:00:34.341
-Uh-huh.

00:00:34.341 --> 00:00:35.875
-And that's a midget.

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:37.036
-Hey!

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:38.615
-[laughs] You get it?

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:40.752
-[laughs]

00:00:40.752 --> 00:00:42.237
Uh... no.

00:00:42.237 --> 00:00:44.372
-[groans] You're not from around here, are you?

00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:46.277
-The poor guy probably grew up in the dark.

00:00:46.277 --> 00:00:47.965
Why do you think everything's so new to him?

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.549
-So he really is a "dimwit." [laughs]

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.475
-No, I'm not a dimwit. I'm a mushroom.

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:55.798
-Yuck. There's an entire room made of mush?

00:00:55.798 --> 00:00:58.073
-No, he IS a mushroom.

00:00:58.073 --> 00:00:59.048
-If he's just a room,

00:00:59.048 --> 00:01:01.770
then what does the rest of the house look like? [laughs]

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.575
-No! Mushroom. Like a toadstool.

00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:05.643
-Huh?

00:01:05.643 --> 00:01:07.108
-Nuh-uh, he's not a toadstool.

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:08.527
That's a toadstool.

00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:10.938
-[croaking]

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:13.364
-But if that's a toadstool, then what's that?

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:15.075
[frog croaks] -Duh.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.411
It's a frogchair. [laughs]

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:18.953
-Wow, this is amazing!

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:21.106
Nothing ever happens where I'm from

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:22.453
and now there's toadstools

00:01:22.453 --> 00:01:24.513
and frogchairs everywhere!

00:01:24.513 --> 00:01:26.030
-Ooh! Ooh! If you like amphibians,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.655
then you're gonna love my motorboat.

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:29.326
[fluttering lips like a motorboat engine]

00:01:29.326 --> 00:01:30.906
-Yay! Motorboat!

00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:32.114
-Would you stop it already?

00:01:32.114 --> 00:01:33.646
You're getting spit all over the counter.

00:01:33.646 --> 00:01:35.224
-Ooh! Ooh! You should try this one.

00:01:35.224 --> 00:01:36.617
Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya...

00:01:36.617 --> 00:01:38.524
[both babbling tongues]

00:01:38.524 --> 00:01:39.730
-Would you guys quit it?

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.018
[babbling continues]

00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:41.959
Stop!

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:42.840
-I can even do the other side.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.956
[babbling continues]

00:01:43.956 --> 00:01:46.602
-Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!

00:01:46.602 --> 00:01:47.649
[laughter]

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:48.650
Geez!

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.733
-You know what, Mushroom?

00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:52.319
You really are a "fun-guy." [laughs]

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.112
-[groans]

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:54.989
-[fluttering lips like a motorboat engine]

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.408
-Hey, Midget Apple, look!

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:59.118
He's doing the Truffle Shuffle. [laughs]

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:00.995
-Yeah, he's cute as a button.

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:04.713
-[laughs] Midget Apple made a funny! [laughs]

00:02:04.713 --> 00:02:06.989
-[groans] You're a bad influence, you know that?

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:09.637
-Hey, hey Orange! What are we gonna do next?

00:02:09.637 --> 00:02:10.881
-Hmm, let me see.

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:13.133
-Oh, come on! Don't encourage him.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.381
-Ooh! Hey, Mushroom! Hey, Mushroom, hey!

00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:16.139
-Yeah?

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:17.159
-Mario!

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:17.763
-Huh?

00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:19.389
-Whoo-hoo! [blipping sound]

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.457
-Ugh!

00:02:20.457 --> 00:02:23.894
-Hey, everybody! It's me, Mario!

00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:26.169
-[disappointed]: Aw. Nice one, Mario.

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:28.564
Why don't you just "grow" away? [laughs]

00:02:28.564 --> 00:02:30.901
-Oh, what's the matter, Orange?

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.069
Why are you acting so "spore"?

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.655
-[laughs]

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:35.906
-Wha-ha-ha!

00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:36.781
-[groans]

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:40.197
-Oh, boy! Time for Mario to get his Frog Suit.

00:02:40.197 --> 00:02:41.490
-Huh?

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.252
