00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.259
Earth's ecosystems have always been changing,
with species mixing and mingling thanks to

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.500
migrations, freak events, and slow creeping
expansions. But since we humans arrived on

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.160
the scene, we've put things into fast-forward,
moving plants, animals, and other&nbsp;organisms

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.150
around the globe -- whether intentionally
or not.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.990
Once in a while, one of these transplants
might have an evolutionary quirk -- like deadly

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.390
poison, a lack of predators, or a voracious
appetite -- that unexpectedly helps it dominate

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.619
its new territory. Earthworms, for example,
were introduced into North America by European&nbsp;settlers

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.560
and have been inching across the continent
ever since - tilling soil and improving crop

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.060
yields as they go.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.950
But if a newcomer starts to harm us or a part
of the environment we care about, we'll call

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.730
it an "invasive species." Technically-speaking,
humans aren't "invasive," because we don't

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.530
usually consider ourselves an ecological threat
to... ourselves.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.660
But other species certainly are. One way they
get our attention is by costing us money.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.969
A lot of money. The US spends billions of
dollars fighting invasive weeds like the pretty

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.420
but pesky yellow rocket flower that chokes
fields and creeps onto golf courses&nbsp;and lawns.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.440
Other invaders wreak so much havoc on fragile
ecosystems that we can't help but notice even

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.840
if billions aren't at stake. For example,
the yellow crazy ant - a likely native of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.600
Southeast Asia - has been eating many beloved
and endangered Australian creatures since

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.920
its arrival several decades ago. These little
ants feast on nearly anything and everything

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.770
in their path - insects, amphibians, birds,
small mammals, even the famous red crabs on

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.229
Australia's Christmas Island, which used to
keep the island's undergrowth in check; without

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.830
them, the ecosystem has veered into chaos.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.570
But noticing invasive species is easy - dealing
with them is the real challenge.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.310
When we brought rabbits to New Zealand for
food and fur, they escaped and bred like...well...rabbits,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.130
overrunning the country. So we introduced
ferrets to control the rabbits; but they too

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.740
spread like wildfire, generally ignoring the
rabbits while gobbling&nbsp;up rare species like

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.270
the now nearly-extinct kakapo. New Zealand
is still overrun by both furry fiends, and

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.070
this is just one of&nbsp;many well-meaning attempts
at biological control that have ended in disaster.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.829
The best way to fight an invasion is to first
arm ourselves with knowledge: Instead of trying

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.219
to kill Australia's yellow crazy ants by just
spraying insecticide everywhere, we've learned

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.609
that the best approach is a year-long multi-step
assault that specifically targets ant-riddled

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:21.260
areas at the times when the egg-laying queens
are mature and susceptible to our treatments.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.879
Then we spread two kinds of bait for the workers
to bring back to the nest - one kills, and

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.879
the other sterilizes the queens. Neither poison
is perfect, but executed together, they can

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.889
knock out a whopping 99 percent of the population.

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:38.799
But with many invasives, even 99% isn't enough,
because it doesn't remove whatever advantage

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.239
gave the invaders an edge in&nbsp;the first place.
So unless we honest-to-goodness get rid of

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.680
every reproductively active individual, eventually
they'll return as vigorously as before, keeping

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.859
us constantly on our toes.

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.139
We really just need to stop moving potential
troublemakers around in the first place, leaving

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.609
bunnies where they belong and making sure
ants and earthworms don't stow away in ships,

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:05.139
cars, or excavators. But in a modern, globalized
world, this is easier said&nbsp;than done. For

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.849
those species that we do accidentally (or
intentionally) let loose only to see them

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.809
spread wildly out of control, our best hope
is to learn as much as we can about their

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:17.559
habits and their biology - only then do we
have a chance of keeping their harmful "ant"-ics

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:24.559
at bay.
