So the Snare Drum that I want to make sounds
something like this

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.000
Ok, so I'm going to start with a basic tone

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and I'm going to use a triangular waveform

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.800
The amplitude's envelope should start pretty
much immediately

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.000
and the decay is short, here its 0.1 seconds

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.300
The pitch starts pretty high and goes down
very fast

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.000
and then a little bit slower to the final
pitch

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.000
which should be in the middle, middle low
frequencies

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.000
Then I'm going to add noise with the noise
envelope

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
this envelope is very similar to the amplitude's
envelope

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.900
only the decay is a little bit longer, and
it has a tail at the end so the sound doesn't

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.000
die as fast

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And I'm going to add a high pass filter but
only to the noise

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.000
like that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.000
Now I'm going to add distortion

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.000
And then I'm going to adjust the tune of the
oscillator

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and adjust the level of the noise and the
gain of the oscillator

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.300
So that's a pretty good Snare Drum sound and
if you keep tweaking it you can get results

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.000
like this

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So that's it for this quick tutorial. I hope
you learned something, and thanks for watching.
