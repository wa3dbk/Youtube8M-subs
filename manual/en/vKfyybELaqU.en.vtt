Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and welcome to my super messy studio.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.119
Now I’ve been getting a lot of requests
for a proper studio tour, and I’ve been

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.630
putting it off because things are kinda crazy
around here, and it just dawned on me that

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:28.240
it might be interesting to you guys to see
just how chaotic a workspace can get…especially

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.320
for someone like me, when I’ve got so many
different things that I’m trying to do,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.350
and…

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.430
Now I have to create a ton of content, every
month Doug and I produce 5 new videos for

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.510
Youtube, so there’s, like the PcT Test Labs,
the Product Demos, the Mini Tutorials and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.440
a bunch of other things like that.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.241
And then we also, every month, do a new paid
tutorial that has like 6 videos in it, and

00:00:56.241 --> 00:01:01.039
a whole new project, and over an hour’s
worth of content, usually, so there’s a

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:07.500
lot that needs to be done in a small amount
of time and sometimes, it can get completely

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.750
out of control.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.200
And I’ve got a very small studio, it’s
about 10 feet by 10 feet…and I’ve got

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.759
some sorta interesting things about myself,
first of all, I’m highly organized, so I’ve

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:29.020
got this super organized side that everything
has its place, and then I’ve got this side

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.090
that, often wins as you’ll be able to see
in a minute, that is completely chaotic, random,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.820
super creative, just spinning all over the
place as far as ideas and things, so I try

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.109
to find some sort of balance, but the more
stress I’m under, the more it gets kinda

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:53.509
crazy, and I thought it would be fun for you
to see just a little window into how random

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.060
and how messy a creative person’s space
can get.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.280
Now, this is just as is, and the only thing
I did was I did move the computer screen over

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.890
‘cause I was doing some video editing, and
so I did move that over.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.280
But I’ve got just projects and tutorials
that I’m working on, I even have this funny

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.410
little tool that Doug picked up in the alley
today…he thought it might be good for clay,

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:28.300
so I just chucked it on the desk, I’ve got
stuff in process, I’ve got tools…new stuff

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.040
that I’m gonna be testing, I’ve got just…stuff
everywhere.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.940
And I don’t know, maybe Doug can take a
quick pan around just to see what’s going

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:46.000
on in this space, and you know, there is…underneath
all the crazy, there is some highly organized

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.700
things as well, there’s almost 500 drawers
that have items in it, every type of craft

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:03.870
supply, tool, all kinds of stuff in here,
and sometimes, when it gets out of control

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.760
like this, I just shove it to the side and
continue working.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.230
But, often, it just gets to the point where
I just can’t even think anymore, so what

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.730
I do is I book some time off in the afternoon,
put on some music or a webinar, something

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:28.480
to listen to, and I just start cleaning up
and getting it all put back away, and I can

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.530
restore that peace again, and then start again
with the creativeness.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.440
So I do promise to get to a real tour one
of these days soon, once I tidy up a bit more

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.950
again, and show you what’s actually in the
drawers, and how I do keep it under control.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.130
And I’ll do that in the future, but I would
love to hear about your messy work spaces,

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.120
‘cause I am guessing, with a few of you
creative types out there, that this is pretty

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.870
normal for a lot of you, so I’d love to
hear those stories, and if you enjoyed this

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.960
video, do let us know.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.640
And leave your comments in the comment section
below with stories about your messy spaces,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.680
or your extra clean spaces, if you have them,
questions on…or suggestions on future videos

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.650
would be appreciated as well.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.230
So I hope you liked that, and we will see
you next time, bye for now.
