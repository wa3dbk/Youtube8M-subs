00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:14.999
Getting a leather jacket with shoes

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.746
wearing sporting trousers, Smile asking him:

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:19.986
“Gotta anything?”

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.870
“They say you’ve just spent $2,12? Now come with me!”

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:25.997
$1,11 would be the tax!

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:26.770
Where are you from?

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.843
We’re from Na`Vi!

00:00:27.843 --> 00:00:28.829
Tax Service!

00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:37.622
So why do we have to owe our own phones

00:00:37.622 --> 00:00:40.985
For such guys in sporting trousers not approaching you for a purse!

00:00:42.714 --> 00:00:44.886
And why should we sit in a right manner?

00:00:44.886 --> 00:00:48.544
That’s because nobody can put you anything without you noticing that

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:50.707
Everything is being thought out in advance.

00:00:50.707 --> 00:00:53.143
Now I know on what they make their money

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.168
For such things I think.

00:00:55.168 --> 00:00:59.465
It’s a workshop, it adds items!

00:01:00.497 --> 00:01:02.778
We gonna do a Na`Vi’s workshop

00:01:02.778 --> 00:01:05.511
and sell there everything we got from the tournament

00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:07.417
DeMoN’s purse, eye of Maelk

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:10.080
Fear’s girlfriend

00:01:11.339 --> 00:01:13.607
Yeah we can even make an auction.

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:17.298
We can open new Na`Vi workshop

00:01:18.402 --> 00:01:22.328
We’ll have an infiltration squad

00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:27.154
With a phone, shoes and wearing sporting trousers

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:31.433
and we gonna change the whole thing with it!

00:01:32.777 --> 00:01:34.154
What do you think we did with HugoBoss?

00:01:34.154 --> 00:01:35.496
We wouldn’t have to pay anything there

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:36.895
When the infiltration squad gets in with

00:01:36.895 --> 00:01:38.966
“We want these 44 size, these 46 size and these 42 size,

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.873
Take and bring me the jacket that you have behind you,

00:01:41.873 --> 00:01:43.746
a purse for this boy

00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:46.172
And an ice cream as well.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.488
And when you come here, the beer is waiting for you already

00:01:48.488 --> 00:01:52.579
Two cans with puffs to drink it like that in the plane

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.766
I’m telling you, the Na`Vi infiltration unit would solve questions!

00:01:57.131 --> 00:01:59.354
We should take Zeus there just to make it perfect!
