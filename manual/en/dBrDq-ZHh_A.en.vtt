00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:08.051
We just looked at a very good hand for shooting
the moon in Hearts. Now, what do you do if

00:00:08.051 --> 00:00:14.280
you realize someone is shooting the moon and
you want to stop them? After you've played

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:23.269
this game a few times, you will almost always
recognize early to mid attempt when someone

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:29.489
is shooting the moon. There will be times
when itâ€™s obvious right from the first points

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.019
that they take that that's what they're going
for. What happens is, if someone is shooting

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:39.980
the moon they start doing the opposite of
what they should be. They should be throwing

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.329
low cards, but they're throwing high cards,
and they're trying to take points. In those

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:56.499
cases, as soon as you recognize that someone
is shooting the moon, you need to start throwing

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:04.089
low cards if you can't win a trick, or go
ahead and jump on a trick if you can win it.

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:15.780
So, let's say that my hand included these
cards. Okay? Since I have an ace, if someone

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.060
throws out diamonds, and it's the person who
is shooting the moon, I'm going to throw this

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:31.500
ace, and hope that a player after me has hearts
and gives me points. Because if you notice

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.180
that someone is shooting the moon, other people
will notice as well. And, but it's very important

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.460
that no one go, "oh hey, he's shooting the
moon." That's not fair play. Let's keep it

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.040
fair. If you notice fine, other players have
to realize it themselves. So I hope you understand

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.289
these strategies for shooting the moon, and
like always you'll learn more from experience,

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.509
and as you play you'll realize other strategies
for how to stop people from shooting the moon

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.039
in hearts.
