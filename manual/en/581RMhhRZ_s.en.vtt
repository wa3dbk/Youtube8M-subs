00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.460
Hey what's up guys, Sean Nalewanyj here, BodyTransformationTruth.com,
and in this video I want to go over the issue

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.830
of the leg press vs. squats when it comes
to building muscle in your lower body.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.920
Both exercises use a very similar movement
pattern and they both allow you to effectively

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.369
overload your leg muscles, but is one better
than the other?

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.129
What are the advantages and disadvantages
of each?

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.660
And which one should you ultimately pick for
your leg workouts?

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.160
So the problem with the whole “leg press
vs. squat” issue is that there’s really

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.129
no need to turn it into an “all or nothing”
argument in the first place.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.750
In reality, both lifts are simply individual
tools that you can use as part of your overall

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.470
leg training approach, and each lift has its
own unique benefits depending on the situation.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.720
Squats have basically always been considered
as the “king” of lower body exercises,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.079
and I would agree that in most situations
for most lifters, squats are going to be the

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.210
most productive and the most effective overall
exercise that you can perform.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.970
They build muscle very effectively, they increase
your total body strength, power, flexibility,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.119
your athletic performance and they can even
help to prevent injuries when you do them

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.119
properly.

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.929
So unless there is a specific reason why you
can’t perform them, then consistent squatting

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:40.030
probably should be included as part of your
overall leg training approach.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.039
Now that said, and I know that a lot of the
“hardcore” bodybuilders and powerlifters

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.770
out there probably won’t agree with this
and they won't want to hear it, but the simple

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.200
reality is that, even though squats are an
awesome exercise, when it all comes down to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.649
it they’re still not a mandatory lift and
you absolutely can build significantly big

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.850
and strong legs without them.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.700
Any exercise out there that puts the targeted
muscles under tension and that allows you

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.799
to consistently increase the weight over time
is still going to produce gains in size and

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:21.980
strength, and there are a lot of options available
outside of traditional squats that will accomplish

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.260
that for you.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.810
So the most popular exercise on the list after
squats is going to be the leg press, and even

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.220
though it does tend to get a lot of hate within
certain, again "hardcore" circles of the bodybuilding

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.220
community, it’s actually a perfectly viable
lower body exercise, and it actually even

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.590
has specific advantages in certain cases.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.040
If you have poor body mechanics for squatting
which usually means that you have particularly

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.070
long femurs, so long upper legs, that's going
to force you to bend forward excessively during

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.860
squatting, and leg presses can sometimes be
a more productive lift in that case because

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.709
it makes sure that your legs reach failure
rather than your lower back.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.530
The leg press also doesn’t tax your cardiovascular
system or your entire body as a whole in the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.510
same way that squats do since you won’t
have to worry about balancing a heavy barbell

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.849
on your back throughout the entire lift, and
because of that, it makes the leg press a

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.480
really good follow-up exercise to the squat
because it's going to allow you to perform

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.000
additional volume for your legs without burning
yourself out or sacrificing your overall muscular

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
performance.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.810
On top of that it also often works better
when you’re training in the higher rep ranges

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.950
so maybe 12 or more reps per set, because
again, squatting in high rep ranges will cause

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.480
a lot of cardiovascular fatigue which can
reduce your performance and reduce the overall

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.700
amount of muscular overload that you can achieve.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.939
Another thing to keep in mind is that the
leg strength that you develop from heavy leg

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.000
pressing is also going to have some direct
carryover to your squatting strength and even

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.580
to your deadlifting strength as well.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.920
And finally, and although this isn’t true
in all cases, leg presses are often a good

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.360
alternative for those lifters who experience
a lot of lower back discomfort during the

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.959
squat, especially if you go with a one-legged
leg press because that movements is going

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.980
to allow you to hit your legs with a high
level of intensity while using a relatively

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:26.980
light load.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.590
Now I’m obviously not trying to discourage
anyone from squatting, and I’m definitely

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.960
not saying that the leg press is “better”
somehow or that it should be used as a replacement

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.510
for squats, again, all I’m really trying
to point out here is that both of these exercises

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.950
are viable lifts and there’s really no need
to pick one over the other.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.190
If I had to pick one then I would definitely
go with a basic barbell squat, but if you’re

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.280
like most lifters and you're going to be using
a variety of exercises to hit your lower body,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.150
then just use a combination of both.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.530
And on top of that, if you truly can’t perform
squats because of some sort of injury, usually

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.430
to the lower back, then just know that using
leg presses as your main lower body compound

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.700
lift is still going to produce significant
gains in size and strength as long as you

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.220
apply progressive overload over time.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.050
Squats are an awesome exercise, but there’s
reallynothing “magical” about them and

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.250
you absolutely can still build an impressive
lower body without them.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.120
And just as a side note, I know that some
people will probably point out that squats

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.800
are far and away the better exercise because
they boost testosterone and growth hormone

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.430
levels in the body, but just keep in mind
that this point is more likely than not a

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.950
non-issue, because small temporary spikes
in these hormones is very unlikely to make

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.710
any difference to your bottom line gains,
because in order for testosterone and growth

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.690
hormone to have any real effects here, the
levels of each hormone have to be elevated

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.250
to very high levels and maintained over time.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.470
So even if performingsquats does produce a
slightly higher increase in testosterone or

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.450
growth hormone in comparison to the leg press,
the difference is likely small and it's probably

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.050
not relevant in the big picture.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.650
