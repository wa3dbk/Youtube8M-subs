00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.840
This isn't the first time Honda have had an
estate model in the Civic range. The Civic

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.790
Aerodeck was unveiled back in 1998, and although
there's been something of a gap between them,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.180
the new Civic Tourer launched earlier in 2014
builds on the foundations laid by the original.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.169
Both were designed for Europe, and both were
built at Honda's manufacturing plant in Swindon.

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:28.119
In fact, some of the engineers who had a hand
in the original also worked on the new Tourer.

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.329
Compared to the hatchback, the new Tourer
is 235mm longer, but it's still one of the

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.070
most compact estate cars in its segment. Much
of the design is familiar Civic fare, with

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.530
the Tourer receiving the same updates as the
hatchback for 2014, such as the revised alloy

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.309
wheels and black trim on the front bumper.
Of course, the big changes are round the back,

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.780
not just with the obvious extra sheet metal
but also the disguised D pillar hidden behind

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.559
the window line, the subtle roof spoiler and
the sleek tailgate. Rear visibility is much

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.640
improved over the hatchback, thanks largely
to the now unobstructed view through the rear

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.730
window. As an estate car, it's practicality
that's important, and here the new Tourer

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:14.050
scores highly. The boot features a low sill
and quite a wide aperture making loading easy,

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.590
and there's an underfloor compartment that's
been increased in size over that of the hatchback

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.250
to 117 litres. It even comes with a hook to
hold the lid out of the way, and there's a

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.600
separate compartment to hold the flexible
load cover when it's not in use. In terms

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.770
of raw space, with the rear seats in place
the Civic Tourer gains 147 litres over the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.950
hatchback with 624 litres, rising to 1,668
with the seats folded and loaded to the roof

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.950
- an increase of 290 litres over the hatchback,
and 48 more than a Golf Estate. Practicality

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.040
continues into the cabin, too, and while there's
a fairly decent amount of space for rear-seat

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.100
passengers, it's the way those seats fold
that makes them stand out. Pull the seat backs

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.690
forward, and the seat base drops down out
of the way, leading to a largely flat floor.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.790
But there's also the option of flipping the
seat bases up, allowing you to carry tall

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.340
loads like mountain bikes. Up front, the Civic
offers good adjustment to both seats and steering

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.730
wheel, and there's a useful number of storage
places for phones, bottles, and other goodies.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.109
The dash itself wraps around the driver and
all the controls are generally where you would

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:21.219
expect to find them. We love the chunky steering
wheel, but the optional satnav feels a little

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:27.249
dated in comparison to the system you'll find
in, say, a Mazda3. The dials continue to be

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:31.930
a rather blingy model of clarity, with the
now familiar central rev counter and high-mounted

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.930
speedo layout that we're used to. If it ain't
broke, don't fix it, as they say. Under the

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.209
bonnet, there's a choice of two engines - a
1.8-litre petrol with 142PS, or this, the

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.700
1.6-litre diesel with 120PS and a useful 300Nm
of torque. The smaller 1.4 petrol isn't offered

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.739
in the Tourer, and only the 1.8 is available
with automatic transmission. The diesel's

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.420
the one to go for, though, and in the Tourer
the 1.6 records 74.3mpg in the official government

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.489
tests, while during our time with it we maintained
a fairly consistent 59.6mpg average. You can

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.409
forget about paying for road tax for a while,
too, as the diesel Tourer emits just 99g/km

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.139
of CO2, placing it in band A. The diesel is
a little louder than we'd like, particularly

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:12.139
at idle and low speeds, but on the move it
settles down well. It's also a little laggy

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.859
off the line, a trait we noticed in the hatchback,
but the slick six-speed manual gearbox makes

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:29.209
it easy to keep on the boil. The Tourer is
the first Honda to benefit from the company's

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.879
new adaptive damper system - on the top two
models, at least - and this includes a set

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.319
of computer-controlled valves in the rear
dampers to stiffen or soften damper response

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.799
as required. Three settings are available
to introduce a baseline- Comfort, Normal,

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.260
and Dynamic - and although each has a distinct
effect, we found ourselves leaving it in Comfort

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.200
much of the time, as in this mode surface
imperfections were soothed away surprisingly

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.489
well and there didn't appear to be much in
the way of trade-off in terms of handling.

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.079
Indeed, apart from getting a little 'pitchy'
over larger undulations, the Tourer handles

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.739
well when compared to its hatchback brother
- body roll is initially well resisted, although

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.919
it can build through a series of faster corners
- but on a favourite back-road there's no

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.900
reason why you can't enjoy yourself. If this
is all beginning to sound like it adds up

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.650
to a formidable combination of practicality
and purpose, you'd be right. Granted, it's

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.560
no sports car, as evidenced by its 10.1 second
0-62mph time. But it's incredibly capable,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.069
and is likely to be equally happy tackling
a long trans-continental trip as it is being

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:34.740
loaded to the gunnels at your local Ikea.
There is, though, a small fly in the Civic

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.479
Tourer's ointment - and it's price. The Tourer
starts at £20,270, although the diesel commands

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.370
an £1,100 premium on top, with a mid-level
diesel coming in at around £23,000. Our top-spec

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.370
test car weighs in at a hefty £28,460. Price
aside, though, the Civic Tourer has a lot

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:59.479
going for it. It's incredibly economical,
rides superbly, and has an almost infinite

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.020
sense of practicality. Dare we say it, but
between the hatchback and the estate, we think

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.669
the Tourer's the better looking, too.
