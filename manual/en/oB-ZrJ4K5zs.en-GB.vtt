00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:15.042
And so here we are finally back at home. Now you might 
 not recognise this at home but this is where I live.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:24.140
Now this is my desk with my computer. That is the hippo that 
 I shot in 2007, that I nearly got killed doing so.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.337
They had a civil unrest, I had amoebic dysentery, 
 it was just a bit of a mess.

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:33.878
Here is the sword that was given to me by Joshua 
 and Krystal White to stay really close to me.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:43.288
I haven't really unpacked from being away. I've got my smoking gun turkey call 
 set and this thing which we are going to show you coming soon.

00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:48.455
This is the iScope connector that allows you to put 
 your iphone on the back of your scope.

00:00:49.253 --> 00:00:51.938
So this is, here you go guys, where I live.

00:00:52.332 --> 00:01:00.869
Now that's my TV, that's normally what my wife is watching and she sits down here 
 when I'm working because all I seem to do at the moment is work

00:01:01.018 --> 00:01:03.197
on programmes for Team Wild TV.

00:01:03.934 --> 00:01:10.861
And that's why it's been a little bit long since I've done a 
 blog, actually the 27th of December, which is very very naughty.

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:17.070
But as I say I've been away - ATA show in Louisville 
 Kentucky,  then hunting with Joshua and Krystal White, 

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:22.690
then over to the SHOT show in Vegas, then hunting with my good 
 pal Terry Tate, then came back and saw the guys at Deerhunter.

00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:29.092
Thank you guys at Deerhunter for supporting us again, not only is 
 the clothing affordable it's also high performance stuff we enjoy. 

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:34.988
It's not the only stuff on the market, yes we know guys we'll be bringing you 
 other stuff, but it's good to know we can use the stuff you guys like.

00:01:36.015 --> 00:01:40.370
So from there I went to the British shooting show 
 at Stoneleigh, which was an excellent show for us.

00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:44.890
And I just have to say thank you so much 
 guys, to those who came to see us because,

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:51.590
Me, Steve and Keith are just three ordinary guys that make 
 pretty cool videos or at least try to so... 

00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:58.960
When you came up we were just taken aback really with the positive comments you 
 gave us and shaking our hands and taking our autographs and stuff and...

00:01:59.334 --> 00:02:06.790
You know we really did appreciate the feedback and everything you guys do 
 for us, it just helps us making better programming for you.

00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:10.570
So thank you for everybody coming to see us 
 and thank you for your kind comments.

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:21.370
There were a few of you that weren't so kind. But man I don't 
 care, don't waste your time on my videos if you don't like them.

00:02:22.404 --> 00:02:24.400
But once again thanks to the guys who did.

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.780
Now we've got loads of cool stuff coming up, you've seen 
 we've had a completely new schedule of programming for 2013.

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:37.900
That's seems to be going really well. We've finally managed to give everybody something 
 they want. Although there are a few of you that just aren't happy.

00:02:40.187 --> 00:02:42.930
Now we get that you might not like all the videos that's fine.

00:02:43.587 --> 00:02:50.280
But recognise you don't own us, we're trying to give you 
 as much good quality, cool, unique content as we can.

00:02:50.812 --> 00:02:57.180
If you don't like the videos don't tear us apart, don't say horrible 
 things, don't question our parentage, don't threaten to burn down my house,

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.980
Seriously guys if you want to come here and 
 try that then you better come tooled up.

00:03:02.401 --> 00:03:09.140
But joking aside we are doing the best for you. Just leave comments if there is anything 
 you want to see or anything you want to see different just let us know.

00:03:09.582 --> 00:03:11.670
And we'll do our very best to bring you that sort of programming.

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:20.000
In the meantime leave out the nastiness because it just makes you look like a 
 bunch of douchebags if you are really horrible and put swear words on there.

00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:25.510
I'm sorry if I come back and embarrass you but some 
 of the things you put on there aren't very nice.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:29.980
The vast majority of you, thank you very much for your 
 support, we are going to keep on making cool videos.

00:03:30.587 --> 00:03:37.640
Now coming up over the next few weeks we've got the IWA 
 show in Nuremberg, the European version of the SHOT show.

00:03:37.994 --> 00:03:42.730
And after that we're going back to the US for 
 another, I don't know, 8 to 10 weeks.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.580
We're going on a Redneck road trip. We're going to start off in Florida 
 to hunt turkeys. Go up to Alabama and hunt turkeys and hogs. 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.840
Then to see my good friend Harold Rushton in Tennessee, who is one of 
 the world's greatest field target shooters. And then we will shoot Turkeys there.

00:03:55.223 --> 00:04:03.070
Then we are going to drive down through Mississippi, and we are going for round 2 
 with my good pal Arthur Matherne in Louisiana hunting swamp rats from an airboat.

00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:07.540
Now you might remember that from last year, it 
 is probably the coolest video that we've created.

00:04:07.797 --> 00:04:12.970
So we are going to go back and have round 2 with Arthur, see if I can 
 figure out what he says and beat more swamp rats to death with a stick.

00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:21.240
From there we are going to go over to east Texas and hunt with my good 
 pal Terry Tate once again, hopefully exotics, racoons, beavers, snakes, whatever it might be. 

00:04:21.656 --> 00:04:24.310
And then finish off down with Joshua and 
 Krystal White for another couple of weeks.

00:04:24.877 --> 00:04:27.140
So we have pretty exciting stuff coming up.

00:04:27.582 --> 00:04:31.720
We've got a range of programming... We've got some new 
 personalities coming on to Team Wild TV as well.

00:04:32.511 --> 00:04:36.510
We've got young Charlie Bryant from Young Country Sports, he's 
 going to be joining, him and his team.

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.330
We've got Joshua and Krystal White will have 
 their own Team Wild's extreme hoggers video.

00:04:41.761 --> 00:04:46.800
They've already started sending some stuff through to us which is really 
 exciting. Daniel kind of working through that at the moment.

00:04:47.154 --> 00:04:53.410
And also the stunningly beautiful, the most beautiful woman in hunting Kristy Titus 
 is going to be doing some work with us as well.

00:04:54.042 --> 00:05:02.960
Now not only is she super hot, she is also an incredible wilderness hunter. She has 
 more elk, mule deer, bear hunting experience than most of us guys put together.

00:05:03.358 --> 00:05:10.820
So we're really excited to be broadening the team, bringing you some new stuff, taking more 
 Ian Harford out of the equation as you don't like too much of me.

00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:16.100
But that frees me up also some time to do 
 some really cool exciting and entertaining stuff with Realtree.

00:05:16.586 --> 00:05:20.990
There's a new Team Wild Realtree blog coming 
 to realtree.com over the next few weeks.

00:05:21.438 --> 00:05:23.630
And it's going to be something different from what you've ever seen before.

00:05:24.464 --> 00:05:29.040
We're going to keep on making the good stuff. It's great to be 
 back home, great to see you guys at the British shooting show.

00:05:29.464 --> 00:05:31.260
Please keep watching Team Wild TV. 

00:05:31.609 --> 00:05:37.980
And for all you nay saying douchebags out there saying nasty stuff I have 
 a special programming coming up for you on Sunday - Stay tuned.

00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:40.610
Thanks guys. Peace out.
