00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:15.856
Some superheroes can grow

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.580
to the size of a building at will.

00:00:19.604 --> 00:00:21.085
That's very intimidating!

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:22.691
But a scientist must ask

00:00:22.715 --> 00:00:26.274
where the extra material is coming from.

00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:28.370
The Law of Conservation of Mass implies

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:31.084
that mass can neither be created

00:00:31.108 --> 00:00:32.248
nor destroyed,

00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:33.918
which means that our hero's mass

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:37.858
will not change just
because his size changes.

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:42.212
For instance, when we bake
a fluffy sponge cake,

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:44.189
even though the resulting delicious treat

00:00:44.213 --> 00:00:46.667
is much bigger in size
than the cake batter

00:00:46.691 --> 00:00:48.182
that went into the oven,

00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:50.802
the weight of the cake
batter should still equal

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:51.977
the weight of the cake

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.671
plus the moisture that has evaporated.

00:00:55.695 --> 00:00:56.954
In a chemical equation,

00:00:56.978 --> 00:00:59.565
molecules rearrange to make new compounds,

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.258
but all the components should
still be accounted for.

00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:05.149
When our hero expands

00:01:05.173 --> 00:01:07.022
from 6 feet tall

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:09.404
to 18 feet tall,

00:01:09.428 --> 00:01:11.741
his height triples.

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:13.669
Galileo's Square Cube Law says

00:01:13.693 --> 00:01:15.828
his weight will be 27

00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:18.287
- 3 times 3 times 3 equals 27 -

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:19.499
times his regular weight

00:01:19.523 --> 00:01:22.997
since he has to expand
in all three dimensions.

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:26.542
So, when our superhero
transforms into a giant,

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.214
we are dealing with two possibilities.

00:01:29.238 --> 00:01:31.633
Our hero towering at 18 feet

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:34.521
still only weighs 200 pounds,

00:01:34.545 --> 00:01:36.970
the original weight in this human form.

00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:42.102
Now, option two, our hero
weighs 5,400 pounds

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:46.554
- 200 pounds times 27
equals 5,400 pounds -

00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:48.180
when he is 18 feet tall,

00:01:48.204 --> 00:01:52.515
which means he also weighs 5,400 pounds

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.732
when he is 6 feet tall.

00:01:57.455 --> 00:01:59.040
Nobody can get in the same
elevator with him

00:01:59.064 --> 00:02:00.823
without the alarm going off.

00:02:00.847 --> 00:02:02.707
Now, option two seems a little more

00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:03.962
scientifically plausible,

00:02:03.986 --> 00:02:05.909
but it begs the question,

00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:07.629
how does he ever walk through the park

00:02:07.653 --> 00:02:08.874
without sinking into the ground

00:02:08.898 --> 00:02:11.108
since the pressure
he is exerting on the soil

00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:12.550
is calculated by his mass

00:02:12.574 --> 00:02:15.795
divided by the area
of the bottom of his feet?

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.383
And what kind of super
socks and super shoes

00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:21.464
is he putting on his feet
to withstand all the friction

00:02:21.488 --> 00:02:25.098
that results from dragging
his 5,400 pound body

00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:28.625
against the road when he runs?

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.303
And can he even run?

00:02:30.327 --> 00:02:32.649
And I won't even ask how he finds pants

00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:35.716
flexible enough to withstand
the expansion.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.326
Now, let's explore the density

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.832
of the two options mentioned above.

00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:48.883
Density is defined as mass
divided by volume.

00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:51.745
The human body is made
out of bones and flesh,

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.387
which has a relatively set density.

00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:57.634
In option one, if the hero
weighs 200 pounds all the time,

00:02:57.658 --> 00:03:00.832
then he would be bones
and flesh at normal size.

00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:02.987
When he expands to a bigger size

00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:04.644
while still weighing 200 pounds,

00:03:04.668 --> 00:03:06.483
he essentially turns himself

00:03:06.507 --> 00:03:10.003
into a giant, fluffy teddy bear.

00:03:13.188 --> 00:03:15.195
In option two, if the hero weighs

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.118
5,400 pounds all the time,

00:03:17.142 --> 00:03:20.207
then he would be bones
and flesh at 18 feet

00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.044
with 5,400 pounds of weight
supported by two legs.

00:03:24.068 --> 00:03:26.164
The weight would be
exerted on the leg bones

00:03:26.188 --> 00:03:27.831
at different angles as he moves.

00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:30.159
Bones, while hard, are not malleable,

00:03:30.183 --> 00:03:31.782
meaning they do not bend,

00:03:31.806 --> 00:03:33.874
so they break easily.

00:03:33.898 --> 00:03:36.211
The tendons would also
be at risk of tearing.

00:03:36.235 --> 00:03:38.148
Tall buildings stay standing

00:03:38.172 --> 00:03:39.962
because they have steel frames

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.842
and do not run and jump
around in the jungle.

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:44.010
Our hero, on the other hand,

00:03:44.034 --> 00:03:46.814
one landing at a bad angle

00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:48.631
and he's down.

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:55.190
Assuming his bodily function
is the same as any mammal's,

00:03:55.214 --> 00:03:57.691
his heart would need to pump
a large amount of blood

00:03:57.715 --> 00:03:59.889
throughout his body
to provide enough oxygen

00:03:59.913 --> 00:04:03.100
for him to move 5,400 pounds
of body weight around.

00:04:03.124 --> 00:04:05.233
This would take tremendous energy,

00:04:05.257 --> 00:04:06.686
which he would need to provide

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.264
by consuming 27 times 3,000
calories of food every day.

00:04:11.288 --> 00:04:14.913
Now, that is roughly 150 Big Macs.

00:04:14.937 --> 00:04:17.273
27 times 3,000 calculated equals

00:04:17.297 --> 00:04:20.794
81,000 calculated slash 550 calories

00:04:20.818 --> 00:04:22.256
equals 147.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.122
He wouldn't have time to fight crime

00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:26.400
because he would be eating all the time

00:04:26.424 --> 00:04:28.429
and working a 9-to-5 job

00:04:28.453 --> 00:04:31.932
in order to afford all the food he eats.

00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:32.895
And what about superheroes

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.903
who can turn their bodies
into rocks or sand?

00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:38.571
Well, everything on Earth
is made out of elements.

00:04:38.595 --> 00:04:39.976
And what defines each element

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.074
is the number of protons in the nucleus.

00:04:42.098 --> 00:04:45.450
That is how our periodic
table is organized.

00:04:45.474 --> 00:04:47.288
Hydrogen has one proton,

00:04:47.312 --> 00:04:48.873
helium, two protons,

00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:50.063
lithium, three protons,

00:04:50.087 --> 00:04:51.290
and so on.

00:04:51.314 --> 00:04:53.457
The primary component
of the most common form

00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:55.379
of sand is silicon dioxide.

00:04:55.403 --> 00:04:57.632
Meanwhile, the human body consists of

00:04:57.656 --> 00:04:59.384
65% oxygen,

00:04:59.408 --> 00:05:00.936
18% carbon,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.091
10% hydrogen,

00:05:02.115 --> 00:05:04.556
and 7% of various other elements

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.806
including 0.002% of silicon.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.031
In a chemical reaction,

00:05:10.055 --> 00:05:12.813
the elements recombine
to make new compounds.

00:05:12.837 --> 00:05:14.774
So, where is he getting all this silicon

00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:17.517
necessary to make the sand?

00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:19.070
Sure, we can alter elements

00:05:19.094 --> 00:05:21.874
by nuclear fusion or nuclear fission.

00:05:21.898 --> 00:05:25.025
However, nuclear fusion
requires so much heat,

00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:28.811
the only natural occurrence
of this process is in stars.

00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:31.540
In order to utilize fusion
in a short amount of time,

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:32.965
the temperature of the area

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:35.461
needs to be hotter than the Sun.

00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:39.749
Every innocent bystander
will be burned to a crisp.

00:05:41.302 --> 00:05:44.043
Rapid nuclear fission is not any better

00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:47.284
since it often results
in many radioactive particles.

00:05:47.308 --> 00:05:48.482
Our hero would become

00:05:48.506 --> 00:05:51.521
a walking, talking nuclear power plant,

00:05:51.545 --> 00:05:55.147
ultimately harming
every person he tries to save.

00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:57.734
And do you really want the heat of the Sun

00:05:57.758 --> 00:06:02.023
or a radioactive nuclear
plant inside of your body?

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:09.370
Now, which superpower physics lesson

00:06:09.394 --> 00:06:11.839
will you explore next?

00:06:11.863 --> 00:06:15.916
Shifting body size and content,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.253
super speed,

00:06:17.277 --> 00:06:19.112
flight,

00:06:19.136 --> 00:06:22.077
super strength,

00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:24.402
immortality,

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:26.276
and

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.970
invisibility.
