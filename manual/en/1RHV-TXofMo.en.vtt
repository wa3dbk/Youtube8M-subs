Hi everyone I’m Ryoya.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.360
The theme of this month is soy meat.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:18.800
I asked you guys a request you want me to make in a recent video.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.700
Lots of people said that they want me to make pan fried dumpling.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.080
I’m going to make fried dumpling at your request.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.100
What most difficult to make fried dumpling is to wrap the fillings.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.880
If you got store bought Gyoza skin, it’s gonna be easy to wrap.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.960
But when you make gyoza skin by yourself, the skin is quite softer than store bought one,
It would be hard to handle.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:54.200
I’m going to make skin as well today,
But if you haven’t make gyoza skin before,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.660
It might be better to buy gyoza skin at store.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:13.380
I think you can get organic, whole wheat gyoza skin at natural food store(in Japan).

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.620
It’s kind of hard and flexible so it is easy to handle.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.320
If you make your own gyoza skin, it is so soft and it may be a mess.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.360
It may be better to use store bought gyoza skin for the first time.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:42.280
The filling of frien dumpling is quite similar to the filling of steamed meat bun that I uploaded a few weeks ago, 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.080
well, there’s a tip for frying beautifully.
So let’s get started.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.020
ah I’m relieved that I was managed to make fried dumpling beautifully.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.600
I sometimes fail to fry dumpling.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.300
I’m relieved it went well today.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:37.080
Tips for making fried dumpling is not to hurry.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.720
It takes time until fried dumpling is golden brown on the bottom.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:51.240
It should take 8 – 10 minutes until it’s done.
Actually it depends on the condition of heat.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:07:06.500
Try not to touch or check too much to see how fried dumpling goes when fried dumpling is still soft.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.720
It causes to break the gyoza skin.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:18.480
so when you make fried dumpling, wait patiently until it’s golden brown.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.280
By doing so, you’ll succeed.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.540
so see you in next month.
The theme of next month is Italian.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:35.300
Don’t miss next week video.
See you soon!
