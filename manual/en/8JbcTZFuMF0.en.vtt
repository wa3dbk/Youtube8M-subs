Welcome everyone.

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.900
Today we're taking a look at Wheatgrass a
product that I've recently been researching

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.620
and finding to pack a great deal of benefits.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.990
Always consult your physician when you're
considering introducing something new to your

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.990
diet.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.570
This outline is based on my personal experience
with wheatgrass be sure you conduct your own

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.720
research before taking this or any other product.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.140
Links to additional information can be found
in the About section below.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.230
The consumption of wheatgrass in the western
world began in the 1930's as a result of experiments

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.199
conducted by Charles Schnable.

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.130
Schnable's research was conducted with wheatgrass
grown outdoors in Kansas, which required 200

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.100
days of growth, through the winter and early
spring.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.739
Wheatgrass grown indoors in trays typically
takes about 10 days and provides similar nutritional

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.560
content as wheatgrass grown outdoors.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.610
The health properties of wheatgrass range
from cancer prevention, to detoxifier, it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.860
helps increase blood flow and digestion.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.489
Wheatgrass is rich in chlorophyll although
it carries roughly the same vitamin content

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.909
as most vegetables such as protein, Beta-Carotene,
Vitamins E, C, B12, Phosphorus, Magnesium,

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.659
Calcium, Iron and Potassium it packs quite
a punch for a low malignance easy to grow

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.179
food source.

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.460
My reasons for taking wheatgrass is that it's
a great all natural detoxifier.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.520
It also helps in production of hemoglobin,
the chemical in red blood cells that carries

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.729
oxygen.

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.099
It helps improve blood sugar disorders, aids
in wound healing and acts as a preventative

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:32.749
measure from bacterial infections.

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:37.689
Additionally it helps reduce high blood pressure
and aids in reducing cholesterol by blocking

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:38.939
its absorption.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.350
I'm currently taking wheatgrass in powder
form although ideally you may want to grow

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.149
and juice it so that you're getting the full
range of benefits.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.420
It has very little if any side effects and
packs a lot of benefits into a single dose.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.780
So far I've been very satisfied including
wheatgrass into my regiment and have found

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.849
it to be a great asset when it comes to weight
loss, building lean muscle mass and workout

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:02.079
recovery.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.209
Wheatgrass is certainly worth looking into
when you consider all the benefits packed

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.840
into this simple, low maintenance easy to
grow food source.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.220
This has been a quick look at Wheatgrass if
you have any questions or comments feel free

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.410

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.459
