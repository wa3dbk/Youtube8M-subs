Hi everyone this is Bubbly J. In this video
im going to show you how t use an eyeliner.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.960
Lets get started.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.900
An angle brush

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:33.140
What I usually do is, I break up the eyeliner
into 2 parts. I draw from the outer corner

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:44.180
going inwards 
right into the middle and then I draw from

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:54.239
inwards coming out and I join both the lines
together. Drawing the line as a whole can

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.360
be a little bit tricky and doing it this way
we have more control over the liner. The good

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.720
thing about using a gel liner is that it is
easy to control and you can build up the line

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:16.560
so if you want a thicker line you can just
go over. You can then repeat this on the other

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.560
eye.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.010
With this we are done. I have used a gel eyeliner
for this tutorial but you can also use a pencil

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.250
or a liquid liner. The difference between
using a pencil, a liquid and a gel is that

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.860
a pencil is easy to control but we may get
thicker lines we may not want. With a liquid

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.720
liner it is way more difficult to control,
so I personally like the gel liner the best.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:56.250
