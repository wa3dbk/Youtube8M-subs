00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.840
In this clip we're going to talk about how
to structure your play. Now there's a very

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.150
basic chart, but what we can do is add on
to that, and make some changes, and make it

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.650
a little more workable. So basically at the
beginning you have your exposition, which

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.840
tells the background of all the characters,
and the story, just enough for the audience

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.900
to understand what's going on before the conflicts
really start happening. Then you've got your

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.411
rising action, as the story develops, as the
conflicts hit, and that builds and builds

00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:35.510
and builds, until you get to the climax. Then
after the climax, comes the falling action,

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.649
which is the wrap up from the climax and all
that has happened there, and then at the very

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.040
end of that is the denouement, which is the
unraveling. And the structure goes something

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.110
like this, officially the structure goes exposition,
rising action, then the climax, and then the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.379
falling action, and then the denouement. Now,
what I think is important is if you can, instead

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.180
of starting off here going exposition, exposition,
on this straight line, start it off as quickly

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.030
and into things as you can, and do the exposition
along the way. That, if you can, might work

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.480
better. It's sort of like a movie in the first
thirty seconds sometimes that really grabs

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.659
us, and there's no reason a play should start
off slow and talky until we get into it. So

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.460
if you can do that with your play, and make
it instead of this and up, jump right into

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.350
it and going up. Now, actually, this whole
part of the rising action, is about eighty

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.500
percent of the play. That's most all of it,
and in fact, if you break it down into acts,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.010
we're probably going up here in act one, and
then in the middle of it we have a break,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.320
and then it's still having rising action,
and the climax happens towards the end of

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.250
act two. Then you have your falling action,
which instead of this, it should actually,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.130
you hit your climax, bam, go straight down
and, and do that falling action as quickly

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.000
as possible, not rushing it, but not dragging
that out after the climax. What I also suggest

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.370
is, at the end of the denouement, is that
you put an exclamation mark. In my, my play

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.840
"Dreams on a Desert Night", which was where
they were building a housing development and

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.180
one of the builders was freaking out because
he was seeing U.F.O.s. But at the very end

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.609
of the play everyone had gone, everything
was quiet, the lights went down to half, and

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:33.999
then an alien walked onto stage, took his
hand, and took him off. Here's another example.

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:38.829
The example of a, of a man who's battling
with his family, and he sits there all day

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:44.319
doing jigsaw puzzles. And maybe we create
something where he's always missing pieces

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.849
for the jigsaw puzzle. Well what happens the
family fights and battles that and at the

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.999
climax he finally passes away, and the falling
action is the result after that, the upheaval

00:02:55.999 --> 00:03:00.680
that the family has gone through. Maybe some
of the relief, some of the, of the torment.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.480
And then you get to the denouement where they're
all talking it out. They worked it out together

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.359
as a family and they're, they're going on
to sleep now. But maybe there's one thing

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:19.150
where he's actually missing a piece, and he's
been missing this one piece all that time.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.959
Maybe at the very end you have his wife sitting
there, staring at that jigsaw puzzle, and

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.889
out from this side of the couch falls this
missing puzzle piece, and she goes up, puts

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:34.569
it in, and completes the puzzle. Or walks
up and completes, puts it in and it doesn't

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.760
complete the puzzle, it doesn't fit. So whatever
you do, some thing at the end, it doesn't

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.389
need to be earth-shaking, but some little
touch at the end is very important in structuring

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.200
the play. As you're charting all of this out
you have your characters, and the different

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.040
conflicts they're going to go through, different
plot points you know is going to happen. You

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.029
know the husband is going to die, you know
they're going to get in a big fight before

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:01.249
it. Maybe one of the kids is going to run
away from home. So what you want to do is

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:05.939
put a lot of this on something like note cards.
If you can keep it in your head that's fine,

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.689
but note cards are very helpful because you're
going to switch the order a lot. Of course

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:15.341
if you have a spreadsheet, that's very easy
to do too, in just switching the order of

00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:20.090
things. So whatever works out best for you,
but just to get those main points, and then

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.370
switch those around so they make sense for
you, will really help with the structure.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.580
So a great way to look at it is like, you're
going on this journey. You are the driver,

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.100
and your characters are the passengers. You
don't know exactly where you're going, but

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.790
you're going to have a great time discovering
it along the way.
