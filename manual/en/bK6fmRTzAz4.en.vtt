00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.460
Some of the predictions that London faces
are, for example, warmer and drier summers,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.510
and, on the whole, wetter and slightly warmer
winters.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.070
While it's a new climate for London, it's
obviously not new in the world, and what's

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.300
exciting is that we can start looking at other
cities in the world, for example the Mediterranean

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.300
with regards to warm summers, and how to prevent
overheating, and safeguard occupant health.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.230
But also then, for example, Venice and the
Netherlands, because when we're going to see

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.090
more winter rain we're likely to get more
flash floods, we might be building more on

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.230
flood plains, and of course they're cities
that really have learned how to work with

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.030
water rather than against it.
What's interesting is that some of the measures

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:59.010
that help overheating, like green spaces,
what we call 'water squares', and trees, they

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.690
also help prevent some of that flash flooding,
while they also provide some cooling and some

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.619
amenities for the residents, and also provide
a healthy live-and-work environment in the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.409
city.
Some of the measures that we're looking at,

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.729
both at a city scale, as well as the building
scale, for overheating, would be well-insulated

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.289
buildings - both new-build and also retrofit
of the existing building stock in London,

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.729
which is one of the oldest in Europe actually
- and also good airtightness, because these

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.729
measures both prevent overheating in summer,
but obviously also keep the cold out in winter,

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:48.649
which is why we're currently using these measures
And, of course, as soon as you insulate you have to look at solar shading, having effective

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.369
solar shading on all your buildings, and at
the same time also providing for inward-opening

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.679
windows for good night-cooling, and secure
ventilation of the buildings.

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:05.009
We've also to be careful about when we're
building and retro-fitting in a city, all

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.500
the buildings are very close together, and
while you might want to reflect sunlight to  prevent overheating

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.450
in a building, the issue with a lot of corporate office
buildings is that a lot of them are in glass,

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.209
in steel, and so they tend to reflect light
very specifically and actually quite strongly

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.370
down to the ground, which then can blind people,
add glare into other spaces across a road,

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.580
for example, and - as also happened in London
- it actually really started to damage property

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.900
on the ground level.
So, when you're really looking at building

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.110
sustainably, you really have to be aware of
what the surrounding buildings are, how both

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.040
you're overshadowing and impacting them but
equally also when you're reflecting light

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.110
back - how that is impacting them.
