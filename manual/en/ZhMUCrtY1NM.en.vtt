Hi, I'm Ann Myrick, and today we're going
to work with storage solutions for any room.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:12.730
We were in a bedroom today, in a little girl's
bedroom, and one of the big things is just

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:20.880
finding great containers that work for the
area and work for the person, the child, whoever

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.450
you're working with. I love using flea - finding
interesting containers from fleamarket and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.780
from garage sales because you can have all
types of stuff in a container and if the container

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.390
is really different and interesting and unique,
then it just makes it that much better and

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.180
interesting. There are so many different things
that you can find out there, just in discount

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.160
stores and retail stores. This is a book case
that is a darling book case and it doesn't

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.749
look bad, but we could brighten it up and
make it so much more useful. So what I'm going

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:10.939
to do is show you just some different ways
 - some different thoughts on how you can

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.460
organize with different storage units. These
are just little canvas boxes that you can

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.090
get at a discount shop or a little retail
store, and they look darling, I'm going to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:36.299
turn the handle around, and they look darling
just in the bookshelf. So what you can do

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.729
is one shelf or one basket could have all
of her books in it. And the other basket can

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:58.819
have her little purses and cords and then
she has several little boxes like this that

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:04.850
are great, but then she can put them all even
if you have many of these they can become

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:14.180
very cluttery and so you can put all these
little things in here. In addition to these

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.780
colorful baskets, you could just around the
house you probably have plenty of containers,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:29.849
great metal buckets, big huge baskets, you
can find great boxes that are specifically

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:37.180
for putting under the bed, so you can go to
retail stores, discount stores, and just look

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.700
around at all their storage units to see what
works for you. This is Ann Myrick, and that

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.650
 - those are storage solutions for any room.
