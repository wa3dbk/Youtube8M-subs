00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.879
Initial descriptions of games can be a little
bit deceiving.

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.140
All I knew about this game when I first got
it was that you were able to raise and lower

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.210
terrain to help you out, and I thought maybe
it would be kind of like Rollercoaster Tycoon

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.210
or something.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.790
Well, no, it’s nothing like Rollercoaster
Tycoon, but it is one of the coolest shooters

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.610
to come out in the last few years.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.489
Sure, it isn’t a drastic move for the genre,
but some innovative features definitely make

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.900
this a game you should give a try.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:06.970
It’s Fracture for the Xbox 360.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:21.030
Fracture’s story is set in a future America
where the West and East have split into two

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.100
separate countries.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.170
More specifically, the West is now known as
Pacifica as it split from the United States.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.170
The general for Pacifica is considered extremely
dangerous and it’s your job to capture him

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.350
at all costs!

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.370
Of course, things are never easy, as you meet
massive resistance in the form of genetically

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.530
modified soldiers, but you have a little trick
up your sleeve called the entrencher, an item

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.940
that can raise and lower dirt to help you
clear obstacles and block out enemies.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.640
It’s an interesting idea, and it works well
most of the time.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.650
I say “most of the time” because there
is a limit to the amount you can raise something,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.930
and it can pull you out of the experience
when you can’t keep going up for no reason.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.510
However, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing,
as if this is happening, it usually means

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.010
you aren’t supposed to go wherever you are
trying to go.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.890
Fracture’s core gameplay is third-person
shooting, and while it isn’t really anything

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.340
special, there’s nothing really wrong with
it, either.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.470
Hit detection is fine, weapons work well,
and enemy AI is actually really good.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.390
In fact, the game’s difficulty actually
feels genuine because of this; you won’t

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.390
die from bugs and glitches, but the enemies
actually providing a fair challenge.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.420
Using the entrencher to help provide cover
and sink enemies is also a lot of fun, especially

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:34.060
when a large group of enemies all go down
at the same time.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.510
The only real issue I have with Fracture’s
gameplay is the grenade mechanics.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.110
You have access to a few different grenades
to not only defeat enemies, but change the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.170
terrain.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.980
While these work okay, actually getting them
to go where you want is a bit of a pain.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.200
You also don’t get very many, so having
to waste a few grenades before you hit your

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200
target is pretty annoying.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.880
Regardless, you don’t have to use them all
that often, and you will start to get the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.900
hang of it over time, but they do seem to
act like bricks of lead at first.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.160
Visually, Fracture does look like a budget
title.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.230
Environments don’t actually look that bad,
but they do seem to be pretty similar to each

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.720
other, with bland walls and terrain.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.730
The main character also has a long scratch
on his face like that dude from The Wire.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:34.060
It really doesn’t seem necessary.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.720
Fracture doesn’t execute all of its concepts
as well as it could, but it is one of the

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.450
more interesting shooters released this generation.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.770
I wouldn’t say that it’s necessary to
give it a try, but fans of the genre looking

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.060
for something a little different will definitely
have some fun.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:04:06.840
Just remember, it definitely isn’t Rollercoaster
Tycoon.
