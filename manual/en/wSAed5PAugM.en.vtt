00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.430
I'm Fraser Cain, the publisher of Universe
Today.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.470
Dinosaurs roamed the Earth for 135 million
years.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.780
Filling every ecological niche, from the oceans,
forests and plains; even the skies.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.560
Then, 66 million years ago, something terrible
happened.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.480
In a geological instant, 75% of the plants
and animals on Earth went extinct.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.420
.... And all of the land dinosaurs were wiped
off the Earth forever.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.960
What happened?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.600
What killed them off?

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.540
What could have caused that much damage in
such a short amount of time?

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.809
The key to this mystery was found in a strange
layer of ash sandwiched between layers of

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.059
rock deposited 66 million years ago.

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.670
This line, known as the Cretaceous--Paleogene
boundary, is found across the world in the

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.249
geologic record and it marks the moment when
everything DIED.

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:54.230
What's interesting about this layer is that
it's rich in iridium, a rare element on Earth,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.850
but abundant in asteroids.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.170
And so, geologists found the most likely culprit:
an asteroid.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.549
This evidence matched the discovery of an
enormous asteroid impact basin in the YucatÃ¡n

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.960
Peninsula in Mexico, centered near the town
of Chicxulub.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.820
The rock debris in this area could be dated
back to approximately 66 million years old,

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.070
matching the worldwide layer of ash.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.869
We now know that an asteroid at least ten
kilometres across slammed off the coast of

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.920
Mexico 66 million years ago, releasing 2 million
times more energy than the most powerful nuclear

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.180
bomb ever detonated.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.689
The effect of this impact is mindblowing.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.210
Millions of tonnes of rock were ejected into
space on ballistic trajectories.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.719
Reheated by atmospheric re-entry, this debris
superheated the air across the entire planet,

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.549
catching the world's forests on fire.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.539
Shockwaves radiated outward from the impact
site, inducing earthquakes and volcanoes along

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:48.539
their path.

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.960
Mega tsunamis thousands of meters high spread
out from the impact site, pounding coastlines

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.500
around the world.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.869
Dust rained down across the planet.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.310
It filled the air, darkening the skies for
decades, and preventing photosynthesis.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.960
Plants on land and in the oceans were unable
to produce energy.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.429
The planet cooled from the choking dust and
aerosols, followed by years of acid rain,

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.640
and then even global warming as the carbon
from the blasted life filled the atmosphere.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.480
The effects to life were devastating.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.280
It's no surprise the land dinosaurs didn't
make it through this impact event.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.659
In fact, it's a bigger surprise that our ancient
ancestors, hardy early mammals could endure.

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.480
And our final sobering thought is that impacts
of this scale have happened many times in

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.870
the past, and will happen again in the future.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.510
It's not a question of if, it's a matter of
when.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:47.390
Thanks 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.730
for watching!
