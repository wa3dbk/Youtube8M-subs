HEY, BABE, I'M SORRY I COULDN'T
BE THERE WITH YOU TODAY.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.600
I KNOW THAT WATCHING "ELLEN"
FOR THE PAST NINE MONTHS

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:24.400

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.800
I KNEW WHEN I MET YOU
TEN YEARS AGO

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:32.500

DAY OF MY LIFE,

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:35.033

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:38.733
AND I MISS YOU AND OUR BEAUTIFUL
CRAZY GIRLS SO MUCH.

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.466
I WROTE TO ELLEN BECAUSE
YOU'VE DONE AN AMAZING JOB

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.000
TAKING CARE OF THE GIRLS
FOR THE PAST NINE MONTHS

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:43.866
WHILE I WAS DEPLOYED,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.766
AND I'M SORRY THAT I CAN'T SPEND
CHRISTMAS WITH YOU,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.300

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.433

IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER,

00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:03.866
AND THEN HE SAID THAT Y'ALL
USED TO WATCH IT TOGETHER,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.466
AND SO HE THOUGHT
HE'D BE ABLE TO WATCH YOU

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.966
IF YOU WERE ON THE SHOW.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.466

LET'S BRING IT OUT.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:15.466
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA--

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.000
OH, YOU'RE GONNA BE EXCITED,
I THINK.

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:21.466
[cheers and applause]

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.100

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:49.033
[cheers and applause]

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:52.700
- ALL RIGHT, WE'LL BE BACK
AFTER THIS.

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:02.833
WE'RE BACK WITH
CAPTAIN MICHAEL LACKEY,

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:03.966
WHO JUST GOT BACK FROM KUWAIT

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.433
AND SURPRISED HIS WIFE.

00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:06.533
THIS WAS--
YOU'RE THE MASTERMIND.

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:07.866
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WROTE IN

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.600
AND WANTED TO SURPRISE HER
AND DO THIS.

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:10.600
- YES.

00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:11.933
- 'CAUSE SHE DIDN'T THINK

00:03:11.966 --> 00:03:13.233
YOU WERE GONNA BE BACK IN TIME,

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:15.933
AND SO HOW HARD WAS THAT
TO KEEP THIS SURPRISE?

00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:17.100
- I CAN'T LIE TO HER
ABOUT ANYTHING,

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:18.533
SO IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT.

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:20.666
EVEN THE SMALLEST GIFT,
I'LL GIVE HER THE HINT

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.733
OR AT LEAST FORCE MYSELF
TO TELL HER,

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:24.400
EVEN THOUGH I'M TRYING TO KEEP
IT A SECRET.

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:26.566
- AND YOU'VE BEEN HIDING
BACK HERE THE WHOLE TIME.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.566
- YES.
- YEAH.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.866
- AND WE SURPRISED HER.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.200
SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS COMING
FOR SOMETHING ELSE,

00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:31.766
AND SO IT WAS REALLY GREAT.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.100
AND YOU HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS.
HOW OLD ARE THEY?

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:34.866
- FIVE AND THREE.
BRIANNA AND ALEXA.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.233
- FIVE AND THREE.
WOW.

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:39.000
THAT MUST REALLY BE DIFFICULT
TO BE AWAY FROM THEM.

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:40.000
- IT'S VERY HARD.

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:41.066
I'VE DEPLOYED--

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.033
THIS IS MY FOURTH TIME,
ACTUALLY.

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:44.600
AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME
WITH TWO KIDS.

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:46.733
SO IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.

00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:48.166
BUT, YOU KNOW, I GOT THE SKYPE
TO SEE 'EM EVERY DAY,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.433
BUT I CAN'T WAIT.

00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:50.466
- ALL RIGHT.
- CAN'T WAIT.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.366
- WELL, SHE WENT TO GET THEM.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.766
THAT'S WHY YOUR WIFE
IS NOT HERE.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.900
SO, JEN, I THINK--
ARE YOU READY?

00:03:55.933 --> 00:03:58.066
BRING YOUR DAUGHTERS OUT,
AND...

00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:12.833
- HI, BRIANNA.
HI.

00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:14.466
[cheers and applause]

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.733

00:04:28.366 --> 00:04:29.866
SO BEAUTIFUL.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.100
- LOOK AT YOUR BEAUTIFUL DRESSES

00:04:31.133 --> 00:04:32.466
AND YOUR BOWS AND EVERYTHING.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.233
