Hi this is Yolanda Vanveen, and in this section
we are going to talk about how to repel rats.

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:11.510
Rats are a problem because you let them become
a problem. So by to repel rats you got to

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.970
make sure to get rid of any of their food
or home sources. So first of all the reason

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.200
they are hanging out at your house is because
they love garbage, they love the food. So

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.990
by making sure that your garbage can is completely
covered at all times and there's no break,

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.300
that they can get in, that's the number one
way to repel rats, cause if they don't have

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.720
food, you won't have rats. Next water, if
you have standing water anywhere and the rats

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.510
are coming in to drink it, two if you can
cover that up or stop them from coming to

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.989
the water in any way then that will repel
them as well. Now rats love to live underneath

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.409
your house or underneath a wood pile, or anywhere
they can have protection. So make sure that

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.280
all of your areas that are going underneath
your house or anywhere that they can nest

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.179
is covered. Make sure that you've got wood
in front or a gate or some what, way to stop

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:07.330
them from coming inside in anyway. And by
removing all of these factors you will find

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.300
that you won't have any rats. And if they're
still a problem where you have a neighbor's

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.120
area that you can't control you can always
repel them by making a border. They don't

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.840
like any kind of really strong spice, so you
use cayenne pepper, Tabasco, red hot chili

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.000
peppers, garlic, curry powder and you cover
that bed or that area where they are coming

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.610
into your area or your property then they
won't cross it and they don't like spices

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.970
so that's about the only thing that you can
do to really repel them from your area. A

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.600
lot of times different types of herbs, lavender
plants or putting any type of oil along the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.240
tree, they don't a lot of times don't like
to crawl up a tree if there's oil on it. So

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.610
try to find out where they are at, and then
to repel them stop them from coming in to

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.610
that area. And that's really all that you
can do. And if you are still having problems

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.860
always contact your department of fish and
wildlife and they might have some ideas for

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.260
you as well.
