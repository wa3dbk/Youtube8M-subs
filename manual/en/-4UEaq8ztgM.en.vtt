00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.740
from the past month Parker's about to
hit all cells

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.170
I'm who Thomas

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.199
provides tito's good to me in to meet
you sir now

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.640
you got the new Dan Wesson and these are
the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.620
halliburton is supposed to be very can
tell us a little bit more about that

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.050
share I'll all we did was we look that
they are going toward it and saw we were

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.850
missing a couple of pellet version
pistols and revolvers

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.530
while the right a little barrel actually
adds a little bit more to the accuracy

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.470
very little to no

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.380
de PSE known should a lot harder but
agassi is it a lot

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.710
gotcha yes and the way this works is you
actually unscrew the top

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.750
of the cartridge and insert the pellet

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.350
then you just heard back on

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.060
you're ready to go that's how it works
pretty simple and already got

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.060
I improve Palin version is set up %uh
still BB version

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.720
that's really tough because I'm sure
people have been trying to figure that

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.640
out free at all

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.240
tolerant yeah

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.670
call to turn everything is the
attraction to disagree with the revolver

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.750
exactly I would be just push down on the
man in the guy

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.150
yeah but I was looking at it thinking

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.070
now you have no excuse pushing its good
about it that's going to go inside

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.010
co-conspirator percent talk to me. I'll
it functions the same way other

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.770
like their software still baby version

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.360
I how they work closest same way yeah I

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.550
heat didn't wanna do like we had to
insert a little from Mac in the top or

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.690
anything like that they go from other
pistols guy

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.710
saw it this way we kept the look and
feel and everything

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.979
as I just like spoil the exact yeah
exactly

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.069
on course but the goal from the colleges
why

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.230
and you got it you got all the cool
stuff still going on yeah it is

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.230
it is a were you really clever idea and
I like that a lot does make it so I went

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.299
to those commands

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.470

not out of out already
