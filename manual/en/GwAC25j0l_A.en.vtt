Hi, I'm Kelli on behalf of Expert Village,
I'm going to show you some tips and techniques

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.550
that I use when I'm trotting and jogging my
horse. So now that we have our horse walking

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.220
and trotting, we want to make sure that we
know how to stop our horse. So stopping for

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:24.960
the trot, let me move up to a trot here. We
are going to be trotting looking where we

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.109
want to go. When we decided that we are ready
to stop we are going to sit, pull back slightly

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:39.890
on the reins and say whoa if we have to. Once
you sit deep and see smoothness with your

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:48.410
horse, that is a cue that you no longer want
your horse to go forward. So again you are

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.089
going to sit deep, pull back slightly on the
reins, say whoa if you need to. Once you get

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.270
your horse to stop when you want them to back,
you are just going to pull back, apply a little

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.750
bit of calf pressure and get them to step
backwards. You might find that this is not

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.782
the easiest if your horse is not trained back
very well. So you may have to find that you

00:01:09.782 --> 00:01:16.450
have to pull a lot harder in the beginning.
But to give your horse pretty easy for small

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.240
rewards so if you get one step, give them
a pat say good job. You did what I wanted

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.899
you to do. So again when you stop, you are
going to sit deep, say whoa, pull back really

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.329
slightly. You go to back, you just going to
pull back gently on your reins, apply a little

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.140
bit of leg pressure, stay sitting square in
your saddle, you may lean back a little bit,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.950
apply a little bit deeper pressure with your
sit bones. You don't want to be sitting forward

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.180
cause that is a cue that you want your horse
to go forward. So make sure you are staying

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.780
nice and balanced, you are staying square
on your seat bones and your just gently pulling

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.189
your horse backwards. So that is how you would
want to stop your horse and back using 2 reins.
