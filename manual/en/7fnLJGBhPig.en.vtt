Hi, this is Joelle Meijer.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.700
I will show you how to create a whale from
a sheet of Bristol paper.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.990
Start by folding the sheet of Bristol paper
in half.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.330
Draw the body of the whale which will occupy
the greatest part of the half sheet.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.390
Then, on one side, draw the tail.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.510
If necessary, refer to the diagram in the
free printable document.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.990
Cut the two layers of Bristol paper to obtain
on one hand, the body of the whale

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.960
and on the other, the tail.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.399
With the rest of the paper, you can make fins
for example.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.690
To create the body of the whale, you first
create each side of the body separately.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.629
Start with one side and glue the tail to the
body.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.680
Separately, make the other side as a mirror
image of the first side

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.770
and make sure that both sides of the whale
have the same overall length.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.090
When painting, it's also important to work
symmetrically

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.810
otherwise, one side will be on the inside
and it will not be visible.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.670
Start by painting the inside of the eye with
white.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.920
While the white of the eye dries, decorate
the whale as you wish.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.180
You can represent an existing kind of whale
or you can be more fanciful.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.540
In my case, I wanted to represent a humpback
whale, so I painted the belly gray

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.409
and I made gray circles to represent the tubercles
on the front of the head.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:42.159
When the white of the eye is dry, paint the
iris and then add a black dot for the pupil.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.990
The humpback whale has streaks on the belly
that I represented by black lines.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.060
To represent the spray of water that whales
emit from a hole at the top of their head,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.290
draw it on blue construction paper.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.430
Cut two layers and glue them to one another
so that it will remain vertical

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.180
when it is glued to the whale.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.000
To assemble the whale, place one of the halves
with the unpainted side up.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.910
Apply glue all around except along the bottom
edge.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.830
Put the other half whale on top without forgetting
to put the spray of water

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.490
between the two sides of the whale and let
dry.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.920
Glue the fins on either side of the body.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.020
The whale is now complete and can be worn
as a sort of hat.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.730
To celebrate Earth Day, kids could make a
parade of whales, each of them an original

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.750
creation!

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.260
This is a great way to educate the kids about
these endangered large mammals!

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.670
