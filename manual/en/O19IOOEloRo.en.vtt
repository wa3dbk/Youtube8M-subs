WHY HAVE A RESTAURANT LIKE THIS?

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.027

MEXICAN CULTURE, FROM THE FOOD

00:01:10.027 --> 00:01:14.407
TO THE DRINKS TO THE SERVICE,
BUT ESPECIALLY THE DECOR.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:18.724
WE TRY TO ENCOMPASS EVERYTHING
AND DELIVER IT TO CLEVELAND.

WHAT IS THIS WALL ABOUT?

EVERYTHING IN THE MEXICAN

CULTURE WE DECIDED TO THROW ON
THIS WALL.

00:01:41.498 --> 00:01:45.138
BEFORE MOMOCHO OPENED IN 2006
IT WAS A BAR AND RESTAURANT

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:45.846
CALLED THE FULTON BAR AND GRILL.

WALL.

WE DECIDED TO NOT PAINT OVER IT,
BUT ADD TO IT.

CUSTOMERS WOULD BRING CROSSES,
THE SUGAR SKULLS, DAY OF THE

AS A SIDE DISH AS A JOKE.

00:02:15.224 --> 00:02:18.703
AS A KID I RODE MY BIKE
EVERYWHERE.

00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:20.347
LOW RIDER CULTURE IS A
SUBCULTURE OF THE LATIN

COMMUNITY.

00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:28.013
I CANNOT REALLY FIT A 1955
CADILLAC IN HERE, SO I THOUGHT,

00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:29.012
WHY NOT BRING A -- SOMETHING
DIFFERENT?

00:02:29.012 --> 00:02:31.717

ESPECIALLY UP STAIRS.
