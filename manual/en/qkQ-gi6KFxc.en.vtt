today's print that thing episode is
inspired by

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.049
disney's new film big hero six

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.200
cuz I fell instantly in love with the
huge white

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.809
marshmallowy robot creature called
baymax

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.779
and I thought he'd be cool to 3d
model and 3D print

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.060
and share with you guys so let's get
started Baymax is pretty much

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.390
a pear-shaped and a capsule then I just smudged it
around like some Plato

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.439
added some fingers &amp;  moved those around as
well

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.059
threw on a badge on his chest

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.579
and then finalized him with some patches 
on his knees and elbows

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.460
the 3D printing process took about
seven hours

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.460
and he printed very well

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.710
BOOM! it's Baymax from big heroe 6

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.550
I just love how they use 3d printing to
you tell part of the story

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.070
and to promote the film and hopefully
inspire some you young whipper snappers

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.640
out there

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.710
to get involved in 3d printing

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.990
because it's a lot of fun and for this
episode if you're the first person

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.020
