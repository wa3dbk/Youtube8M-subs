Hey Guys and today im gonna show you how to use custom Legue of Legends huds for the pach 4.18+

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.600
So since the new Sion-Patch u can no longer use custom hud´s.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.720
But there is an easy way to fix this. This is what i found in a reddit post.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.880
To install the hud go to your Legue of Legnds folder.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:53.060
Go to "Rads" "Solutions" "Gameclient" "lol_game_client_sln" "Realeses" and then pick the newest patch "Deploy" "Data" "Menu" "Hud"

00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:09.540
So usually we just pick the downloaded hud and drag it in here but we have to change the hudname to "HUDatlas.dds"

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:20.500
Im going to show you really quick how it works.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.500
After changing the name just drag it there.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.000
Just simply add a .dds to the end of the hud.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.740
And u can now see i´ve got a custom hud In League Of Legends.

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:43.695
I picked Sion so you can see its the newest patch.

00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:44.695
