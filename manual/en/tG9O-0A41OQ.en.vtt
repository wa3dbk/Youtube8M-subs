00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.260
Why Can Not Answer?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.780
If you wish to sing for all eternity, lurk within the cycle of death and rebirth,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.100
But in the end things will change, as you look back lovingly on everything you’ve done in vain.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.600
Laugh, laugh if you will, as I struggle unto my own collapse,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:49.300
But my heart will not stop loving, drowned in nostagia.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.020
What can I do but continue this crazed dance, my heart overflowing in maelstroms of lament?

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:06.840
A morning in which I need no sadness is still yet far, far away…

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:18.700
These tears that flow as I see the day ending despite my longings unchanged…

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.300
I don’t get out

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.240
Telling on the world

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.720
If be born again

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.980
It’s painful to think about

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.080
If you would sing a song of loneliness, struggle in this fleeting world,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.440
But in the end you’ll see, that it is only an endless repetition of fleeting things.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.600
Laugh, laugh if you will, as I struggle unto my own collapse,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.640
All that you’ll see is down into a bottomless cradle.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.340
If I cannot reach it, will I forget

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.780
That endless and eternal life everyone dreams of?

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:53.240
As I spin interminably ’round and ’round, just out of my arms’ reach

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.940
Life cruelly falls away from me…

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:10.420
The morning is still yet far, far away…

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:21.900
These tears that flow as I see the day ending despite my longings unchanged…

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:33.120
These tears that flow now and forever, inexhaustible for all eternity…
