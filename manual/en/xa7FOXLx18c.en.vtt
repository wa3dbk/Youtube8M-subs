00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.220
 I'm Batman,

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.820
 Im Awesome! 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.040
Brought up in the city of Gotham!

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.880
I bring justice, because it's meant!

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.290
I got more swag than Harvey Dent.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.810
Criminals I'm on the prowl.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.996
Jump out of nowhere and go POW!

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.373
I'm Batman watchout!

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.426
I'll hit you in the face and I'll shout!

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.926
Wear my cowl, when I prowl, to make me feel safe.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.456
No one can find out, that I am Bruce Wayne.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.466
Cut that last line.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.420
I perch on a ledge dramatically. 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.416
Then I drop down and glide Batically.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.216
I'm Batman! I've got a cape!

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.946
Time to face up to two face.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.783
Batman you're insane. I got more

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.896
twitter followers than that guy Bane.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.870
Thought I was Rachel!

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.670
You burnt my face!

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.050
Even that Joker guy is less of a disgrace!

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.423
Now, Let me flip,

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.456
to decide who gets to live and who

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.100
has to die.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.420
BATARANG!!!!!
