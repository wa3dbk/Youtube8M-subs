00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.560
TODD: Oh, hi there.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.640
Glad you could join me.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.389
You caught me moonlighting
at my other gig

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:09.520
as an indie game developer.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.240
I am putting a few touches on
the next update of my game,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.780
and my friend Gus
is here to give me

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.460
some feedback for
our beta testers.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.055
So, Gus, what's the good news?

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:18.720
GUS: Hey, Todd, so
this new Uber Leet!

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.400
achievement that we
added, it's way too easy.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.030
TODD: Really?

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.238
GUS: Yeah, I was able to
get it in like five minutes.

00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:25.850
TODD: Oh, well, let
me fix that here.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.495
A little coding, and done.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.630
All right, can you
try earning it again?

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.920
GUS: Well, I already
have the achievement,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.810
so I can't earn it again.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.351
Can you, like, reset it for me?

00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:36.850
TODD: What?

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.930
Reset an achievement?

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.450
What am I, some sort of wizard?

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.754
What's next on your list?

00:00:40.754 --> 00:00:42.920
GUS: Well, you know this
new high score leaderboard?

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.380
TODD: Yeah.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.410
GUS: Your beta
testers are saying

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.020
that there's a bug report
saying that the scores are now

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.460
double what they should be.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.080
TODD: Oh, well, I can fix that.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.636
Let's remove the
times two, and done.

00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:57.010
All right, ask
them to try again.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.510
GUS: Well, they already
have these super-high scores

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.600
on the leaderboard, so
it's going to stay broken.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.190
Can you remove their scores?

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.690
TODD: What?

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.920
Reset a leaderboard?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.840
Again, not a wizard.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.840
Is there anything else?

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.085
GUS: Yeah, a couple of
cheaters found an exploit

00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:10.980
to cheat their way to the top
of the fastest time leaderboard.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.231
Can we remove them?

00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:12.730
TODD: What?

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.190
Remove players
from a leaderboard?

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.482
OK, seriously, I
am not a wizard.

00:01:16.482 --> 00:01:18.190
Speaking of, what
happened to our wizard?

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.010
Didn't we used to
have one on staff?

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.512
GUS: Yeah, he left a palantir.

00:01:22.512 --> 00:01:23.053
TODD: Wizard!

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.970
Well, for those of you who
don't have a wizard on staff,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.670
we have the next best
thing available--

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.680
the management APIs for
Google Play game services.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.160
So the management APIs
are a set of rest calls

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.405
that do things that an
ordinary player can't do.

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:40.030
Now if you were to
take a look at them,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.960
I'd say 90% fall under the "help
you reset stuff during testing"

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.930
category.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.170
So if you want to earn an
achievement for a tester

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.760
or clear it so that they can
earn it again, you can do that.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.968
If you want to remove all
scores from the leaderboard

00:01:51.968 --> 00:01:53.800
your testing, you
can do that, too.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.860
If you've upgraded, say,
your turn-based data

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.630
format and need to kind of
clear out all those old games,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.240
well you can do that as well.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.790
The one exception to all
this is this last 10% here.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.760
And maybe it's the
most important 10%,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.000
because it takes care of
a very important task,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.509
dealing with cheaters.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.550
Yes, in spite of
your best efforts,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.554
cheaters will find their way to
the tops of your leaderboards.

00:02:13.554 --> 00:02:15.470
I mean, look at this guy
with his smarmy face.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.750
Don't you just hate him?

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.790
I know I do.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.290
But with a couple
of API calls, you

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.930
can make sure you never have
to see his cheating face ever

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.155
again.

00:02:23.155 --> 00:02:25.680
The management APIs
have a hide call,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.820
that basically will block any
scores from this user from any

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.587
of your public leaderboards.

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:32.170
Note that this is a
lot more effective

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.190
than just removing
a single score.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.710
If you were moved a score,
this cheating player

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.550
could go ahead and add
something back 15 minutes later.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.710
God, it's like he's a
cockroach or something,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.060
just keeps coming back.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.950
But with a hide call, you're
essentially hiding everything

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.610
from this player
and all the scores

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.520
they submit in the future,
which is pretty nice.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.100
Now in the wrong hands,
these management APIs

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.124
can be dangerous,
or at the very least

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:56.540
a player could
erase a whole bunch

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.370
of scores they didn't mean to.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.140
So you'll notice we have a few
restrictions on these APIs.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.310
First, only the people
in your testers list

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.754
can call these APIs.

00:03:05.754 --> 00:03:07.920
Now you might think that's
a small number of people,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.410
but remember that if you
have alpha or beta testers,

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.760
and you've given them testing
access to game services

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.950
here, this might be
a lot more testers

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.980
then you originally thought.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.170
Second, management APIs can
only be used on tester accounts

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.960
or on game service
resources that

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.210
are still in an
unpublished state.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.670
So if you want to erase
an entire leaderboard,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.170
go ahead and do that, as long
as it is a draft leaderboard.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.570
If you want to remove all
achievements from a player,

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.590
you can do that, but
only for a test player.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.550
If you want to remove
published achievements

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.610
for a normal
player, well, sorry.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.930
That you cannot do.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.820
But remember, if you've got
alpha or beta group selected

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.950
as testers here, you
may have the power

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.000
to affect more people
than you realize.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.100
And again, the exception to all
of this is those cheater APIs.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.150
These will work on
non-tester accounts,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.440
because cheaters are basically
their own category of person--

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.080
really person is
too generous, more

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.490
like kind of a bipedal
creature capable

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.590
of basic human-like
thought or something.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.100
Anyway, third, we don't have a
lot of client library support.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.930
Now on the one hand,
it seems like there

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.700
might be times you
want a convenient,

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.370
erase all my achievements
option directly in your game.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.670
But all we need is one or two
beta testers to accidentally

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.500
find this button, and you've
got some really angry players

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.632
on your hands.

00:04:22.632 --> 00:04:24.840
So how do you do this stuff
without a client library?

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.423
Well, generally
speaking, you're going

00:04:26.423 --> 00:04:28.942
to make raw rest calls
directly, probably from a web

00:04:28.942 --> 00:04:31.150
app that you've built yourself
that only a few people

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.190
on your test team know
about and have access to.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.320
But wait, you say.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.520
I'm a mobile game developer.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.920
I'm all about, like,
path-finding algorithms

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.104
and collision detection
and vertex calling.

00:04:41.104 --> 00:04:43.020
I don't have time to
learn about server issues

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.500
like making rest calls.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.060
Well, don't worry, my pretty
little polygon pusher.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.540
We have a ready-made web app
that you can download and use.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.350
And with a couple of
configuration steps,

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.650
you can set it up to
reset achievements.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.480
You can reset quest progress.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.150
You could delete
a turn-based game,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.090
or you could clear
out a test leaderboard

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.460
and hide some cheaters.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.920
Now there's a lot more that
these management APIs can do,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.150
and we'll be adding more
capabilities in the future.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.460
I encourage you to check
out the full documentation,

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.549
which we will link to at
the end of this video.

00:05:10.549 --> 00:05:11.590
Oh, hey, that reminds me.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.040
I should probably go back to the
studio and check in on things.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.710
All right, Gus.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.850
I have reset your achievement
so you can earn it again.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.620
I have cleared out
that buggy leaderboard,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.994
and I have removed
those cheaters

00:05:21.994 --> 00:05:24.460
so we never have to see their
cheating faces ever again.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.755
How's feedback now?

00:05:25.755 --> 00:05:27.696
GUS: Yeah, it's still
pretty terrible.

00:05:27.696 --> 00:05:29.070
People aren't
digging the update.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.850
TODD: Really?

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.660
Is it the new boss fight?

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.880
Is it too hard?

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.540
GUS: No.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.623
TODD: Is it the epic loot?

00:05:34.623 --> 00:05:35.770
Is it not epic enough?

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.600
GUS: Nope.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.620
TODD: Is it-- it's not
the new bonus level

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.580
where you have to
punch a koala, is it?

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.760
GUS: Yeah.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.670
TODD: Philistines.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.725
They just don't understand art.

00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:47.511
Do they even get
that the koala was

00:05:47.511 --> 00:05:50.084
a metaphor for
oppressive censorship?

00:05:50.084 --> 00:05:52.500
GUS: You should have picked a
metaphor that is less fuzzy.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.550
