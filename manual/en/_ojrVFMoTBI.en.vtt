00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.209
Okay, so there actually, in my mind, three
components to learning how to fingerpick in

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:12.540
this kind of country blues style. And one
is what you saw me doing with my left hand

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.080
when I was playing that more kind of complex
version of like the "Blue Moon" progression.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.180
Which was that, well, even though I was playing
kind of simple arpeggio with my right hand,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.240
right, just with the root note and the other
three or four, you know, notes in the chord

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.970
that I chose to play. With the left hand,
I actually started adding some notes and taking

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:39.160
some notes away. So, if you look at my left
hand, you know, like right, I added a note

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:53.160
there. Now, I can add two here, add one there,
add two here. Okay? So, that's one of the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.630
three kinds of components of fingerpicking.
What your left hand is doing. So we're going

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:03.080
to put that on hold for a little bit now.
So let's think about the right hand. And so,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.300
you know, in order to put that on hold, we'll
just sort of hold the chord. Let's just say,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.360
we'll hold the G chord. I'm going to hold
the G and I'm not going to do anything fancy

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.990
with my left hand. Okay. So, let's think about
the right hand. The right hand actually needs

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:22.560
to be doing two different things. And this
comes from, it actually comes from kind of

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.040
a ragtime style or even like a piano playing
style. Where you think about like a ragtime

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.550
piano player, the left hand is, you know,
doing a style, of playing which is called

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.120
vamping, which is just like, right, kind of
playing these chords, one, two, one two. And

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.770
then the right hand is kind of playing the
melody. So a lot of Scott Joplin is like this.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.070
A lot of ragtime music is like that, where
the left hand is kind of doing this one, two,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.780
one, two vamping and the right hand is playing
these syncopated notes, right. Syncopated

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.560
meaning that they're on kind of the offbeat.
Right? Well, when you learn how to fingerpick

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.020
in this style, you're actually doing both
of those things. Kind of the bass vamping

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.560
and the syncopated, you know, notes. You're
doing those both with the right hand. Okay?

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.640
So that's why I say there are three components
to fingerpicking. One is what the left hand

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.060
is doing, holding a chord, adding notes, taking
them off. Right hand needs to be doing both

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.340
sort of the bass line, the vamping, like a
piano player would, and kind of the more melodic

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:32.240
syncopated notes. And so the way that's done
is by, you know, dividing the labor, doing

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.782
the division of labor, dividing the work up,
between your thumb and then the rest of your

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:41.950
hand. Okay? So, basically, in this style of
fingerpicking, your thumb becomes, you know,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.370
basically the left hand of the piano player.
Your right thumb becomes the left hand of

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.380
the piano player and your other two, three
or four fingers, however many you decide to

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.180
use, become the right hand of the piano player.
Okay? So the next thing we'll work on is how

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.790
to separate what your thumb is doing from
what your other fingers are doing.
