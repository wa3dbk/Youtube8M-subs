00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:06.179
Hey Vsauce, Joey here.

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:10.220
The Assassin's Creed series takes place during
real periods in history. But, what parts of

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.460
the game are actually based on those periods,
and what parts are completely made up?

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.890
Some deeper historical context might help:

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.140
For example, the organizations in the game.
Did the Order of Assassins and the Knights

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.980
Templar actually exist?

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.090
Well, the Assassins were a real order of Shiite
Muslims founded by Hassan-i Sabbah during

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.199
the first crusade. Instead of direct attacks,
Sabbah would send our particularly devoted

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.180
members of the order to kill high-ranking
enemy leaders. In fact, it's currently thought

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.860
that the term "Assassin" is derived from the
term "Assassiyun," meaning "those faithful

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.610
to the foundation."

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.440
In the game, the Assassin stronghold of Masyaf
is the headquarters of the Order. And while

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.270
this was the case during the game's timeframe,
1191, the layout of the castle is mostly fictionalized.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.410
The Assassin's power began to wane as the
Mongol Empire destroyed many of their strongholds

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.229
in the 13th century. And, by the 14th century,
the last remnants of the original brotherhood

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.439
were swept away.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.779
So, while assassination techniques may have
been passed down since then, like in Renaissance

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:16.700
Italy or Colonial America, the actual Order
of Assassin's was long gone.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.529
Now, the antagonist of the series, the Knights
Templar, is another real organization that's

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:25.369
been the source of many conspiracy theories
for centuries.

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.279
Founded as a Monastic order shortly after
the first crusade, they were tasked with the

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:34.130
protection of Christian pilgrims in the Holy
Land. Initially an impoverished order, the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.159
Knights grew in terms of wealth and power
due to the Pope's favor.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.990
Between military victories against Muslims
and using their assets to set up a banking

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.770
system for pilgrims, the Knights Templar became
one of the most powerful organizations in

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.799
the world. However, the crusades dragged on,
and Muslims eventually regained much of the

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.239
Holy Land. The Knights lost their Citadels
and the people's favor, and were accused of

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:00.439
heresy by the King of France just so he could
skip out on his debts with them.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.779
By 1312, the church officially disbanded the
organization. And while several groups have claimed

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:10.459
the be the philosophical heirs to the Knights
Templar, such as the Freemasons, there's no

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.170
direct link of any kind.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.060
So, tales of eternal struggle between the
Assassins and Knights, past the crusades,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.819
are pretty much unfounded.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.060
Another intriguing topic is how the Assassin's
carried out their deadly deeds. In what ways

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.290
are the game's weapons and tactics realistic?

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.950
The original Assassins carried out attacks
with a knife, or other blade, as their main

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.099
weapon. But, unfortunately, the retractable,
hidden blades in the game didn't really exist.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.019
In addition, Assassin's didn't normally use
poison, bows, or arrows. These were thought

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.030
to be sloppy, and increased the target's chance
of survival.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.099
But, alongside the blade, Assassin's also
used intimidation to achieve their objectives.

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:55.099
The famous Sultan Saladin, who was referenced
in the first game, woke from his sleep one

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.670
night to find a dagger and a note on his pillow
saying that he would be killed if he attacked

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.780
the Assassin stronghold of Masyaf. Soon after,
he brokered a truce with the Assassins.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.650
Another tactic worth noting is the aversion
of collateral damage to innocent bystanders-

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.200
a feature present in the game. But, in order
to assert their fearlessness, Assassin's did

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.370
sometimes carry out their killings in public,
which players also find themselves doing in

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.079
the games. This devotion to their mission
was a famous trait of the order.

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.269
Up-coming downloadable content for Assassin's
Creed 3, which takes place during the American

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.709
Revolution, will include a storyline where
George Washington becomes a tyrant and King

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.709
of the United States after successfully defeating
the British. It's an interesting bit of alternate

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.189
history, but the question remains: If he wanted
to, could George Washington have become King

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.150
of America?

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.430
Well, there were at least two points in history
where such a result could have realistically

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.189
taken place. The first was at the very end
of the revolution when several officers in

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:57.150
the Continental Army, angry at not being paid
by congress, were looking for a strong, single

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.620
figure to take complete control of the new
country. Washington easily could have filled

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.870
this role.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.709
If successful in convincing the enlisted men,
the next steps would have involved marching

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.069
on Philadelphia, dissolving the congress,
and convincing the state governments to acquiesce

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.380
to his stabilizing, central leadership- via
a second war, if necessary. Instead, Washington

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.210
quelled the discontent with a speech to his
men urging the primacy of republicanism, and

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.580
resigned his position as Commander in Chief
later that year.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.960
However, another chance at near-unlimited
power was given to Washington when he was

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.729
elected the first President is 1789. During
Washington's administration, he set many standards

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.030
for the office still in place today, including
its limitations.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.520
His arm suppression of farmers during the
Whisky Rebellion was met with popular approval,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.550
and it's not out of line to think he could
have extended his executive powers with the

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.949
people's support, bypassing them in congress
if necessary.

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.870
He also refused to run for a third term, a
custom kept by every President until FDR in

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.400
1940. However, he could have easily stayed
in office until he died, setting the dangerous

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.270
precedent of the imperial Presidency.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.870
Even in modern times, the American people
have shown a tendency to reelect politicians

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.729
in perpetuity. The senate, alone, has had
several long-term office holders only give

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.520
up their seats in death.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.900
It's not hard to imagine US President's also
being reelected for decades, all following

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.819
Washington's potential example.

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:28.060
So, generally, the historical context of Assassin's
Creed is both real, and accurate. Even its

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.110
alternate timelines are not too far afield.
By blending myth and fact, the games are able

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:39.009
to stimulate interest in history spanning
a thousand years...and hidden blades... Lot's

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:40.789
of interest in hidden wrist blades.

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:47.039
And, as always, thanks for watching.
