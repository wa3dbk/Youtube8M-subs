00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.269
To make an Olympic champion takes millions
of young people around the world to be inspired

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.939
to choose Olympic sport.

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.939
We offer London’s vision of inspiration
and of legacy.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.620
The International Olympic Committee has the
honour of announcing that the Games of the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.620
30th Olympiad in 2012 are awarded to the city
of London.

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.000
Sport is at the heart of this celebration
but sustainability has to underpin everything

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.950
that we do.

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.000
And thanks to London’s multicultural mix
of two hundred nations they also represent

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the youth of the world.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.950
Their families have come from every continent.
What unites them is London, their love of

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.980
sport and their heartfelt dream of bringing
the Olympic Games to our city.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.450
To inspire young people to choose sport wherever
they live, whatever they do, whatever they

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.030
believe.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:29.000
First we want to deliver a magical experience,
an electrifying atmosphere for competitors

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.940
and spectators.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.940
To provide the uplifting spirit which distinguishes
the Olympic Games from other sports events.

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:04.819
London’s vision is to reach young people
all around the world.
