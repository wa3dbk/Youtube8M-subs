00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.000
Hello there unboxers!

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.000
This is Sakis Karpas from GameOver.gr in another episode of Unboxholics.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.500
Today we will take a look at Borderlands 2 Ultimate Loot Chest (Xbox 360)

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500
An amazing title by Gearbox Software!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.800
The box is quite big and looks prestigious with all these bright colors.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.050
At the bottom side, Claptrap inform us that we're looking at the wrong side

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.500
while on the back you can read information regarding the game.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.000
We remove this huge slipcase to find a huge black box underneath it with logos of 2K Games and Gearbox Software written on it.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.300
2 Borderlands II logo stickers on the left and right side hold together the box in which several goodies can be found.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.400
I should take a breath though because I have a lot to show you!

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.500
First up is the retail case of Borderlands 2.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.000
A repousse, glossy paper slipcase is covering the case.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:28.000
We remove it to find the DVD disc of Borderlands 2, that can offer you more than 50 hours of gameplay.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.900
Next to it, a code for additional downloadable content

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.600
along with a manual that may be colored but it is really small.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.300
Forthwith we find an excellent matte red steelbook that has the Borderlands 2 logo on the front

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.700
while on the back our favorite Claptrap salutes us.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.000
Steelbooks have become a preferable gift for any collector's edition nowadays.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.300
Next up is the Inside the Vault: The Art of Borderlands 2 Hardbound Book

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.100
Compared to other artbooks, it is probably the richest one in these given dimensions.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.450
Of course, hardbook covers in the front and back 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.500
Inside The Vault provides us with a lot of information and concept art from the Borderlands universe.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:25.700
A second code is also included for in-game content like weapon and character skins.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.000
Field Notes from Sir Hammerlock is another item that is included in this collector's edition.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.500
Sir Hammerlock knows Pandora better than anyone else and in this journal he talks about the most important and dangerous parts of it.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.500
Moreover, 5 concept cards are also included.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.850
For some strange reason, the card that shows Opportunity

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.700
a place that many players will visit near the end of the game

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.000
is included twice.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.900
Maybe because we didn't get to enjoy Opportunity that much in the game...who knows...

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.600
To make sure we have an original Borderlands 2 Collector's Edition, 2K Games included a certificate of authenticity.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.100
The number of the Ultimate Chest Loot Edition you have is also written there.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.500
Moving on, we find a wide format ID Chart that shows us all the creatures that we will encounter on Pandora.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.700
From the weakest to the toughest ones, 2K Games included every creature. A great idea by the way!

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.800
Ultimate Loot Chest Edition offers a four sticker set with logos of 2K Games, Gearbox Software, Borderlands and a Minion on Board car sign.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.650
This black box is emptied once we get this Pandora map out.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.000
This map includes all the areas that players will visit along with fast travel stations.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.700
Trust us, you will need many hours to fully explore Pandora.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.700
We're not done yet!

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.500
Something special is hidden inside this box.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.500
A real ultimate loot chest!

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.300
To be honest, we thought it would be of better quality. Especially the plastic material that this chest is made of.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:59.700
These chests are used to store weapons inside the game. We can use this one to store the contents of the collector's edition.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.500
Last but not least, our favorite item of this collector's edition is the authentic Marcus bobblehead.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.750
Marcus is a gun dealer with a deep-vowelled russian pronunciation that sells guns to the players.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.500
An excellent choice was to add cel-shaded details to the bobblehead that match the series look.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.700
Borderlands 2 Ultimate Loot Chest Edition is priced at â‚¬129

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:48.400
It was released for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.050
Probably, it is one of the richest collector's editions for 2012 in terms of content.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.800
A fair opinion since Borderlands 2 is an amazing and crazy,crazy,crazy game!

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.300
On Monday 22/10 we will upload a giveaway video

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.100
where we will be giving away lots of gifts related to Borderlands 2 and full retail copy of the game.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.000
