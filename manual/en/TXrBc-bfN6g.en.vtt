00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
There is a solution !

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You'll need :

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
a tissue or a tea bag ( more effective)

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:59.000
So, we are going to create a "bandage"

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:02.000
It will last only for a few days

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:07.000
You can use it when you want to cover it, while your nail grow or when you don't want immediately to cut your nail short (for a party ...)

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:10.000
take your tissue/tea bag

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
cut a small piece (bigger than your nail break)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Choose a nail glue or a top coat (I like to mix them)

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
apply on the nail, twice on the break (only twice on the break for the glue)

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and apply your bandage

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
press it to flatten it and remove air bubbles

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
apply another coat

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
let it dry !

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
apply another coat for reinforce ! (glue works better!)

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Remember if you are using the glue , just put it on the broken part of the nail, not on all of it !

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
clean and let it dry !

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
file if anything is not clean on the edges.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
lightly buff (especially if you used glue)

00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:58.000
and apply one last coat of top coat to add shine !

00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:03.000
here is the result ! Not bad !

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
almost invisible !

00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:14.000
You can creat another "bandage" when you want, as many time as you want

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:17.000
You can clean it whith nail polish remover

00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:21.000
I do it all the time for my thumbs who break easily on the inner edge ! Ouch !

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:26.000
Like on these pictures ! I told you ! Invisible ! :)

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
See you on next saturday !
