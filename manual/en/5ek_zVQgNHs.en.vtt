00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.859
When we first announced this

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.620
new Department being established

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:53.158
The various elements of that new Department was scattered amongst eight or nine different buildings in different parts of Douglas.

00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:01.079
Many of them were working in departments and have in fact never had contact with people in the other revenue Departments before.

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:08.969
I think the specific role is to provide an initial and single point of contact for would-be investors.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.449
The advantage of the Department of Economic Development is that on the single ministry there is now a

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.989
one-stop shop and it includes not just

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.989
areas of activity as diverse as tourism financial services manufacturing

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.839
ETC, you can contact us in respect of issues relating to work permits training and other employment issues.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.980
Well the common thread is that that message that the isle of man is a good place to do business.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.590
Many of the the Sectors which we now represent have a natural

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.809
linkage anyway. For example a strong tourist industry is very important to underpin the services which are provided for Financial services.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.830
Financial services need good hotels good restaurants, good air links to the Island so one supports the other.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.830
Inclusive efficiencies for the department we're now going to be able to work much more closely together and identify synergies across the different sectors.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.730
So for example

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.790
Somebody who has an aircraft registered here might well offer as potential as a high net worth

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.810
individual to attract them for potential investment in the island as well and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.679
because we're now all working much more closely together and able to treat that customer as a whole it will be a more effective

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.559
approach, particularly from the customers point of view.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.340
I'm the director of the Business Development Agency

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.720
so I head up the agency which has been created to bring together all the main revenue earning areas of the economy

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.480
So that's financial services, tourism,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.979
manufacturing, ebusiness, egaming, Space Commerce, film and media. We've looked at other models which have developed in other jurisdictions

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.809
And we felt that the the agency model was a good model to follow. And the people

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.209
we brought together have specialist skills in specialist sectors however we also feel that there's a lot of

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.799
Cross-Sectoral work which we need to start encouraging more of. So

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.169
again part of the rationale is to get people working together in cross-sectoral teams working together on and common projects.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.809
Becoming Chief Executive of Economic Development

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.790
I've been very encouraged by the role of the Chamber of Commerce the new Chief Executive Mike Hennessy is very proactive.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.600
They've recently moved to quite prestigious new headquarters, and we see an opportunity to really build upon

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.000
what always has been a good relationship with the chamber.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.760
What I see is the new Department is a step forward in its own right.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.379
Why do I say that? Well, It's gathered together Various parts of

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.870
Industries that were

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.850
Possibly a little bit disparate in that in the past, and it's now easier to liaise and work with

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.790
Economic Development.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.720
I think improved communications with the private sector is going to be a key feature of the new Department and

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:17.669
we've already taken steps to build upon the excellent relationship that we have between government and the private sector.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.899
Actually say that the incubators probably in ones that one of the greatest exponents of that type of partnership between public and private

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.239
sector. The Incubators operated by capital selects a private sector company

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.330
and it's funded by the isle of man government. But it's not just about funding it's about collaboration

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.159
So we work very closely with the business development managers across the department of Economic Development.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.330
So we give our clients all the access they need and you in turn the department helps us by making sure that we're progressing

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.679
those clients and getting the businesses to help so it's very collaborative.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.959
A very important element of the strategy will be working closely with the businesses we have.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.209
Helping them to grow, helping them to find new markets working together with them in partnership.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.440
So it'll be a twin track approach bring new businesses in but also

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.990
enhance and preserve what we have already.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.940
Clearly we recognize that

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.570
finance issues to the fore but we've got some important sectors here, and we are quite a diverse economy.

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.709
I've lived in Jersey we're certainly more diverse than Jersey is.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.849
Take for instance

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:31.469
manufacturing where we have a very strong committee that works closely with government to make sure that the possible environment

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.969
Is on the isle of man for them to do their business.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.399
So we're not exposed as exposed to finance as other countries it still remains a really important element.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.739
But the nature of finance on the Island is changing.

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.879
Our Financial Services Sector is moving far more into supporting of other sectors.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.900
Key activities being how banking supports things like

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.870
Shipping Registry, how things like a business is supported by the banking sector and also

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.449
places like Insurance and insurance

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:06.629
supporting everything from space through to new risk Management. Finance is definitely developing on the Island

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.759
So we're looking forward to taking that finance sector and moving to a new world with it. If you look at the Isle of Man

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.360
in comparison with our competitors.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.130
It is the single thing that defines us as differently to our competitors how private sector and public sector work together.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.449
Particularly access to political matters, the access to regulators

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.659
actually is a unique selling point for the Island and

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.639
If anything Economic Development and the department want to focus on this even more for the future.

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:40.348
We really see this handshake with the private sector as critical to the future success of the island. We believe that the 'Freedom to Flourish'

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:47.699
remains an extremely well thought out strap line for the Isle of Man and certainly one that we are

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.709
reinvigorating and using wherever possible. We think it does epitomize what the Isle of Man can offer in so much as the

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:02.699
opportunity for organizations to come become a part of Island life and to receive the support of

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.130
the government and other

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.909
business associations that are here on the Island is very important.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:18.090
The agreement now is being spelled out very clearly what we expect from the staff, what our targets are it will be far more

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:25.889
Focused more closely monitored I think and coordinated into the future so that everybody will be under no

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:32.159
illusion as to what is expected of them what the targets are those targets will be measurable and we will be

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:38.219
perhaps discarding some old ways of doing business and looking for new ways as well which in itself is

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:39.930
both a challenge

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:45.900
but also an opportunity for many people to use their creative abilities to contribute to what is

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
undoubtedly has to be a team effort

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:54.300
Government pulling together to generate new economic activity to continue the success at the Isle of Man has had.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.569
Everybody as part of that team everybody has a role to play to

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:03.959
Stimulate further success in the future, and I believe this new arrangement will benefit everybody at the end of the day.
