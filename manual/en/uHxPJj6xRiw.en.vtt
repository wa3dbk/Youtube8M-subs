00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.610
Chameleons are lizards that are native to
Africa and Madagascar in particular, but we

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.210
also find them in the Saudi Arabian peninsulas,
in northeastern part of Africa.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.140
The animal we see there is the veiled chameleon.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.919
All Chameleons are some of the most unusual
of all the lizards, starting with their splayed

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:29.919
foot.

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:30.919
They are tree lizards.

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.090
They like to stay hidden in the canopy if
they're in a rain forest environment, or these

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.130
types of animals we've found in desert oases
where they're feeding on insects, or other

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.100
lizards, anything they can get their tongue
on.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.341
They have a splayed foot and a splayed hand,
meaning there are two toes on one side and

00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:50.870
three on the other, allows them to perfectly
grasp branches.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.690
Most of them, veiled chameleons, certainly
,has a prehensile tail.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.040
It can use that as a fifth limb and hang on
in the trees when troubles there.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.220
Its eyes are one of the most interesting of
all animal creatures in that its eyes rotate

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.120
independently of each other.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.840
They can see up and down, or left and right
at the same time, and that really aids them

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.930
in their main task, which is eluding other
predators.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.420
These animals are completely skittish.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.929
They are frightened to be out in the open.

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.210
That's why this one is being so active.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.140
The mistake about them is that they do change
colors, but the mistake about them is that

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.319
change to every color in the rainbow, you
see that more in cartoons when a chameleon

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:37.299
walks by a striped object and turns striped.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.500
He walks past polka dot and turns polka dot.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.639
That does not happen, but the animal can change
every bit of its skin to different colors

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:45.929
when it wants to.

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.579
Here he's grabbing on with his tail and hind
legs, and since we've started shooting, you'll

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.000
see he's grown a white strip down his middle.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.689
He's put these patches out here of white,
and he's darkened his whole body.

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.640
He will darken and lighten and change colors
based on his mood, which right now is not

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.880
happy, because he's secretive and wants to
be hidden.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.630
He's always trying to hide behind the branch,
and making his body very lateral to merge

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.920
with the branch, in order to escape us seeing
him.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.739
He's not going to be happy until he camouflages
himself, and there he goes hiding.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.450
Up at the top we see baby ones who aren't
worried about that, but every chameleon is

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.909
more worried about camouflage than anything
else i.

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.159
So, they can change colors, that's for sure.

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.769
There's a variety of different types of chameleons.

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.490
They can change colors based on their mood,
based on seeing a rival, based on seeing a

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.490
mate.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.299
Their prehensile tail and their moving eyes
and then their herky, jerky type of motion,

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.700
they walk like Michael Jackson used to do
the moon walk.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.040
They go back and forth, because they want
to stay hidden from anybody that's looking

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.040
to eat him.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.379
In nature, their last bit in their arsenal
to stay hidden is they move backwards and

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:58.379
forwards.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.430
Their eyes are always looking for predators
and for prey.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.900
Once they find a prey item, their eyes turn
forward almost like a gun about to go off.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.760
They focus on what they're trying to eat and
then their tongue comes out, almost the length

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.019
of their entire body.

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.810
It's got a sticky wad on the end, and it'll
grab the prey, pull it back into its mouth,

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.260
and make a meal out of it.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.760
That way, they don't have to lurch forward
and be exposed to potential predators while

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.819
they're eating.

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.860
Everything about the chameleon is an effort
to hide, and the veiled chameleon is one of

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.090
the best.
