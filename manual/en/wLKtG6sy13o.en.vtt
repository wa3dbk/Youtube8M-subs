00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.120
I'm Fraser Cain, the publisher of Universe
Today.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.940
For most of us, stuck here on Earth, we see
very little of the rest of the Solar System.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.070
Just the bright Sun during the day, the Moon
and the planets at night.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.909
But in fact, we're embedded in a huge Solar
System that extends across a vast amount of

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:20.909
space.

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:25.519
Which begs the question, just how big is the
Solar System?

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.960
Before we can give a sense of scale, let's
consider the units of measurement.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.210
Distances in space are so vast, regular meters
and kilometers don't cut it.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.260
Astronomers use a much larger measurement,
called the astronomical unit.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.640
This is the average distance from the Earth
to the Sun, or approximately 150 million kilometers.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.109
Mercury is only 0.39 astronomical units from
the Sun, while Jupiter orbits at a distance

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.149
of 5.5 astronomical units.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.290
And Pluto is way out there at 39.2 astronomical
units.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.880
That's the equivalent of 5.9 billion kilometers.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.241
If you could drive your car at highway speeds,
from the Sun all the way out to Pluto, it

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:19.460
would take you more than 6,000 years to complete
the trip.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.500
But here's the real amazing part.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.000
Our solar system extends much, much farther
than where the planets are.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.510
The furthest dwarf planet, Eris, orbits within
just a fraction of the larger Solar System.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.009
The Kuiper Belt, where we find a Pluto, Eris,
Makemake and Haumea, extends from 30 astronomical

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.369
units all the way out to 50 AU, or 7.5 billion
kilometers.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.259
And we're just getting started.

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.180
Ever further out, at about 80-200 AU is the
termination shock.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.100
This is the point where the Sun's solar wind,
traveling outward at 400 kilometers per second

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.799
collides with the interstellar medium - the
background material of the galaxy.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:08.060
This material piles up into a comet-like tail
that can extend 230 AU from the Sun.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.070
But the true size of the Solar System is defined
by the reach of its gravity; how far away

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.320
an object can still be said to orbit the Sun.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.590
In the furthest reaches of the Solar System
is the Oort Cloud; a theorized cloud of icy

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:32.150
objects that could orbit the Sun to a distance
of 100,000 astronomical units, or 1.87 light-years

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.420
away.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.690
Although we can't see the Oort Cloud directly,
the long-period comets that drop into the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.050
inner Solar System from time to time are thought
to originate from this region.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.440
The Sun's gravity dominates local space out
to a distance of about 2 light-years, or almost

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.770
half the distance from the Sun to the nearest
star: Proxima Centauri.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.590
Believe it or not, any object within this
region would probably be orbiting the Sun,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.040
and be thought to be a part of the Solar System.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.930
Back to our car analogy for a second.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.070
At those distances, it would take you 19 million
years to complete the journey to the edge

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.710
of the Solar System.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.980
Even NASA's New Horizons spacecraft, the fastest
object ever launched from Earth would need

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.110
37,000 years to make the trip.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:30.670
So as you can see, our Solar System is a really
really big place.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.510
Thanks for watching
