FROSTWIRE: HOW TO SHARE FILES ON WIFI WITH
AN ANDROID PHONE OR TABLET

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.790
In this tutorial we are going to show you
how to share files over a local Wi-Fi network

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.930
from your Android Phone or Tablet using FrostWire.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.869
Files will be shared with any device running
FrostWire, that means PCs, Macs, Kindle Fire

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.600
HD and Android phones or tablets connected
to the same Wi-Fi hotspot.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.830
Wi-Fi sharing on FrostWire is only meant for
your local network, no files will be available

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.790
to the general public on the internet.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.860
Make sure your device is connected to a Wi-Fi
hotspot, preferably with a strong signal.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.250
Open FrostWire and make sure "Wi-Fi Sharing"
is enabled.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:56.140
To do this open the navigation menu and go
to Preferences &gt; Networking Preferences &gt; "Wi-Fi

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.120
Sharing".

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.670
Now we're ready to share.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.620
Go to the navigation menu and select "My Files".

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.100
Here you can choose which files you would
like to make available on your local Wi-Fi

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.970
network.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.930
From the top menu, select which file type
you would like to share.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.010
We will pick some audio filesâ€¦

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:27.100
You can either scroll down or filter your
selection before sharing.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.010
If you want to share just one file, just tap
on the padlock icon to open it, an open padlock

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.620
means the file is available to users on the
Wi-Fi network.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.990
If you would like to share all the files,
you can tap this checkbox and touch any of

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.280
the selected file names.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.500
From the pop-up menu choose "Share selected
files".

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.100
All the files you've selected are now being
shared and are downloadable from any other

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.900
device running FrostWire and connected to
the same Wi-Fi hotspot.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.570
If you want to browse files shared by others
go to the main menu and see what's available

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.960
by exploring the "Wi-Fi Sharing" section.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.319
