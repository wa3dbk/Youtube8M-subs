(tranquil music)

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:13.695
(Iva) In the city I feel trapped;
I must get out of here.

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.601
(music)

00:00:30.058 --> 00:00:32.371
But freedom is not all I am looking for.

00:00:32.508 --> 00:00:34.828
I have also a quest
which would challenge my limits.

00:00:37.823 --> 00:00:40.453
The mountains are alive
and this is where I belong.

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.848

00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:53.171

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:56.543
[Shkhara,

00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:58.940
These are 3 titans I must conquer,

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:01.324
3 highest peaks of Caucasus.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.025
My name is Iva Tsiklauri,
I am a freeskier

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:07.669
and I want to be first of my kind
to touch these mountains.

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.733
(sound of the wind)

00:01:19.472 --> 00:01:22.682
For this I will do the impossible
and extreme conditions

00:01:22.813 --> 00:01:25.389
of 3 titans will test me.

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:32.519
(thunder)

00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:43.025
(pot sizzling on flame)

00:01:48.482 --> 00:01:52.750
This achievement will be
the best feeling any skier can have.

00:02:00.797 --> 00:02:03.701
(wind howling)

00:02:11.793 --> 00:02:15.210
