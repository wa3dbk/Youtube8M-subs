00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Hello, welcome to MAXreportage for the Yamaha MT-125 test 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
a beautiful roadster affordable without motorcycle licence in France 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
finishing was refined. look at the beautiful headlight with LED 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we can find aluminium parts like T handlebar and footrest

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And air intake could be customized 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
matte painting is very well applied

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the little 125 cm3 15 HP engine is modified to be more efficient 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and look at the inverted fork with big brake caliper as a sport bike

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the swing arm like a banana is well  

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and racing seat very well

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you can buy a special Topcase designed by Yamaha to be well balanced

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
instrument panel is complete and offer a good legibility

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and the onboard computer can be consult easily

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
bad sound ! For a good music you can add AKRAPOVIC exhaust. 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.000
the driving position is sport

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.000
legs bent and hard seat

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.000
but it’s still a roadster much more comfortable than the YZF-R125

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
we will take a small turn

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
it's very light so it funny like a bike

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
in six months we can buy a model with ABS for 400 € more.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And now go to the city. It’s very handy ! 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
we’ve got a shift light on panel. Like a sport bike

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the top speed is 120 km/h on panel in fact 115 km/h real

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
gearbox is soft, smooth and very precise. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Front break is really great !

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Fork does not dive too much

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Good clearance is perfect for roundabouts 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
we can overstep !

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
we can read 2.5 L/100 km on the computer. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It’s very abstemious. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
the suspension is not so good than the KTM Duke 125 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But Yamaha engine is more flexible and the gearbox softer

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and Yamaha is famous for his reliability and have a lot of shops

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.000
