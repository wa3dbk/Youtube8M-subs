Hi Deborah my name is David Burns I'm a sales
and leasing consultant here at Handy Toyota

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:13.430
I know you had been interested in this 2014
RAV4 XLE and its this beautiful blue color

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.320
and this particular one here is in our show
room and I just kind of wanted to go over

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:25.160
it with you and offer you a video for just
a different look at the vehicle.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.310
As we come around the front of the vehicle
you'll notice right here are your high and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.320
low beams as well as your parking lights and
the XLE does come equipped with fog lights

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.840
for your convenience too.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.780
These here are a 17" wheel, the mirrors are
color coded to the color of the vehicle as

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.200
well as they also have turn signals and they
are heated mirrors.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.520
Up top you'll notice this vehicle also has
roof rack as well as cross bars for your convenience.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.930
So this vehicle comes equipped with mud flaps.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.879
As we move around to the back you'll see very
very visible rear tail lights you also have

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.899
a rear windshield wiper and right here you'll
notice this is where the back up camera on

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:24.259
the vehicle is mounted, once inside this is
a really nice look at the cargo mat as well

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:32.229
as where they were able to put the spare tire
for you instead of behind like in a 2013 version,

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.549
also you have a tunneau cover covering up
groceries or other valuables you have in the

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:40.969
back.

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:47.639
Once your inside the 2014 RAV4 XLE you'll
notice it has a 6.1" touch screen display

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:56.249
here you can go back and fourth from Bluetooth
audio AM FM CD USB AUX as well as even XM

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.109
satellite radio.

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:06.130
On the steering wheel you'll notice this vehicle
has hands free settings to either adjust the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:14.290
volume for example the mode you can also adjust
the mode with the arrows you can pick up or

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.230
hang up phone calls and most importantly you
have a voice recognition feature so whether

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.510
your using that for your Bluetooth audio or
for your calls you can keep your hands on

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.510
the wheel.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.620
It's also worth mentioning that the XLE comes
with a beautiful sunroof.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.540
