00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.000
So now, we're going to continue with our shaping
for the crown using the double pointed needles.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.290
I've got my markers still spaced. They're
not every ten stitches anymore, because we've

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.480
been decreasing, but they're the same number
stitches between markers, and I've got one

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.050
marker made to look different, so I know the
beginning of my round. So, just like before,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.320
knitting on the circulars, I'm knitting on
the round, I'm just working off of the double

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.009
points. So, I've got one needle that started
out empty, and I'm going to work those stitches

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.550
off the double pointed needle. I'm going to
knit till there's two stitches before the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.489
marker, knit those two together, I'm going
to pass the marker, and I'm going to continue

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:45.870
this way around each needle. There I am, two
stitches before, and you might have to manipulate

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.670
the stitches, so the markers don't come off.
I'll move my marker. So, now I've just got

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.770
that one stitch, which is fine, move my stitches
to the middle, so they don't fall off, and

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.910
now I've got another empty needle. And, you
always want to kind of pull that first stitch

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.750
a little bit tight, so there's no gap. Here's
the next decrease, knitting two stitches together.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:20.540
Move the marker. Knit to the next marker.
Knit two together. Pass the marker. Slide

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.751
those stitches to the middle. You always want
to do that, so that they're not going to slide

00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:30.900
off. You move them out of your way. They get
less clumsy with practice. Knit to the next

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:39.850
marker. Pass that. And now, the last marker
is the beginning and end of the round, depending

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.970
how you look at it. So, now I've completed
a round on the double pointed needle, and

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.000
you can see that the shaping is coming up
at the same diagonal, because we've just been

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.450
moving that marker. Right there, and all the
way around the hat. So, it just makes a nice

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.520
look as you go along.
