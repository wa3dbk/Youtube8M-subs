Ah, robbed. Ha ha. Hi I am Rokosz, "Your Digital
Lifestyle Expert," and I am here to talk a

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.280
little bit about handicapped controllers,
adaptive controllers, for the Wii gaming system.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.980
Now the Wii system, in my opinion is one of
the best gaming systems, if not the best gaming

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.369
system on the market. It has got a lot of
great games like the other gaming systems,

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.539
but it is this, the remote, and the companion
Nunchuk, that really set this apart. They

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.050
vibrate, they make noise, but the biggest
thing is that they mimic your hand-play. Now

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.000
this becomes a problem if you have a physical
handicap. How do I enjoy all of the functionality

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.790
of the Wii if I have got a physical handicap,
I cannot move my arms? Well, that is the first

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.520
thing. Fear not, there are adaptive controllers
out there. One company out in the Midwest

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.180
called Broadened Horizons makes several different
versions. Now, no matter where you get them,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.850
unless you are inventing them yourself, they
are costly, alright? But the joy of the playing

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.160
the Wii game can completely outweigh that.
But again, you want to understand exactly

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.050
where your physical limitations go, because
they have everything from a silicon-type thing

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.060
that makes you hold the Wii remote very similar
to how you did with the traditional remote.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.620
Now that is the first step. If you have limited
motion, the Wii also allows the old both wireless

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.250
and wired NES controllers or Nintendo GameCube
controllers to go into it. They do have silicon

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.380
types of things that allow you to hold it
similar to the controllers. They also have

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.280
all the way up if you are a complete quadriplegic,
and what they call the blow and sit method.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.450
You have possibly seen people use little tiny
straws to make their wheelchairs move. Well,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.200
each puff or any impulse that you can send
down can control the controller. Now, where

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.630
it gets a little bit tricky is that between
this and the Nunchuk, you have a lot of different

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.781
buttons to negotiate, plus again, the thing
has complete range of movement, so you are

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:59.140
trying to mimic that. Some of them go right
down and attach to your muscles, so like prosthetic

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.600
hands, very little bits of muscles can make
big movements. So, first thing is identifying

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.580
your needs, and there is help out there. Or
use your noodle, like me. I am Rokosz "Your

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.129
Digital Lifestyle Expert" saying play ya later.
