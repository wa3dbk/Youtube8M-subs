 to subscribe to my channel. Let's start!

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.260
First, let’s chop the chocolate

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.920
make sure to use a high quality dark chocolate, at least 60% cocoa content.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.000
This is the main ingredient so go for the best!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.156
Melt the chocolate with the butter

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.840
either in the microwave in 30 second shots while mixing in between or in a bowl over boiling water

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.120
Mix the butter and chocolate well

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.220
add a little bit of vanilla paste if you want

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.720
then let them sit on your kitchen counter to cool down a bit while preparing the rest of the recipe.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.240
In 2 different large bowls, separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.767
Add sugar to the egg yolks and beat with an electric beater

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:28.100
for around 5 minutes until you get a thick whitish mixture. 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.980
By the way all the ingredients are listed below the video.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.680
Clean you egg beater, very important

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.760
and let’s move to the egg whites.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.960
Notice, the egg whites should have NO traces of the egg yolks, otherwise, they will not fluff.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.400
Add a pinch of salt, and beat the egg whites at high speed.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.160
When you start seeing a thick white foam

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.960
add the sugar little by little, while continuing to whip the eggs.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.040
Beat, beat , beat until the egg whites are white, fluffy, firm, with stiff peaks. 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.800
Now, let’s mix all these goodies together. 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.200
Add a little bit of the melted chocolate and butter into the egg yolk mixture. 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.360
Using a spatula, mix in then add a little more chocolate.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.600
We are trying to bring up the temperature of the egg yolk mixture by adding the warm chocolate step by step

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.720
otherwise, if we add the chocolate all at once we could cook those egg yolks and you don’t want that. 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.240
Continue adding and mixing both, until you get a thick chocolate cream. 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.520
Now add the fluffy egg whites to the chocolate mixture, little by little. 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.000
It is very important to mix gently… circular movements, from top to bottom

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.320
 then cutting across with the spatula

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.880
This way we can keep all this fluffiness alive.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.000
That’s it we are done … yep, I am serious. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.340
Let’s prepare our baking pan.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.348
As usual butter the pan, cover with parchment paper, butter the parchment paper

00:03:08.348 --> 00:03:13.080
and in this recipe, I am using a baking circle,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.960
it does not have bottom because it’s easy to remove later

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.920
 If you don’t have it, no worries, just use any baking pan you have.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.420
Ok, pour half of the chocolate mousse in the baking pan

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.560
and keep the other half in the fridge

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.600
Bake in a preheated oven at 360 F  / 180 C for around 15 minutes.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.040
To check if the cake is ready, gently touch the top of your cake with your fingers

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.200
 it should feel firm and springy

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.033
Remove the circle around the cake and carefully place the cake in a plate.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.760
if you are using a pan just keep the cake in there otherwise, it would break

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.880
You will notice that the cake is shrinking and quickly

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.400
Don’t worry, it’s expected because there is no flour in this cake. 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.720
Now place a smaller circle on top of the cake and fill it with the cold chocolate mousse. 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.120
Cover with a plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least 2 hours before serving.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.797
When you are ready to show off your cake, remove the circle around the mousse

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.440
smooth up the edges with a spatula, then dust some cocoa powder on top. 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.200
Let’s slice this beauty… Check this out!!!

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.240
2 layers of heaven… a flourless chocolate cake topped with chocolate mousse

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.520
no one would believe they are the same thing 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.560
and it only took you 4 ingredients to make this magic happen!!! 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.480
This is hands down one of the best chocolate cakes I’ve had

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.865
