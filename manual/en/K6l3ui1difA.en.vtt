Hello everyone, welcome to EZHow channel.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.020
This video will show you how to cut the gate nub.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.000
and how to avoid nub marks when cutting it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.720
or less marks

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.280
I will use darker part to show you which is blue.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.200
So after cutting it , you can see it clearly

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.460
how much mark left on the part.

00:00:54.192 --> 00:01:00.072
This part is from OO Quanta MG

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.300
Many of you may already know that

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.900
when cut the part out of the runner

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.100
,don't put your cutter next to the part

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.220
you may cut in and damage the part

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.080
put it a little away from the part

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.080
and cut it

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.400
do it like this for all cutting

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.260
After cut the part out. Let's cut the gate nubs.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.640
You can see the nub left here after cutting.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.920
Here is a big nub.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.100
and thick

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.380
First, use the cutter cut the nub

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.120
little by little.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.460
until as close as possible to the part.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.420
make the left nub smallest

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:36.886
don't cut all the nub

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.640
you may cut in the part or mak the nub mark appear

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.040
You will know how much you have to cut

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.540
as you experience it.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.360
Then, use the art-knife

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.300
slightly cut the nub.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.640
little by little

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.140
You may turn to cut the other side.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.420
when we cut it little by little, the nub marks will hardly appear.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.940
for this side, let's put the knife close down  to the part.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.340
and cut out to the edge

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.360
You can see that after we cut it little by little,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.760
There will be no nub marks or just a little nub marks.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.140
