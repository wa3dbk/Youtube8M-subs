00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.310
When we were born into this open world

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.310
And welcomed into arms of love and warmth,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.510
The first few steps we took were steadied as

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:48.070
They held us near and helped us on a path, every moment.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.210
When we learn to walk, we fall not once but twice,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.990
And scraped our knees, though it sometimes hurt.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.150
There is something to be found at every turn and corner so unknown,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.430
Filling pages of a book with a smile.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.270
Each time is precious when we laugh or cry.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.030
Learning to understand the reason why

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.190
Is just a part of life.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.730
Easy to take the good things in stride,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.430
We start to forget to thank those who tried to help

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.950
Or disagreed. But, it's all right.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.510
It can be found when we try to see

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.870
That past all the clouds contained in a silly dream,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:15.670
The beauty lies within the likes of you and I.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.590
When we learn to love, we fall not once but twice,

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.210
Imagining we could fly the skies.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.770
There is something to be found in all the good and bad we come across,

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.030
Filling pages of our book with our tears.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.010
Each time is precious when we laugh or cry.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.610
Learning to understand the reason why

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.030
Is just a part of life.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.690
Giving our all, returning the light

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.150
To those who are lost. You won't be alone.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.270
And I will be right here for you tonight.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.150
Those who have fears, please open your eyes.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.670
A lot in this world can be simply shared.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:41.750
We can protect the precious time that we have called life.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.130
Giving our all, returning the light

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.810
To those who are lost. You won't be alone.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.530
And I will be right here for you tonight.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.890
Those who have fears, please open your eyes.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.270
A lot in this world can be simply shared.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:39.550
We can protect the precious time that we have called life.
