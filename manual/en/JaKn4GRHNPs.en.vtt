00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I graduated in 1986 and

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I have a degree in industrial technology

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.500
and a minor in business

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm currently employed at Rolls Royce

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.750
in Indianapolis, Indiana

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.500
I'm the executive vice president 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000
of business operations

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.750
and at Rolls Royce we manufacture in

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.000
gas turbine engines, jet engines for

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.500
ah, aircraft - airplanes, helicopters

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.250
power generation and marine

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.000
Yeah, I really appreciate the university 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
helping me find my first job

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.500
Back in 1986 there were

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.250
different companies that came to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.500
the university to interview students

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.750
and I signed up for a number 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.000
of those interviews

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.500
and I remember the nervousness

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.000
and the excitement you know

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.500
putting on a tie and a suit and, um

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.000
taking the next big step in my

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.750
in my life 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.000
And it was, um, it was exciting

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.250
and I really appreciate

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.000
the university helping me take that, that step

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.250
Ah, when I started looking at colleges

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.500
I looked at a variety of colleges

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.000
I probably really didn't know which college

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
was right but after I looked at

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.250
a number of colleges I knew

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.750
UWP was the college for me

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.000
and it was my first choice

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
One of the main reasons 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I came to Platteville was for the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.750
industrial technology degree

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.250
I always had an interest in

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.000
on how things were made 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
how things were put together

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and how things were manufactured

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
so it was the ideal degree for me

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.250
When I went to UWP

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.250
I was the Exponent, the school newspaper

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.750
circulation manager

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.500
What that meant was

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.750
I was the paperboy

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.500
I delivered the papers around campus

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.000
And another organization I was involved in was the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.000
Delta Sigma Phi fraternity

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So it was a social fraternity

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.500
and my junior and senior years

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.000
I lived in the fraternity house and have just

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.000
great great memories

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.500
made a lot of good friends

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.250
and it was a real special part of my college life

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.500
Really work towards your passion

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.000
Whatever your passion is

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.500
find a career in that field 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.000
and really live that

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Show energy and excitement

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.500
about what your involved in

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.000
and what your career is all about

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I guess if I was to give one piece of advice

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to students going from college

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
into the working world is

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.500
It's all about people

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.250
Really build relationships 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.000
in every organization you're involved in

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.750
at every level in the organization

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.000
with all sorts of people

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Because everything we do is

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
through people, with people, and about people

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.000
When I went to UWP I was

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.750
always proud to go to this university

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.000
But walking around now

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.500
seeing all the changes and the buildings

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.750
and the, um, people walking around

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.750
the students walking around

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.500
the energy, the excitement

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.000
it makes me really proud today

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and it makes me proud to show my son 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
around the university as well

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Some of the big changes

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
the engineering building

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the student center

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
all great improvements

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.500
ah, residents halls as well

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.500
What keeps me coming back to Platteville is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.250
a couple things

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.750
First, my kids are 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.000
getting to get to the age where they're 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.750
starting to think about

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.750
college and I wanted to give them a little bit of 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.000
university experience

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and also I feel like I got just an

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
outstanding education at UWP

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.500
so I want to give back to the university

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.000
in any way that I can

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.000
I think UWP is one of the best kept secrets

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
not only in Wisconsin

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.500
but throughout the country

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.000
I think the class size is the right size for 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.500
many students, it was the right size for me

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.000
And I think where these students come from

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
really makes them who they are

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.250
I thought everything looked real new

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.250
I wasn't expecting that because

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.000
you know my dad went to school here so 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.750
I wasn't expecting it

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.000
But everything was really new

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and exciting

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
because I haven't really visited any colleges

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So it made a really good first impression on me
