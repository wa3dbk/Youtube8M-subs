00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:01.781
Oh, my God!

00:00:01.893 --> 00:00:06.296
The Bumstead contracts. l've been
working on that deal for four years!

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:08.557
Get out of here! l'll take care of it!

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:12.632
You could have destroyed
the most sensitive document of my career.

00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:15.229
&lt;i&gt;Mr. Bumstead is threatening to leave.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.671
l'm on my way down.

00:00:16.742 --> 00:00:20.234
We need the first page of the contract
retyped with copies going to Legal.

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:21.871
&lt;i&gt;Yes, Mr. Mussburger.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:27.309
Out! Out of the office!

00:00:30.123 --> 00:00:31.317
Down three points?

00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:33.826
That's encouraging. How about New York?

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:36.826
Not that way, through the door!

00:00:37.498 --> 00:00:40.228
&lt;i&gt;lt&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;i&gt;ll take three hours to retype&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the Bumstead contracts.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:41.427
Where are you going?

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:43.197
Get out! Stop that!

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:45.097
&lt;i&gt;Mr. Bumstead&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;i&gt;s threatening to leave.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:45.173 --> 00:00:47.698
Not the whole contract, just the first page.

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:50.068
l'll be there. Give him another magazine.

00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:52.807
-&lt;i&gt;He says he&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;i&gt;ll leave.&lt;/i&gt;
-l said l'll be there!

00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:57.511
Up on your feet! We don't crawl here
at Hudsucker lndustries!

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.751
-My leg is on fire!
-No assumptions!

00:00:59.822 --> 00:01:03.519
lt's early yet. Just let me know
where we stand at the closing bell.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.200
Oh, my God, the Bumstead contracts!

00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:22.636
No magazines! No coffee!

00:01:22.814 --> 00:01:27.376
Mussburger! l want to see Mussburger!
Or did he jump out a window too?

00:01:28.453 --> 00:01:32.083
Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger, l got you!
l got you by your pants.

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:35.926
Pants?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.436
Mr. Mussburger, l'm gonna give
your pants a nice double stitch.

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:48.636
lt'll make them real strong
and you're going to look real sharp.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.035
No. Single stitch is fine.

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:54.578
But the double stitch lasts forever.

00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:58.377
Why on earth would l want
a double stitch?

00:01:59.654 --> 00:02:01.121
To pad your account.

00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:03.080
Single stitch is fine.

00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:10.523
Damn!

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.473
What the heck! Mr. Mussburger
is such a nice man...

00:02:20.843 --> 00:02:23.437
...l'm going to give him
a double stitch anyway.

00:02:24.547 --> 00:02:27.881
That's some strong stitch, you bet!
