00:00:02.053 --> 00:00:03.611
Great. Bye.

00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:05.318
Brooke!

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.727
Hi.
Hi.

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:16.529
Wow.

00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.472
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:25.907
I'd give you a hug,
but my hands are kind of
full with all the bags here.

00:00:28.314 --> 00:00:30.646
How've you been?
I've been really good.

00:00:30.717 --> 00:00:33.184
How have you been?
I've been good.

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:35.047
Yeah.

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:38.053
You look great.
Thank you.

00:00:38.123 --> 00:00:41.423
The hair's a little different.
Looks nice.
Yeah? Oh, yeah.

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:45.958
You've lost some weight.
Well, it's very
deceiving, actually.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:50.868
I've managed to become thin
without having any real muscle
on me whatsoever.

00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:54.237
Very tough thing to
accomplish, by the way.
I'm proud of myself.

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.800
Well, you look terrific.
Thanks.

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:01.313
I heard your trip
went really well.
It did. It went really well.

00:01:01.383 --> 00:01:02.975
Oh, good.
It was fun. It was amazing.

00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:05.611
I saw so many amazing places.
It was just...

00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:10.184
But, you know,
you do realize
how much you love home.

00:01:10.858 --> 00:01:14.295
It's good to have you back.
Yeah. It's good to be back.

00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:20.158
And the boat.
Congratulations on the boat.
Thanks.

00:01:20.268 --> 00:01:23.135
I'm waiting for it
to get warm, and I'm gonna
come by and take a ride.

00:01:23.204 --> 00:01:26.037
Well, anytime you want.
It'll be on the house.
Come on by.

00:01:26.107 --> 00:01:28.166
Well, I will, then.

00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:31.101
I hope you do.

00:01:32.447 --> 00:01:33.608
Definitely.

00:01:37.654 --> 00:01:40.487
Well, I got to...
I'm going to a meeting, so...

00:01:40.557 --> 00:01:45.357
I got to drop these bags
off anyway, but it's really
good to see you, Brooke.

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:48.389
Really good to see you.
Shouldn't...

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:50.632
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.067
I'm just saying we shouldn't
wait so long the next time
before we...

00:01:54.137 --> 00:01:55.502
Yeah.
...catch up.

00:01:55.572 --> 00:01:57.971
We have a lot more
to talk about.
Yeah.

00:01:58.374 --> 00:01:59.364
So.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.337
Be good.
Okay.

00:02:02.412 --> 00:02:03.606
Bye.
Bye.
