00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.900
Hello and good day ladies and gentlemen. Please excuse my German.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.100
Pep Guardiola's...start at FC Bayern.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:20.100
It's my first time here in Bavaria. I love Germany. You always have to win at this big club.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:29.200
I didn't even know that no German side had ever won the European Super Cup. I want to congratulate the manager, his staff and the team on this achievement. Bravo!

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.600
Pep Guardiola...on the first busy schedules.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.800
The president said: "Full throttle". We're ready for the challenge.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:50.200
It's the first game in the Champions League this season and I'm very proud to be here with Bayern.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.500
Pep Guardiola...on Oktoberfest.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.100
I'm looking forward to it. Can I trust my players during that time?

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:23.500
Yes, it's great. I like it! The women in Dirndls, the men in Lederhosen and beer too. It's nice.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.700
Pep Guardiola...on the title.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:37.000
The Champions League is the more prestigious title, but the most important one is the German championship. If we win it, we will have to celebrate.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:05.700
I'm happy and I'm very proud. Maybe it's just another Bundesliga title for most people, but for me personally, it's my first and most important title here at Bayern.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.900
Pep Guardiola...on being knocked out the Champions League.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:27.700
Obviously it all looks a little bleak two days after the 4-0 loss in the Champions League in the Allianz Arena. But it's not all bad. We did a lot of good things too.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.900
Pep Guardiola...on beer showers.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:46.500
I know that it's a big tradition and I like tradition. The players can know that I have no problem with it. If they want to do it, then they can do it.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:03:00.900
On top of that, there aren't that many chances in a season for moments like these. So they are sure to do the beer shower.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.100
Pep Guardiola...on celebrating the title in Lederhosen.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:22.500
The manager too? "Yes! You will look good".

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.100
Pep Guardiola...on the double.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.800
Dieter Nickles: You've won the double, a great achievement following the treble. That's only happened once before in Europe. Did you know that?

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.400
Pep Guardiola: Yes.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.800
Dieter Nickles: PSV Eindhoven did the double in 1988 after winning the treble. Even Barcelona haven't done it before. It's a great achievement.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Pep Guardiola: Yes. It's for that reason that I'm very proud of my players. You know, it's not easy for a player's head when you win everything. You want to keep doing everything right and keep on winning.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:38.800
But it's difficult for the head, after winning the treble, to then go and play every single game full of intensity the following year. That's why I'm even more proud of what we achieved in Berlin.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.600
I love you guys. I feel like I'm one of you. Mia san mia!
