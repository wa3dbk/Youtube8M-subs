JORGE BENLLOCH: You'll see that more or less,
we are getting--already we have the shape

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:20.140
of the kitty. Of course, we want to have some
kind of movement. Then you just slap here,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:30.840
put the butt there, twist the body, that's
what the clay is for. It's a flexible and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:43.600
elastic material that you can play with. Then
we are going to give him this kind of aristocratic

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:55.190
look that it looks to you with superiority
like we are unable to catch any mouse that's

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:18.310
why cats, they have this kind of feeling that
we are good for nothing.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:31.829
You can see the ears up, nice pointy ears
but different way. Now, we have to shape it

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:42.719
like that. In fact, it's one of the best weapons
that they have against the rodents, their

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.149
ears. They hear in the night when the rodents
are chewing or moving. We are going to put

00:01:47.149 --> 00:02:00.409
the eyes in here and then we

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:18.549
are going to make the nose that they have
a very tiny nose. Okay. Now, we are going

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.779
to start making the legs.
