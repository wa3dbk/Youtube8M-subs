00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.379
The altitude that we fly at is actually above
99% of the atmosphere, which means that we

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.160
have a lot of the same physical challenges
as flying in outer space, and yet we still

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.430
have to deal with the chaotic nature of the
wind patterns.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.060
We need to know where the winds are in the
stratosphere so we can surf those winds in

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.380
order to go different places.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.210
We've been using some wonderful data we have
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.820
Administration, which gives us their best
prediction of which directions the winds are

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.750
blowing up in the stratosphere.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.589
They get their data from things like weather
balloons, but as a weather balloon goes up

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.960
it gets larger and larger until eventually
it pops.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.850
So the amount of time it spends in the stratosphere
is pretty limited.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.760
In comparison, we will have a fleet of balloons
that are in the air all the time.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.280
And of course we have GPS so we can see which
ways the wind is blowing us, so we will have

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.000
a very rich stream of data coming into our
system.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.909
You can kind of imagine putting a whole bunch
of rubber ducks on a lake or in ocean and

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.210
watch where they float to.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.780
You get a very good idea of what the water
currents are doing, whereas our balloons will

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.729
show you what the air currents are doing.

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.780
So this simulation shows how we use the wind
data to predict a balloon's trajectory.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.859
In this video, the red dot in the center is
the balloon and the arrows around it are the

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.200
predicted wind field.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.319
So you can see, as the wind field changes,
the red arrow shows the velocity of the balloon

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.250
as it travels through this ever-changing wind
field.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.009
One question you might have is: are our balloons
actually flying at the same speed as the wind?

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.889
And it turns out that we can tell that they
are because we've actually flown microphones

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:54.189
on our balloon and it's very quiet when we're
flying in the stratosphere.

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.359
That tells us there's no wind rushing past,
and that's because we're flying at the same

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:01.049
speed as the wind around us.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.219
Right now we're only flying a few balloons,
but we're already gathering a lot of really

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.899
exciting data that's helping us understand
the stratospheric winds better.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.180
And as we have a better understanding, that's
enabling us to fly more balloons with greater

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.610
confidence, and provide ourselves with even
more data.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.700
So we have this ever-improving understanding
of the stratosphere.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.470
We've actually been talking to NOAA and working
with them to feed some of the data from our

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.780
balloons back into their models and as our
fleet comes fully online, we'll be able to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.040
significantly improve the quality of wind
predictions that NOAA's able to provide to

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.830
others as well.
