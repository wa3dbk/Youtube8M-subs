00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.422
&nbsp;      We are super excited!

00:00:07.422 --> 00:00:12.418
&nbsp;      Today we announced 
with GM the launch of 4G LTE

00:00:12.418 --> 00:00:18.882
&nbsp;      on the GM line of cars that are served 
by OnStar in the US and in Canada.

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:21.238
&nbsp;      That means that all the US cars 
that are manufactured

00:00:21.238 --> 00:00:26.288
&nbsp;      by GM and in Canada, 
will be connected by AT&amp;T.

00:00:26.288 --> 00:00:30.847
&nbsp;      This deployment is the 
largest deployment of LTE

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:33.405
&nbsp;      by a car manufacturer 
in the industry.

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:36.888
&nbsp;      So, we are right 
in the forefront of taking the cars

00:00:36.888 --> 00:00:40.822
&nbsp;      and reinventing how they interact 
with our network and the internet,

00:00:40.822 --> 00:00:43.838
&nbsp;      it’s a very exciting time 
and a very innovative time

00:00:43.838 --> 00:00:47.165
&nbsp;      as we collaborate 
with GM to create

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:49.832
&nbsp;      and re-imagine what a car 
is like on the inside.

00:00:49.832 --> 00:00:53.410
&nbsp;      I tell people that cars 
are going to be safer,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.355
&nbsp;      they’re going to be more secure, 
and they’re going to be more satisfying

00:00:57.355 --> 00:01:00.697
&nbsp;      to the driver and the passengers 
of the car.

00:01:00.697 --> 00:01:02.612
&nbsp;      The cars that are 
in back of us right here,

00:01:02.612 --> 00:01:09.432
&nbsp;      actually have cameras underneath 
the rear mirrors, the rear view mirrors,

00:01:09.432 --> 00:01:13.933
&nbsp;      so that you can actually be looking 
at anything surrounding the car,

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.122
&nbsp;      even if 
you’re not in the car.

00:01:16.122 --> 00:01:20.048
&nbsp;      So it is an amazing time 
and they’re just getting started,

00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:24.952
&nbsp;      so we are really thrilled to be working 
with GM, and collaborating with them,

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:28.607
&nbsp;      and re-imaging what the car 
of the future will be like.

00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:31.302
&nbsp;      It’s an exciting time 
for AT&amp;T and GM.

00:01:31.302 --> 00:01:33.787
&nbsp;      Well Digital Life, 
we have a great exhibit here,

00:01:33.787 --> 00:01:39.125
&nbsp;      it’s an exhibit designed to appeal also 
to the international partners carriers

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:41.380
&nbsp;      that may want 
to license Digital Life.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.238
&nbsp;      And as I’ve spoken to several 
of them last night,

00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:47.615
&nbsp;      there is a great deal of excitement 
about that technology

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:49.545
&nbsp;      because it brings 
additional revenue

00:01:49.545 --> 00:01:54.248
&nbsp;      using the same exact transport 
technology that we use today.

00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:56.712
&nbsp;      So the other carriers 
are very interested in that,

00:01:56.712 --> 00:01:59.462
&nbsp;      we hope we can strike some deals 
while we are here in Barcelona.

00:01:59.462 --> 00:02:04.003
&nbsp;      So both the Connected Car, 
the Digital Life in this Connected City

00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:06.625
&nbsp;      are some of the greatest things 
that people are going to come look at.

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:09.258
