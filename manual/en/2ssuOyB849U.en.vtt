G'day, g'day, Steve here

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:17.190
professional Minecrafter

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.660
at your service

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.020
I'm going to be showing you the ins and the outs of all the Minecrafts that you could ever

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.890
possibly imagine!

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.010
Now, first things first

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.500
we've got to go find some wood

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.039
to be able to survive.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.359
So come with me, and we'll get started!

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.190
*singing*

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.320
Now, remember to always be on the lookout for hostile mobs

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.450
that might want to be chopping your heads off.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.100
Ah, we seem to have found a beautiful little tree here

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.380
and I'm going to start punching this with my iron clad fist.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.600
As you can see right there, pop, pop

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.360
All gone.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.850
Collecting that wood like nobody's business! Now I understand this might be a bit more

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.489
challenging for those of you with softer fists out there, but you got to do your

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.760
best to be able to survive in this harsh, harsh world.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.590
Now we're going to have to collect some wool

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.050
to be able to make a bed so we can have a nice, warm, cozy sleep, and be refreshed for the next

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.290
full day ahead of us.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.840
Another essential is a nutritious diet so that we don't starve to death.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.320
This can be obtained by planting seeds so we're just going to collect some here and uh... that's not

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.090
a seed at all. Quite a pretty yellow flower though...

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.430
Ah, these flowers are quite pretty aren't they? Might just pick a few of these up.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.560
Ah, yeah, that's the stuff, got to love the yellow flowers

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.030
Woah, woah, got to watch my step here!

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.400
I don't want to be falling into that hole there... ooh

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.220
Hello, pretty...

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.929
Ah, I could just walk around

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.740
Or I could jump to get it right now. I can't wait that long, let's just jump it!

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.850
Here we go, here we go, here we go. Ooh sh**!

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.840
Jesus, that's going to do a number on the ol' spine in the morning!

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.140
Ugh

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.920
Where am I now?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.810
There's a bit of a light down there...

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.350
Going to have to further investigate this, aren't I?

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.290
Just be careful here, inch it

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.679
I don't want to surprise anyone. What's that?

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.679
Ooh, looks alright, yeah no, no problems, let's go!

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.040
*mumbling*

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.769
Huh, is somebody there?

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.529
Hey! I'm Steve!

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:38.009
