00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.870
(Ow Ow, That's me you're biting)

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.370
After getting the seed sticks, I was looking
forward to the Budgerigar exhibit.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.750
I do not have much experience with budgies
myself, but a friend of mine adores hers.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.790
That budgie was generally well behaved and
mostly quiet. She had that bird for over 10

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.010
years, and considered it part of her family.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.089
I was kind of expecting to meet tons of birds
just like it. But when I got inside that cage,

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:50.480
that proved not to be the case. Those budgies
were ill behaved, loud, and had a penchant

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.769
for mobbing people with seed sticks.

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.249
They would at times go into a frenzy. During
this frenzy, they would fly at whoever had

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:04.249
a seed stick, and start biting everywhere,
at the hands, neck, shoulder even the head.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.660
They would also land at the visitorsâ€™ feet
and make it impossible for a person to safely

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.430
walk.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.270
Initially, I was a little confused, as I was
not expecting that at all. I thought that

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.550
maybe I had done something wrong, until I
saw a few children quickly exiting the exhibit

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.910
and I decided to follow them shortly thereafter.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.910
Overall, it was not a pleasant experience.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.730
I had a similar experience with Rheas at another
zoo. When I got too close to their fence,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.310
they started pecking at me. When I went back
to that zoo, I just observed that exhibit

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.310
from afar. This is pretty much what I would
do if I were to return to this exhibit.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.569
Their ill behavior could be due to many factors
such as too many of them in one really small

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:41.439
area, the season, or just hunger. It could
be that taming them requires a personal touch.

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.439
Something that a revolving door of visitors
may not be able to accomplish.

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.400
This specie has been kept as a pet since 1850,
according to the wikipedia. They are very

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.340
popular birds around the world due to their
striking colors, easy of maintenance, and

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.430
ability to mimic speech.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.069
If they were to mimic what people were saying
in there, the phrases would be, "stop attacking me",

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.599
"they are biting me", "I am scared",
etc...

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.599
Alfred Hitchcock would approve of this exhibit....

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.599
(I am like a bird woman)

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:54.329
Not really sure why the budgerigars were behaving
in such an ill manner. I was glad to have

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.269
encountered budgies in a much better light
in the past, otherwise I would have a pretty

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.489
negative impression of them.

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.400
(Ouch... Don't bite)
