00:00:38.898 --> 00:00:41.865
Man: MOST OF THE NATIONAL PARKS
IN THE UNITED STATES

00:00:41.898 --> 00:00:44.832
WERE FOUNDED ON THEIR GEOLOGY.

00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:49.098
YELLOWSTONE DISPLAYS
VOLCANIC FEATURES;

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:53.598
THE GRAND CANYON SHOWS MILLIONS
OF YEARS OF SEDIMENTARY HISTORY.

00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:55.698
AND HERE IN YOSEMITE,
THE GEOLOGIC STORY IS

00:00:55.732 --> 00:00:57.865
PRIMARILY ONE OF GRANITE.

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:09.032
GRANITE IS WHAT’S KNOWN AS
AN IGNEOUS ROCK,

00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:11.398
WHICH MEANS IT’S BORN OF FIRE.

00:01:11.432 --> 00:01:16.365
IT COOLED AND SOLIDIFIED
FROM MAGMA, OR MOLTEN ROCK.

00:01:16.398 --> 00:01:17.698 line:0%
AND WHEN MAGMA ERUPTS ON
THE SURFACE,

00:01:17.732 --> 00:01:20.032 line:0%
WE THINK OF IT AS LAVA.

00:01:20.065 --> 00:01:21.898 line:0%
BASICALLY, GRANITE STARTED OFF

00:01:21.932 --> 00:01:23.365 line:0%
AS SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT.

00:01:23.398 --> 00:01:26.198
IT WAS RED-HOT, FLUID ROCK,

00:01:26.232 --> 00:01:28.032
BUT INSTEAD OF MAKING IT UP
TO THE SURFACE

00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:30.598
AND ERUPTING AS LAVA
IN A VOLCANO,

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.998
IT STAYED MANY MILES
BELOW THE SURFACE

00:01:33.032 --> 00:01:36.465
AND COOLED THERE VERY SLOWLY
OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:01:36.498 --> 00:01:38.898
AND BECAUSE IT COOLED SO SLOWLY,

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:42.698
IT ALLOWED VERY LARGE CRYSTALS
TO FORM.

00:01:42.732 --> 00:01:44.865
Man: IT’S A VERY
COARSE-GRAINED ROCK.

00:01:44.898 --> 00:01:46.532
AND THAT’S THE KEY TO
ITS STRENGTH.

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:48.698 line:0%
THIS ROCK SPENT A LONG TIME
AT HIGH TEMPERATURES,

00:01:48.732 --> 00:01:50.432 line:0%
COOLED VERY SLOWLY,

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:51.965 line:0%
AND THAT ALLOWED A LOT
OF THE CRACKS

00:01:51.998 --> 00:01:53.465 line:0%
TO BE ANNEALED OUT OF IT,

00:01:53.498 --> 00:01:54.998
MAKING A VERY STRONG ROCK.

00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:57.265
SO THE GLACIERS HAD A HARD TIME
MOVING IT.

00:01:57.298 --> 00:01:59.598
AND THAT’S WHAT ALLOWS YOU
TO CARVE THE KIND OF LANDSCAPE

00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:01.865
THAT YOU CAN SEE
OVER MY SHOULDER HERE.

00:02:01.898 --> 00:02:05.532
Greg Stock: GRANITE IS
AMONG THE TOUGHEST ROCKS

00:02:05.565 --> 00:02:07.098
ON THE PLANET.

00:02:07.132 --> 00:02:09.265
I MEAN, IT’S VERY, VERY
STRONG STUFF.

00:02:09.298 --> 00:02:10.965
SO WHEN GLACIERS WERE MOVING
THROUGH HERE,

00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:12.698
THEY CERTAINLY
WERE ABLE TO ERODE AND SCULPT

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:14.198
THE LANDSCAPE SOME.

00:02:14.232 --> 00:02:16.132
BUT A LOT OF THE DOMES,

00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:18.532
THE SMOOTH RIDGES THAT WE SEE
UP HERE IN THE HIGH COUNTRY,

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:21.198
THEY’RE REALLY A TESTAMENT
TO THE FACT THAT GLACIERS

00:02:21.232 --> 00:02:24.532
WEREN’T ABLE TO DO A LOT OF
ERODING OF THIS LANDSCAPE.

00:02:24.565 --> 00:02:26.698
Allen Glazner: ONE OF
THE THINGS THAT MAKES YOSEMITE

00:02:26.732 --> 00:02:29.865
SUCH A GREAT PLACE FOR US
AS GEOLOGISTS TO WORK IS

00:02:29.898 --> 00:02:33.632
THAT NATURE HAS TAKEN THESE
ROCKS AND POLISHED THEM FOR US.

00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:35.332
AND SO WE CAN COME OUT HERE

00:02:35.365 --> 00:02:37.598
AND LITERALLY CRAWL AROUND
ON OUR HANDS AND KNEES,

00:02:37.632 --> 00:02:40.698
LOOKING AT BEAUTIFULLY POLISHED
SPECIMENS THAT IN PLACES ARE

00:02:40.732 --> 00:02:43.532
POLISHED ALMOST AS WELL
AS A COMMERCIAL COMPANY

00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:46.632
WOULD POLISH UP YOUR
KITCHEN COUNTERTOPS FOR YOU.

00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:49.165
SO WE CAN SEE THE RELATIONSHIPS
AMONG THESE MINERALS.

00:02:49.198 --> 00:02:52.532
WE CAN SEE INTO THE GUTS OF
WHAT WAS A MAGMA CHAMBER

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:56.632
AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON THEN
FROZEN IN TIME FOR US.

00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:01.665
Stock: EVERY VISITOR
TO YOSEMITE, I THINK,

00:03:01.698 --> 00:03:03.365
EXPERIENCES GRANITE IN SOME WAY.

00:03:03.398 --> 00:03:05.798
I MEAN, YOU CAN’T HARDLY NOT
EXPERIENCE GRANITE

00:03:05.832 --> 00:03:08.732
IN A PARK LIKE THIS WHERE MOST
OF WHAT YOU SEE IS GRANITE.

00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:11.265
THAT CAN RANGE FROM JUST TAKING
A QUICK STROLL

00:03:11.298 --> 00:03:14.465
OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO
A PLACE LIKE OLMSTED POINT

00:03:14.498 --> 00:03:18.198
TO TAKING THE HIKE UP HALF DOME
UP TO THE SUMMIT

00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:22.365
TO SPENDING 4 OR 5 DAYS
CLIMBING UP EL CAPITAN.

00:03:22.398 --> 00:03:26.865
I THINK MORE THAN MOST VISITORS,
ROCK CLIMBERS HAVE

00:03:26.898 --> 00:03:29.432
A REALLY GOOD SENSE FOR GRANITE.

00:03:59.432 --> 00:04:01.332
Glazner: CLIMBERS TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:04:01.365 --> 00:04:03.565
OF LOTS OF THE GEOLOGIC FEATURES
OF THE GRANITE,

00:04:03.598 --> 00:04:06.032
SUCH AS THESE FELDSPAR KNOBS
THAT STICK OUT,

00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:08.032
SUCH AS THE OCCASIONAL CRACKS,

00:04:08.065 --> 00:04:11.532
SUCH AS SOME OF THE DARK BLOBS
OF DIFFERENT KIND OF ROCK

00:04:11.565 --> 00:04:13.032
IN THE GRANITE THAT WEATHER OUT

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:15.932
THAT YOU CAN USE FOR HANDHOLDS
OR FOOTHOLDS.

00:04:34.432 --> 00:04:37.632
Glazner: OK, SO WHAT
MINERALS HAVE YOU GOT SO FAR?

00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:39.032
Female student:
BIOTITE, QUARTZ,

00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:40.432
AND POTASSIUM FELDSPAR.

00:04:40.465 --> 00:04:43.332
OK. WHAT ELSE MIGHT YOU
EXPECT TO BE ON THIS ROCK...

00:04:43.365 --> 00:04:44.865
Glazner, voice-over:
WELL, I GOT MY CLASS.

00:04:44.898 --> 00:04:47.865
IT’S A FIRST-YEAR SEMINAR AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA.

00:04:47.898 --> 00:04:50.198
WE COME OUT HERE EVERY FALL.

00:04:50.232 --> 00:04:52.465
AND WE ALWAYS BRING THEM INTO
YOSEMITE FOR AT LEAST A DAY

00:04:52.498 --> 00:04:55.532
BECAUSE IT’S AN EXPERIENCE THAT
EVERYONE NEEDS TO HAVE

00:04:55.565 --> 00:04:58.032
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
IN THEIR LIVES.

00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:00.498
Stock: YOU KNOW, YOSEMITE IS
A GREAT PLACE

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:03.165
TO JUST COME LEARN MORE ABOUT
GRANITIC ROCKS.

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:06.032
YOU’LL SEE THEM EVERYWHERE. YOU
CAN EASILY WALK AROUND ON THEM,

00:05:06.065 --> 00:05:07.865
LOOK AT THEM CLOSELY.

00:05:07.898 --> 00:05:11.032
AND I THINK IT HELPS THAT YOU
CAN BE STUDYING THESE ROCKS

00:05:11.065 --> 00:05:12.932
IN SUCH AN INSPIRING PLACE,

00:05:12.965 --> 00:05:16.098
YOU KNOW, WHERE THE LANDSCAPE
JUST SORT OF OPENS YOUR MIND UP

00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:18.865
TO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
IT BETTER.

00:05:18.898 --> 00:05:20.365
Glazner, voice-over: WHEN I WALK
AROUND HERE AND LOOK AT

00:05:20.398 --> 00:05:22.798
THE GRANITES,
I THINK I UNDERSTAND

00:05:22.832 --> 00:05:25.898
A LOT ABOUT HOW MOST OF
THE FEATURES THAT I SEE FORMED.

00:05:25.932 --> 00:05:28.032
I CAN SEE CRACKS THAT FILLED
WITH MAGMA;

00:05:28.065 --> 00:05:30.198
I CAN SEE BLOBS
OF THE DARK MAGMA

00:05:30.232 --> 00:05:32.298
THAT WERE CAUGHT UP
IN A LIGHTER MAGMA.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.465
AND WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
BY STUDYING IT,

00:05:35.498 --> 00:05:37.165
BY DOING CHEMICAL ANALYSES,

00:05:37.198 --> 00:05:39.832
BY DOING EXPERIMENTS TO TRY TO
DUPLICATE SOME OF THESE THINGS.

00:05:39.865 --> 00:05:42.165
BUT THERE ARE A LOT
OF FEATURES OUT HERE

00:05:42.198 --> 00:05:44.098
THAT NONE OF US UNDERSTAND.

00:05:45.598 --> 00:05:48.532
WHEN YOU WALK AROUND ON THESE
GLACIATED SURFACES,

00:05:48.565 --> 00:05:51.032
YOU CAN FIND A LOT OF REALLY
UNUSUAL THINGS.

00:05:51.065 --> 00:05:53.032
SOME OF THEM I THINK
WE UNDERSTAND,

00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:55.032
AND SOME OF THEM ARE
GREAT MYSTERIES.

00:05:55.065 --> 00:05:58.898
I’VE BEEN TO THIS PLACE
MAYBE HALF A DOZEN TIMES,

00:05:58.932 --> 00:06:02.765
AND I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA
HOW THIS FORMED.

00:06:02.798 --> 00:06:05.598
IT’S ONE OF THE WEIRDEST THINGS
I’VE EVER SEEN IN A GRANITE.

00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:08.198
SEEING THINGS LIKE THIS IS
KIND OF HUMBLING.

00:06:08.232 --> 00:06:11.365
I THINK WE UNDERSTAND A LOT
ABOUT THE GRANITES IN YOSEMITE

00:06:11.398 --> 00:06:13.532
AND HOW THEY FORM AND OVER
WHAT TIME PERIODS THEY FORM

00:06:13.565 --> 00:06:15.098
AND SO FORTH.

00:06:15.132 --> 00:06:16.565
BUT YOU WALK AROUND
THE CORNER,

00:06:16.598 --> 00:06:17.998
YOU RUN INTO SOMETHING
LIKE THIS,

00:06:18.032 --> 00:06:19.432
AND IT’S REALLY HUMBLING.

00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:20.865
IT SAYS THERE ARE

00:06:20.898 --> 00:06:22.798
A LOT OF MYSTERIES OUT THERE
STILL LEFT TO SOLVE.

00:06:28.298 --> 00:06:30.865
Stock: I THINK A LOT OF VISITORS
WHEN THEY COME TO THE PARK,

00:06:30.898 --> 00:06:34.032
THEY’RE NOT THINKING ABOUT
GEOLOGY PER SE.

00:06:34.065 --> 00:06:37.698
BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY’RE HERE TO
EXPERIENCE THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

00:06:37.732 --> 00:06:39.165
IT’S RIGHT HERE IN THE CORE
OF YOSEMITE

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:41.632
THAT WE HAVE THE BEST EXPOSURE
OF GRANITE,

00:06:41.665 --> 00:06:44.332
AND THAT’S ALSO WHERE WE HAVE
THE MOST AMAZING LANDSCAPES

00:06:44.365 --> 00:06:45.832
IN TUOLUMNE MEADOWS,

00:06:45.865 --> 00:06:47.498
IN YOSEMITE VALLEY.

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:50.365
THEY ARE A DIRECT RESULT
OF THE GRANITE THAT’S HERE.
