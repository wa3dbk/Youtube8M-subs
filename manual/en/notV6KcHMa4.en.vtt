00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.220
It's our first meal in Scotland, so we've
decided to go with something very typical.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.070
We're going to be eating the National dish,
which is Haggis.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.690
So let's go into Whisky Room.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.850
So today's meal is all about Haggis.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.720
We are starting with Haggis spring rolls.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.730
So let's see what those are like.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.520
We've had a lot of spring rolls lately in
Thailand, Vietnam and other places in SE Asia.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.520
Mmmmmm.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.520
Never Haggis.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.920
And it's also the first time trying haggis.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.830
Oh, so hot!

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.740
Is it hot?

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.740
Mmmmmm.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.620
I'm pleasantly surprised.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.560
Oh, yeah.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.440
Haggis is good people!

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.899
Those are hot.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.350
Mmmmmm.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.150
Wow, so many flavors.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.040
It's delicious.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.980
I think I've found myself my new favorite
spring roll.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.750
Haggis spring rolls.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.520
Background my playing.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:22.420
So for those of you who aren't familiar with
Haggis it's a savory pudding made with sheep's

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.420
pluck.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.220
And that means a sheep's heart, liver and
lungs.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:38.830
And if that doesn't sound appetizing enough
it's wrapped in the sheep's stomach and it

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:55.380
also includes spices and some oats and onions.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.380
So that's what we're going to be trying.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.380
Background music playing.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.380
It's time to cover this bad boy in some gravy.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.380
Oh my, oh my.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.380
Look at that.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.380
So Haggis is served with neeps and tatties,
which is basically turnips and potatoes.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.700
First bite.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:14.130
So I've got lots of haggis here.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.599
Neeps and tatties.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.079
Lots of gravy.

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.079
The verdict.

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.079
It's awesome.

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.079
Yeah.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.079
That's not an acquired taste.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.079
I love it on the very first bite.

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:39.329
Do you like it as much as I do?

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.060
It's a really nice rich winter dish.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.030
And like normally I don't like organs.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.400
I've had liver before and it has a very strong
flavor but somehow when it's all mixed together

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.950
and they add spices and the gravy it's perfect.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.550
I like it.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.010
I like haggis!

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:16.420
And it's a cold day today so 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.840
I'm trying something else very Scottish here.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.840
It's a nice warm drink.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.840
It's called a Hot Toddy.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.840
It's got hot water, whisky, lemon and honey.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840
And that sounds good to me.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.840
Take a sip.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.840
Oh yeah.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.840
It goes down nice.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.840
Okay, First sip of the Hot Toddy.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.749
I'm not I've ever even tried this whiskey.

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:35.579
So let's how it is in a hot drink.

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:36.579
Ooooh.

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:37.579
It's nice.

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.439
It really warms you up but it's not a strong
and overpowering as I thought it would be.

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:42.439
This is nice.

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:49.870
And it's also very aromatic because they've
put some cloves along with the lemon.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.209
Like Christmas.

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.290
So far you're liking Scottish food.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.290
Yeah.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.293
