00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
Sadly, our city is increasingly losing its cultural values

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.299
of identity and the respect. We accept bad attention as 
normal.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.370
We treat bad attention with indifference and disinterest.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:22.370
We do not opt for taste; we adapt to need.The 
cuisine in Cuba, especially in the capital is in a detrimental

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.449
condition, at least, this is what the images
captured by the cameras of our correspondents

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.269
irrefutably establish.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.679
Foods from Cuba are handled badly and brand marketing 
techniques are blatantly absent. The State-owned

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.960
cafeteria food display cases are 
improvised or made by hand, without

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.790
a design; without any aesthetic to capture the attention of 
the client.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.850
Advertisements are shown on a torn piece of cardboard or 
a cracked chalkboard. The

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.860
windows are tarnished by steam. It does not take a big
stretch to imagine the chaos that projects

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.320
from this sector.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.140
Well, the images alone, announce the lack
of service.  Service providers run

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.850
away from their clients, resting behind the
columns. Perhaps they lack

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.850
interest in the service they provide because of how low 
their salaries are.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.980
There is no variety in selection. During our
tour, we visited more than seven establishments

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.980
of the national currency C.U.P. We visited the cafeterias
most frequented by the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.330
majority of Cubans who do not have
access to foreign currency during work hours

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.159
or after a long work shift.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.580
Well, the typical food in Cuba at these cafeterias-in fact
the only food- is quickly prepared bread with fish

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.760
and some sausage. It is no coincidence, that

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.380
food workers in the foreign currency exchange market are motivated
by their profits and invite the client to purchase

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.920
by providing quality service and a variety of popular food
in Cuba.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.270
I ask myself...Why in the foreign currency
markets where the State is the owner; can

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.360
the client find properly designed gondolas,
according to their purpose?

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.560
The service providers are properly in uniform,
and even though a symbolic amount is paid

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.560
to motivate this worker; don't both of them
work for the same public? Or does an interest

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.640
exist in collecting foreign currency before
the national peso, the C.U.P., which is how

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.819
they are paid in our country?
But that is not all. We were able to take

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.650
notice of the nationally manufactured product
values and sold in foreign currency at elevated

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.650
prices, with respect to the average salaries
of the salaried Cuban.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.720
One example of the high cost of Cuba cuisine using the C.U.P.
instead of the C.U.C. : boxes of eight pieces
of marshmallows made in our country are at

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.849
a price of 975 C.U.C., which is equivalent to approximately 
243.75 C.U.P.,

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.510
or a complete monthly salary. A small chocolate cake 
can be bought for 8 C.U.C., 200 C.U.P. It

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.560
is something we Cubans still cannot comprehend.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.840
It is possible to have a lack of products,
but the cleanliness, initiative and

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.640
worker motivation are indispensable for an
economy, and more for a country like ours.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.040
We hope that these images create awareness
in the conscience of those who cause these

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.950
deficiencies, and saturate the colors of our
city so it does not remain in

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.379
sad sepia tones.
