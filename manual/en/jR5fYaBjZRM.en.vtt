00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.900
So beading is completely different than stringing
and knotting, because beading is more like

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.200
sewing with tiny little beads.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.289
And stringing and knotting is about using
beads, but you're going to be putting it on

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.770
a string, as opposed to sewing it with a needle
and thread.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.760
So the first material, of course, are like
the gemstone beads, which, you know, all gemstones

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.770
come mostly in bead form.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.009
These, for example, are amethyst.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.930
These are pearls.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.699
And then another material that is popular
now are the Czech glass beads, which come

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.899
in lots of colors and sizes, and it gives
you more flexibility, because all the holes

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.949
are very calibrated, so they're all the same
size.

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.829
So it's easier to choose the stringing material
that it goes on.

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:01.210
And then another popular item type of bead
now is, that I like to use, are these African

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.680
trade beads, which are called African trade
beads because some of them are really, really

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.479
old, like these ones.

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.509
And they are originally, I would say these
are probably from Urano, Italy, from the pattern

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:14.940
that you see here.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.119
They're great, because they're a little bit
beaten up already.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.729
They're not perfect and beautiful and shiny.

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.740
If you want that look, you should be going
with a Czech glass bead.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.110
If you want more of a used, sort of worn look,
you would go with something like a gemstone.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.250
These I like because they're matte.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.259
If you want a more polished, fancy look, you
would go with something more like a polished

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.259
gemstone.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.280
For men, a lot of guys like to wear these
trade beads, now.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.549
You can just quickly throw them on leather,
and make a quick bracelet, which I'm going

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:50.549
to show you later on.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.479
Once you have chosen your beads, the most
important thing is looking at the holes of

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.289
the beads to determine your stringing material.

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.460
So, for example, I have a few different types
of things here.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.070
The stringing material really depends on the
beads you choose; normally, most traditional

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.119
jewelry is strung on silk.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.290
So this is a great product because it has
the silk cord, and it comes with a needle,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.319
so that's very easy.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.970
You just go, you pick your silk cord's color
and size according to the size of the holes

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.390
of your bead.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.720
So that's for something more like gemstones,
where you want drapey, sort of more polished.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.940
So you would put that on silk.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.620
Then, if you have something that's a little
heavier, you would use something like a Bead-a-lon

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.950
product, which is, Bead-a-lon are tons and
tons of little wires, and it's all wrapped

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.900
in a nylon coating.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.140
So you would, it also comes in sizes, and
it also comes in different weights that you

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.140
need to choose.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.680
So it comes, so this one, for example, comes
with a gold nylon coating, and this one is

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.159
seven strands.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.409
Seven strands of wire inside.

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.580
This is good for something like metal beads.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.519
Metal beads on silk, it'll cut the silk, whereas
if you use something like this, it'll be able

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.930
to withstand the weight and withstand the
sharp edges of the beads.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:24.360
Then if you go with something larger, you
can use leather, of course, which is great

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.360
and easy.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.560
Because it's easy to knot, and you don't have
to do a lot of fussy things with it.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.409
Then there's also hemp, and that also comes
in different thicknesses and colors, and the

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.049
colors are a little bit more faded, vegetable
dye looking, as opposed to bright.

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.819
Then we also, for people who are not into
leather, like at our store we have a lot of,

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.069
sort of, vegan type people, so we offer them
the wax cord.

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.260
So it basically is just cotton cord that has
a wax finish on it to make it smooth and not

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.349
sharp and edgy, and those also come in lots
of colors.

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.769
Everything comes in different thicknesses,
so that's one of the most important things

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.049
to decide when you choose your beads.

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.650
Then another thing I like to do is also use
things like ribbons, or twill tape, or things

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.970
from the trim store where it's more like a
fiber material.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.720
So you can get great cotton, like thick string,
you know, because I come from the fashion

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.780
world, so I love shopping at trim stores,
and there's always tons of great alternative

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.449
materials that are just, you know, that you
can use and incorporate into your jewelry

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:27.659
designs.
