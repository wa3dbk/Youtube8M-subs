00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:07.450
In this episode, How To Delete All Mail on
an iPad.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.300
Before starting the demo, it's important to
note the following:

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.769
For your chosen email account, if you have
many, all checked and unchecked mail messages

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.689
from the native Mail app on the iPad, will
be deleted.

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.829
Make sure that messages you want to keep,
is moved to an appropriate mailbox.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.460
Deleting hundreds or thousands of messages
could take some time.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.460
Onwards with the demo.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.149
Sooooo, Let's Get Started.

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.980
The first thing to do, is to check the settings
of the email account that you’ll be using.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.620
Simply open Settings, and select Mail, Contacts,
Calendars. Choose the Email Account that you’ll

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.890

And check that discarded messages is moved
to the Deleted Mailbox option.

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:04.230
And that the Deleted Mailbox, is using the
Trash mailbox, on the server of the email

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.130
account.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.120
Furthermore; make sure to tap Done, to save
any changes that were made, as shown.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.320
Once the Settings has been checked, open the
Mail app and select the email account you

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.520

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.619
Now for the important parts.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.740
Make sure to Mark all unchecked messages as
read. Tap edit, then on Mark All and choose

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.500
Mark as Read.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.590
Next, tap on Edit again and Mark the first
message.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.500
Now, with one hand, place and hold down on
the Move option with one finger, as shown.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.640
With the other hand, un-mark the first message,
then lift your finger off the Move option.

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.770
If you have performed the shown procedures
correctly, you should see the message area

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.619

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.799
It is now important that you Do Not Touch
any area of the screen, until you see a stack

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.170
of messages, as shown on this screen shot.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.200
It could take sometime to prepare your messages
for deletion, especially if you have many

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.250
messages.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.190
