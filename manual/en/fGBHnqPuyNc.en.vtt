00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:06.633
Hello pilots!

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:11.733
Today, we will discuss with you the LaGG-3, a Soviet tier V fighter.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.033
This aircraft is interesting in many aspects.

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:28.567
It is the first aircraft in the Lavochkin aircraft branch and also opens the way to the Yakovlev branch.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:31.100
Additionally, it has plenty of configurations.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.133
But, first things first.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.433
Its precursor in the branch is the I-16 (late mod.)

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:46.200
Unfortunately, the LaGG-3 inherited only the RS-82 rockets and the opportunity to unmount one of the 12.7mm BS machine guns.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.267
Also, the LaGG-3 doesn’t have the incredible manoeuvrability the I-16 has.

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:59.800
Instead, the LaGG-3 gets twice as many hit points, greater speed, and the opportunity to mount autocannons of up to 37mm in size.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.600
Sounds quite good.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.600
Among other fighters of its tier, the LaGG-3 is also looks quite well.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.267
It loses in durability only to the Focke-Wulf and the American fighters.

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:12.167
Manoeuvrability is quite good.

00:01:12.267 --> 00:01:16.633
Only the A6M2 Zero and the Yak-1 are more manoeuvrable.

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:22.867
A wide choice of weapons allows you to adjust the LaGG-3’s characteristics to fit your personal style of flying.

00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:29.300
With all available weapons mounted, the LaGG-3 has the highest firepower and lowest speed in its tier.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.267
In its lightest configuration, the LaGG-3 is outmatched in speed only by the P-40 and the Fw. 190 V, but has the weakest armament.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:45.967
We recommend to mount the single 23mm VYa-23 autocannon and two 12.7mm BS machine guns.

00:01:46.067 --> 00:01:49.200
Why not the 37mm autocannon, you might ask?

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.067
Unfortunately, its accuracy and rate of fire are quite low and it overheats quite fast.

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:58.433
So, now we know about the aircraft, and we’ve chosen its configuration.

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.567
Let’s get into battle.

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:04.833
We’re at the top of the list.

00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:10.400
According to its specifications, the optimum altitude for the LaGG-3 is 1050 metres.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.467
However, it can comfortably fly at an altitude up to 1500 metres.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:20.400
At the beginning of the battle, fly with a group of allied fighters toward the enemy at an altitude of 500 metres.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.600
You can engage in combat either being at the leading edge or in the second or the third wave.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.400
You should plunge into massive dogfights only if you have support from friendly aircraft.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.600
Flying alone, the LaGG-3 is an easy target just like any other aircraft in its tier.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.233
You should attack more manoeuvrable enemy aircraft first.

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:42.633
They pose a greater threat for you than high-altitude aircraft.

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:48.133
Try to intercept them when flying by or bring down those who try to attack your team mates from behind.

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:51.033
You can attack light-armed enemy aircraft head-on.

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:54.367
American and German aircraft should be your next priority.

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:56.467
Avoid their boom &amp; zoom attacks.

00:02:56.567 --> 00:02:58.800
We’ll tell you how you can do that later on.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.267
Engage them a turnfight and don’t let them gain altitude.

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:04.133
You should avoid head-on attacks with them.

00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:08.133
The Fw. 190V is armed just as well as the LaGG-3.

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:10.133
Heavy fighters are harder to counter.

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:13.500
Try to outmanoeuvre them and don’t let them speed away.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.800
Don’t stay long behind heavy fighters or you’ll be damaged by their rear gunners.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.900
Destroying attack aircraft is quite easy.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.700
However, don’t lose your focus because attack aircraft can destroy you with a bomb.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.133
Sometimes you’ll find your LaGG-3 at the bottom of the list.

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:36.767
However, that’s not an issue for this fighter.

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:42.300
You should stay behind higher-tier allies and choose your targets more carefully.

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:49.400
Monitor the situation around you so you don’t get under heavy enemy fire and stay with large groups of allied aircraft.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.667
The LaGG-3’s good weapons and decent manoeuvrability make such battles easier.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.100
Let’s summarise:

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.100
The LaGG-3 is a really nice aircraft to master.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.167
Due to wide choice of modules, you can choose any combat tactics you prefer while maintaining good manoeuvrability.

00:04:05.267 --> 00:04:10.700
Such adjustability allows the LaGG-3 to successfully counter almost every aircraft in its tier.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.900
If you’re still unsure what branch you want to research, the hero of our story for today will help you make the right choice.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So, experiment and choose the best option for you.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.067
The LaGG-3 will help you with this.
