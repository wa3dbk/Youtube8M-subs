00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.890
Hi my name is Allyson and I'm a proud graduate
of Middle Tennessee State University.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.590
I'm going to spend a few minutes telling you
why this is the best place to go to school.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.880
You may already know that MTSU is the number
one choice of undergraduate students in Tennessee,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.239
but did you know that we are also the number
one choice of transfer student and veterans

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:39.010
in Tennessee, and that more summer school
students chose MTSU over any other state university?

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.559
So why have so many people picked MTSU?

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.989
Magazines like Forbes, Princeton Review, and
U.S. News and World Report have said amazing

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.059
things about our faculty and programs.

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.860
But we also have more than 140 undergraduate
majors, so there are lots of choices and opportunities

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.860
to learn.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.170
But that's only part of the story.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.269
I could spend hours telling you great things
about MTSU, but we only have a few minutes.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.080
So here, in no particular order, are some
of the things I love about my university.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.340
I'll start right here where I'm standing,
Walnut Grove, the space between Peck Hall

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.970
and Cope Administration Building.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.580
It's like everyone's back yard!

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.409
Students, alumni and fans all come here to
tailgate before every Blue Raider home football

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.409
game.

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.479
The team and coaches parade past the Grove
before the game, an MTSU tradition known as

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:24.479
the Raider Walk.

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.140
It's a lot of fun!

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.009
When it's nice outside students enjoy hanging
out here with friends or getting a change

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.930
of scenery to catch up on homework.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.600
I wish this place were open when I was here,
our new Student Union Building.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.550
It opened in the fall of 2012.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.009
This place is huge, more than 200 thousand
square feet, and it has everything, a bookstore,

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.460
copy center, game room and a food court on
the first floor.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.219
There's a ballroom on the second floor, along
with a movie theatre, computer center, and

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.229
plenty of places to study, meet and have fun.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.070
Then on the third floor there's lots of space
for student organizations.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.689
But that's not all that's new, already under
construction is a brand new 147 million dollar

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.289
Science Building.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.640
Check out Walker Library.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.821
Four floors, 250 thousand square feet, over
a million volumes in its collection, and there's

00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:18.980
a Starbucks right next to the front door!

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.400
We call this place "The Rec."

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.540
It's our campus recreation center.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.620
Weight rooms, exercise rooms, a climbing wall,
six basketball courts, racquetball, and indoor

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.099
track and indoor soccer arena.

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.130
It also has an indoor swimming pool with a
slide and diving board and a zero-entry outdoor

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.349
pool.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.760
We have more than 200 student organizations.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.540
That includes an active greek system of fraternities
and sororities, honors societies and service

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.060
clubs, student government and student activities.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.320
Each spring we all get together for the Big
Event, the largest one-day student-run service

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.500
project in the United States.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.989
About 3,000 students log an average of 160
thousand hours every year doing about 300

00:02:58.989 --> 00:02:59.989
community service projects.

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:00.989
We're involved in good works in Murfreesboro,
Nashville and throughout middle Tennessee.

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.790
We also have a thriving sports program here
at Middle Tennessee.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.709
As a member of Conference USA we compete at
the highest level in 17 sports.

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.519
Many Blue Raiders move on the success in the
Olympics and the pros.

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.930
Our football took home this trophy from the
New Orleans Bowl, one of our three appearances

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.060
in five years.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.480
We play football here, at Floyd Stadium.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.599
Gamedays at Middle are awesome, with our huge
Band of Blue, tailgating, and cheering our

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.780
Blue Raiders to victory.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.780
Our Reece Smith Jr.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.780
Baseball Field has been called "The Showplace
of the South" and it's beautiful!

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.890
We play basketball in Murphy Center.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.880
This place gets intense, with lots of action,
rowdy crowds, and Blue Raider teams that compete

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.800
against some of the best programs in the nation.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.319
So why have so many people picked MTSU?

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.400
Maybe it's because we are more than just an
academic community.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.220
All of us, faculty staff students and alumni,
are a family.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.469
We're Tennessee's best comprehensive university,
with more undergraduates than any other school

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:59.420
in the state, yet we've never forgotten our
roots as a small college.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.579
I was truly able to connect with my professors
here, and there are examples all through campus

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.590
of how students and faculty work together
to achieve great things.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.329
And that's probably the best thing about MTSU.

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:21.299
Hopefully you too will be part of our True
Blue family.
