00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:12.250
Modeling in your local hometown or in a local
market or regional market is a lot different

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.980
than modeling in a big market like New York
City.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.340
First of all, most of the time it's not full-time.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.750
It can be, but it's usually not a full-time
job.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.789
And it's usually a place where you're learning,
but the requirements are different to get

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.400
a job.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.690
Clients in those markets that are paying you
money really want you to know how to walk

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.900
on a runway.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.900
They don't want first-timers.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:42.450
So, as you're learning how to do your job,
you will find that sometimes being a little

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.220
bit smaller is okay.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.840
You can get away with it at five-eight.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.250
Your requirements are not so tight.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.880
Clients are looking for different things in
different markets wherever you go, and so

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:04.010
if you're starting your first experience in
a market like Birmingham, Alabama, let's say,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.290
it's a small town.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.170
Probably the jobs you're going to do are fashion
shows in the mall.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.810
There are probably not very many magazines.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.960
You're going to work for newspapers, as opposed
to magazines.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.920
The type of modeling you do is different,
so the requirements are different.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.010
So, sometimes since you're modeling clothes
that come from the department store, not necessarily

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.750
do you need to be sample-sized, so that's
a little bit different.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.820
Sometimes if you're too tall, if you're 6
feet in Birmingham, Alabama, you probably

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.960
won't work, the same way that if you were
coming to New York, that might be exactly

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.550
what they're looking for.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.659
It is all determined on the market that you're
in, if you are the right look for those clients.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.920
Somebody who doesn't work in Birmingham, Alabama
because they're not right might be just the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.290
person that an agent in New York is looking
for.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.310
So, it's a good place to start.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.360
It's a good learning ground.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.310
It's nice to make your mistakes and learn
your job when not everybody is looking at

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.310
you.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.840
So, if you're learning how to take pictures,
I'm a big believer that learning in your hometown

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.440
is a good place to start if you're not spending
a lot of money.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.340
Sometimes, because a client would like you
to know how to walk, you have to learn how

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.340
to walk somewhere.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.389
If you're in New York City, your agents, the
casting director, the designer, people will

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:27.260
give you a chance to learn how to walk on
a runway.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.829
In a local market, they want you to look like
a pro from the second you start.

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.639
So there, is a whole entire business that
has been created in these smaller markets

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:41.609
where you need to go to a modeling school
and you need to learn how to walk, how to

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.790
put on your own makeup.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.140
And that's not necessarily true.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.450
So, you don't need to spend a lot of money
to learn how to do it, but you have to have

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.760
some skills.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.749
It's the same thing that if you wanted to
go and audition for a TV commercial, you would

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:03.489
need to know how to feel comfortable in the
environment going on a casting for a TV commercial.

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.730
You need to know how that filming process
works.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.659
Modeling is kind of the same way, but there
has been a whole business created where people

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.190
will ask you for money when you may never,
ever work as a model.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.469
So, you need to know that you're actually
going to work as a model, and then it's worth

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.489
making an investment because you're making
a business investment in yourself.
