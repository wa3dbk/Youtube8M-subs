00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:16.139
A difficulty that every student of A Course
in Miracles has is with a concept of "mind."

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.689
Surely one can't work with the Course even
for a short period of time without coming

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.630
into contact with this very difficult term.
It is difficult because when the Course talks

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.100
about "mind" it is not talking about the brain.
Very, very often brain/mind researchers (with

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.920
very, very few exceptions), when they talk
about the mind what they're really talking

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.510
about is some aspect of the brain. Something
like the brain is the organ, the physical

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.049
organ, and the mind is the activity of the
brain that can't be seen but yet is still

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:54.220
localized or controlled by the brain. And
so when students see the word "mind" they

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.409
automatically think like this. The mind is
some aspect of this personal, psychological,

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.589
physical self that I identify with; the self
that I see every morning in my bathroom mirror

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.280
when I wake up, but that's not what the Course
means by "mind" at all. The mind transcends

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.650
time and space. Actually, it came into existence
before there was a world of time and space

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:23.430
therefore it is non-spatial and non-temporal,
which means it can't be seen. Often people

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.310
will ask the question, "Where is the mind?"
And while that's an obvious question to ask,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.440
it has no answer because it's not a "where"...it's
not a "where" concept. The mind doesn't exist

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.870
anywhere or any place. Again, it can't be
studied; it can't be dissected under a microscope.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:49.640
It could only be inferred from our behavior.
An analogy which can be helpful is to think

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.290
of a puppet and a puppeteer. When we take
a small child to a puppet show what is seen

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.350
on the stage the adult recognizes is not alive,
even though the child may think that the puppets

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.540
actually move about and speak and hit each
other and love each other, etcetera. The adult

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.129
recognizes that either above the stage or
beneath the stage unseen by the audience is

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:18.780
the puppeteer, the person who's animating
the puppets. It's the puppeteer's voice that

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.780
is heard, not the puppet's voice. It's the
decision made by the puppeteer to have the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.920
puppet move a certain way or speak a certain
way that is seen by the audience even though

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.040
the puppet is not doing anything. In that
sense the mind is the puppeteer; it calls

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.200
the shots. It is unseen, it is beneath the
stage of what we call the world or the stage

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.620
of our life, yet it's what dictates what the
body does. It dictates how the eyes see, how

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.810
the ears hear, how the brain thinks, and that's
why there are many passages in A Course in

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.489
Miracles (in the text, the workbook, and teacher's
manual) that tell us that the brain doesn't

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.319
think, eyes don't see, ears don't hear, bodies
don't feel; they don't get sick, they don't

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:11.739
get well, they're not born, they don't die,
they don't make decisions. Everything...everything...is

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.510
done by the mind, and so what's helpful to
us because we're not in touch with the mind

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.890
is to keep in our awareness is a very important
line that comes near the beginning of Chapter

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.090
21 in the text, which really is the way Jesus
helps us. He says to us, "The world you see

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.000
is an outward...is an outside picture of an
inward condition." The world you see is an

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.569
outside picture of an inward condition. In
other words, that the world that we see (the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.290
relationships that we experience), whether
it's an experience with a relationship with

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.340
our body or the body of another person, the
situations we find ourselves in, in fact our

00:03:51.340 --> 00:04:00.069
very lives themselves in this world are all
simply a projection of a decision that the

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.150
mind makes. The world you see is an outside
picture of an inward condition. The condition

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.319
of the mind is the condition of making a decision.
And so when I find myself getting angry, when

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.590
I find myself getting anxious, getting frightened,
getting depressed, getting sick, and I ask

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.490
Jesus for help the way that he helps me...his
answer to me...is to say, "What you are experiencing

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.530
is a projection of a decision your mind has
made, and if you are experiencing a peace

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:35.080
and a joy that embraces all people without
exception then that is coming from your mind's

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.400
decision for me as your teacher. If, however,
you are experiencing something that is separating

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.580
you from other people, again, through anger,
grievances, depression, or whatever, then

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.360
that is coming from your mind's decision to
be with your ego." Well, what's helpful about

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.360
that is that this now gives us a fighting
chance. This now gives us the opportunity

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.780
of realizing it's not the world outside that
I need to change. What I need to change is

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.520
the way that I'm looking at the world, namely
which teacher am I choosing to identify with.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.020
Through who's eyes am I choosing to see? The
ego's eyes, which would always separate and

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.560
keep me in pain or the eyes of the Holy Spirit
(Christ's vision) that would bring me peace?

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.870
And that would be a peace that would embrace
all people, not on the level of the body,

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.440
not in my brain, but on the level of the mind.
