00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.410
Steve Dotto here today. Our topic du jour:
distraction. How do we deal with distraction?

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.740
Because one thing is certain, the internet
and all of these social media sites and all

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.960
the different feeds we have flowing into our
computer is certainly a recipe for massive

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.330
distraction. We all run into it on an ongoing
basis. You�re working away on something,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.680
you run into a little bit of a road block
and you just can�t get past it so instead

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.199
of struggling through it and soldiering on,
you check Facebook because you just need a

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.640
little break. But then that takes you off
on a complete different tangent and then getting

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.739
back into the momentum of concentrating on
the task at hand, well typically speaking,

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.540
that is more of a struggle than ever and we
lose a massive amount of productivity as a

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.430
result.
Now we�ve looked at some great tools in

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.940
the past that helped. The one that I�m thinking
of 30-30, the task timer that works similar

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.790
to the Pomodoro technique where you commit
to spending a certain amount of time on a

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.360
task and by the fact that you�ve committed
this time unit for the task, you get an awful

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.000
lot done when you�re working in that particular
technique. But even with those techniques,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.090
distraction can still occur. We have emails
coming in. As I said, when we hit road blocks,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.619
we tend to look for distractions on that point
there because it�s just the way that we

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.609
cope. It�s a coping mechanism. So we have
to work or way through those issues.

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.829
Now some people go very drastic. They disconnect
from the internet. There are browser plug-ins

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.850
that will actually stop your Facebook feed
from coming in, stop your email, or turn off

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.200
the internet completely for periods of time.
I think those are fairly drastic measures.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.430
There are some kinds of in between steps that
one can look at and the ones that I like are

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.100
the apps that basically eliminate distraction
at a visual level, at a screen level. There

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.070
are some great word processors that I want
to look at, actually two today. The two take

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.249
two very different approaches to that.
Writing is the thing that we typically need

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:53.759
our most concentration when we�re doing,
when we�re composing letters, when we�re

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.119
writing proposals, when we�re writing a
book, any of those tasks, we really like to

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.239
be able to focus and concentrate. So just
dealing in a word processor, typically speaking,

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:05.950
if you do run into a difficultly, if you do
run into a challenge, it�s far too easy

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.400
to say, �Hey, I wonder what�s happening
in Facebook?� Then you go in and check your

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.290
Facebook and maybe you check your email. �Oh,
LinkedIn, I haven�t checked in LinkedIn

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.062
in a little while.� Before you know it,
you�ve lost a whole bunch of time and it�s

00:02:16.062 --> 00:02:20.230
really difficult to get back on task.
So the two tools I�m going to show you today,

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.450
one is called WriteRoom and the other is called
OmmWriter. You have to say it very zen-like,

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.189
OmmWriter. They both work in both Mac and
Windows although the WriteRoom product is

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.000
called something slightly different in the
Windows environment, but they basically eliminate

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.720
all of the screen clutter and allow us to
just focus on the task at hand.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.620
Now the one that I personally prefer and this
will be a total personal choice is WriteRoom.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.700
The reason that I like WriteRoom, I think,
is because I�m a baby bloomer and I started

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.250
my working career working on a terminal. If
we take a look here, I�ve got my WriteRoom

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.170
up, and it costs like $9.95. It�s super
cheap to purchase. They have, if we find,

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.560
there are the Themes. In the Themes, they�ve
got a variety of different things. They�ve

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.120
got the WriteRoom which is just a nice big
white kind of screen and they�ve got this

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.930
Terminal theme which is what I�m going to
show you right now. When you go into full

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.020
screen mode, watch what happens. We can�t
see any of our incoming email. There are no

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.680
browser tabs to click on, nothing but a blinking
green cursor just the way God intended things

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:44.879
to be. And so I can write. Isn�t that awesome?
See for me, I can spend a lot of time writing

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:50.349
looking at this particular screen. It really
works for me. This is one that works for $9.

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.480
Then of course what you do is export it into
Word or into WordPress or wherever you have

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.690
to as far as formatting goes, but that allows
you to write with absolutely no distraction.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:09.700
Now on the other end of that spectrum is OmmWriter.
Now I�m going to bring up OmmWriter and

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:18.019
immediately, you will see the difference.
Is that not interesting? They add a little

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.000
bit of music. Now the free version includes
three different themes such as I�m working

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:45.819
on here. This particular theme is very winteresque
with stark trees and as I write, listen. Oh,

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:58.169
it is so, so serene. I don�t think using
this tool that I could write an angry word.

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:07.330
No. No, I couldn�t. So this tool for me
might not be the ideal tool but for you, it

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.080
just might be. Now the paid version, the more
expensive one, if you buy the full version,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.680
you get more music that flows through and
you get more different kind of parchments

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.580
that you can write on.
I could see spending time using OmmWriter

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.979
but for me, my choice is WriteRoom just because
you can tell my personality type. Bottom line

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.520
is though these tools will help you. They�re
worth a try, especially when you have kind

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.479
of that project that you want to work on and
you want to sit down and really concentrate

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.250
on it. Then when you�re done, if you choose
to, you can use a tool like RescueTime. I�ve

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.270
shown you RescueTime in the past and we�ll
put a link up here as well for RescueTime.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.139
RescueTime will tell you where exactly where
you spent your time when you�re sitting

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.699
on your computer so if you think you spend
a lot of time in productive tasks, this is

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.320
a way that you can actually audit those tasks
and see exactly how productive you are, how

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.259
much time you spend on productive stuff, and
how much time you spend on the more frivolous

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:09.790
things. All of us can stand from kind of refreshing
or commitment to productivity.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.569
