00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:08.010
Did you know that God says "fear not"
365 times in the Bible - the same as the

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.940
number of days in the year?

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.490
Neither did I!

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.619
That's because it's patently false!

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.269
Lloyd John Ogilvie, the former Chaplain
of the U.S. Senate, wrote in

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:27.119
Facing the Future without Fear
(1999), p. 22,

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.820
"The Lord's constant word to us is 'fear
not!'

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.590
There are 366 'fear not!' verses in
the Bible--one for every day of the year

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.730
and an extra one for leap year!"

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.760
That sounds good.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.220
It preaches well...
but it's completely wrong!

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.360
Want to know the real numbers?

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.720
Hi, I'm David Daniels
from Chick Publications.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.260
I got home from work and saw this
"meme" on Facebook,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.600
the picture with the words on it,
and it told about this 365 "fear nots."

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.100
I decided to check it out for myself.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.040
This is what I do to relax.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.210
I'm a wonk.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.510
But a Bible-believing one!

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.060
It turns out that the King James
actually says "don't be afraid"

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.920
in two ways: "Fear not"
and "Be not afraid."

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.659
"Fear not" is stated 63 times
in 63 verses.

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.560
But it is not stated by God, or else
it is not a godly command to "fear not"

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.870
in 24 of those verses.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.920
That means God or His representative
commands us to "Fear not" a total of

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.490
39 times.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.170
That's the same number as the
number of books in the Old Testament.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.300
"Be not afraid" is found 28 times
in 26 verses.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.150
But in one of those verses
it is not stated by God, or not a godly

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.930
command to "fear not."

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:15.620
That means God or His representative
commands us "Be not afraid" a total of 27

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.700
times.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.779
That's the same number of times as
there are books in the New Testament.

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:23.939
39 and 27.

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.319
A total of 66 times it says
"fear not" in the Bible.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.290
See the picture?

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:40.780
I think the whole 365-366 thing
happened because of a mistake!

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.430
Here's what I think happened...

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.439
Some enterprising Bible-believer
did the research and found the truth.

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.180
Then he preached the truth.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.810
And then someone in his congregation
thought, "I don't need to take notes.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.900
I can remember it."

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.032
But he didn't.

00:03:00.032 --> 00:03:03.859
He got home that night and he said,
"Now what was that number again?

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.050
The number of days in the week?

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.050
No.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.349
Seven is too few.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.950
The number of chapters in the Bible?

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.219
No, that's 1,189.

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:16.510
It's too many.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.430
The number of days in a year!

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.430
365!

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.430
That must be it!"

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.110
So when he preached, he simply said,
"365 Fear nots!"

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.859
And somebody took notes.

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.439
And then those guys, they preached,
saying "365 Fear nots!"

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.909
And others wrote down notes.

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.980
And eventually it came down to
Lloyd John Ogilvie who heard it,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.730
wrote it down, put it in a book, and
everybody's been quoting it

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.749
for decades, from that day to this,
right up to that Facebook meme

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:58.829
last night.

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:06.260
And over the decades, no one
took the time to just look it up?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.269
Wow.

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.889
One person online tried all sorts of
different versions to try and

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.599
come up with 365.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:22.230
They found the 365 was wrong, but had
no idea what was right.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.520
It's a memorable number, right?

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.530
But we have to remember
the right numbers!

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.910
That's why God gave us
the right Bible,

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.599
His preserved words in English,
the King James Bible,

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.620
a Bible that is beyond dispute,
our final authority.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.870
Then we take the numbers from here,
and from nobody and nowhere else.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.220
Like I did.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.000
Maybe now people will start quoting
the right numbers!

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.520
It's still totally cool:
39x for "fear not" and

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.050
27x for "be not afraid," just like the 39
books of the Old Testament

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.050
and 27 books of the New Testament.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.060
It's easy to remember,
isn't it now?

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.169
It's amazing what we can do, when we
have our pocket King James Bible,

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.389
even our pocket concordance,
to find out what God has said.

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.580
So let me ask you:

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.020
What's in YOUR pocket?

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.040
God bless you, and have a wonderful day.
