Hi, I'm Johan SvahnstrÃ¶m on behalf of expertvillage.
Now, leopard geckos, they don't require a

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.300
whole lot of stuff. But they require one thing
that's important, and that's some type of

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.300
a shelter. If you have more than one gecko,
you want more than one shelter so they can

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.460
choose to go in one or the other. And I always
put one shelter by the heat source and one

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.570
shelter away from the heat source. If it gets
too hot under one, they can choose to go to

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.230
another one. You gotta remember, leopard geckos
come out at night, and spend most of the time

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.640
during the day underneath their shelters.
You can buy shelters at the pet store, commercial

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.739
shelters that are made out of concrete or
something like that, those are fine. However,

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.940
I like the cork bark. It's a little hard to
get these days but, if you find it, it is

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:59.030
definitely the best thing to do, to use. Pieces
like this are perfect, kind of hollow at the

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.140
bottom so the lizard can go in underneath.
I put one here where I'm going to have my

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:23.290
heat source, and then I take another one
to put on the other side of the tank. I keep

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.860
a rock in there, as well, that's always neat
for the lizards to rub on in shedding time

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.990
and so forth, and it makes it look a little
bit better, as well. The one thing that I

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.310
haven't put in yet that's extremely important
is water. Leopard geckos, although they're

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.060
a desert species or a dry animal species,
they do drink like all other living things.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:54.450
So, they do need water. I only keep a little
tiny water bowl in there, kind of low so they

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.729
can just stick their head in there and drink.
Don't need to have a lot of water in there,

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.200
just check it, one every two or three days
and clean it out. That's all you need. A lot

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.780
of people have plants in there. Plants are
pretty and makes your tank look a little bit

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.010
better, but the geckos don't really care about
it at all. And they're kind of hard to maintain

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.591
because you have to water them, and you get
water in there, you can get moisture in there

00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:25.450
that you don't want. Now, this right here
is a perfect enclosure for one or two leopard

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.000
geckos.
