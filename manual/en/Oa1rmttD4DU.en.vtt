00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.160
Going to technology is something that’s
inevitable.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.029
People will go to technology because technology
is spreading far and wide it does offer some

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.350
advantages.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.790
But to think that technology alone will solve
problems is not quite right.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.320
I think there are a few fundamental issues
here.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.550
Let’s assume that you can get a hundred
percent connectivity to Internet and all that.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.890
Let’s say all that is true.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:32.730
The biggest problem in using technology is
that if you use technology to improve the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.790
learning outcomes under the present curriculum
and the present education system then there’s

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.790
a conflict.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.370
The technology, information technology is
essentially a nonlinear tool.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.520
You can go to the Internet and serve just
about any content.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.420
Whereas the education system as it has existed
over the 200 years is a very linear one.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.470
Somebody out there in Washington or London
or Delhi decides what you’re going to learn

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.370
in fifth grade and sixth grade and seventh
grade.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.460
And that’s the boring part.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.020
Whereas the kids are learning the nonlinear
stuff our life has become nonlinear.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.340
It’s not assembly line anymore.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.159
We don’t stand in lines anymore.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.280
You want a book a cinema ticket, you want
to book a Broadway ticket, you want to book

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.970
an airline ticket you just go on the Internet
and do stuff.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.710
And this is true of production.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.900
Everything has become nonlinear except where
seasons are concerned.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.909
Whereas the learning systems have remained
linear.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.880
Now when you take technology and place it
in the learning environment, if you make it

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.220
subservient to the current linear system then
the power of the technology is constrained

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.470
and then to that extent it is not affected.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.670
Then its effect is only as much as the school
system’s effect.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.020
Whereas if you were to remove it from the
school education system and say the school

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.350
system, the learning system should be now
changed to suit the new technology then you

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.940
have a particular advantage.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.509
The question is how you do it.

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.899
Second part is in our parts of the world at
least – I can’t say much about the developed

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.729
world.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.290
Due to or shall we say feudal culture where
you have to listen to the elders to start

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.290
with.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.859
Of course it’s changing a little bit.

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.059
Sometimes it’s good to listen to elders.

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:23.040
But you have to – you go to the teacher
– the teacher is the one who gives you answers

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.700
and the pretension is that the teacher knows
the answers or the textbook knows the answers

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.079
or somebody knows the answers.

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.590
Whereas the whole idea is that in the modern
world you should be looking for answers.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.989
You should become a self-learner because there’s
so much out there to be learned and there’s

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.640
no way that the content that humanity’s
generated over so many hundred years can be

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.370
absorbed over 5, 10, 15, 16 years.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.029
So the important thing is to learn the skills
of learning, to learn cooperatively.

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:56.669
The old system says you are going to learn
and you are going to appear for the exam.

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:00.689
The new system is saying you can work in groups
and learn and crack the problem.

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.469
So I think we need to fundamentally change
the way we’re learning, the way that we

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.099
are being assessed and certified as well.

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:13.030
So policymakers – very clearly everybody
says put computers in the kids’ hands.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.799
That’s only part of the problem.

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.299
In my part of the world even the content is
not available in local languages.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.819
If I go to YouTube I can watch many things
but I can’t translate that because of copyright

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.040
issues.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.699
So after all those things are done I think
we’ll be ready for a proper serious use

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:31.699
of technology.

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:36.489
Right now the technology’s only a helper
in the current inefficient system.
