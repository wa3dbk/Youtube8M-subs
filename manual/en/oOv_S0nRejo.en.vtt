"Erythritol May Be a Sweet Antioxidant"

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:12.501
The only nontoxic, noncaloric, or low-
calorie sweetener may be erythritol.

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:14.602
For a while, it was only 
available in Japan.

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:17.202
But now, it’s pretty 
much available anywhere.

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:18.872
It’s found naturally in pears and grapes.

00:00:18.872 --> 00:00:22.072
But industrially, we just 
have yeast make it for us.

00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:23.050
Doesn’t cause cavities,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.031
and hasn’t been implicated 
in fibromyalgia, preterm birth,

00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:33.721
headaches, hypertension, brain 
disorders, platelet disorders.

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.470
In videos in years past,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.131
I’ve talked about erythritol 
as being harmless.

00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:41.721
But, new data suggests I 
may have to change my tune.

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:44.442
Now, it actually may be helpful.

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:48.371
Adding to its role as a “low-calorie, 
tooth-friendly, bulk sweetener,”

00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:51.912
erythritol may be “a sweet antioxidant.”

00:00:51.912 --> 00:00:53.720
This shows the dose-
dependent protective effect

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.840
of an increasing 
concentration of erythritol

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.821
on the oxidative destruction 
of red blood cells.

00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:03.051
The reason they even looked 
for antioxidant activity is

00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:06.762
because it structurally 
looks like mannitol,

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:08.910
a well-known antioxidant.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.001
The problem with mannitol

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:14.100
and the other polyols 
(such as xylitol and sorbitol)

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.250
is that they aren’t absorbed,

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.753
and so can cause gastrointestinal 
symptoms lower down in the colon.

00:01:19.753 --> 00:01:22.891
“Safety studies suggest that 
erythritol is well tolerated

00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:25.154
and shows no signs of toxicity.

00:01:25.154 --> 00:01:28.239
It is therefore an excellent 
sugar substitute [for example]

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:29.912
for individuals with [diabetes]”

00:01:29.912 --> 00:01:31.692
because it can both replace sugar

00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:34.941
and maybe even help reduce 
free radical formation.

00:01:34.941 --> 00:01:38.501
Both are expected to reduce 
the onset and progression

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:44.483
of painful and life-threatening 
diabetic complications.”
