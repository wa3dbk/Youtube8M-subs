00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.240
REDUCES THE AMOUT OF WASTEWATER ASSOCIATED
WITH CURRENT DESALINATION PRACTICES.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.320

###

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:05.210
UTEP RESEARCHERS ARE DEVELOPING A COMPUTER-AIDED
DETECTION SYSTEM THAT WOULD PREDICT IF AND

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.410
WHEN BREAST CANCER WILL OCCUR.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.950
ACCORDING TO ELECTRICAL ENGINEER DOCTOR WEI
QIAN, WHO RUNS UTEP’S MEDICAL IMAGING INFORMATICS

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.870
LAB, THE RESEARCH IS EXPECTED TO SAVE SOME
WOMEN FROM GETTING UNNECESSARY ANNUAL MAMMOGRAMS.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.030
IN A PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL “COMPUTERIZED
MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS,” THE TEAM’S

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.460
SYSTEM HAD AN ACCURACY OF 70 PERCENT WHEN
IT CAME TO PREDICTING WHICH WOMEN WOULD DEVELOP

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.600
BREAST CANCER BY THEIR NEXT MAMMOGRAM AND
WHICH WOMEN WOULD NOT.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.960
THE TECHNOLOGY WOULD CALCULATE OVERALL BREAST
DENSITY AND HIGHLIGHT ANY SUSPICIOUS AREAS

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.960
THAT ARE EXTREMELY DENSE.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.580
IT WOULD ALSO ALERT THE DOCTOR ABOUT ANY DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN THE TWO BREASTS.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.580
