Linda (Colonoscopy patient):
Hi, I'm Linda and I'm here tonight preparing

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.460
for my colonoscopy with Dr. Tabib tomorrow.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.500
I was very hesitant about this bowel prep
kit.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.940
I think it's going to be okay; I've got ginger
ale, I've got Gatorade, crushed ice and a

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.940
martini glass.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.730
This is my prep kit, got it at the drug store.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.640
This is a two-part prep kit and a plastic
cup -- that must be for mixing things up.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.160
Empty one of the contents into the plastic
container, add 10 oz of water to the 15-oz

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.360
one, mix to dissolve and drink over one hour
-- very simple.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.810
This makes it a party.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:47.500
A little crushed ice, and I'm going to add
just a tad of ginger ale... cheers!

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.840
Well, it's not an appletini but it's better
than I expected.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.800
I was the one in a past video that was very
hesitant about this concoction.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.689
I had heard from folks that it was kind of
thick, that it was unpleasant, but this isn't.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:12.630
It's something that Dr. Tabib gave me that
I think is very doable.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.469
It's just like any other liquid.

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.959
It has a tiny bit of possibly a salty taste.

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:25.000
I think my pharmacist told me that's because
it's got a lot of minerals in it, so it's

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.520
probably good for me.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.630
My last concoction, I have a name for it.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.509
It is a "Colini".

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.979
I have a peach-mango green tea, Crystal Light.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.850
The key to these drinks is ginger ale, it
really is.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.950
Here I am with one small sip left.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.149
After I finish this I'm going to have two
bottles of water.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.679
After that, we go on to step 2, which is actually
just like step 1.

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:02.090
It's not the tastiest but the test is important
in that it has to be a clear, good view that

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.299
the doctor has of your colon.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.310
So I understand the importance and yes, it's
doing its job.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.590
I look forward to getting the test over with
tomorrow and getting great results.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.890
That's the point of all of this and I'm just
keeping that in mind.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.449
Good night, I'll see you in the morning!
