00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.789
Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:14.480
Expected Q2 2010

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.480
Nokia's "2 series" range of budget phones
has been quite impressive lately,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.000
and the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition continues
the theme. Priced at just

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.980
â‚¬110 before tax and subsidy, the Nokia 2710
comes with GPS support in a

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.690
package that appears to offer remarkable value
for money.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.180
A quick tour around the 2710's features show
that this is a pretty capable

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.790
Series 40 device, one step up from the Nokia
2700 and roughly a similar

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:53.549
price as the popular Nokia 6303. There's a
2.2" 240 x 320 pixel display, 2

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:58.140
megapixel camera, microSD expandable memory
with a 2GB card in the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.340
standard sales package, USB connectivity (cable
included) Bluetooth, a

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.190
multimedia player and an FM radio with a 3.5mm
audio socket. The Nokia

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.510
2710 Navigation Edition is a GSM-only device,
but it does support EDGE data

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.240
which should make it usable if you have EDGE
coverage.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.670
GPS is where it gets interesting - Nokia say
that

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.390
the 2710 Navigation Edition comes with Nokia
Maps plus a lifetime licence for their navigation

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.930
software, which gives turn-by-turn navigation
with voice guidance. The catch is that this

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.470
is only
available in certain countries, and right

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.800
at the moment Nokia isn't saying which countries
those

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.810
are. Local maps are preloaded onto the 2GB
card, and in select markets the Nokia 2710

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.370
also
includes a car charger and in-car mount.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.230
As a satellite navigation device, it certainly
has its limits. The biggest problem on the

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.010
Nokia 2710
is always going to be the relatively small

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.590
non-touch sensitive display. And even though
the low cost

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.480
means that the 2710 is very good value, it's
worth noting that you can get a TomTom ONE

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.900
for
about the same price as a SIM-free version.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.961
However, the compact size of the 2710 and
the

00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:23.219
diminutive 87 grams in weight mean that you
can always carry your personal navigator with

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.249
you,
and contract and most new prepay customers

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:31.260
can expect some sort of discount.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.900
Nokia are aiming the 2710 both at emerging
markets (the handset can also support Nokia's

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.180
Life
Tools suite) and developed ones where some

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.829
people might be interesting in the 2710 as
a backup

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.060
navigation device. It's certainly a smart
looking handset as well which should definitely

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.680
help with its appeal.
The Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition should be

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.459
available in selected markets from Q2 2010
onwards in Jet Black, Warm Silver and

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.400
White Silver colour combinations.
