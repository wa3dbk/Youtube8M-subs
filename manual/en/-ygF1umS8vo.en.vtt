00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.198
-The sort of short sentence
of guerilla gardening

00:00:06.198 --> 00:00:08.528
is gardening on public property
without permission.

00:00:08.528 --> 00:00:11.297
But essentially, it's finding
plots all over the city

00:00:11.297 --> 00:00:13.297
that are dirty
or overrun with weeds

00:00:13.297 --> 00:00:15.693
and trash and things like that
and then going in

00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:18.330
and making it a garden,
making it pretty.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.726
-It's fun to have
that sort of sense of danger,

00:00:20.726 --> 00:00:22.594
even though
there's no real danger

00:00:22.594 --> 00:00:25.462
of anything really happening
'cause if anybody stops us

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:27.198
or anything like that,
it's always like,

00:00:27.198 --> 00:00:29.099
"What are you guys doing?"
-"We're gardening."

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.132
And wait, and they're like,
"Okay. Good."

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:33.627
And they leave.

00:00:38.396 --> 00:00:42.495
-When you have taken a piece
of land that had trash

00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:46.759
and weed and wasn't taken care
of, and then, you know,

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:50.000
the next morning,
you have a garden there

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.462
and then you come back
a week later, you know,

00:00:53.462 --> 00:00:55.330
a month later, a year later

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
and you see how that's
transformed the neighborhood,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.495
it's a really great feeling to
know that you caused the change.

00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:06.528
-We originally started at night.

00:01:06.528 --> 00:01:08.561
That was sort of the "guerilla."

00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:11.132
Someone went to bed
with no garden and woke up

00:01:11.132 --> 00:01:12.528
and walked out and saw a garden.

00:01:12.528 --> 00:01:14.528
There's kind of --
That's a cool element.

00:01:14.528 --> 00:01:16.594
So I think that's something
that I get out of it.

00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:19.528
But I think the most important
for me is building community.

00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:22.033
Do you guys want to garden?
Yeah?

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:24.000
-Seriously, you want to?
-Grab a shovel.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.561
-Come on, man. Here.
-Come on.

00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:27.231
-It's amazing to see all these
different people

00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:28.660
who never
would have met otherwise

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.429
and have this
kind of common interest.

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.165
Again,
maybe not massive gardeners,

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:34.693
but just an interest
in sort of beautifying

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:38.198
and taking ownership
of something.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:39.660
-So, what we do is we garden
and find spots,

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.495
like, out in public.

00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:43.198
There isn't anything here,
right?

00:01:43.198 --> 00:01:44.660
So we just find a spot like this

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.330
and we plant plants
and we're like -- We just do it.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.726
We don't ask for permission
or anything like that.

00:01:48.726 --> 00:01:50.297
We just do it.
-[ Laughs ]

00:01:50.297 --> 00:01:51.561
-Go ahead, man. Dig a hole.
Go for it.

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:53.528
-Awesome. Let's do it.
-See how it goes.

00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:55.198
-The most diverse group
of people I've ever met

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:56.429
has been through
guerilla gardening.

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:57.759
People who are
producers of movies

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.627
and, like, homeless people.

00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:03.396
All ages, from, like, tiny,
tiny kids to people in their --

00:02:03.396 --> 00:02:05.759
probably in their 90s
who wouldn't be interacting

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.132
in any other way.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.198
-For me,
I'm kind of a spontaneous,

00:02:13.198 --> 00:02:15.231
want-to-get-it-done-now person.

00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:17.264
That's what's great
'cause I could right now say,

00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:18.759
"Oh, I see a spot,"
and then tomorrow

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:20.363
show up with plants
and put it in.

00:02:20.363 --> 00:02:21.759
-I heard about
guerilla gardening

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.429
a few months before my birthday,

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:25.231
and I was like,
"Oh, that would be a great idea

00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:26.693
to do that,
rather than going out to a bar

00:02:26.693 --> 00:02:28.264
and getting drinks or whatever.

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:30.198
Hey, everybody,
we're gonna make a garden.

00:02:30.198 --> 00:02:32.099
Bring some plants."

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.396
-Kenneth and I actually dated
for I don't -- a year, I think.

00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:38.033
And so...
[ Laughs ]

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:40.231
So actually, during when we did
our first garden,

00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:42.165
it was for his birthday,
and we were dating

00:02:42.165 --> 00:02:43.594
and then decided
it would be awesome

00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:45.495
to try to start
a company together. [ Laughs ]

00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:48.033
We did and now we are here
and it's worked out.

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:49.627
-We put up a website

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:51.231
so that people could
get the information.

00:02:51.231 --> 00:02:52.660
It wasn't meant to be,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.594
like, this organization
or anything like that.

00:02:54.594 --> 00:02:57.528
It just became that afterwards.

00:02:57.528 --> 00:03:00.297
Do you want -- So, do you
want the Kalanchoe on this side?

00:03:00.297 --> 00:03:01.759
-We worked really hard to,
you know,

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.198
remain friends
and keep it kosher and great.

00:03:04.198 --> 00:03:06.528
And, yeah, I'm glad, actually.

00:03:06.528 --> 00:03:07.660
I don't think
we would be friends

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.297
without guerilla gardening.

00:03:09.297 --> 00:03:11.198
-Guerilla gardening
has really changed the way

00:03:11.198 --> 00:03:13.627
that I've looked at the world
in general.

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:18.561
I'm constantly looking
for a place to put a garden.

00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:20.462
-My mom always makes fun
'cause she used to

00:03:20.462 --> 00:03:22.462
make my brother and I,
you know, weed or do stuff

00:03:22.462 --> 00:03:24.099
in her yard, but we hated it.

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.429
And now I'm running
a gardening organization.

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:29.264
I learned, actually,
that there's something

00:03:29.264 --> 00:03:31.297
really great about
touching dirt and being, like --

00:03:31.297 --> 00:03:32.693
and it sounds a little cheesy,

00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:34.363
but to be kind of
one with the earth

00:03:34.363 --> 00:03:36.231
and actually get in there
and do that,

00:03:36.231 --> 00:03:37.495
which I think in a city
like L.A.,

00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:38.726
a lot of people
don't get to do that

00:03:38.726 --> 00:03:40.561
because you don't have
a backyard.

00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:42.495
It's most important to know
that if you want to do it,

00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:44.330
you can,
and you should do it tomorrow.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.264
I mean, it's easy.

00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:48.198
-The way to start
a guerilla garden --

00:03:48.198 --> 00:03:50.594
First thing is you want to do
a little bit of research

00:03:50.594 --> 00:03:53.099
about what type of plants
work well for your area.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.033
-What we do is all succulents
and drought-tolerants,

00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:56.759
so it's actually really easy
to maintain.

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:58.231
There's not a ton of water.

00:03:58.231 --> 00:03:59.660
-And then you start
figuring out,

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.726
"Where can I find the spot
that's gonna work?"

00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:03.429
-Small is better than big.

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:05.297
You want something
you can kind of maintain.

00:04:05.297 --> 00:04:07.264
The bigger it gets, the harder
it is to take care of.

00:04:07.264 --> 00:04:08.759
-Places that are near
where you live, where you work,

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:10.462
or where you go to school

00:04:10.462 --> 00:04:12.033
because you want to take care
of the garden

00:04:12.033 --> 00:04:13.759
and not just plant it once
and leave it

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:16.297
because it might turn into
what you had. Just do it.

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:17.759
You know, a lot of people think,

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.264
"Oh, it's got to be
a perfect spot

00:04:19.264 --> 00:04:20.660
in the perfect conditions."

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.660
You know, experiment,
throw something in there,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.528
see what happens.

00:04:27.363 --> 00:04:29.033
You know,
a lot of people ask, like,

00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:30.561
"Is guerilla gardening
a political statement?"

00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:33.297
Guerilla gardening for me
isn't a political statement.

00:04:33.297 --> 00:04:35.759
It's just something that
I want to do for my community.

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.528
I just hope
that it inspires other people

00:04:37.528 --> 00:04:39.231
to take ownership
of their own community,

00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:41.033
their own area,
and it causes them

00:04:41.033 --> 00:04:43.627
to be inspired to take action.
