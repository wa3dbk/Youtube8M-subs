WARNING!

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.970
Please make sure that your TV is unplugged,
and that you are protected from static electricity.

There are various ways to eliminate static
electricity,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.970
but the most common way is to use a grounding
wrist strap.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.970
Take photos and notes often to help remember
the location and orientation of the parts

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.970
and wires.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.970
And feel free to pause and backtrack through
this tutorial as much as needed.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.970

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.970
materials:
A pair of latex gloves.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.970
Your ShopJimmy.com replacement SC Board.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.970
A pair of needle-nose pliers.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.970
Both a flat-head and phillips screwdriver.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.970
And a cup to hold all screws, clips, and any
other small items.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:32.970
So let's get to it shall we?

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.210
Locate your TVs identification label and take
note of the brand name, model number, serial

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.030
number, and model code if present.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.960

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.340

connector and gently guide the ribbon from

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.340
the connector.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.240
Do not use a screwdriver to open ribbon connectors
as they can cause damage to the pins.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.170

the chassis.

with the edge of the connector and close the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.520
tab on the top.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.880
