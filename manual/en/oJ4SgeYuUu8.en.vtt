[Famous Magicians with Four legs | Magician vs Puppy]

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.860
This is my buddies dog, Jack! I am puppy sitting
for the week. If you couldn't tell, Jack is

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.640
probably the ugliest bulldog you've ever seen.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.300
[Puppy wimper]

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.900
Which is good because he's a boxer !!!

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.460
That means every time the doorbell rings, he goes
and sits in the corner.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.360
He's a pretty smart little 'pupsicle' I wanted to see how long it would take him to catch on to some of my tricks

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.160
[puppy noises]

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.100
[sniffing]

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.080
It's not there!

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.460
I told ya!

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.220
All this dancing sure got Jack moving....

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.920
Thanks for watching! Share the magic!
