00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.049
distt in colorado i scared a lot of
people and one of the people that was

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.549
very frightened by that shooting was a
seven thirty seven-year-old man by the

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.809
name of scott a cynic in ohio who
decided that he wanted to protect

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.639
himself in case of similar shooting
happened when he went to go see the dark

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.699
knight so when you went to go see the
movie he took a gun ammunition and

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.300
several knives along with ken he carried
all of that in a backpack and one

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.650
employee at the movie theatre noticed
and thought that was suspicious so

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.890
alerted authorities and media leads now
when authorities questions in about a he

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.210
immediately um... cooperated with them
and said look i'm scared i feel like i

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.100
need to have these weapons on meet just
to make sure that something like this

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.489
doesn't happen when i'm at the movies
and you know what and know that this guy

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:43.780
sounds a little cookie

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.960
but hiking

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.340
lately understand where he's coming from
it's interesting first level is speed

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.690
you believe it because

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.070
they've gone in with a backpack gatos
ammunition you're worried that the guy

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.690
is actually the bad guy and not worry
about protecting himself but i i i tend

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.050
to agree with you i i

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.439
i think uh... that he saw the truth

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:06.179
now we don't know for sure of course but
based on the of the facts that we have

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:09.829
because every scare on their minds and
you know and they've been told by the

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.099
n_r_a_ and they've been told by the
politicians

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:16.859
already military got a military got if
you use a shooter at least you back ami

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:20.379
louis gilbert right after the oral
colorado shooting said well you know why

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:23.119
did somebody in the audience your
backside he would allow this guy

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.139
carrying all that and the nation in and
weapons to shooting in kara colorado

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:31.530
happens a few weeks later of the
shooting at the sikh temple happens

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.800
and i remember when that story broke
last weekend i'd turned over to my

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.740
family and i said you know what

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.380
i hate guns i'd never shot a gun i'd
never had the urge to shoot a gun

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.430
but i'd feel like i need to go and buy a
gun

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.660
and i need you know to pay to go get the
permits whatever is that i need to do

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.160
after idon't know maybe take some
training but i feel like we've created

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.580
an environment work everyone is in fear
right this is our so-called safer

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.700
environment where we all have access to
guns right

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.320
no it's i don't want to live in that
kind of nation i don't want to be scared

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.600
out of my mind all the time i don't want
think about

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.680
the possibility of someone shooting up a
movie theater everytime i go out for you

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.359
know i i i had evening of you know
pleasure or whatever it is answering

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:17.219
delay so you know what missus exactly
what the n_r_a_ wags

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:21.319
happily just exactly what the gunmen if
that is not arms dealers want they want

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.569
to reset my what is your was that guy in
ohio n_c_a_a_ every two months of it

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.489
movie zero was going to happen

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.919
and by the way here's a six out of
predictions for years

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.219
others every other shooting that's
obvious

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.259
majors the masters are coming at a
quicker pace now

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.549
and in one of the shooting somebody is
going to have a gun and it's possible to

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.869
during one of the shootings

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.369
the guy with a gun to defend himself

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:47.179
is eqn issue fisher

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:50.619
and then the n_r_a_ in the media is
going to go crazy they're going to cover

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.340
wall the wall they may have the biggest
hero in the country

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.729
they say you see

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.609
if everybody had a god everything would
be fine

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.709
than that will be followed by a series
of shootings

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.609
where there will be other shooters and
they will all shoot one another

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.749
and it'll be an abdic disaster

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:11.680
everybody'll be carrying guns and will
pull through the whole country

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.470
into the okay corral it'll be a horrible
for us as so many more people will be

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.389
killed

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.319
and those same arms dealers they control
donna n_r_a_ will

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.739
allotment

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:24.570
cuz then

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.569
everybody will be the position of that
ohio menace

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.429
thinking if i ever go outside my house i
better have a couple goes with me

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:33.289
an arms dealers will think

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:35.189
epic win

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.339
we get slaughtered but they make money

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:41.219
now thirties are planning on charging
this man with uh... carrying under

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.369
disability apparently he's on
prescription drugs and he is not

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:45.329
supposed to

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.889
haven't done under any circumstance and
also he didn't have a permit for the guy

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:55.179
and that he was carrying so uh... if he
will face charges for for that mob but

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:56.329
its

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.959
just another story of someone who has
attentive access to weapons they

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.909
shouldn't have access to how did you get
that that in the first place right and

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.179
by the way he was in thirty different
states including wisconsin we just have

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:09.450
a seat double shooting

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.259
you'd actually bring that down

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:15.369
out no open and he does in the apartment
doesn't need training if if the cops

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:19.180
come and say hey was i got about heat on
the press saw yakima people are gonna

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.609
say the reason why he got that done

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.840
is because gun control didn't work you
need a permit you can get the permanent

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.710
that anyway

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.000
nobly guns shown loopholes are a huge
problem

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.840
so we need to have discussions about
that why can people go to gun shows as

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.520
violence exactly and and uh... this is
not a nice and then eric demanded to be

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.650
part of the law

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.939
so that you know by from a private
seller of the gun show

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:45.110
and you don't need any background check
the or need anything

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.949
this id open invitation

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.759
to selling guns to people to use them
for legal purposes whether it's a murder

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.639
or whether it's drugs or whatever might
be say here come by your legal guns here

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.759
somos obviously hooked in fact they
would have ever thought about it does

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.479
uh... gun owners agree with us
overwhelming majority of gun owners an

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.710
n_r_a_ members say we should close the
gun show loophole

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.310
but we don't close anyway as a son who
makes the decisions

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.749
som erica

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:15.649
so uh... come corporations make a
decision in fact a let's not have any

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.189
laws when it comes to gun control
because

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.270
you know what kind of also fall off
anyway so we should just let them know

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.329
anyone

00:05:22.329 --> 00:05:26.719
well you know cisr ozell formal any laws
what why have lost the first place when

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:29.100
we just let people murder rape each
other

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.519
okay evocative well it's ok hubert
episode is get a couple guns

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:35.509
by the way

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:38.809
it's not that far offer what they want

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:43.449
deregulation deregulation big government
doesn't work everybody get some guns

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.819
and ironically they're all marxist

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:50.169
maybe it was the same inkatha's calm or
stormy governor melt away

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.810
and then but they're utopia is actually
in nightmare where everybody's killing

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.889
one

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.529
we tried this before

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:02.539
looked literally called ode to corral it
was a wild wild west

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:04.710
any or others with their but it was a
gun

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.380
most people dot
