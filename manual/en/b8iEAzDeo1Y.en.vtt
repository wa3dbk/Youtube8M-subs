00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:11.129
Attach the Handlebar/Seatpost/Pole mount to
bikes, ski poles, and more.

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.510
This mount is compatible with all GoPro cameras
and premium accessories.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.930
Out of the box, this product includes the
Handlebar/Seatpost/Pole mount, a short Twist

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.369
90, a long Twist 90, and additional adaptors
to fit smaller tubes as well as protect bar

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:28.380
surfaces.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.121
This mount fits 3/4 inch to 1.4 inch diameter
tubes without an adaptor, but with the bar

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:41.500
grip liner, and smaller .4 to .7 inch tubes
with the included pole adaptor.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.790
To attach your Handlebar/Seatpost/Pole mount,
unscrew both thumb nuts and swing open the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.790
clamp.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.790
If attaching to a smaller ski pole or boom,
push the pole adaptor firmly into the mount.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.969
Otherwise, use the included bar grip liner
when mounting to bars and posts to protect

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.400
surfaces, provide a more secure fit, and improve
stability.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:13.630
Place the mount around the handlebar, seatpost,
or pole to be used and begin to screw shut.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.020
Be sure to tighten each side evenly and avoid
over-tightening to prevent threadware on the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.690
bolts.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.530
Use the included short Twist 90 and long Twist
90 to provide additional angles to shoot from.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.200
When using this mounting hardware, avoid extending
the camera out more than necessary to ensure

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.710
you get the smoothest possible shot and to
decrease excessive vibration that could cause

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.080
damage to your housing and mounts.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.530
The Handlebar/Seatpost/Pole mount allows you
to easily attach your GoPro camera to bikes,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.830
ski equipment, boom poles, and more to provide
dynamic points of view from your HERO cameras.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.070
