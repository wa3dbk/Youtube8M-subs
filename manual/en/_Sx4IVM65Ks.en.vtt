00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.459
Welcome to Dinan. Today we're going to
discuss the E90, E92 

00:00:17.459 --> 00:00:21.189
M3 stage one suspension system
which is designed to retain the electronic dampers

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.919
in the car

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.529
The suspension system includes a set of springs front and rear
the rear

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.130
spring purchase in the front

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.260
front shock absorber bump stops

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.220
and rear shock mounts

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.780
Now spring rate is increased ten
percent

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.480
That's because one, the spring is fairly stiff in the M3 already but the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.799
other reason is you want it to match the
damping in the car in the electronic shock absorbers

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:46.920
Since we're not replacing those we need to be careful about changing the spring rate too much.
about changing the spring with too much

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.370
I want to spend a little bit of time
discussing the bump stops and how the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.110
bump stops work

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.700
This is the original bump stop that comes in the car and this is the Dinan one and as you can

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.860
see it's a little bit shorter

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.730
This is the original spring perch that comes in the car and this is the Dinan one and it's a little bit shorter. 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.170
The reason we do this is

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.820
stock, the car only has three quarters of an inch of travel 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.970
between the bump stop

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.620
and the shock body.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.770
And most springs that you buy lower the car an inch so if you lower the car an inch and there's only three-quarters 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.280
of an inch of travel this is about an inch
compressed according to ride height

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.810
this it's very stiff then when you lower the car into a corner and it causes the car to

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.780
ride and handle poorly.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.900
Generally the handling characteristic is a
corner entry understeer which means the

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.320
front end plows when you enter a corner

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.619
And a corner exit oversteer which means  the back end steps out and goes sideways when you leave.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.770
That's because you've increased the spring rate.
These act like a progressive

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.450
spring.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.810
The bump stop is very soft on the bottom

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.210
like a little lip here, and very firm on
top so the goal here is when this first

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.350
touches you can barely feel it and as it
compresses the spring rate goes up. But

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.900
the spring rate goes up fairly rapidly.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.400
So what we do is we shorten this device

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.850
and we shortened the spring perch as well

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.140
so once the car is lowered

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.120
you still have the same travel the car had stock.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.709
The goal here is to maintain a high
ride quality as well as mechanical grip

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.499
because the suspension hasn't bottomed out

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:12.290
The car will turn in a lot better

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.669
put down a lot more power and ride a lot
better so you get everything. It just takes

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:19.049
a few more pieces to get there.

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.430
So I stacked all the parts up here so you can
see what we're talking about in more

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.449
detail. This is a stock spring perch and bump stop.

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:29.249
This is a Dinan spring perch and bump stop
for the front and you see the increased

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.329
travel there.

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.930
In the rear this is the upper shock mount stock this is the Dinan one. Once again you can see the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.499
increase in travel.

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:41.069
So a lot of research goes into this. We spent
close to a year driving the car around at high speed

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.689
making little adjustments to the travel

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.659
to the spring rate, to the absorption rate, 
the bump stops, so you give the right

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:48.739
feel for the car

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.419
The car is predictable has great ride quality.

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.039
Now the other reason these things are designed the way they are is under slow-speed

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.749
corners

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:59.089
we want to make it so these don't touch so
when you're driving around town they have

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:02.489
a nice ride but also that really good
mechanical grip we're talking about. When

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.699
the car goes faster and aerodynamic
pressure pushes the car down and you load the

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.090
harder to go into a corner

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.670
we want this to touch down and add  a little bit of spring break to

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.139
the the spring rate to give the car more support

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.319
But I also want the front bump stop to
bottom out a little bit before the rear bump

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.950
stop

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.560
so when the car's loaded into a corner
you pick up a little bit of understeer at high speed

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.429
and the car doesn't want to spit itself sideways and scare you.

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:28.589
So the tuning of these is very critical to get
good results you can't lower the car too

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:32.939
much. You have to mind the travel on the other
components to go with it to maintain a good

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.729
handling suspension system.

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:35.980
