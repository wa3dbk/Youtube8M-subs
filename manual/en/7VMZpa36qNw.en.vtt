Hi everyone, It’s Colleen Patrick-Goudreau
from joyfulvegan.com. Welcome to Vegan Point

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:26.320
of View. Some people say “Soy is not healthy
for men, women, or children -- or even the

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:35.579
planet. People should avoid soy." That's one
point of view. Here’s my point of view.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.079
Soy is neither miracle food nor is it poison.
It is a bean that, like other plant foods,

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.370
contains health-promoting nutrients. But let's
take a moment to address the common negative

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.580
claims against soy and put them to rest once
and for all. One of the claims against soy

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.940
is that the estrogen levels in soy are harmful.
Some people say "Soy is not good for you because

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.200
of the estrogen. Let's be really clear here:
SOY is a bean. It doesn't contain hormones.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.280
Vertebrates -- including humans, mammals,
and even insects -- have hormones -- not beans.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.079
So, while there ARE hormones in cow's milk,
goat's milk, sheep's milk, buffalo's milk

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:22.189
and so on. There are NO hormones in milk made
from BEANS - or nuts, seeds, or grains for

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.979
that matter! But nobody's talking about the
hormones in animal milk. Claims about cancer

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.259
and estrogen are true: some breast cancer
can grow in the presence of estrogen, but

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:42.079
if you want to avoid actual excess estrogens,
then avoid eating vertebrates or anything

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.939
that comes OUT of a vertebrate!

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:52.929
The confusion and misinformation stems from
the fact that soy contains isoflavones, which

00:01:52.929 --> 00:02:02.069
are sometimes referred to as plant estrogens
or phytoestrogens because the molecules are

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:09.258
very similar in shape to estrogen molecules.
So similar that they can fit into specially

00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:16.490
shaped estrogen receptors on the surface of
our cells. But eating soy does not affect

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:25.060
estrogen levels in the body. HOWEVER, eating
soybean based foods may affect estrogen activity

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.480
in the body - primarily in beneficial ways!

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.210
Because phytoestrogens can occupy some of
the estrogen receptors on our cells, they

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.260
mitigate the effects of excess estrogen circulating
in the body. This may explain why soy intake

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.240
appears to be protective against breast and
other estrogen-driven cancers. So not only

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.000
are there no links between soy creating or
increasing cancer, it actually appears to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.280
be protective against estrogen-driven cancers
such as breast. Further studies indicate that

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.530
early consumption of soy -- early in life
- before girls hit puberty appears to have

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.520
the greatest protective benefits. I think
they are finding this with all plant foods

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.950
to be honest. Consuming them when we're young
is so important. As for a link between soy

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.760
intake and early puberty in boys or girls,
researchers have looked for this link, but

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.570
they have found no sign of this effect. Though
there is a link between the consumption of

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.530
cow's milk and early puberty (and breast and
prostate cancer). Even the concern about soy

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:41.280
formula for infants has turned up no negative
effects. Nonetheless of course experts recommend

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.240
we should use soy infant formula as a last
result. Of course experts recommend human

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:52.080
milk first and foremost, but where this isn't
always possible, soy infant formula is recommended

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.300
as a healthy alternative.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.450
As for men and soy - decreasing a man's testosterone,
again there is no evidence for this. I think

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.380
there was one person who spread this around
the internet. We'd have androngynous men all

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.730
over Asia if this were the case! Soy is shown
to decrease prostate cancer risk. I have one

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.600
more thing to say about soybeans. Another
argument used against soy, sadly, this often

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.289
comes from environmentalists, is that the
rain forest is being cut down to grow soy

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:26.030
beans. Actually, much of the rain forest is
being chopped down for cattle grazing, but

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.430
it’s also being chopped down to grow soy--but
not for human consumption. Americans and Europeans

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.780
can't raise all the feed domestically that
is needed to sustain their meat addictions,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.400
so agribusiness has started cutting down the
rain forest. The overwhelming majority of

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.770
soy (or corn or wheat, for that matter) grown
is used to feed animals whom we then kill

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.740
to consume. If you're worried about the rain
forests being chopped down for grazing or

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:04.250
to grow soy, the best thing you can do is
to stop eating other animals. So from my point

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.650
of view: Eat a whole-foods plant-based diet,
including whole soybeans if you want them.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.800
If you don’t like them, don’t eat ‘em.
Although, if you WANT to learn to like them,
