Hi. My name is

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.250
Darlene Myatt. I'm an Extension agent with the Expanded Food

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.370
and Nutrition Education Program in Tarrant County.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.400
Today I'm going to be making a vegetable stir fry dish I think you'll enjoy.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.530
We're going to start by making a basic sauce.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.710
I'm adding 3/4 cup of pineapple juice.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.750
With that, 1 tablespoon of sugar.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.940
For a sweet-sour flavor,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.020
a tablespoon of lemon juice.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.070
The thickening agent is 1 1/2 teaspoons of corn starch,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.140
a teaspoon of light soy sauce. I would encourage you to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.320
consider the light soy sauce because of concerns for

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.360
too much sodium in the diet that can be just as unhealthy 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.390
as too much sugar or too much fat. With the wisk,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.480
we'll wisk that together so the sauce is complete.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.600
Now we get to start cooking. I'm going to add to the electric

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.630
skillet 4 teaspoons of heart-healthy vegetable oil.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.720
And then we're going to add 1 cup of broccoli flowerets.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.890
I'm now adding 1 cup of shredded casrrots.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.070
And you can already see how the color is really starting

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.090
to come out. And that's one of the things that we're really encouraging people

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.130
to think about--eating foods based on colors of the rainbow.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.260
Next is 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.310
1 cup of cauliflower, the flowerets.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.350
Again, they have been washed and separated so it's a little easier to eat.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.470
And finally, 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.600
1 cup of 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.620
the celery.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.860
So I'm just going to kind of stir this around

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.000
and let it cook for 2 minutes.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.070
OK. Now that this has cooked

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.150
for 2 minutes, it's time to add the remaining vegetables.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.200
That would be

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.290
1 cup of diced red pepper,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.310
and these are the little

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.360
sugar snap peas. The stems have been removed,

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.420
and to make them a little easier to eat, I usually go ahead and slice them

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.430
into smaller bite-size pieces.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.450
OK. We've waited another 2 minutes. Now it's time to go ahead and add the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.560
sauce.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.870
You want to allow this time to reach a boiling point,

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.000
then place the lid on top to cook for 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.020
one more minute.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.080
After waiting 1 minute, we're now

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.090
going to see the end result --

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.210
a beautiful dish that will serve five people

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.370
at 36 cents per 1 cup serving.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.410
Now I've decided to plate this with a grilled chicken breast

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.520
with a combination of brown rice and

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.540
wild rice. And to tie in the flavor of the pineapple sauce

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.630
that has been used with the vegetables,

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.730
I'm adding a couple of slices of pineapple rings. So we'll plate this up.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.910
And there you have it.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.950
There is vegetable stir fry--a quick and easy meal that soon may become

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.130
one of your favorites as well as any of the other recipes brought to you by 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.980
