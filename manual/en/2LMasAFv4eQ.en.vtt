00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.000
We are very fortunate.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.700
I’m the eldest, Sanyi is younger, 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.400
and Sanyi’s son is younger still. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.600
So we can say that we’ve got the three generations here.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.000
It’s called “artisan” because we really do everything by hand.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.900
From the bottling to all the rest, we do everything ourselves.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.400
In our view, only one type of agriculture exists

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.200
and that is biological agriculture.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.800
The end of the other types of agriculture can be envisaged.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.800
From the point of view of health and quality, this is the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.300
only plausible way, too.  Nothing else works.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.900
In conventional agriculture, the plants are directly treated with chemical fertilizers.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.000
The problem with chemical fertilizers is that the micro-biology of the plants

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.700
breaks down if the plants are treated with them. This is one aspect.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.400
The other is that even though our plants yield less, they produce healthier fruit.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.000
That’s why we don’t have to spray them with strong chemicals.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.500
We only use natural treatments, which are the different forms of sulphur and copper,  possibly with lime and water.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.800
We think that wine that comes from volcanic soil is more pronounced,  more unique than the others,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:00.400
as the fresh minerality of the volcanic activity is in our wines, even in the reds.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.600
We believe that red wine has a place in Csobánc  and naturally that’s why we make them as well.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.800
The majority of our grapes are red wine grapes.  We make rosés, Siller and red wines as well.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.900
The last 50 years destroyed the red wine producers,  but once the Badacsony “Óvörös” was a big red here.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.000
So, there’s always been red in Badacsony and it still has a place here.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.400
We are small, modest but we have something to be modest for…

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.500
And we are going to be big, modest and still have something to be modest for…
