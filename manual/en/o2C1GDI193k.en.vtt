00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:12.720
(Ohoh... Oh yeah )

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.940
(Oh Oh yeah )

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.680
(Oh  yeah  )

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.320
I looked into the place that holds your name

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.160
I felt a rush inside, and never felt the same

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.620
it was all meant to be, and I could plainly see

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.380
you were the one,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.700
you were

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.440
I've wandered cross this land in search of love

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.080
I never had a feeling, no one to take care of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.760
it was all meant to be, you were my destiny

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.160
you are the one,

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.040
you are

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.140
And yet were so, far apart, I don't know where to start

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.400
this ocean, keeps us far away

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.060
each day I want you more, I'll see you once more

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:39.760
and I'll be closer, closer, to your heart

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.660
To your heart

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.920
( Oh yeah )

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.520
( Oh yeah )

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.560
Ohhhhhh

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.580
Ohhhhhh

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.980
Ohhhhhh

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.360
I know I can be everything you need

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.980
I see it in your eyes, that you long for me

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.660
it was all meant to be, we see it, easily

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.260
time will soon come,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.500
come

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.600
When I can hold your hand again

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.620
This romance can start bloom again

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.680
This ocean, will not keep us apart

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.020
Each day I want you more, I'll be with you once more

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.700
And I'll be closer, closer to your heart

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.060
Each day I want you more, I'll be with you once more

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:56.620
And I'll be closer, closer to your heart

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.720
To your heart

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.780
(Oh Oh yeah )

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.240
( Oh yeah )

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.040
Ohhhhhh

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.220
Ohhhhhh

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.720
Ohhhhhh

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.240
I hope you want to support me through Patreon, or my own support site

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.880
Or buy something in my web shop, like my CD, or DVD

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.000
It would help me a lot to keep making music videos.
