Hi! John King for Expert Village. Now we have
our roux made and our milk. This is 3/4 of

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.270
a gallon of milk. I've already warmed it up
on the stove. You could add cold milk right

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.930
to your roux if you wanted but you would have
to stand there and stir it and it takes a

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.500
little bit longer but you want to make sure
if yuou are adding cold milk to the roux that

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.270
you want to bring it up to boiling point so
that the roux will thicken your sauce. So

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.440
if you don't, it will taste just like a flour
taste and it won't taste good at all and it

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.930
won't thicken like it should. If you are doing
it this way, you have to make sure it is close

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.729
to the boiling point or if you are just adding
it cold, you have to make sure that you bring

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:55.479
it up to a boil and keep stirring it in your
pot. So we are going to pour the milk into

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:05.650
the hot roux, stir that around, make sure
that it is completely dissolved. You want

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.850
to make sure you get in the corners of your
pan with your whip because a lot of times

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.350
your roux will stick there and kind of hard
to get in those corners but you have to make

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.980
sure that it is completely dissolved that
way and you basically have a bechamel or white

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.390
sauce. It is a very important sauce to learn
to make in cooking. You can do a lot of different

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.930
things from this base sauce. You could make
scalloped potatoes and ham with a white sauce

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.750
you already made or you could also make pasta
primavera by adding a little white wine, garlic,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.210
fresh basil. So there are a lot of different
things you can do with a white sauce so once

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.640
you learn how to make it, you can make a lot
of different things from that base sauce.
