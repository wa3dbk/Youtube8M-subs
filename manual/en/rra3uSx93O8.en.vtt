00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:07.117
- We did it great in the 1st fight

00:00:07.117 --> 00:00:10.940
- Yes, the first blood under the tower was really epic!

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:15.569
- You pressed them so much

00:00:16.145 --> 00:00:18.517
- It wasn't only first blood, he killed 4 of them!

00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:21.416
- there was a double-kill

00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:22.678
- yes!

00:00:22.678 --> 00:00:25.646
- there were 2 heroes running away with red HP

00:00:26.178 --> 00:00:28.633
- Seemingly, why didn't we win with such fights?

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:32.394
- Were you doing OK in fights?

00:00:32.394 --> 00:00:36.739
- We could just go back after Roshan, in this case everything could be alright

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.626
- Holy f**k!

00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:41.377
- We were unlucky

00:00:41.704 --> 00:00:42.788
- Do you think so?

00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:44.552
I gave away the TP and took Aegis

00:00:44.552 --> 00:00:48.207
I told the guys that I didn't have the TP but we went to push tier3

00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:50.227
- Didn't you have smth to drop?

00:00:50.227 --> 00:00:53.539
- Yes, I had only Gem, Aegis, Daedalus, BKB and Phase Boots

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.104
- It really sucks

00:00:55.104 --> 00:00:59.939
- If had TP, Puck would have canceled it just like he did with everyone else

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:01.769
- I don't TP just like that

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.362
I understood what Puck is going to do

00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:05.892
I understood the whole idea of their play

00:01:05.892 --> 00:01:08.425
it is obvious for me from the very beginning

00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:14.040
- Alright, I guess it's also good to get to the finals in every The International...

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.446
- We've almost won this game!

00:01:15.664 --> 00:01:16.913
- Dendi, you've won the 4th as well

00:01:16.913 --> 00:01:20.602
- We could just step aside after Roshan, push any line

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:22.539
and get it in our pocket.

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.454
- Fuck, I wanna be on Maldives right now!

00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:25.799
Instead of being here!

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.580
I can imagine how I will get sap-happy soon

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.302
I'll drink from 2 bottles simultaneously

00:01:30.302 --> 00:01:35.413
Where's Sergey? I need his help!

00:01:35.883 --> 00:01:37.549
- Tell us where should we look for you after that?

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:38.787
- In a dyke

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.480
- In a dyke or in Canada?

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.476
- In Canada

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.550
- In the 3rd dyke in Canada

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.797
- In Canada's dyke

00:01:44.797 --> 00:01:46.788
- Where's Smile?

00:01:46.788 --> 00:01:48.096
- He was standing here

00:01:48.096 --> 00:01:49.893
- Are you going to drink 1 liter at a gulp?

00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:51.786
- Urgently! You should have been prepared!

00:01:51.786 --> 00:01:53.805
- We will be prepared at the afterparty

00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:55.426
- Oh, fuck, afterparty!!!

00:02:05.678 --> 00:02:08.479
- Buzzard, why did you fight with Aegis?

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.204
- I was told to go and kill Roshan

00:02:11.204 --> 00:02:14.330
I didn't want to do that but I listened and went there

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.756
I'd better stay outside and wait if anyone would come

00:02:17.756 --> 00:02:20.855
- Did you hear each other in team fights?

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:23.478
- The communication was fine, the games were fail

00:02:25.688 --> 00:02:27.740
- Here's the moment of 4 TP

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.797
- Bye-bye

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.626
- He says they are in Top 6?

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:34.506
Really? Good for you!

00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:37.390
- I guess they are leaving

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.953
- I hope they go to Kazakhstan to join Astana Dragons.

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:47.789
- By the way, it will be great if they buy them for $8 billion

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:49.393
can you imagine that?

00:02:49.393 --> 00:02:51.042
- Can you see he shot down our TP?

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:52.680
- He did it for the 2nd time?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.654
- He did that for 4 players?!

00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:59.154
- Not 4 but a few players

00:02:59.154 --> 00:03:00.212
- 4

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:03.042
- Not 4 cause Dendi haven't had it at all

00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:06.589
- Yes, only 3, we can see Funnik there

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.183
- He shot it down the 2nd time too

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.368
- I tried to prevent him but it wasn't successful

00:03:12.368 --> 00:03:13.852
- The train is coming for you

00:03:13.852 --> 00:03:15.340
- Is it the police?

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.057
- Will they bring me some alcohol?!

00:03:17.057 --> 00:03:19.838
- A special urgent train with alcohol for you

00:03:20.594 --> 00:03:24.930
- Look, you could win him even here but got disarmed in the end

00:03:25.228 --> 00:03:27.471
- You beat them well

00:03:27.471 --> 00:03:30.013
- In any case you had no chances

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:33.306
After you lost both sides it was obvious you had no chances

00:03:33.306 --> 00:03:34.807
How could you do that?

00:03:34.807 --> 00:03:38.153
They wouldn't have allowed you to leave the base

00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:40.102
- It was so gay...

00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:42.820
Not gay. Furion!

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.836
You know they started this when I played against fnatic

00:03:44.836 --> 00:03:47.866
They just used Meepo instead.
