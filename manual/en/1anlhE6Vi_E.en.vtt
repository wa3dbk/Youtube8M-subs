00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.040
I'm going to show you how to do knotted, messy
braid or a loose braid.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.559
This is a look that's really popular with
celebrities right now.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.660
So with this look you can have really messy,
grungy hair and have a lot of fun with it.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.949
So what I like to do is just kind of mess
up your natural hair and I'm kind of gathering

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:35.500
it over to one side.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:44.520
Then what we're going to do is we're just
going to twist each of the three sections

00:00:44.520 --> 00:01:02.690
that are going to make up our braid, and just
twisting and taking the outside pieces into

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.290
the center.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.479
Now at this point what I like to do is twist
the two outside sections, and then just connect

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.299
them back into the three strand braid.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.569
Repeating the same on the other side.

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:33.539
Just twisting it and connecting it back in
and repeat on the opposite side, connecting

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:47.299
it back in, and then just finishing off the
braid.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.159
Now with this look, because it's a little
bit messier, I'm going to stop the braid a

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:59.459
little bit further up than I normally like
to do, which would be around here, and I'm

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:06.700
going to tie that off.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.040
I'm going to cover the band with a little
bit of Kelly's hair, taking a small section

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.680
from the back and messily wrapping it around
the elastic.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:29.269
Again, with this look, you don't want it to
be too perfect.

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.620
Then you can have a lot of fun with this just
by pulling all the different sections, up,

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.620
sideways.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.160
You can pull some pieces down.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.909
Really just mess up the look.

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:52.930
Remember, with this braid, the messier the
look, the better it is.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.319
Now we're going to take the bottom here, holding
the ends, and just pushing up the hair strand,

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:11.909
just to make that nice knot and create a lot
of fullness there on the ends.

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:17.360
And there you have the knotted, messy braid.
