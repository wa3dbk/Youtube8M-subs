00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.280
Waddup suckas?

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.080
This week on Thug Notes we goin straight primeval on yo ass with Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.260
As he chillin on the Thames River with some
homies,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.880
mah boy Charles Marlow start talkin bout some dark
bidness he saw while hustlin in the ivory trade.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.100
See back in the day, Marlow got hooked up tradin ivory up in da African Congo for some crew called The Company.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.000
And this gang full of shysti fools just sittin on they asses waiting for sh*t to happen.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.940
Marlow get the word that he gonna holler at G-ed up agent named Kurtz livin at the inner station,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.820
but the only ride he
got is a busted-ass steamboat.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.740
So after gettin his ride pimped, Marlow starts his journey
towards Kurtz.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.060
When it comes to slingin that clean
ivory to make swole dollas,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.580
dis fool Kurtz got the whole congo SOLD UP and all the otha bruthas hatin on him since he ballin so hard.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.360
Just as Marlow cruisin up to
Kurtz’s spot, arrows start flyin outta nowhere,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.860
and the helmsman gets straight LIT UP.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.340
After Marlow escape, he scopes a
Russian wearin some dopey-ass duds who say Kurtz ain’t yo everyday hustla.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.980
Naw, the natives worhsipping Kurtz
like Mista Big up in here —

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.440
meaning Kurtz can do whatever he please.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.260
Turns out, it was Kurtz who ordered the attack on Marlow’s whip.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.020
When Marlow meets the Big Dawg, he
sees that he's ill in more ways than one.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.900
Marlow convinces Kurtz to truck it back to Europe,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.900
but he keeps gettin sicker til he spits his last words: “The Horror! The Horror!”

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.540
and then he croaks like a bitch.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.380
With Marlow back in Europe, he
makes a stop to see Kurtz’s lady.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.540
When she axe about his final words, Marlow lies and
says that Kurtz used his last breath to say her name.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.460
Aight slick.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.000
If you got yo sh*t
together,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.860
you know that most peeps say HOD representin a descent into humanity’s evil nature as Marlow flowin upriver.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.080
And as all well-read thugs know,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.080
dat journey slingin ambiguity and paradox up in here like Scarface slingin dat yeyo.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.420
Fo example, when Kurtz is away from
society for too long,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.340
he get all whacked out in the head and start doin some notorious deeds.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.240
But at the same time, society with all its crooked imperialism doin vicious sh*t on the reg.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.240
Cuz it’s the eyes of civilization that keeps
humanity’s darkness in check.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.760
But when we surrounded by the silent whisper of the wilderness, we straight lose ourselves to the dark.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.040
It’s only then that we ain’t got no
man-made code to tell us what’s what and we start gettin straight nasty.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040
Naw mean?

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.440
On the real, both human beings AND society decked out wit enough evil inside to inspire all dat horror Kurtz talkin about.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.580
But what’s Kurtz really trying to
say with those last words?

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.560
Not only is Kurtz referrin to his own dark deeds, but the beastly evil inside the heart of erry hustla.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.760
Cuz in the wilderness, that evil got nowhere to
hide.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.920
Civilization, though, be all shady bout it and sweeps dat sh*t under the rug like s’all good.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.160
Peep this quote from Matthew 23-

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.640
So when Marlow say a city look like
a “whited sepulcher,”

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.560
he really sayin that it’s full of crooked bustas frontin
like they civilized.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.840
But is mah boy Marlowe one of these
hypocrites?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.000
Cuz this fool say he hates to lie —

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.280
Yet, at the end of the novella, he
lies to Kurtz’s woman like it ain’t no thang.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.120
Why?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.840
Like the hero of the mythic
journey,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.140
Marlow returns from the dank depths of Hades with info that s’posed make the world a better place.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.860
And since he realize that darkness that lie
beneath is just too f**ked up for Kurtz’s biddy to bear, he lies.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.760
Sometimes, there are more important
things than than stickin straight to the truth.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.909
You feel me?

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.380
