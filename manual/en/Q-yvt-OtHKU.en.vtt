00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.710
A special guest visited the Phoenix Day School for the Deaf

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.950
to celebrate Veterans Day. 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.209
They invite me to come here and celebrate Veterans Day with all the students and the school

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.289
I was very honored to be invited and to come present. 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.000
Keith Nolan

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.259
A few representatives

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.759
from Senator John McCain's office attended the event.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.200
If you wouldn't mind standing up gentlemen so we can acknowledge you... 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.579
Keith Nolan's presentation

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.460
even inspired those who aren't interested
in serving in the military.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.700
I was incredibly inspired of how Keith
is fighting for Deaf people's rights to join the military.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.720
You know I think Deaf people have a lot of the advantages over hearing people.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.350
because they can't hear, so they rely more
on visuals

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.739
Those in the Deaf community and even in
the disabled community as a whole

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.320
can see that they can make changes in the world if they really want to.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.539
The military may not be an option for
Keith during his lifetime but...

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.650
If the next generation can do it I would
be incredibly proud

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.260
For me it's probably gonna happen later
on, not today but maybe 30, 40 years...

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.520
Who knows I could see things changing

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.580
Keith is known for his work on a trial program for the Deaf

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.360
and Hard of Hearing in the military. Its
already been presented to congress but...

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.090
The possibility for the bill to pass is very low

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.370
That hasn't stopped people from trying.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.620
The point is to raise awareness for the
bill so people can know more about the program.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.940
Keith hopes to bring the program to the
attention

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.550
of the National Defense Authorization
Act which decides the budget for the US

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.790
Department of Defense, this spring.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.440
Keith and his supporters had a rally earlier this year to try and raise awareness.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.960
It was inspiring to see all the people
come together from across the country.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.700
I can't even explain the feeling. It was just
Wow!
