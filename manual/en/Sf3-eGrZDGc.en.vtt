00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.649
Hello, my name is Mark Griffith, and this
is a short introduction into how to invest

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.980
in precious metals. Perhaps the first thing
you need to do is be aware of what the precious

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.600
metals are and how not to confuse them with
some other metals which can also be expensive,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.380
usually known as the strategic metals or the
strategic minerals. Precious metals tend to

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.680
be metals that have been used in jewelry at
one time or other, like platinum, gold, silver

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.121
and some others you might not have heard of
like palladium, rhodium, ruthenium. Strategic

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:43.600
metals tend to be things like tungsten, cobalt,
malibdinum, for example titanium and these

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.190
are often used because they have very, very
strong structural qualities. They can be used

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.200
to make steel very hard, for cutting things
in industry. They can be used to make very,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.110
very light pieces of aircraft for example.
So you got to distinguish the precious metals

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.830
and the strategic metals. Among the precious
metals, you will find that although they are

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.970
used for jewelry, they also have industrial
uses. Silver is still used in photography.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:20.470
Gold is used in electronics. Platinum or palladium
are used in catalyzers that make car exhaust

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.220
clean and safe. So the precious metals are
sometimes used for jewelry. They are sometimes

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:35.810
used for industrial reasons, and they're sometimes
used simply as bullion. In gobs which - of

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.900
metal which are regarded as valuable in themselves
to store value. And you'll find slabs of these

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.590
in the vaults of most major banks. And as
with just trading in gold, essentially you

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.330
want to decide, do you want to hold the metal
and if you want to hold the metal is this

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.820
going to be a nuisance. If you have some bars
of platinum round at your house, even if they're

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.600
in a safe, you might attract the attention
of burglars. If you don't want to be burgled,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.680
it might be good to keep it in a bank, but
if you keep it in a bank you might have to

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.900
pay them a little bit of rent to look after
it for you. So you can either hold the metal,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.930
or you can hold the paper instrument which
gives you the right to the metal or which

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.299
tracks the price of the metal. Or as I said
before you can try to invest in mining companies,

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:30.489
whose value usually goes up and down in line
with those metals. Be aware that there's a

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.800
different problem with each precious metal.
Silver is the most traded so large volumes

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.760
of silver are traded each year, the movements
can be very fast, and it can also mean that

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.419
you don't always understand why the price
is moving the way it's moving. There's a similar

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.959
problem with gold which is heavily used as
a bullion metal, as a reserve metal by major

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.079
banks. Quite often, of trying to do several
things in the markets, they might try to reverse

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.209
a price move by gold, so gold is moving up,
because everyone feels unhappy about the dollar.

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.480
The central banks at this point may be dumping
gold to raise money for their own purposes

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.120
and also to manipulate the price of gold back
down again. So if you deal in gold and silver,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.809
you have healthy volumes, you can easily get
in and out of the market, but the prices can

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:24.029
move in unexpected ways. If you deal in rarer
metals like platinum, palladium, rhodium,

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:29.150
ruthenium, you have the opposite problem.
The volumes are very thin meaning there's

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.189
not much trading on any particular day, which
means that you can find it difficult to get

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:39.760
out of the market or into the market at the
price you want to. If the volumes are thin,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.239
you can find yourself in a position where
you're the only seller, and there's nobody

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.659
ready to buy off of you. So there are dangers
with being in markets which have very, very

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.010
large volumes, and there are dangers with
being in markets with small volumes. Your

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.629
advantage with things like platinum, palladium,
rhodium, ruthenium is they're generally not

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.519
used as bullion metals, so you're not actually
setting yourself up against the major banks,

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:10.459
they're not trying as hard to control those
prices. So you have an advantage there. As

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.939
ever, be careful and decide what it is you
want to do, decide how much risk you want

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.749
to take on and decide how much you can afford
to lose and good luck.
