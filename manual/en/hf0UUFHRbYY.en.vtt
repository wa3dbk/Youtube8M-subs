00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.930
Hello and welcome back to keep calm and bake.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.320
My name is Carol and I do a you tube cooking
channel and in this episode I will teach you

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.860
how to do a hazelnut, chocolate, and orange
tort.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.480
[Music]

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.820
First up melt your butter.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.460
This is unsalted butter 200 grams going into
a sauce pan.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.559
We are just going to gently leave that to
melt down.

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.999
While the butter is melting I am going to
separate my eggs.

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.079
So I have got three large eggs.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:47.199
Put the whites there and I'm going to put
the yolks in my food blender there, because

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.950
we are going to whisk the eggs and the sugar
together.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.979
If you don't have a mixer like this, than
you can just do this by hand.

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:59.850
You are going to whisk the egg yolks with
200 grams of caster sugar.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.030
Now don't worry if you're scribbling down
all the ingredients, we've fitted them down

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.220
for you in the description box.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.810
Now lets whisk the eggs and sugar together
so that it is light and fluffy.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.490
All right that's perfect.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.250
You just whisk it until it is thick and paler
in color.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.570
I am going to add zest from one orange like
this.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.390
Some really lovely chocolate desserts have
or maybe for a bit more a special occasion.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.000
Maybe it is a dinner party you have got going
on or a friends birthday, something special.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.310
Now that my butter is melted I am going to
take this off the heat and add my chocolate

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.500
straight into the butter.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.860
And go for the best quality of chocolate you
can find.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:08.030
It does make a difference for this type of
cake that is mainly just chocolate.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:18.490
Now this is 85% coco I have got, just break
it all up, pop it in and the heat of the butter

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.170
is like going to melt.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.340
The rest of the ingredients that are going
to go in to the mixture is two tablespoons

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:41.370
of ground hazelnut, sprinkle everything in,
two tablespoons of flour,a pinch of salt,

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.020
two tablespoons of orange extract.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.170
Now I am actually going to get a metal spoon,
because I want to fold everything in.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.090
I want to fold everything in and its actually
going to be much better with something like

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.040
a sharp edge like as a spoon if you do that.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.520
It cuts through a lot easier.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:11.810
I am going to add my melted chocolate and
butter.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.380
Make sure all the lumps are out.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.560
So pour that into the bowl.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.810
Every last little bit.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.599
Great.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.370
Now fold this all together.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.120
You want to keep as much airiness as possible.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.120
Lovely.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.470
Once this is all mixed together leave it to
one side while you whisk your egg whites.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.970
I am going to pop them back into my mixer.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.540
Just beat them on full speed until they become
lovely, soft beats.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.890
Lovely, these egg whites are lovely and firm
which is good.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.430
I am going to fold the egg whites into the
chocolate mixture.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.640
Just do it a spoonful or two at a time.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:20.290
Again a metal spoon really helps to cut through
and mix everything together without taking

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.889
out too much of the air.

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:29.070
Now all the orange zest working its magic
and a little bit of orange pure.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.640
Once it is all mixed together really well
you are going to pour it into your cake tin,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.480
which I have greased and lined already and
my oven is preheating.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.620

over to my channel, because I have a tons

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:00.190
All right pour your mixture straight into
the tin.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.950
This is now ready to go straight into the
oven.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:12.250
So at 190 degrees celsius is going to take
about thirty to thirty five minutes to cook.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.520
Once your tort has cooked, just leave it somewhere
to cool down nicely.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.030
Now this has cooled I can decorate it.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:29.000
And what do you think of your cheesecake,
possibly my favorite.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.240
I know I have many, but anyway give me a thumbs
up if you want my amazing cheesecake recipe.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.160
Yeah you want it.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.620
thumb up.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.840
Now to decorate this I am doing something
very simple, because it is a rich cake.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:51.720
I am doing a dusting of coco powder on top.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.620
Sprinkle.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.080
And then in the middle I have some, these
are blond hazelnut, which I have popped into

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.270
the oven with rice and sugar.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:12.100
I am just going to put a big heap of these
on top and in the middle so that when you

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.630
cut it their all going to like crumble off
and when you eat this together you will taste

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.139
a little extra crunch with the hazelnuts.

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:28.270
And then just add a little bit of color with
orange zest, you just need a few little strips.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.919
and you just sprinkle some around.

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:43.419
I hope you all really enjoy this decadent
chocolate tort and I will see you next time.

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:44.620
