00:00:03.832 --> 00:00:07.484
Yoon Hyung Joon

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:14.128
Yoon Pi Pen

00:00:20.904 --> 00:00:24.159
Done with the schedule
At the end of the day

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:28.397
I take the wheel and drive
over the Hang Ju Bridge

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.366
Such an intense place
Trapped in Seoul City

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:36.310
I flounder then point my feet
To where my family is

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.606
So relieving and suffocating at once

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:43.485
I'm nothing close to the masterpiece I pictured myself to be

00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:45.412
When I turn 30, when I grow up

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:47.467
I thought I'd fly across the sky

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:49.477
As I learned from my heroes in cartoons

00:00:49.477 --> 00:00:51.454
But I'm not doing any of that

00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:55.485
Everyone so out of breath
Both legs limping away

00:00:55.485 --> 00:00:59.543
Actions that are bad, painful
so busy and compromising

00:00:59.543 --> 00:01:02.563
I tame myself, let them bleed in

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:04.890
Denying the reality that isn't on my side

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.427
I pound on the handle as if it's to blame

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:11.099
A repeat of long tunnels without ends

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.955
Even if life's stuck in traffic
I keep the engine running

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:20.947
It's okay to let others pass me by
I can always take a little detour

00:01:23.532 --> 00:01:31.212
Cause I'm BestDriver

00:01:31.408 --> 00:01:38.054
I'm the best driver

00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:46.144
Cause I'm BestDriver

00:01:47.528 --> 00:01:53.993
I'm the best driver

00:01:56.265 --> 00:01:59.857
Sorry friends, I don't mean to act so out of time

00:01:59.857 --> 00:02:01.817
I keep myself busy so I can actually get busy

00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:03.641
I find consolation in how tired I look

00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:06.001
Your faces I see once or twice a year

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:07.826
They are my roof and my pillar

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:12.268
Don't mind the rain all night
Today feels just right

00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:13.956
It's on me, what would you like to eat?

00:02:13.956 --> 00:02:16.060
I'd love to soaked in drinks until the sun rise

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.805
Even if my pockets go empty

00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:20.100
I don't mind being fool's gold for you

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.348
You say I'm lucky I make money with music

00:02:23.348 --> 00:02:25.852
When you have chased your dreams away

00:02:25.852 --> 00:02:28.379
I'm still chasing my dream

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.070
We'd run from our wounds
From the pain of being young

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.380
But will a single book be able to comfort us?

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.956
Leaving us with questions
Locked away inside a room

00:02:39.956 --> 00:02:42.356
I scribble down the words
to make myself feel better

00:02:42.356 --> 00:02:47.804
When I'm imprisoned in this tiny room
is the only time I find freedom

00:02:47.804 --> 00:02:50.772
Once I figured that, I realize

00:02:50.772 --> 00:02:52.898
I'm the one who kept locking myself up

00:02:52.898 --> 00:02:54.396
Then I rush myself

00:02:54.396 --> 00:02:55.949
Toward a bigger fence

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.164
Making my life even more dramatic

00:02:58.164 --> 00:02:59.848
My life spins on like a camera on a crane

00:02:59.848 --> 00:03:02.937
A repeat of long tunnels without ends

00:03:03.545 --> 00:03:06.934
Even if life's stuck in traffic
I keep the engine running

00:03:07.494 --> 00:03:13.254
It's okay to let others pass me by
I can always take a little detour

00:03:15.501 --> 00:03:22.469
Cause I'm BestDriver

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:29.884
I'm the best driver

00:03:31.381 --> 00:03:38.045
Cause I'm BestDriver

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:46.054
I'm the best driver

00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:51.318
Why do I keep ending up on unpaved roads

00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:55.437
Why do I keep stopping at crossroads without lights

00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:59.813
Trying to hide the regret and desperation that made me try

00:03:59.813 --> 00:04:03.477
Why should my courage have to
be compared to someone else's

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.696
Yes, it's okay to let others pass me by

00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:07.926
To be stuck inside a long tunnel

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:09.797
Let the soles of my shoes wear out

00:04:09.797 --> 00:04:11.925
Let the wheels keep rolling

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.451
And I ask how to dream a more dramatic life

00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:17.413
Don't stop, keep the foot on the accelerator

00:04:17.413 --> 00:04:19.445
Like spitting out the fumes

00:04:19.445 --> 00:04:27.285
Cause I'm Best Driver

00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:34.398
I'm the best driver

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:43.286
Cause I'm BestDriver

00:04:43.286 --> 00:04:50.225
I'm the best driver
