Third fight you all know that I advise you to eat that is to eat small meals often

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:14.169
only proper meal

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.920
but not everyone has the opportunity because so many of you want to go to work in a university or something else

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.849
so today I'll give you a few tips on how you can support our proper diet if you eat away from home

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.709
night the most important thing you should not come to work or uni hungry

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.499
many of us have a habit to drink coffee in the morning and then not eat anything and then suddenly there

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.410
will give for daring appetite and we eat some stuff at work so do your most satisfying breakfast

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.719
helpful and let it enter you into the habit

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.489
also do not forget that we need to have 5-6 meals per day

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.140
that is, let's say if you learn to school and you have short sessions in the morning there before 2 pm then you would be enough

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.280
one or two snacks it could be any fruit from your home or taken any yogurt

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.819
kefirchik milk any I certainly understand that the school canteens is not very good and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.860
proper nutrition there is absolutely no smell but there are options like soups and side dishes if you are sure that they prepare well and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.180
enough

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.220
delicious food there it is quite possible to take but again watch their

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.239
portions and not overeat too the same applies in the canteens

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.589
university course for if you're not confident in your kitchen

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.110
University will always have the option to take food with them and the option for more difficult when you are working

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:48.699
the work may be different as the seating in the office when you just drink seagulls and a snack of cookies or just

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:56.769
very active when the network just once or even rest in some cafes and restaurant where a lot of temptations

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.299
Girls do not often write and asks Tanya what about if I do this work

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.148
I can not even sit down and eat

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.239
something that I have prepared for even though I even correct but I do not have time, then I come home and

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.810
then I eat all that horrible and all have fridges and now this here is the meal I

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:26.179
I really understand these girls because I used to work in the cafe itself is from 9 to 12 am, I know what it is

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.479
First, I had quite a bit different problem because I had a cafe and banquet type

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.069
then after the banquet ended leave remained very much food at all intact and we later on the new

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.700
I covered myself a new banquet and so maybe it was

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.400
a couple of times a week, you can even say almost every day, and here such here

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.199
power I recovered somewhere in the 6 kilos in six months

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.980
but

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.440
looking at the girls who work there already 8 years, I realized that there is no good that nothing will have

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.079
all the excess weight

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.319
there were so many, and I did not want just to spoil yourself so your body and I opted for

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.950
proper nutrition and a healthy lifestyle and quit her job

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:24.439
so I do not want to tell you put work above all if you see it you just ruins

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.359
kills your body, I can still say that the restaurants cafes there's a drink for lovers

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.970
it kind of just seems to bounce back after a good working day to drink a glass of beer there or something like that

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.239
it is also a separate topic so here's another one major point do not put work above all

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.419
Still more important than our health but if you

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:57.049
workaholic and used to this rhythm, I'll give you a few tips to keep our correct eating out

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.440

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.370

dried milk products the choice is very large main show imagination

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.760

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.859
as regards restrictions that try to eliminate fatty and spicy foods

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:38.178
simply exclude fast food muffin muffins pastry

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:45.618
various cakes and so on always reminded that this meal is delayed, we fats and that we do not need

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:53.389
If colleagues are used to treat various goodies you learn to politely refuse it but if you agree then you should know the measure

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:00.648

th transport the food to be stored for example it may be some kind of homemade cookies

let oatmeal cookies that have been on my channel or the same protein bars can easily take them with you to work and

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.239
they are pretty hearty so that as an option can even approach

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:30.408
and of course do not forget about the water for a long time all know that a person during the day should drink at least half liters of water

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.188

about the juice, I'll tell you that they

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:39.799
increase the sugar our body and

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:47.029
better to avoid them because then they were scattered after the appetite of this and we did not need Well I hope my tips will help you
