00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.160
Erik: What opportunities do you see to better
encourage people to pursue careers in the

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.160
sciences?

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.470
Stacie: So, you know, in this country, I think
there's a big emphasis now on trying to improve

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.830
STEM: science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics education in younger people.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.720
I think that in order to pursue a career in
research, there have to be role models and

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:37.920
incentives, it's not the same as law or finance
or business where you know that you can go

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.040
out and become a very successful person.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.640
A life in scientific research is unbelievably
daunting and challenging, for a lot of reasons,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.370
I mean first of all, it's hard.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.960
You go to school for a very long time, but
when you get out of school, after 5 years,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.440
for doing a PhD, at that point, you're generally
about 30 years old, sometimes older, sometimes

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:12.350
younger, you still have to go and do a postdoc,
and postdoc salaries are really dictated by

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.499
the NIH, by the National Institutes of Health.

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:20.299
And those salaries are very hard to live on.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:29.000
So a starting postdoc, a 30-year-old person
with a PhD might be making $42,000 a year,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.579
and you can see why many people maybe wouldn't
choose that path, but even if you do choose

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.159
that path, and you are gonna live on $42,000
a year in a place like New York City, whichâ€”a

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.350
lot of people do it.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.380
Obviously I did it.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.869
And at the time, not even making $42,000 a
year, I think my salary was $33,000 a year.

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.219
You know, you still have a very challenging
future ahead of you if you're on the track

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:03.679
that where you're pursuing the traditional
scientific career, where you do a postdoc,

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.570
maybe you do a second postdoc, and then you
interview for an assistant professor, tenure

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:17.370
track assistant professor job, and get on,
you know, the path to a tenured full professor

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.349
position, maybe even a chairman position.

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.480
There's a big drop off at the postdoc stage
because making that transition to the next

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.599
phase is really, really difficult because
you have to be unbelievably successful scientifically,

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.629
you have to publish your work.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.209
It would be great if you were funded independently
as a researcher, and then those positions

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.659
for assistant professors, associate professors,
full professors, they just don't come up very

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.090
often.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:58.210
So it's hard to be positively reinforced I
think, and it's hard to succeed.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:05.829
I mean it's hard to compete with the giant
pool of postdocs that are out there.

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.620
Erik: Where's the inflexion point, how do
you make it easier?

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:19.500
Stacie: I don't think it's gonna become easier
until the NIH changes their funding structure.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.510
The budget for the NIH has been basically
flat for a while, which doesn't give you a

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.500
lot of incentive to go that route.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.680
I mean the success of your grand proposal
is not very promising.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.969
I think there have to be big changes in the
way that we support scientists and fund scientists

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:44.230
in this country.
