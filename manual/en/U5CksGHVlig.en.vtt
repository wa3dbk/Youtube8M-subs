00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.380
In the same acacia forest in which the secretary birds have built their nest,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.900
a family of warthogs grazes on the nutritious green grasses

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.740
that have grown since the rains.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.100
The little warthogs are only a few days old,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.540
but already they are expert savannah dwellers.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.980
They still lack the experience to be able to find food like their elders,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.740
but they have the mobile food store of their mothers and,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.180
though she doesnâ€™t want to stop to feed them,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.060
the young warthogs are determined to get at the nutritious milk.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.580
Their only task during these first weeks will be to exercise

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.100
in order to acquire the speed and strength which will enable them to flee from hunters.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.740
And they dedicate themselves to this in body and soul.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.060
Wrestling matches,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.740
or football with a pat of elephant dung form part of their training.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.660
Anything will do if it serves to make them faster and stronger.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.860
Because it will not be long before the savannah puts them to the test.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.660
In the shade of an acacia, a cheetah watches over a nearby group of oryxes.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.620
The oryxes are too strong for him,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.500
but at this time of year are always young calves,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.460
just a few days old, and it is one of these that the cheetah has his eye on.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.860
The calf appears to be perfectly healthy,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.540
and the possibilities of catching it are virtually nil,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.580
but the cheetah has been building up tension and decides to launch a desperate attempt.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
The oryx moves off unhurriedly,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.060
confident of its superiority but without exposing its young to unnecessary risks.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.420
The cheetah has not even had the chance to test out its prodigious speed.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.460
There are many adults in the group and it knows that when it comes to defending its young,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.740
an oryx is capable of killing even a lion,

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.260
so he abandons the attempt,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.020
and returns to his slow wanderings in search of more accessible prey.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.700
During the short rains,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.300
between December and February,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.380
there are frequent storms at nightfall.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.020
The climate mellows and the heat of the day gives way to fresh,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.540
humid air; the temperature the large hunters have been waiting for to go into action.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.020
The evenings and nights of Shaba are extraordinarily beautiful.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.620
But, ever loyal to its contrasts, they are also the time when death lurks in the dark.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.620
Night falls over the Ewaso Ngiro.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.780
Along the dark banks, long shadows emerge from the water

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.140
in search of the warmth of the sand heated up during the daytime hours.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.420
The metabolism of the Nile crocodiles depends on their body temperature,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.140
and this in turn depends on their surroundings,

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.580
so at sunset the narrow shores of the Ewaso fill with these dragons.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.260
For the lionesses, the night is an advantage.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.100
Lions have eyes that can see in the dark.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.620
Under cover of the shadows,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.540
a mother and her young from the previous year lie in wait for the herbivores,

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.700
guided by the sounds coming from the thicket.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.540
Tonight, they are not in luck.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.380
From the forest alongside the river three elephants emerge,

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.060
and no hunter in Shaba would dare disturb them,

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.260
so the lionesses lower their guard and rest,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.380
waiting for other signs that reveal the presence of possible prey.
