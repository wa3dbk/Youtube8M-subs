hey guys a lot of you are having trouble
updating your sony playstation 4 i'm

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.790
here to tell you how to do that real quick because I just figured it out

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.009
so here's the cable to plug the
controller into because you're going to

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.210
need that it yourself or controller mean
that the playstation and perfectly

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.300
connect to the lan cable there's a
button on the front of this PlayStation

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.340
just going to hold it down until it
beeps twice once keep holding twice

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.850
look at the television screen alright
then you're in safe mode with in safe

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.980
mode it tells you to connect the USB
cable again and press the playstation

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:56.370
button on your controller you should you
and I also update the system software

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.809
here so when you are in this window

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.630
I'm sorry when you're on the screen
you're going to need to use this part of

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.640
the controller not the knobby part but
the pad

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.740
ok to move the selector up and down so
you will go to update system software

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.150
you'll go through here you do that
you're gonna you'll go to update from

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.420
disk now you can either download on your
computer but I tried doing that and i

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.540
did not have any luck so what I did was
I went update using internet hit that

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.890
button and while you're in safe mode
you're actually able to connect to the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.369
network somehow as long as you know
you're plugged in to the land which I

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.659
wasn't plugged into the land but you're
plugged into the land you can connect to

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.530
the internet

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.930
alright guys so that should do it and
then i'll say the following version of

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.320
the system software is it

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.710
you will hit next

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.479
the controller it will download the
update file within the safe mode

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.539
don't forget to install it within safe mode 
as well that's what
