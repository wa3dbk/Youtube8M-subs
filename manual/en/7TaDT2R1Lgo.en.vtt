00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:35.241
Don't you ever wonder what

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.769
Will happen when it ends

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:45.143
The books are over, it feels

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:50.206
Feels like we lost our friends

00:00:51.223 --> 00:00:55.846
How can we ever be happy when

00:00:56.095 --> 00:00:59.848
We lost a decade of memory?

00:01:01.657 --> 00:01:06.222
We would forget or move on if it

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:10.847
weren't for a group of crazy fans

00:01:11.724 --> 00:01:16.094
You started a new era

00:01:16.784 --> 00:01:21.409
New adventures, laughs to come

00:01:22.095 --> 00:01:26.409
It feels like we found a home

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.992

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.744

One decade closed,

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:05.305
You opened up for one

00:02:05.456 --> 00:02:09.706
That's just as magical

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:13.829
You gave us hope, friendship and joy

00:02:14.477 --> 00:02:15.663
And showed

00:02:16.038 --> 00:02:19.663
us that we're not alone

00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:25.306
You started a new era

00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:30.743
New adventures, laughs to come

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:35.615
It feels like we found a home

00:02:36.043 --> 00:02:39.418

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.679

00:03:26.803 --> 00:03:33.428
