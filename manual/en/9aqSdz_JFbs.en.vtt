00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.520
Ok, so oats are one of the cereals that is
a great choice because there’s no sugar

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.180
added to it and it’s very high in fiber.
Today we’re going to make oat applesauce

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.870
muffins. We’re going to start with the oats.
We’re going to pout those in. We’re going

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.540
to pour in the whole wheat flour. Using whole
what flour adds a lot of fiber. The brown

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:55.530
sugar, the baking powder, makes sure you get
it all in there. And the baking soda. Kind

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:04.650
of stir around those dry ingredients, kind
of mix it in the bowl. Ok, now we’re going

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.030
to add the wet ingredients. This is the low-fat
buttermilk. The applesauce, now the reason

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.300
we use applesauce is applesauce is a great
substitute for oil in a recipe, so it really

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:22.370
cuts down on the amount of fat in your recipe,
plus it adds some good flavor. And then the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:31.590
one egg. Ok and we’re going to stir that
around. You don’t need a mixer for this,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:42.179
you just want to stir it yourself until its
well combined. And this is going to make a

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:50.289
total of 12 muffins. Each muffin has 105 calories
and only 1.2 grams of fat. So it’s a great

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:56.350
choice for a quick breakfast on the go or
just as a snack or even as a dessert. Ok,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.810
so we’re well combined here as you see.
And here we have the muffin tin with the paper

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:17.390
muffin cups. And we’re going to spoon the
mixture into the muffin cups until they are

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:32.240
about ¾ full. So about like so. We’re ready
to put these in, they’re going to bake for

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.230
30 minutes at our 375 pre-heated oven. Alright
our muffins are ready to come out of the oven

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:57.470
and they smell really good. Alright so there
you can see this recipe is really healthy,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.900
it uses applesauce instead of oil. And you’ve
got yourself a healthy oat applesauce muffin.
