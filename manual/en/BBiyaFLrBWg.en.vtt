Hello it is Binky from main Chelsea and welcome
back to another series of Binky's Boutique

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.210
on videojug.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.000
[Music]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.492
It is so important to get your makeup right
for the first date because it is important

00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:18.492
to make a good impression.

00:00:18.492 --> 00:00:21.250
And you don't want to be too caped makeup,
so this week I am going to show you how to

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.440
do makeup for first dates.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.619
So we are going to start with this Clarins
Skin Illusion Foundation it is SPF 10 I will

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.360
be using my fingers to apply it, it is really
lightweight, it gives you good coverage.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.200
If you use your fingers to apply it, it gives
you more of a natural finish because it really

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.030
does get into the skin.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.829
Just apply this all over your skin.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.360
For your lovely natural base.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.920
Next up I will be using this Clarins eyeshadow
palette it is called Rosewood, and I will

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.530
be using this color here, really light pretty
glittery number.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.020
And I will be applying it all over my eyelid.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.020
Good base.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.649
It is a really good idea to use a really light
color for an eyeshadow base.

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.530
Because it does get rid of any discoloration

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.750
It is really good because you can work all
the other products into the base.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.260
You do not have to be too neat with this because
it is just a base.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.590
So next up I will be using this dark color,
take an angled brush will be using the skinny

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.890
bit of it just to go along the lashline.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:28.040
So tilt your eye, just go gently over the
lashline.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.110
When you get to the outer line kind of blend
it in, for that kind of winged effect.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.880
[Music]

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.950
By working along the lashline, you can make
the lashes look slightly thicker.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.950
[Music]

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.409
I am going to take a slightly bigger blending
brush and use a little bit of product, I am

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.259
just using it for the corners of my eyes by
doing circular motions.This just makes the

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.320
line less harsh and it really emphasizes that
winged eyelet.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:02.640
Next I take a small smaller brush, I will
be using the same color and just go under

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.230
the eye.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.050
This will just add more definition to the
eye without using eyeliner.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.439
Next, I am going to be using Bareminerals
eyeshadow, and it is called graphite.

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:22.430
And I am going to shake it and then use whatever
has been left in the lid.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.650
Because this will go everywhere if you are
not careful.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.989
So, take a slightly more angled brush and
go along the upper lashline and lower lashline

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.079
to make you have more of a curve, and to make
your eyelashes look thicker.

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:40.150
So again tilt your eye and just go along the
lashline.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.519
What is good about using eye shadow instead
of eyeliner, it is that you do not have to

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.980
be too perfect in applying it.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.879
Just work it along the lashline.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.540
Alright next up I am going to be using this
Bareminerals mascara, it is called black very

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.809
simply, the brush that it comes with is really
thin, it is really small so that it can get

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.680
every individual lash, no clumps.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.170
Does not make your lashes too clumpy you would
not really want clumpy lashes for your first

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.170
date.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:17.029
Next, up I am going to be using bareminerals
bronzer and it is called the deep end.

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:24.709
Using your bronzer brush, I am going to simply
use it under my cheekbones in circular motions

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.479
by applying bronzer under your cheekbones
it gives you that really sculpted look.

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:35.790
I am also going to use it slightly on the
temples.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.799
This really does slim your face down.

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.349
I am going to be using this Stila bright and
correct concealer it comes in a pretty cool

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:50.829
little package where you just turn it and
you will see it, umm ok there it is, umm the

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.930
little brush that is there so it is really
easy to apply under the eyes using your fingertips

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.129
just blend it in.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:01.799
it is really good concealer for under the
eyes because it is illuminating.

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.870
And it just brightens your eyes up.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.430
This will clear up any mess you made earlier
by applying the eyeshadow.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.199
Now using this Bareminerals powder, I am going
to put it in the lid because it is going to

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:20.470
come out quite a lot, this is called mineral
veil powder, use the lid quite a lot is coming

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.769
out in there.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.710
I am going to be using it under the eyes,
make sure you tap it off first.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.020
Use it under the eyes, it just sets the concealer,
and I am also going to run it along the T

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.660
zone to get rid of any shine and on my nose.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.129
You do not want to look shiny on your first
date.

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:47.289
And by applying a powder, this will keep your
makeup on longer, it is longer lasting.

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:53.130
Next, I am going to be using this Stila blusher,
well it is actually cheek and lip blusher,

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.870
do not be alarmed by the colors because it
actually does not come out this strong.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:03.479
I today will be using it on my lips but like
I said you can use it on your cheeks as well.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.169
It is really pretty, pink, and what is nice
about this color, it is called fuchsia by

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:17.120
the way, is that it is not too heavy, so if
you do have that midnight kiss by the front

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.330
door, you won't get it all over your face
and his face.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.610
To give your lips more of a sheen, I am going
to be using just simply Vaseline.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.169
It is not sticky, so I do not like it when
you use a really heavy lipgloss it really

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.020
sticks, you know your hair gets in it so,
just try a little bit of Vaseline it does

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.840
the same effect and the added benefit being
Vaseline it is much better for your lips as

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.840
well.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.210
