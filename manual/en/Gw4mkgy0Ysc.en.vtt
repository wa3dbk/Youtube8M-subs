00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.120
Hi everyone.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.120
So I'm in my bedroom right now.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.490
And in this video, I'm going to show you how
to make the bed.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.049
So making the bed every morning doesn't take
that much time.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.630
It takes like three to five minutes if that.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.299
Sometimes it takes more mental effort than
actual physical effort because we think about

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.940
it so much and we just dread it so much inside
of our head.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.910
But I'm going to show you that it doesn't
have to be that difficult.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.100
So before I get started, I just want to say
that like when you take the time to make the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.730
bed in the morning, you just feel so much
better at night when you get into the bed

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.610
because you just feel like so much more luxurious
getting into the bed that's like nicely made

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.629
as opposed to just passing out in a bed where
the sheets are just like jumbled at the bottom

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.470
and you just pass out in bed.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.059
So yeah, so taking the time in the morning
is worth it at night when you get into bed.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.059
OK.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.059
So let me show you exactly how I make my bed.

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.059
OK.

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.749
So the first thing I'm going to do is just
pull the pillows off the bed and just go put

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:56.719
them on top of the chair in the corner and
then I'm going to grab the quilt and do the

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.929
same thing, just put it aside just so I'll
make the bed.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:06.690
So I actually - I use a quilt instead of a
comforter or a bedspread because a quilt,

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.030
it's like thin material and so you can easily
tuck into the bed.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.690
I like to tuck things in because I feel like
it looks so much more neater and cleaner and

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.340
stuff as opposed to a comforter or a bedspread,
you can't really tuck them in as easily.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.100
So that's why I like this quilt.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.100
OK.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.812
So put that aside and then now, we're just
going to straighten up the sheets and the

00:01:27.812 --> 00:01:28.812
blankets.

00:01:28.812 --> 00:01:36.590
So I usually pull the sheet up to about like
two inches from the top of the bed and then

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.160
the same thing with the blankets and then
we're going to pull down the blanket once

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.030
we bring it up and match everything up then
we'll fold it over.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.030
All right.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.110
So first, we're tucking everything in.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.800
We're going to make sure that one side is
not longer than the other side because when

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.980
you tuck it in and one side is longer than
the other side, it's like too much fabric

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.660
or too much material and then once it gets
higher than the other side and then it's hard

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.859
to tuck the quilt in.

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:16.129
So we got to have it even on both sides, which
I think that's good.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.749
Let me just fix this corner.

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.120
OK.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.129
And now, we can fold the blanket over.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.230
So I just fold it over like I don't know,
just like a good amount.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.749
The reason I fold it over is because I like
to see like when I walk in the bedroom, I

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:44.959
like to see the brown blanket, the beige sheets
and the teal comforter because all three colors

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.060
just like they go through nicely and so I
like to just play one of each color or just

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.209
make the bed so you can see one of each color.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.430
All right.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.220
So I'm just tucking everything into the bed
frame.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:09.099
And I really like this bed frame because you
can tuck everything inside and you don't need

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.550
a bed skirt.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.639
And so, it just makes it really clean like
looking at the bed from afar.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:23.230
So yeah, it's nice when you can have the nice,
clean look.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.129
All right.

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.370
So after I'm done tucking this in, we're going
to grab the quilt.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.060
We're going to put it on top.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.359
Fold the blanket, put the pillows on top,
and then we'll be done.

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:36.359
So let me grab the quilt.

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.359
OK.

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.709
So I just grab the quilt and now, we're just
going to lay it on the bed and then fold it

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.260
over and then put the pillows on the bed.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.499
All right.

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:57.769
So I'm looking for the edge with the tags
because that goes in the upper left-hand corner.

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.659
So I just love this quilt.

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.580
So I got it like six months ago from Pottery
Barn.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.079
It was on clearance for like 85% off.

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:11.340
It was a total steal like the quilt, the shams,
the whole set, it was just an awesome find.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.319
All right.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.519
So we're just going to line it up.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.519
OK.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.560
So now, I'm just going to folded it over.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.590
I'm going to fold it pass the brown blanket
because like I said, I like to see like I

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:37.990
like to make sure all three colors are showing
when the bed is made because they all matched

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.990
so nicely.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.990
All right.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:50.430
So now, I can just start tucking in the comforter.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.600
OK.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.120
So now that that's tucked in I'm just going
to quickly fold the blankets, then we'll grab

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.560
the pillows, and then we'll be done.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.560
All right.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.330
So I'm going to put this on the chair and
grab the pillows.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.330
OK.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.900
So I put the pillows on the bed.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.370
This is going to sound really weird but I
put the pillows so the close side of the pillow

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.090
case is showing as opposed to the open part
just because it looks neater.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.520
And yeah, it just looks neater and cleaner.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.030
So I'm just going to put that side facing
out.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.349
And then I'm going to do the same thing with
the other side, show this side instead of

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.479
the open part.

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:45.050
Then 
grab the shams or the square pillows, put

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:54.889
one there, put one here, just more that over,
take the third one and put the pillow just

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:55.889
like that.

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.160
And that's how I organized the bed.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.300
So as you can see, it didn't take up that
much time.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.520
And now, when I go to sleep, I'm going to
feel relaxed.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.669
I'm going to feel like luxurious in a nice,
freshly made bed and it's just going to feel

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.490
great after a nice productive day.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.740
So I hope you found this video helpful.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.180

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.870
