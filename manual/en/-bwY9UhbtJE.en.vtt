&gt;&gt;Wade: Hi.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.380
I'm Wade Wingler with the Indata Project at
Easter Seals Crossroad in Indiana.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.900
Accessibility in iPads are
something we spend a lot of time on here and

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.300
Josh is going to show us the Tecla Switch
Interface.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.460
&gt;&gt;Josh: Hi.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.310
I'm Josh Reckelhoff.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.870
We are going to talk about accessing the iPad
with a single switch.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.660
It could be used for
basically anyone, but mainly this is going

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.420
to be for an individual in a wheelchair.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.420
The product is made by Komodo and this
box over here is called the Tecla Shield and

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.149
it is actually blue tooth connected to our
iPad

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.890
over here.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.190
My big orange and
blue thing over here is my switch and right

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.350
now we are going to use a single switch for
someone that doesn't have the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.239
ability to touch two switches at once.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.720
one switch we will go over how to do that.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.610
Connected to this Tecla Shield is also
a joy stick that could be mounted to a wheelchair

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.300
and used to cycle through different applications
as well.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.950
So, that's how
we are going to get started.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.420
I have, the device itself, the Tecla Shield
does need to be powered through a usb cable.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.299
That's
why it's hooked up to my computer and our

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.180
switch is hooked in to one of our ports there.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.049
Now there is a secondary port for
two switches like I said.

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.540
But, right now we're just going to use one.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.190
Alrighty.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.189
So, if I tap a single tap here (ipad computer
voice talks, "itunes"....).

00:01:48.189 --> 00:02:00.570
It is actually going to scan through everything
as I touch it.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.450
And if you hold it for a certain
amount of seconds that's going to give a different

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.450
command.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.560
So, holding it for 1 second is going to allow
me to select

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.590
something and two seconds is going to allow
me to toggle the keyboard on.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.540
And you can scan through the keyboard just
like we

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.370
did with the applications by tapping the switch
once like we do here.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:28.770
So, I held it down for two seconds and it
selected

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.500
our music for us.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.560
And we can still scan any page on the iPad.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.840
This also works for the iPhone.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.280
The interesting thing about
this device is it does require you to have

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.710
voice over on as well as blue tooth connection.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.330
So, to get to your voice over you
are going to want to go in to settings, general,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.191
and then down to the bottom of the page in
accessibility and you will see

00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:58.530
voice over and just slide that button on and
it will turn the voice over on.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.370
But, once you are blue tooth connected and
you

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.540
have the voice over on you're good to go.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:11.730
The last thing about this device is it comes
with these Linklocks arms and you can

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:20.540
actually use what they call dual lock velcro
and attach the iPad to this and have it clamped

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.540
on to a wheelchair or what not
that way the person can just roll up and view

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.840
their iPad.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.950
They don't have to have it resting on this
table which may be

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.350
difficult for them if they can't hunch forward
or look down to see it.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.730
It can be right where it needs to be in their
field of vision.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:46.770
So, this also came with it and to show you
what the velcro looks like we've got two pieces

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.550
of adhesive that
come together.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.780
So, one piece goes on the iPad.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.830
The other piece goes on the clear plate and
they are connected.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.270
And that is my tech
tip for the day about the Tecla Shield.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.230
&gt;&gt;Wade: So, isn't that a cool way to access
your iPad?

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.730
That's your tech tip for this week.
