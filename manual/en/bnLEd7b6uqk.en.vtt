00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.133
Marv Albert:
Mr. President, your interest
in Basketball has been well

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:16.433
documented, in that there are
a few things going on in your

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:20.233
world everyday, how often do you
get to come out here and play?

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:25.133
President Obama:
Well, these days I probably play
once every two to three weeks.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.700
Not as often as I like, but
during say, the Health Care

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.100
Debate, when things are just,
you know, going crazy over on

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.834
Capitol Hill, a lot of times
I'll just come out here and

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:37.200
shoot or I'll play a game of
HORSE it takes an edge off things.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.900
Marv Albert:
Now these days when you're
involved in Pick-Up games,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.300
do you feel that you're
dealing with less physical

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.500
contact since you
became President?

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.934
President Obama:
Well it is true I usually
have guys with guns around.

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:48.934
Marv Albert:
Yeah, I noticed.

00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:52.467
President Obama:
So, if somebody, you know,
takes a real hard fall -- foul,

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:54.333
they could get in trouble.

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.600
Nobody ever lets me with
because if you let me win,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.800
you'll never hear the end of it.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.400
I'll talk a little
trash about you.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.166
I'll make you feel
bad about yourself if

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.500
we beat you real bad.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.600
Marv Albert:
Now, I'm assuming that Bowling
is not on the schedule?

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.800
President Obama:
You know, my bowling
has greatly improved.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.800
So Marv, you're touching on
a slightly sensitive point.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.867
I'm not going to walk
off the set here but,

00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:20.633
we do have a bowling alley
here at the White House and

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:22.300
I've gotten a lot better.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.834
Marv Albert:
Now do you find yourself,

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:26.533
as we all have back in
the day on the playground,

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.066
doing play-by-play to yourself?

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.633
You come out here,
maybe count it down.

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:32.333
For example the game is tied --

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:38.100
President Obama:
In the back of my mind, Marv
Albert is making the call.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.200
Marv Albert:
So, it's Obama with the ball.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.600
Top of the key,
three seconds left...

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.200
Unleashes for three... Yes!!

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
(cheers)

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.066
President Obama:
I have your voice in my head
as I'm shooting the three.

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:50.934
Marv Albert:
That's sad.

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:52.633
(laughter)

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:55.100
Marv Albert:
Now I know you don't
want to be accused of

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.200
tampering for your Bulls but,
any advice that you might have,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.834
for LeBron James as he
approaches free agency?

00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:05.600
President Obama:
I think that the most
important thing for

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.000
LeBron right now is actually to
find a structure where he's got

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.967
a coach that he respects and is
working hard with teammates who

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.533
care about him and if
that's in Cleveland,

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:16.734
then he should
stay in Cleveland.

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:18.467
If he doesn't feel like
he can get it there,

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:19.400
then someplace else.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.767
The one thing I remember about
the Bulls was it wasn't until

00:02:24.767 --> 00:02:29.033
Michael had confidence in
Phil Jackson, Scottie Pippen,

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:32.166
Horace Grant; it wasn't until
you got that framework around

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:34.367
you that you could
be a champion.

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:36.200
Same thing happened with Kobe.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.834
First with Shaq then
later with Gasol, you know,

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:44.467
he's gotten that sense of a
team around him and I think

00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:47.300
LeBron hasn't quite been
able to get that yet;

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.533
that's what he needs to find.

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:51.066
Marv Albert:
Could you, on behalf of the
Bulls, throw in perhaps a night

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:56.000
in the Lincoln Bedroom
or ride on Air Force One?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.567
President Obama:
You know, like I said,
I don't want to mettle.

00:02:57.567 --> 00:03:01.000
I will say this, Rose, Noah --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.100
Marv Albert:
It's a pretty good core.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.166
President Obama:
It's a pretty good core.

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:07.667
You know, you could see LeBron
fitting in pretty well.

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:11.600
Marv Albert:
If you were NBA
Commissioner for a day,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.567
what changes would you make?

00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:14.500
President Obama:
You know, I'll be
honest with you,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.934
I think the game is in
a good place right now.

00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:21.533
The way they're calling the game
right now returns basketball to

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.734
where its supposed to be;
more of a finesse game.

00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:27.333
The biggest change I'd
probably propose right now is,

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:30.066
the commissioner needs to figure
out how to price tickets so that

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:31.767
ordinary people can
go to the games.

00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:35.133
I mean I think that ticket
prices have gotten so high,

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:37.600
and I understand that
salaries are high,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.467
ticket prices are going
to be high but, you know,

00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:43.333
you hate to think that the only
person that can go to a game is

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:44.867
somebody who's got
a corporate account.

00:03:44.867 --> 00:03:48.867
And that's something that I'd
love all professional sports,

00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:50.900
that's not just NBA, but all
professional sports to be

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.300
thinking about a little more.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.567
Marv Albert:
Alright the Phoenix Suns, in
the news recently wearing the

00:03:56.567 --> 00:03:59.300
Los Suns jerseys
on Cinco de Mayo.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.367
And they took a stand opposing
Arizona's immigration policy,

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:06.133
how do you feel about sports
franchises getting involved

00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:07.400
in political issues?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.667
President Obama:
You know, I think that just
because somebody's a sports

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.633
figure or you got a sports team
doesn't mean that you're not

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:16.633
part of the community and you're
not part of our democracy.

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:19.033
I think it's terrific
that the Suns,

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:21.934
who obviously feel very
strong about their community,

00:04:21.934 --> 00:04:26.000
recognize that a big part of
their community felt threatened

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.233
by this new law.

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:31.233
You know, when I was growing up,
you had figures like Arthur Ashe

00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:35.734
and Bill Russell who routinely
would talk about the world

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.133
around them.

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:41.300
You wouldn't always agree with
them but, that sense that,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.967
you know, people are engaged
in the big issues of the day,

00:04:43.967 --> 00:04:49.600
I think is a positive thing
and I don't think that either

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.834
players or franchises
need to always steer

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:53.867
away from controversy.

00:04:53.867 --> 00:04:58.166
I happen to personally think
that the Arizona Law is a bad

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:03.133
idea, I've said so publicly and
I see no reason why these guys

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:07.867
can't make the same statement.

00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:10.633
Marv Albert:
Here in Washington, it's
a great deal of excitement.

00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:14.800
Wizards, now in possession of
the overall first round pick.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.433
John Wall of Kentucky
would be, I would guess,

00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:20.166
the early line favorite.

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:21.900
What's your, I know you watch
a lot of college basketball,

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.400
what's your scouting report?

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.166
President Obama:
Wall is a terrific player.

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:30.367
I mean, you know, he's got
the NBA speed, NBA body,

00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:35.333
great jump shot, unselfish,
really impressive.

00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:38.033
There's only upside
for that kid.

00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:41.834
And I think it'd be great
for him to come to Washington.

00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:45.433
I became very close
to Abe Pollin,

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:47.433
who was a great
supporter, he and wife.

00:05:47.433 --> 00:05:50.900
He just passes away recently but
there's an example of a guy who

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.467
constantly gave back
to his community.

00:05:52.467 --> 00:05:56.600
I mean, almost single-handedly,
he invested in downtown

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.633
Washington at a time when
it was in really bad shape.

00:05:59.633 --> 00:06:03.367
You know, generated huge
affection in this city and

00:06:03.367 --> 00:06:06.467
it was wonderful to
see his widow there;

00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:09.900
getting that number one
pick and I only wish the

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.367
best for that franchise.

00:06:11.367 --> 00:06:16.900
Marv Albert:
What is the Presidential pick
for this season's NBA Champions?

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.967
President Obama:
Boston surprised me.

00:06:18.967 --> 00:06:22.467
They gelled in the playoffs
in a way that they hadn't

00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:24.967
all through the season.

00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:27.834
Rondo's become one of
the best point guards

00:06:27.834 --> 00:06:29.734
in the league in no time.

00:06:29.734 --> 00:06:34.266
I mean, when he gets
a real jump shot,

00:06:34.266 --> 00:06:36.533
he's going to be unstoppable
but I've got to go with the

00:06:36.533 --> 00:06:37.567
Lakers again.

00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:42.467
I think Gasol may be the best
big man in the league right now.

00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:44.967
He's different from Dwight
Howard but he's playing --

00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:45.867
Marv Albert:
Great footwork.

00:06:45.867 --> 00:06:46.900
President Obama:
-- unbelievable footwork.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.734
Speed savvy, he's
playing magnificently.

00:06:50.734 --> 00:06:56.667
Kobe is, you know, the fiercest
competitor in the league and

00:06:56.667 --> 00:07:00.633
they've got, you know, what I
continue to believe is the best

00:07:00.633 --> 00:07:05.734
coach in the NBA right now in
Phil Jackson so there going to

00:07:05.734 --> 00:07:11.266
be formidable and I think
it'll be a tough series.

00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:14.133
You know, Boston's a
veteran club but the

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:15.633
Lakers are looking pretty good.

00:07:15.633 --> 00:07:18.333
Marv Albert:
Mr. President, we appreciate
your taking the time and I

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:21.166
really like your back yard.

00:07:21.166 --> 00:07:23.333
President Obama:
Listen, you are welcome, Marv,

00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:28.834
to call play-by-play in any
pick up game that we have.

00:07:28.834 --> 00:07:33.200
I want you to let Kenny
know and Charles know,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.834
that I appreciate them.

00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:38.934
And I am curious about
Charles' golf game though.

00:07:38.934 --> 00:07:41.400
I want to see if that
swing ever got fixed.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.767
Marv Albert:
A lot of people are
curious about that.

00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:43.867
President Obama:
Charles is a great guy,

00:07:43.867 --> 00:07:47.934
great friend but that's,
it's a scary golf swing.

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:50.100
(laughter)
