00:00:05.584 --> 00:00:09.199
To what extent is water capable of picking up information?

00:00:09.807 --> 00:00:11.215
what does it perceive?

00:00:11.647 --> 00:00:15.475
and how does it remember it overtime?

00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:20.119
The Aerospace institute has discovered a relatively simple way of 

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:23.351
making a structure of a drop of water visible.

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.975
the researchers have had their efforts rewarded by 

00:00:26.407 --> 00:00:28.575
insights into a very beautiful world 

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:33.056
each drop has a face of its own, unmistakable and unique

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.303
why are the individual drops so different from one another?

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.975
we got a lot of people to come to a lecture hall here at the institute

00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:45.895
gave them all the same water, had them make drops at exactly the same time

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.056
collected all the drops and then discovered that each individual 

00:00:49.392 --> 00:00:52.407
produced different images from the same water

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:55.559
and here you can see the results, here at the right you can see

00:00:55.935 --> 00:00:58.423
that the images of the individual students were different

00:00:58.887 --> 00:01:01.783
but those made by a given student were all quite similar

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.832
this is the work of the first experimenter, this one here from the second

00:01:06.216 --> 00:01:09.327
this from the third, and this from the fourth

00:01:10.063 --> 00:01:12.008
individually they can quite easily be reproduced

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.423
but you would never have thought they were all from the same water

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:20.099
because when you compare the images from the different people you see some big differences

00:01:20.907 --> 00:01:24.565
then we undertook experiments to find out whether things changed

00:01:25.037 --> 00:01:26.622
when we put something into the water

00:01:26.768 --> 00:01:30.451
a real flower was placed in the water

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.647
a while later we took a drop of water and here you can see one of the pictures

00:01:36.248 --> 00:01:39.800
and you can see in this picture, its the typical image you get when you put

00:01:40.207 --> 00:01:41.488
flower into water

00:01:42.176 --> 00:01:46.327
you could recognize the flower in every single drop in this glass, offcourse

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.743
that can be reproduced and have significance

00:01:49.127 --> 00:01:51.056
and if you were to put a different flower in here for example

00:01:51.463 --> 00:01:58.587
a sweet william flower, then all the drops of this water will look like sweet william

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:08.719
the stigma that water has a memory, practically changes our whole way of looking at the world, offcourse

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.569
lets travel down the rhine in the trigitive sense

00:02:12.497 --> 00:02:16.929
the water is flowing down the rhine picking up information everywhere it goes

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.609
so the water has more information at the mouth of the rhine, than it had at the source

00:02:23.586 --> 00:02:29.305
and the ducks living at the mouth when they drink that water are also drinking all that information

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:34.467
thus the world's oceans will no longer be something that seperates us, but instead a giant

00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:42.879
storehouse of information, and the rain will perhaps be a data medium carrying information to the world
