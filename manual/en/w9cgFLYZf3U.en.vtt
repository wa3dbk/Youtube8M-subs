00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.000
When loading up Woody Woodpecker initially,
it turned out to be not what we were expecting.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.520
First it looked like it might be a cartoon
themed platformer.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.890
Then the character selection screen comes
up and it looks like a kart racer.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.510
Turns out that's not exactly right either.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.400
Basically this game is what would happen if
you took Tiny Wings and turned it into a racing

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.829
game, with each character from the Woody Woodpecker
show vying for first position when they cross

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.289
the finish line.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.370
An inventive use of a license to say the least.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.390
Each character has three stats that change
how they perform on the peaks and valleys

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.640
of the tracks; speed, acceleration, and handling.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.860
Then when the race starts, you have access
to a speed boost and a special move, which

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.570
usually stuns the other racers if they get
hit.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.510
These are on a timer, but funnily enough they
seem to be more disastrous than helpful.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.780
Oh sure the speed boost can send you rocketing
over the hills, and the attack is useful to

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.640
get the jump on that rival right in front
of you, but they mess up your flow, and any

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.640
player who has spent anytime playing Tiny
Wings can tell you your flow is critical for

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.550
landing the perfect slide.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.311
In the time spent reviewing this game, more
races were won without any use of either of

00:01:09.311 --> 00:01:11.270
these power ups than with using them.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.210
Make of that what you will.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.440
And while a novel concept, the problem arises
in the level design variety department.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.810
Aside from a background swap changing the
scenery, there's not much you can do with

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.159
the rolling hills that lay at the crux of
how the game works.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.790
This is less an issue in multiplayer where
the thrill of beating your opponent outweighs

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.870
the same-ness of the level design, but perhaps
something like floating islands as an alternate

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.180
path could have brought more to the table.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.810
So there you have it.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.190
Whether or not this game is worth your time
and money is based on the concept and your

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.910
love of Woody Woodpecker.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.230
Just as a final note, the theme song has been
altered slightly and as a fan of the cartoons,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.330
it was a bit of a letdown as hearing the theme
song at the menu screen was something to look

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.350
forward to.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:02:00.000
At least Woody's trademark laugh stays intact.
