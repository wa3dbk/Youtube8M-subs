- [male voice] There's plenty of opportunities
for you to pursue your own personal interests.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.360
They've been very helpful in trying to facilitate
those experiences and those opportunities

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.639
and I think all my resident colleagues would
agree.

- [Sean] So, after I graduated medical school

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.650
here from the University of Minnesota in 2008,
I went into the Navy and I completed an internship

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.369
in Internal Medicine. My experience in the
Navy allowed me to understand what primary

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.120
care has to offer and certainly appreciate
working in a clinical setting and being able

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.329
to sit down and talk with patients.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.270
- [Sean] Well, for one, I think that patient
population that we have at the Greenside Clinic

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.540
is very well-rounded. I'm treating a variety
of different ages and age specific conditions

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.969
as well as different ethnicities and people
from different parts of the world, which I

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.989
think is pretty unique. We're very strong,
I think, in sports medicine. Our program has

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.270
had great success in matching residents into
fellowship programs over the course of the

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.060
years. I think a lot of that is due, in large
part, to the opportunities that we have outside

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.810
of the curriculum.
- Sean has benefited from our sports medicine

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.789
experience, which involved working at two
different high schools.

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.999
- [Sean] At Armstrong High School or accompanying
Dr. [inaudible] to Minetauk High School. That

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:30.619
way you get to interact with the athletes
at their school, within their sports, and

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.849
you really can get a lot of additional sports
medicine experience outside of what's provided

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:40.369
within the curriculum originally. The proximity
to the clinic to the hospital is one of the

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.999
undersold benefits of our program. It's very
nice because everyone can go to a new conference

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:52.329
that we have everyday, because it's just a
walk, a five minute walk away from the clinic

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:58.340
and so you definitely get a little bit more
camaraderie, being able to see all your residents

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.700
and staff on a regular basis.
- I'm a third year resident and finishing

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.419
up my experience at Central Clinic. Sean's
going to have an opportunity to come and spend

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:11.680
time there and is really going to experience
this really high volume adolescent and child

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.780
medicine and you spend the first two years
getting trained doing this and Central Clinic

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.790
is an opportunity to go on your own without
a preceptor there with you, and so you really

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.980
get to test your knowledge and your comfort
level with these types of patients.

- [Sean] In my discussion and interview at

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.120
Methodist, I felt that they best appreciated
the different background that I had and what

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.930
I was bringing to the table, having taken
a little bit different route than most traditional

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.430
medical students or residents. I'm interested
in research and pursuing research and possibly

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.530
more of an academic career. I felt like they
were most willing to work with me and allow

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.530
me to continue to pursue things like hyperbaric
medicine or research. Doth the Creekside Family

Medicine Residency and faculty, as well as
the sub-specialists or specialists that Methodist

Hospital themselves, I think our experience
in working with them again, being the only

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.409
residents around, we get to know them pretty
well, so working with the faculty there and

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.920
the other residents there has been fantastic
and we all get along very well and it's an

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.239
open and welcoming environment. Methodist
can provide a great foundation in Family Medicine.
