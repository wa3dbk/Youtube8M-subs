00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello, my name is Jan

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.533
I am Dutch and i am 24 years old (i actually said 20)

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is the fist time that i make a video in Cantonese

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
There is many people from the mainland of China that say that Cantonese is useless

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But i think the language sounds nice

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I like Beyond's music

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I listen to his music every day

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I have been to Hong Kong many times

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So i have many friends from Hong Kong

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So every time i go there there is many people that want to teach me Cantonese

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I don't speak Cantonese very well, but i hope to learn more this year

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Mandarin, i can also speak (changing to Mandarin)

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So i can also speak Mandarin

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Actually i do speak Mandarin better than Cantonese

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I haven't made a Youtube video for a very long time

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So today i would like to tell you my story about learning Chinese

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Three years ago was the first time that i went to Asia

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The first place i went was Guilin in Guangxi Province, a small city in the south of China

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I stayed there for five months and went to university everyday

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
That was for a period of five months

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
When i was in the classroom i didn't have to much motivation to learn Chinese

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I thought it was to boring for me

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But everyday when i went out, i met many Chinese people

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
In Guilin there is not so many foreigners, so i had to use Chinese every day.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
In this way i made many Chinese friends

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
This gave me a lot a motivation to study this language

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
'Yuyin' that's Cantonese, i mean 'Yuyan' 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So, i have many friends from Guilin but they don't speak Mandarin very standard

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
That's because they speak Guilinhua as well, the local dialect

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I can let you hear some Guilinhua

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So the first sentence is: Ni ke na kai? - Ey ni ke na kai a?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The meaning of this is 'where are you going?' they say: Ni ke na kai

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Another one is: Laoban haoduo qian (stange tonation)

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Boss, how much is it? (can i have the bill)

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The other one is: Loi loi loi, hojo hojo

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The meaning of this is: Come here, let's drink alcohol

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
The last one: Ni si bu si Guilinyin a?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Are you from Guilin? Ni si bu si Guilinyin, is what they say

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
For me Guilin is fun

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:55.000
It's a small city, maybe many Chinese prefer bigger cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, ect.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So why i studied Chinese and how did u study this language?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I mean 'yuyan' (language), now i make the same mistake again

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So i have been studing Chinese for three years now

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So first i went to China to spend five months in Guilin

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
During this period i took classes already

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
But outside this period i haven't attened Chinese lessons

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So so most of the Chinese language i know, i learned from self-study

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I went to Indonesia two years ago

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I also spent five months over there

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
In Indonesia there is many Chinese-Indonesian people and some of them can speak Chinese as well.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
But there accent is not so good

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
They have a very strong Indonesian accent

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000
At that time spend a lot of time with Chinese friends

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So at that time i used Chinese on a daily base

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Indonesian as well, but my Indonian is not so good

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:37.000
When i came back from Indonesia to Holland my Chinese started getting better

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Last year i went to Shenzhen, close to Hong Kong

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I goal was to find a company to do my final internship

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:00.000
When i arrived there i still hadn't considered in which company i could do my internship

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I can still remember that i met somebody in a MacDonnalds

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:18.000
He was a Dutch businessman, and he invited me to do an internship in his company

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So i agreed

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:32.000
The most of the Chinese people in Shenzhen came from other parts of China

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:41.000
What i am trying to stay is that Shenzhen is in Guangdong province, but the most people there can't speak Cantonese

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Because they came from somewhere else

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So every time when i took a taxi there i always used to ask the taxi driver: Where are you from?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Sometimes their accent was so strong that i could guess from which place in China they came from

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
At these moment you really can make them scared

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I think thats really fun

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Ofcourse there are also taxi driver in Shenzhen who can speak Cantonese

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000
As i said before, i think Cantonese sounds very nice

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So about my Cantonese, i learned it from friends but there are also taxi drivers who teached me

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
OK, that's my story about how i learned Chinese

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000
If said anything not correct you can write it down below
