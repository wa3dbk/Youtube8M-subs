00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.520
Hello.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.820
I'm here to do the voice-over for the "Hungry Hippos" movie trailer.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.960
It's "Hunger Games!"

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.320
Oh, you again!

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.460
Hello, Frank.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.780
Still employed, huh?

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.760
Guess they didn't get my comment card from last time.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.520
Wonderful to see you again as well.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.140
The script is already in the booth.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.300
Oh, perfect!

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.540
Then I won't need to waste this toilet paper that I bought. Expensive stuff-

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.500
-YOU WILL NOT CRAP IN THE BOOTH, AGAIN!

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.100
Afraid of improving the decor in here, are we?

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.940
Look, just shut your face, roll the trailer, turn on the mic, and call Planned Parenthood.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.400
Why would I call Planned Parenthood, Frank?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.280
'Cause I'm about to make love to your eardrums [in deep voice] with my sexy voice!

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.460
[in quiet annoyed voice] God.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.440
Don't come crying to me when you're pregnant with my ear-babies!

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.080
[humps microphone vigorously and mockingly]

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.460
Hey, stop doing that.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.280
Rolling sound...action!

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.900
From Milton Bradley-

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.580
-Lionsgate!

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.860
NO INTERRUPTIONS!

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.540
Finally, a movie where one young girl

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.680
has to make the ultimate decision

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.900
of [in mocking girly voice] which boy do I like best?!

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.320
[normal voice] I vote for the one that turns into the sexy wolf, personally.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.020
That's "Twilight"!

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.980
Heh, you would know.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.240
Oh, shit, aliens.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.320
Okay, this looks promising.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.460
Oh, that must be the hippos' ship!

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.420
A concentration camp for white children only

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.580
with a halftime show starring...Madonna?

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.100
YAY! She won the trip to Aruba!

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.680
But the jealous sister wants in on the action, too.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.860
Typical sister move.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.400
[in a mocking Jan voice] Marcia, Marcia, Marica

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.460
Wait, what the blazes is going on here?!

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.800
Where are the bloody hippos?!

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.140
It's the future, and "Catnip"-

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.640
"Katniss!"

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.160
"KIt-Kat."

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.660
"Katniss!"

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.240
"Chip-dip"

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.340
has to fight an army of hippos

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.640
who just see her as a delicious white marble.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.600
Oh, look! It's the guy from "Brokeback Mountain".

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.260
No, it's not!

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.200
[in quiet voice] Probably your favorite movie.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.120
Yeah, it's an excellent film!

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.600
From the epic novels

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.320
that "Tween Beat" Magazine

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.740
gave 5/5 "OMGs"

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.720
The most exciting literary achievement

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.160
since "Superfudge"

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.800
[in muffled voice] "Cloud City Empire Strikes Back"

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.380
Cut!

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.200
Frank, all you have to do is read off the paper.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.500
What is with you and the bloody paper?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.540
Do you get money every time you mention paper or something?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.080
I want some money.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.720
Paper, paper, paper!

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.320
Nothing.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.380
Shall we continue?

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.320
Journey to the center of the "L'oreal" factory

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.700
where Lenny Kravitz is the evil stylist

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.060
for the evil prom

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.300
where Jack Bauer's dad is principal

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.880
Ooh! "I whip my hair back and forth!"

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.580
I love her!

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.020
[singing off-key] "I whip my hair back and forth. I whip my hair back and forth. I whip my hair back and for-"

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.720
-Frank!

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.160
The paper, read it!

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.640
Oh, Woody! Nice hair.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.440
Get Lenny Kravitz to help you with that.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.260
Lenny Kravitz...

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.340
Good bloke...

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.000
but he will relieve you of your girlfriend.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.740
Thanks very much for that information, Frank.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.960
Probably not something you have to worry about, though.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.460
Is this gonna be on "ESPN"?

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.280
'Cause this is a sport I would definitely watch.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.920
No, Frank.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.280
It's a movie based on a book.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.380
Yeah, for little girls like you.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.160
Yes, I know.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.580
Oh, that guy dies.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.540
I'm sure of it.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.900
He's got "victim" written all o-

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.320
Wait, does he have "victim" written on his face?

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.820
No, Frank!

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.140
He's just got a fanciful beard...

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.920
with a lot of curls in it.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.020
"Crab dip" gets her name on the list

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.940
at Lenny Kravitz's club

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.860
where the V.I.P. room is...

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.400
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST!

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.860
Where the hippos will try to eat you!

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.440
Run, "Catsitter", Run!

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.560
She takes cat-sitting very seriously.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.840
This spring, prepared to be dragged to the movies

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.920
by your girlfriend.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.380
"The Hunger Games!"

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.380
Where your food plays with you!

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.400
Rated: HPV for "hippo violence".

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.500
See it and you might get laid.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.180
Okay. That was completely useless.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.340
Would you like to try it again?

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.840
[in a mocking voice] Yes, sir.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.840
But first, would you direct me to the lavatory?

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.580
Take a right down the hall and it's your first lef-

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.380
[normal voice] Oh! Too slow.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.300
What do you mean by that?

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.040
It appears, I have crapped in your booth again.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.040
Deal with it.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.320
Oh! Good news, though.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.380
I didn't do it on your precious paper.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.900
Haha!

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.640
Rated: AWESOME!
