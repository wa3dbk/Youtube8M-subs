Hello, my name is Chester See.

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.800
My YouTube channel is
YouTube.com/ChesterSee.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:19.200
On my channel you will find
a lot of stuff is not that

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.450
interesting.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.480
But if you're looking to waste
time, I'm your guy.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.670
I'm about to pass 800,000
subscribers,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.780
which is really cool.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.640
I need that validation like
everyone else, because of my

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.890
own personal insecurities.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.680
"God Damn, You're Beautiful."
That's my biggest video--

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.260
biggest as in most viewed.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.810
It actually is my very
first YouTube video.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.380
I was really proud of this.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.940
It made the love song
dedications album, which is

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.840
really cool.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.510
Because all the names on that
album are actual good

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.440
musicians--

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.272
Seal, Alicia Keys, Coldplay,
Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga, and

00:01:09.272 --> 00:01:13.240
then Chester See is on there
somehow, which is really cool.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.900
I honestly love what I do.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.685
I am so blessed to be able to
do what I love for work.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.760
My passion is actually in
destroying network television.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.980
That's my passion.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.490
Doing something that really
turns some heads in this

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.270
digital space.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.010
I have no problem staying
online as

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.671
long as I have a voice.

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:46.084
Toros!

00:01:46.084 --> 00:01:46.555
Toros!

00:01:46.555 --> 00:01:48.439
Hey, don't hit me, bulls.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.590
Stop it, bulls.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.185
My motivation in making
videos is girls.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.580
That's a true statement,
actually.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.900
Yes, I am single.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.040
I don't want to be.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.750
I would like a baby.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.480
I want a baby.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.350
I'd like to be a dad.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.830
That'd be cool, that'd be fun.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.861
I want to try it out for
a little bit, you know?

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.614
I want to be an action hero.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.840
So Chester See will one day get
to star in an action film.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.120
That sums me up in a
nutshell, I think.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.470
I was a part of a Filipino
dance group when

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.370
I was growing up.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.520
But it was tanickling
and Maglalatik.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.170
And I had coconuts on my
body and I would hit

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.560
the coconuts in rhythm.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.290
But I am not very rhythmic.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.670
Strategy to lose?

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.190
No.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.320
Because I do not throw
in the towel.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.480
However, strategy to win is
a little tougher, just

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.645
considering knowing my place
in the world of dance.

00:02:56.645 --> 00:02:59.520
I'm going to have to have some
sort of a different edge.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.120
I'm going to dance.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.650
And they're either going to
make fun of me or they're

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.490
going to think that
I'm fake dancing.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.710

If you want to leave a comment,
leave it all up in

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.730
the comment box where
you're supposed to.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.060
Don't write it down, because
then we won't know that you

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.450
left a comment.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.780
Doesn't even make any sense.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.990
What am I saying?

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.740
I love you.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.990
Goodbye.
