00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.120
Thank you so much for seeing me.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.254
Well, I
can only tell you

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.060
what the spirits say
through me,

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.960
but is there someone
you'd like to speak to?

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.940
Yes, my
grandma passed recently.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.860
I'd love to just talk to her
one more time.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.020
Well, let's see
if we can find her.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.520
Okay.

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:21.821
♪♪

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.656
I'm seeing someone,

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.559
it's a male
who died recently.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.597
An uncle, a brother,
Ricky, Roadie.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:31.564
Oh.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:33.033
My Uncle Randy?

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.734
Uncle Randy, yes.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.070
Oh, my God...

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.005
What--
Does he see my grandma?

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.775
He says
she'll be here soon.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.677
He says he was in the
neighborhood

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:47.547
and he's just gonna hang out
until she gets here.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:48.982
Okay, fine.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:52.452
Now he's telling me you've
really grown up.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.020
Okay.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.955
No, seriously, you
look good.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.991
You look
like a woman now.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.259
All right.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.295
He's showing
me a trampoline,

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:05.765
a little girl jumping up and
down on a trampoline

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:08.568
and a man watching her
very closely,

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:10.737
never taking
his eyes off of her.

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:13.406
Right, yeah,
he used to get me a trampoline

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:14.707
and a bathing suit...

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:16.810
like,
every year.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.912
He wants to know if you
still use it

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:20.380
and if
so at what times.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.048
I don't even know where
they are.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:24.050
Is my grandma here?

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.118
Yes.

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:26.252
Oh my God,
Grandma, is that you?

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.388
No, it's still Randy.

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:32.492
Now he's telling you to relax
and not to worry

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.727
and he's
rubbing your shoulders.

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:37.297
Oh my God, he's touching me
right now?

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:40.700
He says you have a lot
of tension.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.402
Two huge knots.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:43.503
Oh, gross.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.206
He wants to know,
are you still friends

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:49.075
with that girl, Erin?

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:49.909
Erin?

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.344
Pigtails?

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.980
Amazingly heavy sleeper?

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.448
Oh my
God, I'm leaving.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:57.050
How much do I
owe you ?

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.251
Wait, wait!

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:00.687
Your grandma's here.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:01.721
Grandma!

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:04.924
She wants to know if she
can bum a cigarette.
