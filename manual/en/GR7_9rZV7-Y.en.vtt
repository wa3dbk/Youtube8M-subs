Today we are going to prepare Vanilla Ice Cream.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.370
Ice Cream is loved by people of all age group.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.180
Ice-cream lovers enjoy the different flavours

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.180

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.239
So let's make Homemade Delicious Vanilla Ice-Cream

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.590
Let’s see the ingredients needed. We need:

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.829
One and a half litre of full cream milk

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.709
200 Grams of Sugar

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:31.669
200 Grams of fresh cream.

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.029
Here we are using homemade cream,

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:38.000
if you want to prepare it home then watch my video.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.060
4 teaspoon corn flour

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.560
2 teaspoon Milk Powder,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.680
Half teaspoon baking powder

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.060
Half teaspoon Ice cream stabilizer,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.880
Half teaspoon liquid glucose

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.600
One teaspoon of Vanilla Essence

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.600
First of all we will boil milk.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.490
Take a heavy bottom or non-stick pan &amp; pour milk to it.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.860
Take a bowl and remove approx. 1/4 cup of milk

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.300
to mix corn flour in it to form a smooth paste.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.720
Put on the burner &amp; boil milk till it reduces to one litre.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.240
Stir once or twice in between.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.860
Now add 1 teaspoon of sugar to stabilizer &amp; mix it well.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.600
Now add remaining sugar to boiling milk.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.940
Stir it continuously

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.500
so that sugar doesn’t sticks in bottom of the pan.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.090
We will remove some hot milk in a bowl to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.930
dissolve milk powder in it.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.120
Once the milk turns to lukewarm, we will add

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.520
milk powder in it and mix it well.

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.400
Now you will observe that milk powder is dissolved

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.900
in milk and no lumps are observed.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.000
Now we will pour this mixture in boiling milk

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and mix it well.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.820
Now we will add liquid glucose

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.300
sugar - stabilizer mixture (which we have mixed earlier)

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.840
to boiling milk and mix it well.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.040
Now we will add corn flour to the cold milk which we

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.420
have taken off before boiling the milk and mix it well.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.640
We will make sure that lumps are not formed.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.760
Now we will add this mixture to our boiling milk

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.760
and mix it again.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.760
Now we will add baking powder and mix it well.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.400
Once mix well,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.660
we will turn off the burner and let the mixture cool.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.920
Our ice-cream base is cooled now.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.340
We will pour it in an air tight or Ice-cream container

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.510
and refrigerate it till it turn semi solid.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.340
After few hours we will observe that our Ice-cream turns

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.620
to semi solid.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.900
Now we will add cream to it.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.160
Now pour one teaspoon of vanilla essence.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.360
Now we will beat our semi solid ice-cream base

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.160
for few minutes with the help of electric beater.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.580
If you don’t have electric beater at home

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.200
then you can use hand beater or mixer grinder to beat it.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.960
After beating it,

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.420
We will again refrigerate our ice-cream to set.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.060
Our Delicious Vanilla Ice-Cream is ready to serve

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.439
Take a bowl &amp; pour three Vanilla ice-cream scopes to it.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.460
To make it more interesting

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.120
we will flavor it with chocolate syrup.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.140
Here we are using homemade chocolate syrup,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.159
