00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:32.700
(Ellen V. Futter) It is truly hearty for all
of us at this Museum which is all about nature,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.050
humanity, with so many of the winning entries
to reflect a love of and a fascination with

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.420
nature.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.150
Animals, the ocean and outer space, we love,
as well.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.950
(Ryan Germick) The Doodle 4 Google Program
is a scholarship competition for school kids

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.820
from age K to 12.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.230
They basically draw a Google logo, interpreting
whatever the year's theme is.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.330
This year's theme was My Best Day Ever, which
is pretty open-ended and we were delighted

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.170
to see the creativity and inspiration of the
children.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.800
(Allison) My best day ever is when I went
to Dinosaur Land.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.490
I saw all these dinosaurs and I did a fossil
hunt, and found part of a turtle.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.580
(Maria) My Best Day Ever drawing is about
me going out and looking at the stars on a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.580
clear night.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.200
(Andrea) My best day ever would be going to
the Great Barrier Reef, scuba-diving because

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.330
the ocean has always been one of my greatest
interests.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.310
(Ryan Germick) It was a record-breaking year,
we had over a hundred and thirty thousand

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.890
applicants, which were then wiggled down to
fifty, the state finals that are exhibited

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.890
here.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.470
These were voted on online to become the national
finalist for each age group and the ultimate

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.930
national winner.
