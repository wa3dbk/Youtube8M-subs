00:00:06.813 --> 00:00:08.620
What is DOTA2 NSL to you?

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.489
It is a great opportunity for me 
to learn more about e-Sports.

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:18.555
It introduced me to both new people and a new culture.

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:20.689
I think it’s been a great memory.

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.904
I always write in my diary before I go to bed.

00:00:22.904 --> 00:00:26.343
In my diary, DOTA2 NSL is always in there.

00:00:26.343 --> 00:00:31.470
I think that’s how much affections I have towards it.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.874
Which player that you’ve interviewed 
do you remember the most?

00:00:33.874 --> 00:00:35.448
That… bandit looking person!!

00:00:35.448 --> 00:00:36.347
PD: Rash! (I’m sorry Rash)

00:00:36.347 --> 00:00:37.960
Yes! Rash!

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.000
He was really a fun person to talk to.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.305
He said he was cute!! ROFL

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:47.498
Rash: I’m cute too!

00:00:47.498 --> 00:00:48.527
Byun: What??

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:49.749
Rash: Ah~ I’m cute too!!

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:50.857
Byun: Ah.. yes you’re cut….e

00:00:50.857 --> 00:00:52.371
Rash: You don’t trust me?

00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:55.043
Rash: Ok no more interview

00:00:55.043 --> 00:01:00.221
That and also I’ll miss #SymphonyDota team

00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:08.208
They really remind me of my little brother 
who is almost the same age as them.

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:12.258
Byun: Study hard and we’ll meet again 
at the University.

00:01:12.258 --> 00:01:14.851
Which player, skill-wise, do you remember to most?

00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:19.524
Byun: S4L and Febby, the most.

00:01:19.524 --> 00:01:26.556
I wonder how they can play that well with 
those innocent looking faces.

00:01:26.556 --> 00:01:36.987
When I watch them from the backstage, 
other players scream about their plays.

00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:39.535
That moment, they look really awesome.

00:01:39.535 --> 00:01:41.653
Heard that you have been playing DOTA2 
a lot recently.

00:01:41.653 --> 00:01:47.597
Yes, these days, I’m trying to learn Windrunner.

00:01:47.597 --> 00:01:52.404
I’m not very skilled, but I’m trying really hard.

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:56.657
If you see me in-game, please say ‘Hi’

00:01:56.657 --> 00:01:58.777
And let’s play DOTA2 togther~

00:01:58.777 --> 00:02:00.146
See you in-game~

00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:05.276
Any last words?

00:02:05.276 --> 00:02:09.456
I really think I’m very lucky that I came to NSL.

00:02:09.456 --> 00:02:10.688
Really!

00:02:10.688 --> 00:02:12.198
I made a lot of mistakes...

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:13.510
Everyone!

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.004
If I don’t show up on NSL Season 2...

00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:20.692
GOMTV didn’t hire me!!!

00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:21.636
Call me back for Season 2~

00:02:21.636 --> 00:02:23.391
See you at Season 2~

00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:25.304
Now you have to call me for Season 2! :)

00:02:29.725 --> 00:02:32.144
PD: Hello coach!

00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:34.857
Back when MVP OZONE won the championship

00:02:34.857 --> 00:02:37.085
Coach Im did a B-Boy ceremony.

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:39.977
PD: Straight up… LoL? DotA2? Which is better?

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.962
Coach Im: I think both are fun

00:02:43.962 --> 00:02:46.246
PD: Oh come on~

00:02:46.246 --> 00:02:48.826
Coach Im: Was it too general?

00:02:48.826 --> 00:02:50.653
At first, LoL was really fun.

00:02:50.653 --> 00:02:53.815
Then I felt DotA2 was harder to play.

00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:58.755
Right now, I’m enjoying DotA2 more

00:02:59.905 --> 00:03:03.464
If you win NSL… will you do a headspin?
