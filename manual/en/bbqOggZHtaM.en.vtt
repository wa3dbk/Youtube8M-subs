"How to Prevent Prediabetes 
from Turning into Diabetes"

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:13.316
In just one decade, the number of people 
 with diabetes has more than doubled. 

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:17.186
According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, by 2050, 

00:00:17.186 --> 00:00:20.667
one out of every three 
of us may have diabetes. 

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:22.938
What’s the big deal?

00:00:22.938 --> 00:00:26.574
Well, the consequences 
of diabetes are legion;

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:30.506
the #1 cause of adult-onset blindness, 
the #1 cause of kidney failure,

00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:33.439
the #1 cause of 
surgical amputations. 

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:36.529
What can we do 
to prevent it?

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:39.837
Well, the onset of 
type 2 diabetes is gradual, 

00:00:39.837 --> 00:00:43.252
with most individuals progressing 
through a state of prediabetes,

00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:47.596
a condition now striking 
approximately 1 in 3 Americans, 

00:00:47.596 --> 00:00:52.004
but only about 1 in 10 
even knows it. 

00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:55.161
Since current methods of treating 
diabetes remain inadequate,

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:58.745
prevention is preferable, 
but what works better?

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:01.194
Lifestyle changes or drugs? 

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:06.593
We didn’t know until this landmark study 
was published in New England Journal of Medicine. 

00:01:06.593 --> 00:01:09.561
Thousands were randomized to 
get a good double dose 

00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:13.729
of the leading anti-diabetes 
drug OR diet and exercise. 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.995
The drug, metformin, is probably the 
safest diabetes drug there is. 

00:01:19.995 --> 00:01:24.058
Umm...does cause diarrhea in 
about half of those who take it, 

00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:27.625
makes 1 in 4 nauseous, about 
1 in 10 suffer from asthenia,

00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:33.113
from the Greek meaning lack of strength, 
causing physical weakness and fatigue, 

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:38.643
but the risk of being killed by the drug 
 is only about 1 in 66,000 every year.

00:01:38.643 --> 00:01:41.800
And the drug worked. 

00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:46.020
Compared to placebo, in terms 
of the percentage of people 

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:48.530
developing diabetes within 
the four years study period, 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.260
fewer people in the drug 
group developed diabetes.

00:01:52.263 --> 00:01:58.430
But diet and exercise 
ALONE worked better. 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.510
The lifestyle intervention reduced 
diabetes incidence by 58%,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.330
compared to only 
31% with the drug. 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.600
The lifestyle intervention was significantly 
more effective than the drug, 

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:12.440
AND had fewer side-effects. 

00:02:12.442 --> 00:02:16.080
More than three quarters of those on the 
drug reported gastrointestinal symptoms, 

00:02:16.087 --> 00:02:20.000
though there was more muscle soreness 
reported in the lifestyle group,

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:24.300
on account they were 
actually exercising. 

00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:29.600
Other studies subsequently 
found the same result:

00:02:29.697 --> 00:02:34.940
non-drug approaches superior to drug-based 
approaches for diabetes prevention. 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.440
And the 50% or so drop in 
risk was not for people 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.560
that actually improved their 
diet and lifestyle, 

00:02:40.565 --> 00:02:43.750
but just for those INSTRUCTED to 
improve their diet and lifestyle, 

00:02:43.754 --> 00:02:46.110
whether or not they actually did it.

00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:51.260
Check this out: this is one of THE most 
famous diabetes prevention studies. 

00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:55.760
500 people with pre-diabetes randomized into 
a lifestyle intervention or control group, 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.520
and during the trial, the risk of
diabetes was reduced by that same 50-60%, 

00:03:01.524 --> 00:03:06.230
but only a fraction of the patients
 met the modest goals. 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.830
Even in the lifestyle intervention group, only 
about a quarter were able to eat enough fiber,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.790
meaning whole plant foods and cut 
down on enough saturated fat, 

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:18.960
which in this country is mostly dairy, 
dessert, chicken, and pork. 

00:03:18.964 --> 00:03:21.280
But they did better than 
the control group, 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.940
and fewer of them developed 
diabetes because of it.

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:30.510
But what if you looked just at the folks 
 that actually made the lifestyle changes, 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.100
met at least 4 out of 5 
of those whimpy goals?

00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:41.180
They had ZERO diabetes. 
None of them got diabetes. 

00:03:41.182 --> 00:03:44.060
A 100% drop in risk.

00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:48.700
Bottomline: type 2 diabetes can be 
prevented by changes in lifestyle 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.860
even in high-risk 
pre-diabetic subjects.

00:03:51.863 --> 00:03:56.050
The fact, then, that type 2 diabetes, 
a largely preventable disorder, 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:03.930
has reached such epidemic proportion 
is a public health humiliation.
