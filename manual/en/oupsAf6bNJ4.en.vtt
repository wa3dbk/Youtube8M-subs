00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.660
Even if I chase after the footprints

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.899
Of your disappearing shadow, I won’t find you.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.750
Though my feelings run off ahead

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.930
To the clicking sounds of your sandals, I can’t catch you.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.640
There’s a spring drizzle again today

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.200
And you must be soaked..

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.609
I can’t protect you, and my impatience builds.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.420
Even if what connection ties us together

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.400
Is some fleeting coincidence,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.250
I just want to be beside you and stare silently at you,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.240
With our fingertips intertwined, indefinitely…

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:38.739
Now I’ll walk down a fork-less road

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.750
Lit by the full moon in the night sky.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.730
I’ll walk down it in full smiles,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.950
If the person I’m waiting for doesn’t come, then until that day…

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.530
Today again I could not see you,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.259
Amidst an overflowing autumn rain..

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.760
The seasons pass by again and again.

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:20.349
Even if what connection ties us together

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.460
Is that well heard of inevitable fate,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.420
I just want to be beside you and stare silently at you,

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.100
With our fingertips intertwined, tightly…

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:49.710
Where are you headed now?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.509
Even if what connection ties us together

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.450
Is some fleeting coincidence,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.370
I just want to be beside you and stare silently at you,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.110
With our fingertips intertwined, indefinitely…
