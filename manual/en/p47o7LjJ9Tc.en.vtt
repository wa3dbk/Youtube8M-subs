00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.050
Okay before we go sailing we’re going to
rig our mainsail and get ready to pull it

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:12.809
up or hoist it. the line we use to pull the
sail up is called a main halyard, the main

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.900
halyard runs up to the very top of the mast,
comes down inside the mast, comes out the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.109
mast and will run to the wench and we’re
going to use that wench to help us pull it

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.140
up. what I want to do when I attach my main
halyard to the head or to the top of the mainsail

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.280
is first look up and make sure that the halyard
isn’t twisted on anything, if it’s wrapped

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.969
around one of the wires that hold the mast
up, which we call a shroud the sail won’t

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.879
go up. so I’ve checked up and made sure
that it’s clear, I’m just going to attach

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:52.370
this shackle which is the metal fitting here
onto the sail. We have names for the corners

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.829
of our sail, the top corner is called the
head of the sail, the forward lower corner

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:07.159
is called the tack and the back lower corner
is the clue. So I get my halyard attached

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.700
to the sail, I just want to pull the slack
or the extra line out so it can’t get itself

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.689
caught on anything before I’m ready to pull
the sail out. And I just pull the sail up

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.369
a little bit until that halyard gets tight
and then we’re almost ready to do a couple

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.100
of things we want to check before we hoist
our sail. This fitting right here is called

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.170
a boom vang; in later courses you’re going
to see that it controls the back edge or the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.420
leach of the mainsail. For right now all we
need to know is that it’s trying to pull

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.149
the boom down and we’re going to try to
pull the boom up when we raise the sail. So

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.820
we want to make sure that our boom vang is
loose, we also want to release our main sheet

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.979
so that the sail can orient itself into the
wind that will make bringing the cell up a

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.170
lot easier. I have some blue straps that are
holding the sail onto the boom. I’m going

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.579
to take these straps off and then we’ll
be able to pull this sail up.
