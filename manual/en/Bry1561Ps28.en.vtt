00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.480
Hi! I am Hillorie Bachmann from HPs worldwide
server product management team and for today’s

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.020
Coffee Coaching session I am going to tell
you about the HP Proliant DL160 Gen9, which

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.880
replaces our current DL360e Gen8.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.660
In addition to being one of the newest generations
of HP ProLiant Servers, the DL160 is an ideal

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.700
platform for virtualizing with Microsoft Windows
Server 2012 R2 Standard or Datacenter editions.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.570
Speaking of Windows Server 2012 R2, How do
you know which edition is the best choice

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.530
for your customers? Well, here are a few quick
pointers.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.199
 First, it depends on your customers virtualization
needs…

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.489
The Standard edition provides two virtual
instances, making it ideal for low density

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.240
or non-virtualized environments

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.450
 For more help determining what edition
is right for your customer, Microsoft provides

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.690
a great comparison of the editions on this
Microsoft website.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.179
Once you have chosen which edition is right
for your customer….

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:10.310
Running Windows Server 2012 R2 on the DL160
provides a combination of performance, manageability,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.009
and storage in a high density form factor
which is ideal for space and budget constrained

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.969
environments such as SMBs and service providers.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.261
So what do SMBs need from a server?
They need an essential combination of 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.889
just what I had mentioned…
performance, manageability, and storage for

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:27.209
their growing IT needs.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.860
Ok, let’s get to the good stuff…
lets, take a look at the features of the DL160

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.300
Gen9 so you can better understand how to help
your customers.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.080
There are many features that contribute to
the DL160’s ability to deliver performance,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.140
manageability and expandability.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.239
First, Memory…
The DL160 offers 16 DIMM slots of HP DDR4

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:51.639
SmartMemory, with built in intelligence to
reduce downtime.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.140
In addition, the DL160 supports up to two
Intel® Xeon® E5-2600v3 processors, offering

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.949
improved performance and efficiency.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.539
Next..Storage
HP SmartDrives continue to deliver optimal

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.719
performance to meet workload requirements.
The DL160 is available with either 4 Large

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:19.619
Form Factor (LFF) or 8 Small Form Factor (SFF)
models with flexibility of a four LFF NHP option.

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:28.149
In addition, the DL160 includes an embedded
SATA HP Dynamic SmartArray B140i Controller

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.150
and a choice of HP SmartArray Controllers
with 12Gb/s SAS technology or HP Smart HBAs

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.620
with high performance SAS connectivity, capable
of running HBA mode or simple RAID. mode.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.460
In addition to rocking bandwidth,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.099
the DL160 also has improved ambient temperature
with HP Extended Ambient Operating Support

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:55.209
(similar to ASHRAE A3 and A4 standards), helping
customers reduce their cooling expenses.

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.060
So whats left? The key to staying ahead of
the game with HPs agile infrastructure management.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.569
 HP OneView provides complete converged
management for automation simplicity across

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.560
servers, storage, and networking. In addition,
customers benefit from an online personalized

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.299
dashboard for converged infrastructure health
monitoring and support management with HP

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.269
Insight Online.
Finally, customers get embedded management

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:27.150
to deploy, monitor, and support their servers
remotely or out of band width with HP iLO. technology.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.599
So whats the net-net!? The DL160 delivers
the right balance of performance, storage,

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.849
reliability, manageability, and efficiency
in a new dense and compact chassis to meet

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.709
the needs of a diverse set of customers and
a wide range of workloads.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.780
