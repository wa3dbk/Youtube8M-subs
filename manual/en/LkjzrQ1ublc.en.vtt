00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.760
The East Coast Tamararo competition
celebrates their 60th anniversary.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.720
At the competition held over
the weekend time was set aside

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.520
to celebrate the occasion

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.360
as teams competed for a place
to represent the East Coast

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.000
at the Nationals
in Rotorua next year.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.840
What better way to celebrate
the 60th anniversary

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.560
of the Waihirere group
and the Tamararo competition,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.240
than a win from
Waihirere themselves.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.600
We sang about the times of old,
and those who have gone before us

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.680
like Tuini and Tamararo.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.040
They were first to win the
Tamararo competition back in 1953.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.200
Last year's winners

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.800
Whangara Mai Tawhiti's performance
reflected on the past

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.880
and merged it with the new.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.080
New styles are emerging and our
group has a lot of youth now

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.880
because most of our experienced
performers have moved on.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.880
Tu Te Manawa Maurea
took third place.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.280
Their performers hold fast
to the teachings of old

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.360
by singing the songs
of their elders.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.440
Te Hokowhitu a Tu were the fourth
and the final group to qualify

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.040
for the National Competition
Te Matatini to be held next year.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.880
Although the movements have
evolved over time,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.320
the sound is still sweet,
and the group lives on.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.640
To celebrate 60 years
of the Tamararo competition,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.160
a dinner was held for those
who paved the way.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.280
Those who started Tamararo were
strong believers in the competition

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.640
and that continues today.
It's outstanding.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.520
I hope the language grows and
a high standard is maintained.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.600
That is the main focus of kapa haka.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.920
The event has survived through the
support of the many generations

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.000
and by the looks of it things
it will survive for many more.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.720
Irena Smith, Te Karere.
