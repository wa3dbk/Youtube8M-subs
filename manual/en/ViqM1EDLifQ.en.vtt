00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.720
Todays’ store shelves are filled with products
where the package or label has been printed

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.040
with flexo printing technology.

00:00:14.823 --> 00:00:17.000
Flexo’s popularity
is increasing

00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:20.200
due to the wide range of substrates
that can be printed,

00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:23.640
due to outstanding
brand color reproduction,

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:26.510
and lower cost
over other technologies,

00:00:26.706 --> 00:00:27.981
even for shorter runs.

00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:31.480
And consistently
excellent print quality.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.875
For the last 2 decades,

00:00:36.113 --> 00:00:37.795
Esko first pioneered

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.635
and then became the leading innovator
in digital flexo plate imaging.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.658
And today,

00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:47.351
Esko is the leading solution provider
for flexo plate imaging solutions.

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:50.636
With years of expertise,
smart software

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:52.680
and leading imaging engines,

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:56.651
it’s no surprise that the majority
of all digital flexo plates

00:00:56.811 --> 00:00:59.960
are imaged on Esko's
plate making devices.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.240
Let us have a look at Esko's
unique Flexo Imaging Technology.

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:08.760
How is a digital flexo plate created?

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.241
After a backexposure,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.400
the digital polymer plate
is loaded into the CDI,

00:01:14.873 --> 00:01:18.093
Esko’s family of digital
flexo imaging devices.

00:01:18.955 --> 00:01:22.571
The laser inside the CDI writes
the printable image on the plate

00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.440
in the desired resolution.

00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:29.720
The plate gets its
UV main exposure

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:32.920
by the UV light-array
inside the CDI.

00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:38.120
The plate is now ready
for development

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:40.680
to get the image elements
in raised relief.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.100
After drying

00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:50.920
the plate is then finished
with UVA and UVC light.

00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:55.560
Then the plate is cut and mounted
onto the printing cylinder,

00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:57.800
ready to go
on the printing press.

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:02.031
The Esko CDI series of
flexo plate imaging devices

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.720
covers all flexo and
letterpress printing applications,

00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:08.581
including labels,
flexible packaging,

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.863
corrugated,
or can decoration.

00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:15.640
There is a CDI designed for
all digital flexo plate types and sizes.

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:19.120
Also flexo sleeves,
used for endless printing,

00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:21.720
are imaged with
the Cantilever CDI.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.840
CDI’s can also be used
to image letterpress plates.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.880
Esko’s flexo imaging solutions

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:31.760
leads the global
flexo imaging industry.

00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:36.098
The CDI, together with smart prepress
and workflow software,

00:02:36.508 --> 00:02:40.688
delivers the best quality and
highest performance digital flexo solutions

00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:44.440
for every flexo and
letterpress printing application.
