When we’re talking about ladders, we’re
talking about stretched or pulled stitches

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.500
when you’re knitting in the round, usually
in a small circumference like a little hat

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.270
or a sock.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.570
And the space between the double pointed needles
or where the magic loop ends, people have

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.350
a tough time getting the tension right when
you’re doing that.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.310
I’m going to show you an example of a ladder
here in just a moment.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.370
But one thing I want to say is if you’re
having difficulties with the tension with

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.280
any knitting, but especially when you’re
knitting a sock or in the round, I recommend

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.510
using wool.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.700
[laughs] It’s amazing how many things get
worked out when you’re using wool.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.550
If you’re getting ladders in your socks,
and you’re using a superwash wool yarn,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.489
as soon as you wash those socks most of the
problems disappear.

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.390
So I guess my point is you’re probably a
better knitter than you think you are, if

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.610
you’re trying to avoid getting ladders in
your work and you’re working with something

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.210
like a cotton fiber, a cotton yarn.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.930
Anyway, let’s take a look.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.250
I have this little sample here, and I have
worked up a really good ladder.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.780
Now I’m knitting this small tube, in the
round, on magic loop, and the spot between

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:25.040
my two needles, where the cord is, I have
really stretched out stitches there, see that?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.880
And I’ve worked the same thing on the other
side where the magic loop ends.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.520
And what we want – here’s the current
sock project I’m knitting.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.490
And I’m also doing this on magic loop.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.090
We want it to be just smooth, nice knitting
where the magic loop ends or between the double

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.090
pointed needles.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.570
And so, that’s what we’re going to talk
about now.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.810
I chose to demonstrate this using magic loop,
because magic loop is where you can have the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.270
biggest problem, because the stitch that you
last knit is on the cord.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.280
Let me show you what I mean.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.740
I’m getting myself into position to work
this first stitch.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.549
And this is where the problem happens, right
here.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.000
Now, if I pull, I put my needle in, and I’m
thinking “oh, I don’t want a ladder!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.030
I’m going to pull this stitch so hard!”

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.590
Okay, what we’ve done there, I’ve pulled
the stitch hard, and I’ve made this last

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.040
way way too tight.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.819
Because there’s no needle there – it’s
on the cord.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.890
And the cord’s really much smaller than
the needle.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.040
So when I pull that tight made that stitch
tiny, and I pull that stitch through and finish

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.540
up and go on knitting, and it’s just intuitive
to think that pulling it tightly would make

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.209
you avoid these ladders.

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.769
But both leaving it too tight, and leaving
it too loose will create the ladder.

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.769
So, um, if you’re instinct is to pull really
tight, loosen up.

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.090
Make sure that when you’re doing magic loop,
that when you put the needle in and you go

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.439
to wrap the needle, I’m going to loosen
this up back the way it should be, that you’re

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.609
just using good tension not crazy tight tension.

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:09.189
I want to keep this stitch loose enough as
if there was a needle in there and it wasn’t

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.400
on the cord.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.589
So just gentle, nice tension would fix that
up, without pulling too tight.

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:18.909
Now if you are having a problem, and this
is more common with double pointed needles,

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:25.139
where things are flopping around and you are
leaving it too loose, you want to make sure

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.249
that when you are ready to pull that stitch
through, that the two stitches are very close

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:31.529
to each other.

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:37.079
If you are leaving this stitch way over here,
and wrapping way over here, you can see, that

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.719
is an obvious way to get a ladder.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:42.110
When there is huge distance between this stitch
and this stitch.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.719
So if you pull it up tightly enough so that
the two stitches are close together, you pull

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.909
it through, that will help you avoid ladders
as well.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:58.029
Okay, so we’ve covered the techniques in
how to avoid ladders, but I guess something

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.700
that I really want you to understand.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.900
If you’re experiencing ladders and your
first instinct is to just pull that stitch

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.260
so tightly between the needles, you probably
need to loosen up to avoid ladders.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.879
If your instinct is just to work loosely with
even loose tension, you probably need to tighten

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:15.879
up.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.040
Ladders can happen either with too much tension
or not enough tension.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.930
So, really just practicing good tension all
the time will help you avoid ladders, but

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.000
try loosening up if your instinct is has been
to pull tight, and try tightening up if your

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.020
instinct has been to leave it loose, that
should help you.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.460
Good luck.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.690
