00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:27.740
Every now and then a game comes along that
is just so unlike anything else that it demands

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:37.809
your time and attention and Sound Shapes is
one of those games.

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.500
The game is truly amazing in both its concept
and execution.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.700
The game could be called a 2D platformer,
but there is really so much more going on

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.030
here to just label it that, is just not fair.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.659
You play as a small little blob, and your
goal is to make it to the record player at

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:58.659
the end.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:05.530
You can stick to walls, or remove your stickiness
to move faster, making for an intuitive control

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.530
scheme.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.479
Along the way, there are jumps, obstacles,
enemies and hazards that prevent your progress.

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.950
But like a great road trip, it’s not the
destination that’s important but rather

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.780
the journey itself.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.520
The main goal is to make music.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.709
You do this by collecting music notes that
are scattered throughout the levels.

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:30.420
The music starts off very simple but as you
collect more and more notes, you add more

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.229
and more to the music, until you have a full-blown
song going that you feel like you created.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.970
You can actually make it to the end of the
level without collecting a single note, so

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:51.550
how the music turns out is completely up to
you.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.429
Everything is connected to the music, even
down to the levels.

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.160
The levels will shift and change, moving to
the music.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.409
Objects and enemy movements are completely
to the beat, which helps you time your jumps.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.319
But there are also so many other interesting
ways the music is used.

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.370
Some levels will have the lyrics appear on
screen to form a platform then go away when

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.659
the words do.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.560
It really makes you feel like you are playing
through the music itself.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.129
And it also helps that the music is so good,
with contributions from a number of artists

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.780
including Beck, deadmau5, and I Am Robot and
Proud.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.319
Each ones levels, or album, feel completely
different from one another's and work perfectly

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:43.630
with the music.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.650
And if you see yourself as a musical genius,
you can create your own levels with the very

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.280
deep level creator, and then publish them
to the world.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.069
You can also play levels created by others,
so the game is constantly growing as more

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.279
and more levels are created.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.200
Sound Shapes is just like the music itself.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.040
It is so totally unlike anything else while
also feeling familiar and approachable.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.670
If you are into music, platformers, or anything
creative, you own it to yourself to play this

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.790
game.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:29.480
Words don’t do it justice, so just let the
music speak for itself.
