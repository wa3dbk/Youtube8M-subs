00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.620
Hi guys, the frenchy here, welcome to this
first episode of Focus.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.400
Today we ll make sticky in the micro wave
as seen in the 30 minutes Paris Bangkok stew

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.400
video

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.520
Click here if you wanna see it.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:22.410
First, you 'll need to grab some glutinous
rice also called sticky rice, sweet rice or

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.410
waxy rice

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.260
Here's what it looks like uncooked.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.310
The grains could be either long or short,
so what you're looking for really is a label

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.900
sweet , glutinous, sticky on the pack of rice.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.130
Even if we are not soaking the rice for 3
hours as the classic method requires, it still

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.949
needs to be washed.

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.899
This will remove the starch from the rice.

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.520
So that you don't get a mushy paste at the
end.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.140
When rinsing the rice, use a large bowl that
can hold a great amount of water.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.920
It will be faster, and you won't loose grains
in the sink while stirring.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.630
With your figers, mix thorougly.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.170
The water should become cloudy really fast.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.439
If you empty the bowl by slowly tilting it,
rice grains shouldn't fall off.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.810
Usually I reapeat this rinsing process 3 times.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.640
If it's becoming harder and harder to get
that water cloudy, you're on the right track.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.299
At the end, you should be able to clearly
see the rice on the bottom, through the water.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.319
Transfer the rice in a microwave-safe dish.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:29.649
Add hot water one finger above the rice level,
like so.

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.119
You can add a knob of butter.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.439
I even find it better with salty butter.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.030
It gives the rice an addicting taste.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.619
Cover it up with a microwave safe plate.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.310
This lid is here to steam the rice.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.499
I am placing it right way up, so that droplets
will fall back in the center, not on the edges.

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:54.630
The cooking process is made of three successive
period in the microwave at 850 Watts.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.999
This is the power at which I have done my
tests, and for which I am giving you measurements.

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:01.060
First one lasts 7 minutes.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.849
It 's called the "main cooking".

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:08.270
At the end of it, gently mix the rice grains
upside down with a fork.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.700
Second lasts 4 minutes.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.550
It's here for "equalizing cooking"

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.250
Top, Bottom, Edges, Center...

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.980
Every grain should be cooked the same way
by now.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.410
Third period lasts 3 minutes.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.610
It's the "finishing cooking", where the rice
actually become sticky.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.660
You don't have to mix it at the end of this
stage.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.140
The sticky rice is ready.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.740
If you don't want to eat it right away, let
it covered till you need it.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.250
The rice is fluffy and sticky, but it does
not stick to your fingers.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.750
That's the beauty of it.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.080
Take a bit in your hand and gently roll it
like a meat ball.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.850
Then use it to dip in sauce.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.290
It will act as a sponge, sucking out all the
liquid, becoming by the way the most favorful

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.790
rice meatball ever.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.450
Well that's it !

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.690
