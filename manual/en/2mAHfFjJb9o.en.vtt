00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.730
The rotator cuff is a network
of small and large muscles

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.290
that help move the upper
arm and stabilize the ball

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.200
of the shoulder in the socket.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.620
Because of the joint's
complexity and extensive range

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.770
of motion, tears in the muscles
or tendons of the rotator cuff

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.520
are common, and can lead to
significant pain and weakness

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.700
in the shoulder.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.619
Often these tears don't
heal on their own,

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.160
and because the
shoulder is something

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.990
that we rely on to perform
most of our daily tasks,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.450
rotator cuff tears can be
very frustrating injuries

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.680
to live with.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.654
Recent research has
shown that as we age,

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:31.320
the local stem cells
that would normally

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.480
heal a rotator cuff tear don't
work as well as they should.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.350
In addition, poor
blood supply can also

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.050
make tissues more fragile.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.020
Because of these factors,
roughly 40,000 rotator cuff

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.400
surgeries are performed the
United States each year.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.750
In this procedure, the
surgeon sews the tear either

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.840
through an arthroscopic opening,
or through an open incision.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.865
These surgeries require
significant downtime

00:00:51.865 --> 00:00:53.960
and painful
rehabilitation to regain

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.080
strength and range of motion.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.630
Sadly, some studies show that
6 in 10 rotator cuff surgery

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.130
patients don't fully
heal afterwards.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.739
In fact, a US government
sponsored investigation

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.830
into health care quality
recently reviewed

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.700
more than 150 published
studies and concluded

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.890
that there was no solid
evidence that rotator cuff

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.630
surgery benefited patients
anymore than no surgery at all.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.560
But there is good news for those
suffering from a rotator cuff

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.190
injury, and it doesn't
involve surgery.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.180
Regenexx utilizes
your own stem cells

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.310
to help repair
rotator cuff tears

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.030
using a minimally invasive
and ultrasound guided

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.140
injection precisely into
the torn areas of the muscle

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.070
and tendon.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.750
The results from our
treatment registry

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.780
show that more than
70% of patients

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.930
who received the groundbreaking
Regenexx rotator cuff procedure

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.190
noted improvements
of 70% of more.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.400
In our clinical experience,
Regenexx patients

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.730
benefit from a quicker
recovery and can get back

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.890
to doing things they love
faster than those who

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.120
undergo traditional surgeries.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.930
So if you or someone you know
has a rotator cuff injury,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.310
consider Regenexx, the
nonsurgical alternative

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.885
that uses the healing power
of your own stem cells

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:01.390
to put you back on the
path to an active and pain

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.230
free lifestyle.
