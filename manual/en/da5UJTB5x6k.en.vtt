00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.460
Welcome to San Francisco, known
for its innovations in cars,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.295
technology, and, now, toast.

00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:11.067
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.902 --> 00:00:18.402
Hey, man.

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:18.891
How you doing?

00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:19.380
Steve.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.690
Steve.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.190
Josie.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.300
Yeah.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.620
Thanks for having us.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.820
Yeah.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.020
Good to see you too, bud.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.710
This is Noah.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.210
Yeah.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.440
Hey, Noah.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.650
So this is your shop?

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.270
Yeah, yeah.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.340
This is The Mill.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.275
You own this place?

00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:27.775
Yeah.

00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:30.865
I own it in collaboration
with Four Barrel Coffee.

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:33.790
We heard that there's
some good toast here.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.290
There is.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.360
But it's not cheap.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.860
Yeah.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.200
It's very-- it's very expensive.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.700
Cause at the diner, they
just give you the toast.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.521
Yeah.

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:42.020
No.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.310
But this is--

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.600
We don't do that.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.558
This is another level.

00:00:43.558 --> 00:00:44.590
You want to make bread?

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.670
Should we make bread?

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.777
So this is the namesake
of the place-- the mill.

00:00:47.777 --> 00:00:48.485
Don't touch that.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:48.984
OK.

00:00:48.984 --> 00:00:50.767
Put this on.

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:52.600
It seems like a lot
of work for some toast.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.436
Yeah.

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:54.390
Turn around here.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.890
OK.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.640
So you're gonna
pour that in there.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.640
So we got to turn it on.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.570
But when we turn it on, the
whole thing's gonna, like,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.910
jerk.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.250
Perfect.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.600
Perfect.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.680
OK?

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.710
So-- no, hold on.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.800
Hold on.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.280
Hold on.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.779
OK.

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:06.104
Ready?

00:01:06.104 --> 00:01:06.604
OK.

00:01:06.604 --> 00:01:09.080
Now, quick, turn that wheel.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.580
Right there.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.080
OK.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.068
Now we're talking.

00:01:11.068 --> 00:01:13.796
That's bringing the mill stones
closer together so that we can

00:01:13.796 --> 00:01:17.020
get a finer grind on the flour.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.508
There you go.

00:01:18.508 --> 00:01:19.400
Can we taste it?

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.292
It's good, right?

00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:26.212
No.

00:01:26.212 --> 00:01:27.920
I think that we have
to wait [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.910
So now what do we do?

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.230
So this is a rye starter.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.750
So this all just fresh,
stone-ground rye.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.771
Now you do you
catch your own yeast?

00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:36.270
Yeah.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.050
Yeah.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.675
Yeah, we actually-- the wild
yeast population in this bakery

00:01:40.675 --> 00:01:42.860
is flourishing.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.810
Now we're gonna
pour in some water.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.280
And now you're gonna
get to knead it.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.760
Why is sour dough so
special in San Francisco?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.790
It turns out that a
particular strain of bacteria

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.860
was discovered here
in San Francisco.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.760
So they named it
after San Francisco.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.460
They gave it the name
Lactobacillus Sanfranciscensis.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.465
You just made
that up right now.

00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:06.380
I think.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.880
Kind of.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.379
OK.

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:07.890
Yeah.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.150
So this is top secret stuff.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.021
This is where we proof
all of our bread.

00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:12.520
Wonderful.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.020
Yeah, OK.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.160
So we'll go take a look.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.240
Yeah.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.948
Just take a look.

00:02:14.948 --> 00:02:16.810
And how often do
you proof the bread

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.615
when you check the-- Josie.

00:02:21.615 --> 00:02:23.070
That's not funny, all right?

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.819
And I didn't know where
you were actually.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.840
Wow.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.339
Yeah.

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.374
Gonna see just a finished loaf.

00:02:32.374 --> 00:02:33.790
Or should pull it
out with a peel?

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.520
Should I do it this way?

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.978
I mean, this is
totally ridiculous.

00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:36.782
Wow.

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:38.051
Nice.

00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:38.550
Look out.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.550
It's hot.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.191
It's delicious.

00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:44.107
That smells delicious.

00:02:44.107 --> 00:02:44.340
Yeah.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.880
Thank you.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.090
Yeah.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.006
Let's make some toast.

00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:48.274
So we got to
preheat the toaster.

00:02:48.274 --> 00:02:49.092
Really?

00:02:49.092 --> 00:02:50.050
So there's your toast.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.325
Yeah.

00:02:50.325 --> 00:02:50.600
--OK.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.480
Grab that butter.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.080
And get it all the
way out to the edges.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.950
And don't be too rough
to the bread here.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.440
Brown sugar?

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.130
That's brown sugar
and cinnamon, yeah.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.059
More-- you want, like,
three times that much.

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.600
There you go.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.390
That's it.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.890
OK.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.800
Now we're going to finish it off
with a little sprinkling of sea

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.070
salt.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.611
I like that.

00:03:05.611 --> 00:03:06.740
Yeah?

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.782
Perfect.

00:03:07.782 --> 00:03:09.240
You got-- you got
a toast order up.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.460
Here.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.501
Let's get out of her way.

00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:11.269
Don't mind us.

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.060
Just do your thing.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.260
No, no, no.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.580
Don't-- don't let him make it.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.080
Carla.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.900
Number four.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.970
I'm sorry?

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:17.470
Oh.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.150
Nutella?

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.992
What happened?

00:03:18.992 --> 00:03:19.950
I got the order wrong.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.550
What's up?

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.150
She wanted Nutella.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.650
Oh.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.200
Really?
