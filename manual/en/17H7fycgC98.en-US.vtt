00:00:18.102 --> 00:00:20.078
If I would die-

00:00:20.078 --> 00:00:23.613
-I'll never forget you!

00:00:23.613 --> 00:00:24.766
Love, Cruelty

00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:28.553
We're just killing him!

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.616
Let me help him!

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:31.708
NO!

00:00:31.952 --> 00:00:33.621
Whatever happens-

00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:35.121
-he'll be satisfied!

00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:37.309
I'm sure!

00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:38.940
Gou!

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.101
Be serious!

00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:41.639
He's gonna die!

00:00:42.593 --> 00:00:45.588
If he'd crazed in love-

00:00:45.588 --> 00:00:51.928
-that's the best end of life as a man!

00:00:51.928 --> 00:00:55.598
I don't want him to die!

00:00:56.344 --> 00:00:57.497
Satoshi...

00:00:57.928 --> 00:00:59.639
He won't die!

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:00.646
She will!

00:01:00.646 --> 00:01:04.790
She'll come for sure!

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.498
You have to face the fact!

00:01:06.498 --> 00:01:08.952
It's already over 2 pm!

00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:16.768
Nonsense!

00:01:16.768 --> 00:01:18.998
Don't talk nonsense!

00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:22.893
What the heck...

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:28.396
It's over.

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:42.366
Hey!

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:48.702
Sakura! Finally!

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.636
Here she come!

00:01:54.255 --> 00:01:55.754
How come?

00:01:56.307 --> 00:01:58.030
Masahito is with him!

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.647
Masahito?

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:11.250
Sakura?

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.573
Satoshi, stop fooling around!

00:02:15.263 --> 00:02:16.863
Don't say that word!

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.087
Gou!

00:02:25.356 --> 00:02:26.525
Sakura.

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:28.948
I don't care.

00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:32.295
I don't care about myself.

00:02:33.142 --> 00:02:34.265
Because-

00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:37.695
-you gave me a chance to talk.

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:43.517
I want to keep this memory in myself.

00:02:44.356 --> 00:02:45.217
You idiot.

00:02:45.462 --> 00:02:49.058
I still can't believe I'm talking with you!

00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:51.306
You changed my life!

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:52.581
Satoshi.

00:02:52.974 --> 00:02:56.715
I was glad when you said you love me.

00:02:57.308 --> 00:02:58.846
Sakura!

00:02:59.841 --> 00:03:04.259
But I was mad after that.

00:03:04.802 --> 00:03:06.309
Do you know why?

00:03:07.277 --> 00:03:10.650
The fact you love me and-

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.971
-your desire for death have no connection with me.

00:03:15.484 --> 00:03:17.641
But you said you'll die.

00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:21.624
It doesn't make sense!

00:03:22.097 --> 00:03:23.912
You said like this.

00:03:24.188 --> 00:03:27.008
'If I can't be with you, I'll die'

00:03:30.953 --> 00:03:35.395
That was a kind of self-satisfaction.

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:38.986
You're fooling around-

00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:40.416
-and wasting time but-

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:46.004
I never had such a foolish and wonderful proposal.

00:03:47.276 --> 00:03:49.637
But I don't understand mens' virtue-

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:53.854
-so I can't be with you.

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.154
I'm so sorry.

00:04:00.436 --> 00:04:01.959
Sorry.

00:04:03.144 --> 00:04:04.728
I'm sorry.

00:04:07.775 --> 00:04:11.816
Sorry, sorry...

00:04:22.525 --> 00:04:23.940
I'm sorry too.

00:04:48.411 --> 00:04:49.734
Get me out of here.

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:53.042
Help me.

00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:56.686
Aren't you gonna die!?

00:04:57.164 --> 00:04:58.386
Of course he won't!

00:04:58.401 --> 00:05:00.108
He had just turned down by her!

00:05:00.286 --> 00:05:02.824
JUST DIE AS A MAN!

00:05:02.826 --> 00:05:04.692
Are you an idiot!?

00:05:04.692 --> 00:05:05.615
Satoshi!

00:05:05.994 --> 00:05:07.670
Help me.

00:05:08.777 --> 00:05:11.311
My plan's working out.

00:05:11.931 --> 00:05:12.423
What?

00:05:13.082 --> 00:05:16.080
My plan's on the way still.

00:05:17.123 --> 00:05:18.884
To be continued

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:21.113
Next Episode

00:05:23.348 --> 00:05:25.298
Hey, Masahito.

00:05:25.298 --> 00:05:28.194
His proposal had been turned down-

00:05:28.388 --> 00:05:30.810
My plan's working out.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.696
-but he said 'the plan's on his way'

00:05:33.725 --> 00:05:35.820
What do you mean, 'working out'?

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.887
Satoshi's 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:42.957
The shape of love began to appear.

00:05:43.474 --> 00:05:44.566
Hey!?

00:05:44.612 --> 00:05:47.400
Episode 6

00:05:48.545 --> 00:05:50.694
You guys had gone away so-

00:05:50.694 --> 00:05:53.227
Tangled-Up-Love

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:54.836
he died.
