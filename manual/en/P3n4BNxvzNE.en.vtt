Mask Review.

If you ever want to treat wrinkles, acne and
pigmentation problem with absolutely zero

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.620

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.220
What is LED light therapy?

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.030
LED therapy uses different colored lights
to remedy skin problems.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.950
They are red, blue and green.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.950
Red light

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.250
The benefits of red light are 100% proven
by NASA scientific studies.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.280
It can reduce redness and inflammation, increase
skin healing, boost collagen production and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.020
repair acne lesions.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.130
It is very popular for treating fine lines
and wrinkles, and can also reduce large pores.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.340
You will notice skin plumping effect with
just several treatments

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.340
Blue light

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.680
Blue light can kill acne bacteria beneath
your skin with absolutely no skin irritation.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.060
This will minimize future breakouts tremendously.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.410
Blue light is well documented to reduce 90%
of bacteria in just 3 days.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.660
Green Light

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.060
Green light targets the pigment cells under
your skin.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.310
It treats hyper-pigmentation by breaking down
and decreasing the formation of excess melanin.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.920
It is perfect for fading freckles, age spots,
sun spots, brown patches, liver spots and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.920
scars.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.590
Why LED therapy is superior?

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.750
Many people use topical treatments for their
skin conditions, but most products can not

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.170
penetrate deeply into the skin.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.560
Therefore they are not 100% effective.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.530
Also topical treatments cause of many painful
side effects such as inflammation, Redness,

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.780
irritation, dry skin, wrinkles, premature
aging and sun sensitivity.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.580
On the other hand, LED light therapy is safe
for all skin type and has absolutely no side

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.580
effects.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.760
It is 100% painless and will not damage or
irritate your skin.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.050
How long does LED Mask last and what about
warranty?

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.600
LED light should last at least 10 years.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.090
There is also a 1 year warranty for your led
mask to fix or replace your item for free.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.110
