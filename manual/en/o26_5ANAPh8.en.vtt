00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.680
it was over in a matter of days

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.290
everything we ever held dear to our lives

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.280
was lost

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.440
You haven't lost everything

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.320
take another look around your Wez

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.360
There's three people her that believe in you and trust in your every command.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.910
You've brought us through some of the most dangerous terrain around and kept us all alive.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.920
Tthe aliens... The Kryslums

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.210
emerged from their hiding and
claimed ourplanet for themselves

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.190
Aww very sad very sad.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.780
Look.. I told you, aliens

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.460
They've captured everybody. Look..

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.120
Hrrrgg! You disgust me you pathetic humans

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.410
we know they are here. We detected their party moving this way.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.760
where are they?

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.680
Why don't you just leave us alone?

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.190
Millions were killed

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.490
and many more we enslaved

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.190
as the terraforming process threw us violently into a period that would be known as the Black Earth

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.440
You just said they've been doing it for thousands of years

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.870
hundreds, thousands what's the difference this is a prison planet world lost

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.890
they're not here you ugly mutants

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.810
SILENCE!

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.780
On the brink of extinction and driven deep underground

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.480
we uncovered the ancient instructions for the N.O.H.A.Gen space station

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.560
left by our alien ancestors the Delphoids

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.480
I knew it. I knew it... Fergus, the Delphoids, the same.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.400
When the NOHAGen was destroyed, it seemed all hope was lost.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.180
What's that?
Trouble!

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.160
C'mon

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.160
How do we get across this?
We don't!

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.140
GO!

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.080
If you wanna live today you'll follow me

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.720
NOOOOOOO!

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.510
I think we should go with him Wez

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.880
Well if he makes one wrong move, kill him.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.660
ARRRRRRGH!

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.840
Quick, they've found him. Get him inside.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.540
C'mon move. Everybody move it.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.020
It appeared that the tyranny of the Kryslum empire had won

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.100
and like the dinosaurs before us, we were forced to give way to evolution
