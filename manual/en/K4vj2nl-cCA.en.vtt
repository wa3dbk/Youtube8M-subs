00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.560
The annual migration of Snow geese, as far as sheer numbers go, has to be one of the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.580
greatest wildlife spectacles in North America.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.140
They travel and forage in massive noisy flocks often numbering the tens of thousands.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.739
I had the opportunity to photograph Snow geese over the course of a week as they stopped

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.790
to rest and feed in the agricultural fields
in New York's Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.060
Snow geese follow a yearly cycle that takes
the thousands of miles.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.010
From wintering areas in coastal marshes and
interior wetlands in the United States and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.130
their summer breeding grounds on the tundra
of the Alaskan and Canadian arctic.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.080
During the winter and migration, large flocks
typically roost at night on lakes and in wetlands.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.860
They make daily forays to nearby fields where
they feed on roots and un-harvested grain.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.440
One morning as I was watching a group foraging,
thousands of additional geese began to arrive

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.280
in large, noisy waves from their night roost
on nearby lakes.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:55.359
At times the sky above was filled with birds arriving and slowly sailing down to join the flock.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.350
It was mind blowing to see them streaming
for over an hour.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.580
The flocks swelled to close to one hundred
thousand birds.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.140
When you're close to one of these flocks you
can't help but to get caught up in the excitement

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.740
of migration

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.479
You can actually feel the restlessness of
the birds to move farther north.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.579
I'd been there for four days and suddenly
some unseen cue told the birds it was time

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.110
to move on.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.720
I watched as they excitedly lifted off and
continued on their long journey.
