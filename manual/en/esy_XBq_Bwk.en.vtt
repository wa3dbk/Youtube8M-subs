00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.139
SCREEN PRINTING ON CERAMIC TILES

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.710
The combination of screen-printing and ceramics
combines two art processes in one.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.860
The tiles can be created and used as individual
objects or combined with other tiles for collaborative

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.970
mural projects.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.890
Screen Printed ceramic tiles are an exciting
medium that opens new avenues of expression.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.269
Materials needed include the following:
Speedball 10” x 12” screen with 10xx mesh

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.880
Speedball large screen hinges
3/16” foam board

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.290
4” x 4” bisque fired porcelain tiles
Speedball Diazo photo emulsion kit

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.500
Speedball Underglazes
Speedball Clear glaze

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.340
6” Speedball squeegee
Water supply

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.090
Sponge
Towel

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.190
Masking tape
Craft knife

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.570
Water supply
Electric kiln or Fire finished tiles found

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.570
at your local Ceramic shop

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.570
Optional materials include:
- Speedball Screen filler and Drawing fluid

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.570
- Brushes

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.499
First, a frame needs to be created to hold
the tiles while printing.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:11.899
Carefully trace the tile onto a piece of foamboard
locating the tile about 3” from one end

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.950
and 3” from each of the sides.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.420
Cut this window opening out with a craft knife.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.439
The unique positioning of the window allows
part of the board to extend beyond the screen

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.920
frame for ease in positioning.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.850
You can cut two small semicircles along the
side edges of the window to facilitate removing

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.610
the tile once it is printed.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.079
In preparing an image for this project several
factors should be kept in mind.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.740
The nature of underglaze particulates may
clog a finer mesh screen.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.130
Using Speedball® 8XX mesh screen minimizes
clogging, but still affords excellent resolution

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.049
of image.

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.469
Create your screen art by one of the four
methods we have reviewed.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:02.030
For this demonstration we have created a design
using the photo emulsion method.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.689
If using a 4” x 4” tile, scale the image
to be a bit smaller to accommodate the slight

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.030
rounding at the tile’s edges.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.319
Attach the screen to the hinges and tighten
to prevent slippage.

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.079
Register your screen to the jig that will
hold the tiles.

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.250
You are now ready to print.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.670
Make sure that the screen is kept lightly
moist with a slightly damp clean sponge at

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.090
all times.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.310
Print the image using Speedball underglazes
onto the tile, removing each from the stationary

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.409
jig carefully - so as not to smear the wet
underglaze or shift the taped position of

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:39.880
the jig.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:50.569
You can repeat the process for subsequent
glazes if printing colors in registration.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:03:01.659
CLEANUP: UNDERGLAZE FROM SCREEN
Wash with warm water IMMEDIATELY after the

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.920
last tile is pulled.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.319
Use warm water and a soft brush.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.609
Should glaze dry in the screen, spray with
a household window cleaner, and rub with a

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:11.730
lint-free cloth.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.780
When glaze is removed, wash with a mix of
warm water and dishwasher detergent using

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.439
a soft brush.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.069
Then rinse with warm water.

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.680
FIRING THE TILE

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.140
One firing is possible by applying 2 to 3
smooth flowing coats of clear glaze with Speedball

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.780
Brush-Tools.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.250
Once the underglaze is completely dry, fire
the tile as directed to Cone 05 – 06.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.250
For best results, fire the tiles with only
the underglazes applied.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.250
After properly fired and cooled, coat the
tiles with a clear glaze and fire again according

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.250
to the glaze specifications.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.840
This will seal the entire surface of the tile.
