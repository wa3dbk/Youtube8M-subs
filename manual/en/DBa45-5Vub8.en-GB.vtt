Hello and welcome to Cupcake Addiction's Christmas
Tree Cakepop Tutorial where I'll be showing

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.420
you how to make this great Christmas tree
cakepop. I've made this demonstration one

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.310
here in a white chocolate coating so it's
a white Christmas tree cakepop.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.829
The one we're making today is a green Christmas
tree cakepop so you can choose your design

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.920
Christmas theme.
Tools and equipment that I will be using today:

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.670
I have just a standard pair of scissors and
a snap lock bag.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.770
I'm using a paper straw instead of a lollipop
stick today. I just like the colors in it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.140
but you can use a regular lollipop stick.
If you're going to get a paper straw, get

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.020
a nice thick heavy duty one.
I've got a couple of cocktail sticks.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.700
I've got a pre-rolled cakepop ball. If you
don't have a great recipe and tutorial for

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.600
your cakepops to get them to this stage ready
for decorating, make sure you head to our

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.050
channel. We've got a really good recipe and
tutorial.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.320
I've got some rainbow choc chips, they're
called here. They're basically just a candy-covered

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.689
chocolate chip. If you don't have this where
you are, you can also use Nerds or any kind

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.909
of sprinkle just to make our little Christmas
lights.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.780
I've got a little bit of melted white chocolate.
I've got some silver sanding sugar. Now I

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.860
only use silver sanding sugar on the white
Christmas version so you only need that if

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.070
you're making the white Christmas. If you're
doing the green Christmas, you don't need

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.320
it.
I've also got a little bit of orange sanding

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.650
sugar.
And I've got just some Christmas stars. I

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.630
couldn't find any yellow so I'm going with
red and white today.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.370
I also got my green melted candy wafers and
I've mixed those with a bit of Copha just

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.560
to thin them out.
Now firstly we're going to take the cakepop

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.170
ball. And to make our cone shape, I'm just
going to rock it back and forth in my palms

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.910
and I'm just going to make it into a nice
cone. Don't worry if it cracks a little bit.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.330
It's all going to be covered in chocolate.
But do try and keep it together as much as

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.580
you can. And I like to just give it a bit
of a [heat] on the table, I guess, just to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.130
give it a nice flat bottom. So that one's
going to go to the fridge for about 5 to 7

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.619
minutes. You don't want it to be completely
firm. You just want it to be firm enough that

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.650
it's not going to fall off your lollipop stick,
so just 5 to 7 minutes in the fridge.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.150
I've got one here that's already been refrigerated
so we don't have to wait for this one to fridge.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.760
So I'm going to take my paper straw or your
lollipop stick. Dip it about a centimeter

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.370
into those candy melts and pop it in about
a centimeter into the way of the bottom of

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.950
that cakepop cone. I'm going to let that seal
set just a little bit.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.161
Now as I mentioned if you are doing the white
chocolate version of this, obviously you will

00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:46.040
replace the green candy melts with just plain
white chocolate.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.860
Now do wait for that seal to be completely
set. I'm going to be a little bit naughty

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.730
and I think I'm going to cheat and just risk
dipping it anyway. But if you don't wait for

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.910
the seal to set completely, you do run the
risk of your cakepop falling off into your

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.980
candy melts. So let's see how I go.
To dip your cakepop, a bit straight in, tilt

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.601
it from side to side until those candy melts
cover up that seal and lift it off. You'll

00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:19.290
notice the candy melts are quite thick. Now
here you want to work quite quickly so I'm

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.810
going to take the cocktail stick or the toothpick,
and I'm just going to just dab it into the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.459
chocolate all the way around. This is going
to make the, I guess, the bristle effect or

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.420
the tree branch tree leaf effect of our Christmas
tree. You don't have to be too neat about

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.900
it. [It's] going to have some sprinkles and
other bits and pieces going on there.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.790
Alright, now once you're happy with that.
Like I said, just a bit of texture in there

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.220
is really all you want. Take some of your
lovely Christmas lights and just sprinkle

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.650
them on. Now I've done a bit of a tinsel effect,
I suppose you call it. So I want to make sure

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.940
that I'm leaving a bit of path for my tinsel
to wrap through. So I'm going to take it (Inaudible

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.230
04:04) this section. Just move your lights
around so that you can kind of visualize where

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:18.709
you're going to pop your tinsel on the way
on its way down the tree.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.130
You can just throw these little chocolate
chips on there but I kind of like to position

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.160
them a little bit better. I like to pick my
colors so I don't end up with too much of

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:37.550
the same color in one location.
If you love our tutorials, make sure that

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.900
you subscribe to our channel. We've got lots
of Christmas stuff coming up at the moment

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.060
and we do upload 2 or 3 times a week all year
round so you'll get lots and lots of great

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.389
cakepop, cupcake and cake decorating tips
and ideas. Now you should have something that

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.419
looks like this.
Now is about the time to pop the star on top.

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.000
So just take your star and just sit it on
top. If in any stage that candy melt does

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.880
completely dry and you can't, I suppose, just
stick your lights or anything straight into

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.270
it, just dab whatever it is that you're trying
to attach back into that green candy melt

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.930
and just... I guess it will just act like
a little bit of glue. So we're going to let

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.900
that completely set and then we're going to
come back and do that final tinsel detail.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.570
Alright, so that one's pretty well set. I'm
going to take that white chocolate. Now of

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.060
course, you could leave your green Christmas
tree at that stage if you want to. I like

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.370
to always take it just a little bit over the
top. So I'm going to just put some of that

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.870
white chocolate into the zip lock bag, making
sure to close the zip lock bag. Push it all

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:51.919
down to the corner. And I'm just going to
snip off just a little corner. No exact measurement

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.980
for the corner. It is just going to be to
make our, I guess kind of, tinsel area.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:04.430
Now I'm going to take that cakepop and I'm
just going to run some white chocolate just

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:16.110
along that sort of a line that I said we should
leave to give it a just a strand of a tinsel.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:28.910
Pop another one just down here. Just to make
our Christmas tree look a little bit more

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:36.110
festive.
Alright, now once you've got your tinsel,

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.539
just take those, that orange sanding sugar,
or whatever [color] sanding sugar you like

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:46.130
really and just sprinkle it on that white
chocolate. Because you've let that green tree

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.010
completely dry, it won't be sticking to the
green tree. It's just sitting on there and

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:56.490
we'll just use a paintbrush or your finger
or something just to wipe it off or whisk

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:08.850
it away. Now you should have something that
looks like that.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.900
As I mentioned, you can just use a paintbrush.
Wait 'til that white chocolate's dry if you

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:19.300
can. I'm not going to just for time sake.
But just use a little paintbrush or something

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:25.800
along those lines, a little new makeup brush
or your fingers just to push away any of that

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.669
extra orange sanding sugar.
And if you like it better without the tinsel,

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:34.710
don't do the tinsel. It's just a bit of an
option extra.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:40.370
So here you have your completed, ready to
go, green Christmas tree. You can do a white

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.960
Christmas and green Christmas. You can do
one or the other depending on where you leave.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.790
Either way, I think you'll agree, they're
a great little Christmas cakepop. Thanks vey

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:48.630
much for watching.
