do you have moss on your walkway

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.450
I will show you how to keep it under control

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.580
first thing you want to do is

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.270
take a broom and sweep it quickly

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.270
remove any loose leaves pine needles  cones

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.270

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.220
30 Seconds Spray Walk Away Moss Mold Algae Lichen Killer

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.160
I know that moss is pretty on trees and  in
the forest but not on your sidewalk

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.320
or  driveway because it's very
slippery and they can cause you to fall

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.390
so I choose 30 SECONDS SPRAY AND WALK AWAY

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.110
lichen moss mold  algae killer and
you can get it at

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.930
Home Depot or another hardware
store and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.420
it works really well I'm gonna show you
how simple it is to use it

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.530
30 SECOND SPRAY AND WALK AWAY

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.640
need to dilute it  30 second spray and walk away really works it  really works and gets rid of moss mold lichen algae

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.760
dilute 30 second spray and walk away with 5 parts water to 1 part spray

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.189
use my HDX Garden Sprayer

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.409
I already put in with a simple cup

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.710
5 parts water now I am going to put 1of the spray concentrate

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.710
shake it around have my solution

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.319
make sure you dilute it  make sure you don't use a kitchen measuring cup

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:32.229
that would put chemicals in your food

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.280
don't do that  put on the pumper

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.700
screw it down in there

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.700
make sure your valves are closed  pump it up

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.700
you are ready to start spraying

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.789
take your  sprayer press on nozzle

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.209
spray your moss this is safe for sidewalks

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.450
roofs fences patios

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.710
don't spray onto your garden it is not safe for plants

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.320
keep your pets off of it for at least 12 hours

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.720
if they do get on it wipe off their feet so they don' t lick it off

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.720
that is all you have to do

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.180
this is going to die off I can sweep it later if I want to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.180
it is going to be gone

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.180
this beats power washing

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.630
scrubbing with soap

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.109
having to hose it off broom it away this is
the easiest thing ever

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.299
that's all you have to do and this whole
section is done

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.609
if you have mossy  overgrowth on your fence you can
spray that too

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:48.549
just make sure there's no delicate
plants right down below that

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.739
it could damage

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:00.739
this will make your property look better last longer  and help you
maintain your home

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.900
don't worry about slipping

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.969
on you driveway or sidewalk anymore it doesn't have to be slippery with moss

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:07.920
