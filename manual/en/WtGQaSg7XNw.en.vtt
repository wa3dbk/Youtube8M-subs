In this video, I'll be teaching you how to
put all your calendar, mail, and even Twitter,

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.350
and a few other things such as weather,
right on your lock screen, this is much faster

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.320
and it's a way to simply look at all of your
things you need to do for the day and view

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.420
your tweets and even compose right from the
lock screen. So if you like to learn how to do this,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.000
keep on watching.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.860
Hi, this is Luke from GuideMyJailbreak.com.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.730
And today I'm going to be teaching you how
to install, use, and customize an application

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.730
called LockInfo. So go ahead and tap Cydia
to start. Tap 'Search' and type in 'lockinfo'.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.900
One word.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.649
And tap it, it should be first. And tap 'Install'.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.530
And finally, 'Confirm'. When it finishes installing,
go ahead and tap 'Restart Springboard'. Basically,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.580
this is a faster way of restarting your
device. After you install, go ahead and slide

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.580
to unlock and tap 'Settings'.
And scroll down and find LockInfo. And you'll

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.200
see that you have a 14-day free trial and
you can try out to see if you like it. And

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.360
if you decide you like it, you can go ahead
and buy it. It's $8. So I'm go ahead and hit

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.260
'Continue Trial'. From this screen, you'll
be able to change and customize everything

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.909
about 'LockInfo'. So if you go ahead and turn
off your device and turn it back on, you'll

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.470
see LockInfo. So on the iPod Touch, you'll
be able to see your calendar and your mail

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.930
and you'd actually just tap on the mail message
and it'll display right there and you can

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.930
open up the mail right there and it will open up right
to that message. Turn it back off. You are

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.229
also able to see calendar, that's very helpful.
If you have an iPhone, you'll be able to see

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.200
your voicemail, SMS, and missed calls. But
there's a little bit more to this app than

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.130
just those things. So if you go 'home' and
you tap on 'Settings'. And if you have an

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.950
iPod Touch, let's go ahead and hide those
things you can't use, such as phone, by just

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.900
disabling them.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.919
And then if you tap on that 'Get More Plugins'

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:16.900
button, you will be able to actually install
more things. So for example, one that everyone

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:26.900
loves, is the Twitter. So go ahead and tap
on 'Twitter'. Tap 'Install'. And 'Confirm'.

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:34.359
Then tap 'Return to Cydia'. And tap the home
button. Go back to 'Settings'. And go back

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.540
to 'Plugins' and then scroll down to find
Twitter. From here, you can choose different

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.500
options and let's go ahead and log in.
Type in your Twitter name and password and

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.919
tap 'Authorize App'. Wait a few seconds and
then you're authenticated. So now, if I turn

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:56.909
off my phone again and turn it back on and
scroll down, you are actually able to see

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.069
recent Twitter messages. So you can actually
look at Recent Twitter Messages right there

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.849
and you can refresh them by tapping that button
right there and more will come in. And then

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.809
you can actually compose a Twitter message
right from your lock screen, which is much

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:12.309
faster than opening the Twitter app then composing
a message. Back to 'Plugins'. Tap 'Get more

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:19.309
plugins'. There's more things you can add
like an RSS Feed, Things, Todo List, different

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.729
kind of clock, and there's also weather, which
is kind of a nice feature. So you can put

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:30.549
the weather right on your lock screen. This
app really helps you keep organized and something

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.269
that helps me with is being able to see all
my calendar for that day and being able to

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.319
go through and look on my calendar events
and tapping on them and seeing them which

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.949
is very helpful. Same with mail.
