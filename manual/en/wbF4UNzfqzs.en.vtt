Howdy folks hows it going welcome to my virgin
kitchen I had a request come through from

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.920
the YouTube user GUI Asg and they asked me
to make viennese whirls i've never made them

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.250
before just like all the recipes I make are
the first time me making it but I thought

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.190
i'd get a special guest to show you how to
do it - you guys loved Her, Queen Barryetta

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.340
let's do it.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.280
Good day to all of you lovely people from
the land of the virgin kitchen thankyou so

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.540
much for wanting me to come back I hope you
had a lovely Christmas and New Year i'm going

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.720
to be showing you how to make the wonderful
British classic Viennese whirls which are

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.690
more delicious than the sight of someone on
a horse wearing jodpers with their buttocks

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.380
very firm aren't they?

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.470
Now to make viennese whirls you're going to
need a few ingredients so grab yourself a

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.690
pen and paper or simply get your butler to
do it and hit pause when I rub my broach are

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.170
you ready?

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.329
Write those ingredients down, one really does
approve of these viennese whirls.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.460
Grab a mixing bowl and combine your flour,
cornflour, icing sugar and room temperature

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.460
butter.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.670
Stirring it gently together initially.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.360
you want to caress it at first like you are
stroking a corgi and then get an electric

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.770
whisk on it and mix it together thoroughly.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.240
Now the mixture might look a little lumpy
but don't worry about it that's perfectly

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.450
normal so grab a little bit of vanilla extract
whenever I think of vanilla I think of my

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.600
bling and that song by vanilla ice *sings
ice ice baby* mumbles words.... mix your mixture

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.310
together until smooth.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:46.330
Place your mixture into a piping bag that
has a 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.350
large star nozzle fitted on the end of it,
now on a baking tray that has been dusted

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.150
with flour make little circles now be careful
they will spread so spread them out evenly

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.799
and then place the baking tray in the oven
for around about 12 minutes - you want to

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.240
bake them until they are nice and firm and
light golden brown similar to the colour of

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.590
the underwear that i'm wearing today as a
matter of fact then you want to put it onto

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.560
a cooling rack when I say rack I don't want
you to think of that torture device from Years

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.910
ago i'm still trying to get that legalised
again but just let it cool down for the moment.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.640
Now to make our cream filling grab a seperate
mixing bowl combine your melted butter, vanilla

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.030
extract &amp; the icing sugar continue to stir
until it's well combined and that will be

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.050
absolutely delicious.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.640
Turn each of your halves upside-down and place
them into pairs, you want to put jam on half

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.780
of them and cream on the other before merging
them together and giving them a darn good

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.270
dusting in icing sugar.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.930
And that's it we can now do what the French
call 'mange tout' which basically means shove

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.270
it all in your mouth and thinking of France
reminds me of a little naughty weekend I had

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.709

naughty times, if you enjoyed this video don't
