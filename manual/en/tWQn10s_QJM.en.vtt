Hello and welcome to our new video update.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.470
Every RPG has hundreds of characters in it 
but the difference between RPG and

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.039
any other video game is that
characters can dress and undress in RPG

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.300
and it's a big problem
for developers to solve it.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.609
So let's have a look at how we solved it. 
We will definitely need hundreds maybe thousands

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.070
of characters in the game.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.929
So we needed to develop our own tools to
make their development as easy as possible.

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.230
We built our tool on top of CryEngine. 
We would like to share it with the modding

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.390
community later.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.850
And I would say it's the ultimate character
customization tool ever developed.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.000
Lets start with character bodies.
We can change

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.570
almost every aspect of their appearance.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.820
We can select their size, body mass,
skin, color, hair, facial hair.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.700
Of course the face and also paleness or tone of their skin.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.560
Of course we can display
different injuries on the bodies as well.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.330
So there is really no limit of

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.360
the appearance of any character in the game. 
The system we are most proud of is our

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.229
clothing system.

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.250
We have 16 equipable slots on
every single character in the game.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.150
And what is most important

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.259
and most special about it is
that as in a real world

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.589
you can lay clothing in layers on each character.

00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:29.220
So for example if you
are an armored knight

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.000
you can have a gambeson on your torso

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.280
then chain mail over the gambeson 
then plate armor

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.189
over the chainmail and on top of that you
can have some expensive cloth to show

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.780
social status to people.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.590
Every layer has a different purpose.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.680
Every armor is good against
different types of weapons.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.250
So if you use only chainmail you will
be well protected against swords

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.499
but not as good against arrows for example.

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.299
Plate mail is very good against most of the weapons

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.570
but hammers and axes 
and such weapons.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.869
Thanks to the system we can create
almost unlimited amount of characters.

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.960
You can combine them (the parts) as you wish. 
Every character can combine them.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.430
You can steal from other characters...

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.730
...clothes from dead bodies of course.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.480
On top of that, every layer, every slot can have
different color and different size

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.209
as you can see the fat knight here. 
And the clothing can get dirty or

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.230
damaged or covered in blood

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.390
during the game so 
you will need to wash your clothes

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.200
when you are too dirty for example.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.500
No two characters in the game will look alike.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.620
We can create thousand-man army
and every soldier will be different.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.099
Most importantly it will...
The work will be much easier for us.

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.489
We won't need as many artists because

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.470
every character is built from
little pieces we just need to create

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.340
those pieces and then combine them together.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.310
Which is much easier to develop a
lot of characters for the game.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.560
While the bodies are created by
combining small parts

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.310
we create each characters head individually. 
We are using the latest 3d scanner for that

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.140
and then our artists will hand polish every head.
So that was our character customization system,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.420
I hope you liked it, and next time in the
next update we are going to show you our horse riding.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.620
So stay tuned.
