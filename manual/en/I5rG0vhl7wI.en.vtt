I just discovered this amazing gold addon
that automates the most

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.980
powerful gold making strategies in the game.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.640
So far it's made me a
fortune and I suggest you check it out immediately...

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.090
It's called Tycoon and it's the most powerful
gold making product

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.670
I've ever used.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.810
PDF guides don't even come close.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.600
In the first day I pulled in over 25,000g
and I didn't even

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.320
understand how the addon worked yet.

Not only does it pull in massive gold in minimum
time, but it makes

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.200
gold making fun again.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:21.030
Here's just a FEW of the cool things it does:

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.790
- Scans the auction house, studies your economy,
and tells you the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.880
most profitable items in the game.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.880
(Insane)

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.790
- If that item, for example, is something
that should be gathered

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.440
with mining it will give you an optimized
mining route that leads

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.549
you over the most densely populated mining
nodes in a zone...

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.340
resulting in over 2-3 times more ore than
normal.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.810
- It does this for all the major strategies
in the game, like

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.440
Gathering, Grinding, and Crafting.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.790
- It even knows if there is too much competition
and tells you to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.900
go for a different item instead.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.260
- You can choose any strategy you prefer,
such as crafting, and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.620
Tycoon will give you a list of just Crafting
items to make for huge

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:44.139
profit... (and then it goes on to show you
how to make it and where

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:50.859
to grind materials for even more profit!)

00:02:50.859 --> 00:03:10.590
There is a lot more features in 
this addon but those are just a few

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.959
that really stood out to me.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:29.379
This is going to change the way gold making
is done forever and I

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:44.439
know you'll like it.

00:03:44.439 --> 00:04:01.379
It just came out and I know a bunch of people
are talking about it

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:13.590
so I suggest checking it out before too many
people get their hands

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.590
on it.
