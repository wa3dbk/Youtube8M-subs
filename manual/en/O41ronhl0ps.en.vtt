McDonalds Baked Apple Pie Homemade Vegan-Vegetarian (Veganize Me Day 2/30)

00:00:01.741 --> 00:00:05.062
Hey my Sweet V's. It's The Sweetest Vegan here. 
 Today on the show for Project Veganize Me,

00:00:01.741 --> 00:00:05.062
Hey my Sweet V's. It's The Sweetest Vegan here. 
 Today on the show for Project Veganize Me,

00:00:05.062 --> 00:00:10.844
we will be making my favorite item from the 
 McDonalds Menu, which it the Baked Apple Pie.

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.096
I am so excited so lets get started.

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:17.972
McDonalds Baked Apple Pie Homemade Vegan-Vegetarian (Veganize Me Day 2/30)

00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:24.799
We are going to start by mixing together flour and salt in a small 
 bowl using a fork. And I am just going to cut in

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:32.432
some cold vegan butter. You can use a pastry blender or a food 
 processor. I am using a fork because it is really 

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:38.847
simple and easy. Next we are going to add in ice cold 
 water until it forms a dough ball. Bring it all together

00:00:38.847 --> 00:00:44.111
on parchment paper. Lay another piece of parchment paper on 
 top of that and then roll it out

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:49.383
with a rolling pin. This is my imaginary rolling pin. I 
 was doing it down here. . .  anyway. 

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:57.377
Carefully left the parchment paper and fold it up as many times as you 
 can. I got about three or four folds out of it. 

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:57.377
Carefully left the parchment paper and fold it up as many times as you 
 can. I got about three or four folds out of it. 

00:00:57.377 --> 00:01:05.202
Fold it up in the parchment paper and place it in the freezer until 
 we need it. Now I am just going to peel some apple.

00:01:05.202 --> 00:01:10.751
I have two Golden Delicious apples here, even though you probably 
 only need one. Core it, peel it, dice it 

00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:17.903
and then put it in a bowl. Add in cinnamon, nutmeg, 
 and vanilla extract. Once you have that all mixed together,

00:01:17.903 --> 00:01:23.708
take your pastry dough out of the freezer, dust some parchment 
 paper with flour, place you dough ball onto that, 

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:29.304
and dust the top of the pastry dough with flour too. 
 Lay another piece of parchment paper on top of that

00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:37.222
and roll it out again. You want it to form a square so if 
 it doesn't form a square perfectly, you can just cut off the edges.

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:42.560
We can make 5 pies out of this one sheet of pastry 
 dough, so I am going to cut 5 equal segments,

00:01:42.563 --> 00:01:48.990
and then slice it down the middle. Fill it with you 
 apple filling, place the other half on top of it,

00:01:48.994 --> 00:01:56.360
and pinch the sides with you fork so you can get those nice fork 
 marks on the side. Place these on a sheet of parchment paper

00:01:56.355 --> 00:02:01.210
on a baking sheet. Slice them so they get those nice 
 marks and openings at the top so that the

00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:06.990
steam can escape. I am going to dust them with a 
 little more cinnamon and bake them for about 40 minutes

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.300
in an oven that has been preheated to 400 degrees F. Once they 
 are done, you want them to cool off a little bit

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.410
ou don't want to burn yourself and we can go ahead 
 and taste these now. They came out really great.

00:02:18.414 --> 00:02:24.430
The pastry dough was really flaky because I did that folding thing where 
 I rolled it out then fold it up and froze it

00:02:24.428 --> 00:02:30.580
and rolled it out again. That created a lot of air in 
 between the layers. And the fat, the butter, the vegan butter

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:36.480
was able to expand and make these lovely layers of pastry dough 
 and it was much better than the McDonald's pastry dough

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:42.140
which is kind of just flat. But it was so flaky and 
 so delicious and it was kind of crispy and crunchy. 

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:46.430
And then you got into that gooey center. The only thing I 
 would do again, is I would make my apple filling

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:52.660
you know how McDonald's . . . theirs is more of a gooey apple 
 center? I would have been able to fit more filling in the pie

00:02:52.664 --> 00:02:57.560
if I didn't have the chunks of apple slices taking 
 up volume if you get what I am saying.

00:02:57.563 --> 00:03:02.300
But yeah, that's it. It was still delicious and I love 
 these things. I will be making them again. 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.650
And that is it for today. I hope you enjoyed. Come 
 back tomorrow because we will be making a 

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:12.540
Southern Style Chicken Sandwich. I think it is a Chick-fil-a 
 Sandwich, but McDonalds calls it a Southern Style 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.370
Chicken Sandwich. And it is going to be fun, 
 so you don't want to miss out. Bye.

00:03:18.368 --> 00:03:22.080
Oh yeah, if you didn't subscribe yet. Subscribe. Bye.
