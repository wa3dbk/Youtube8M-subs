00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.560
I hope writing those in
didn't take you that long.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.480
Now, let's hear the process
of gradual elaboration

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.040
which connects the middle ground
to the foreground,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.360
and then to the full score.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.440
I hope you agree
that this helps us get closer

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.120
to understanding Mozart's musical
thought in writing this short extract.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.520
We're now almost at the end
of this unit,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.080
and we've moved beyond the foreground
level of analysis

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.320
to something much harder to do,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.920
but also much more revealing
of the composer's musical thought.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.400
The analysis of the middle ground

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.080
will be the focus of your work
in the next analytical unit, unit 6.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.480
This is the end of this video section,
and to conclude unit 3

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.000
we'll look at ways of summarising the
sort of analysis we've just been doing,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.200
by using notation developed for
written analytical graphs.
