00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.689
In this movie, we will work on this beautiful
photograph that was captured by

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.410
one of my good friends, Michael Costa.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.480
Michael, thanks a ton for the use of
this photo.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.680
We are going to take a look at how we can
apply this recipe to this

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.910
particular situation.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.449
Now we already know a little bit about how
we are going

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:32.449
to do this, right?

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.981
Our Curves Adjustments layer and then Hue/Saturation
layer

00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:36.140
to finish it off.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.400
Well, let's go ahead and press the I key to
select our Eyedropper tool.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.760
Next,
navigate to the Sample Size, something other

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.760
than Point Sample.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.890
In this case, 5
by 5 Average, hold down the Shift key, we

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.590
will click this at a point just off
of the highlight here.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.189
That looks pretty good, take our values to
CMYK Color.

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:53.860
Now percentages are all pretty high.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.010
That cyan amount is much too high, so I
need to fix that.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.020
So I'll go in to the Adjustments panel and
click on Curves,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.300
navigate to that Red-cyan amount.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.720
I'm going to go ahead and bring that amount
down.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm not going to bring it down all the way
because next what I want to do

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.860
is work on this yellow amount.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.360
So I'll go into that Blue-yellow channel and
there I'm going to drag that down

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.470
a little bit.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.390
Then I'm going to go back to that Red-cyan
again, just a little

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.720
bit of give and take here, going back and
forth.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.689
What I'm looking to do is to
try to get my cyan amount about 50% of these

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.070
two values here.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.620
Go to that
Green-magenta channel and bring that down

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.310
a little bit more as well.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.940
Well, we're right in the range except one
of the things we're noticing is this

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.440
image has too much red in it, right?

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.850
Let's take a look at our before and after.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.300
Here's before and now here is after.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.510
Well in this case, the skin tone was
green.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.510
It didn't look very good.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.150
It was kind of green-cyan.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.850
Here it looks a
little bit better.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.390
Now if we've to air in the side of warming
up skin,

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.670
typically that's what we want to do, right?

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.060
So that's where we are at right now.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.310
The next step though is going to be to navigate
to the Adjustments Layer icon,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.159
choosing Hue/Saturation, go up to Target Adjustment
tool, and then click on the

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.620
skin that will take us to the reds.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.990
We are going click-and-drag to the left in
order to remove some of those.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.240
Now that's going to increase the cyan amount
that we can see there.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.430
Yet, I'm going to do that because I think
that looks a

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.780
little bit better.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.190
Here we can see that now this amount is even
higher, but

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.130
here's our before and after with that, just
bringing down those reds.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.200
Now we may want to work on this Yellow channel
a little bit.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.159
So we can
double-click the Curves Adjustments Layer

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.610
icon, navigate to that Blue-yellow
channel, and again just subjectively begin

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.950
to see how we can move this one way
or the other.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.599
Keep in mind that a lot of times what's going
to happen is we're

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.750
going to have a little bit more of a range
or a little bit more difference

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.459
between our magenta and our yellow.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.450
The yellow will be a touch higher there.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.590
Then again, we can subjectively dial that
in.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.890
I'm just going to go ahead and
experiment with this a little bit more.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.330
So I'm having to bring in just a touch
more yellow there.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.990
Let's see our overall before and after.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.310
Here is before and
then here is after.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.450
That image looks a ton better and even more,
you've now learned a hand full of

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.210
really valuable techniques that will help
you color correct skin tone in a

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:06.490
number of different situations.
