00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.800
This is Barack Obama!

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:05.601
The challenges that we face are great.

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:10.202
But there should be no doubt, that with the help of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke;

00:00:10.203 --> 00:00:12.603
We will save this nation.

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:14.404

Obama: "I Know!"

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:22.007
You're even greater than Abe Lincoln.

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:23.108
Obama: "That's true."

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.609
You'll make our economy strong.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.010
Make it strong!

00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:28.211
Obama: "That's right!"

00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:32.812
Your . . . words inspire this nation.

00:00:32.813 --> 00:00:33.813
Obama: "Hope."

00:00:33.814 --> 00:00:36.214
Your chopper costs 1 trillion.

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:37.315
Obama: "That's not true."

00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:42.716
Only you can end this recession. Recession . . . oh . . .

00:00:42.717 --> 00:00:44.217
You lost your job. You lost your home.

00:00:44.218 --> 00:00:46.218
But I'm in the Oval Office, so you won't be alone.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.119
Unemployment is rising, GOP's criticizing.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.820
But with George Bush they were all fraternizing.

00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:50.821
I don't wanna hear!

00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:51.622
I don't wanna talk.

00:00:51.623 --> 00:00:53.323
When Republican's speak, I just start to walk.

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:55.224
They followed these crooks who put us in danger.

00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:57.125
I haven't seen so many sheep since my birth in the manger.

00:00:57.126 --> 00:00:58.826
From the WhiteHouse, to Wall Street,

00:00:58.827 --> 00:01:00.327

I asked John Stewart to destroy Jim Cramer.

00:01:09.334 --> 00:01:11.034
"Mad Money's" the scapegoat for all misbehavior.

00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:12.135
We can do all this.

00:01:12.136 --> 00:01:13.036
This crisis won't last.

00:01:13.037 --> 00:01:14.737
Just like Jimmy Carter I'm starting out fast.

00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:15.638
End the war!

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:16.639
Reduce crime.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.440
Stem Cell research on the Gov. dime.

00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:19.941
Superman's got nothing on me!

00:01:19.942 --> 00:01:21.642

We'll tough it out, just like Rihanna.

00:01:28.347 --> 00:01:30.547
I've got Ben Bernanke to make things right.

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:32.448

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:34.249
Consumer confidence we will reignite.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.950

My stimulus package helps her sleep well at night.

00:01:37.852 --> 00:01:39.852
I wish Bush had played the joker in "Dark Knight."

00:01:39.953 --> 00:01:43.553
Oh . . . Mr. President you are the one.

00:01:43.554 --> 00:01:44.554

Obama: "That's right."

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:57.759
Arlen Specter(R) is a democrat so 2/3 of Congress is by my side.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.260
Except for Bill O'Reilly, the media enjoys the ride.

00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:02.561
