00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:03.330
Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath
desired to have you, that

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.720
he may sift you as wheat: but
I have prayed for thee, that

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:21.360
thy faith fail not: and when
thou art converted, strengthen

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.610
thy brethren.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.857
All ye shall be offended because
of me this night: for

00:01:36.857 --> 00:01:43.120
it is written, I will smite the
shepherd, and the sheep of

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.683
the flock shall be
scattered abroad.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.975
Though all men shall be offended
because of thee, yet

00:01:51.975 --> 00:01:54.760
will I never be offended.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.390
I am ready to go with
thee, both into

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.200
prison, and to death.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.720
I tell thee, Peter, the cock
shall not crow this day,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.160
before that thou shalt thrice
deny that thou knowest me.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.992
Though I should die with thee,
yet will I not deny thee.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:50.880
Father, the hour is come;
glorify thy Son, that thy Son

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.130
also may glorify thee.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.650
And this is life eternal, that
they might know thee the only

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.630
true God, and Jesus Christ,
whom thou hast sent.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:25.340
I have glorified thee on earth:
I have finished the

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.000
work thou gavest me to do.

00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:38.780
And now, O Father, glorify thou
me with thine own self

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.770
with the glory which
I had with thee

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.020
before the world was.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.970
O righteous Father, the world
hath not known thee: but I

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.610
have known thee, and these
have known that

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.040
thou hast sent me.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.970
And I have declared unto them
thy name, and will declare it:

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:14.760
that thy love wherewith thou
hast loved me may be in them,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.010
and I in them.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.970
Amen.
