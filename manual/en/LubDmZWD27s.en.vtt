Hi! This is Elise McMahon for Expert Village.com
and in this video series we are talking about

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.270
making your own dog food. If you would like
to find out more about my services, you can

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.250
visit my website at canineheadstart.com. So
in this series, in this clip here, we are

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.310
talking about making an omelet for your dog
and of course there are many different ways

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.420
that you can make an omelet for your dog and
many different things you can put it into

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.600
it. I am just going to give you one very basic
type of omelet you can make and then you can

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.570
use your imagination and go from there. So
we are going to start off with eggs and you

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.559
know how large the omelet and how many eggs
you use is really going to be dependent on

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.440
how many dogs or the size of your dogs you
are feeding, but we are going to just do a

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:14.340
five egg omelet here. So I am going to crack
five eggs into this bowl. These are little

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:23.759
eggs; maybe I’ll crack another one in there,
as they are quite small. So we have got our

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.119
eggs in the bowl and what we are going to
do now is just put a splash of cream in there,

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:41.500
just a little bit of cream and we are going
to mix that all up. I am going to add in to

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:49.592
this omelet some mushrooms and cheese, but
again you can add anything you like. We are

00:01:49.592 --> 00:01:59.930
going to be using some sharp cheese…. some
sharp Cheddar cheese, yellow Cheddar and I

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.709
am actually going to be using it grated…
it is a pre-grated cheese for convenience

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:08.209
really.
