00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.760
JOE WILES: We're taking a look at "Dream On"
by Aerosmith. We're in the second half of

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.090
the introduction. Let's take a look. The second
half of the introduction is just--it begins

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:20.839
just like the first half, like this. And we'll
going to go back to that original chord. This

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:30.199
is where it changes up. I'm going to put my
pinkie on the 6th fret of the high E string--then

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:37.899
slide up here. My ring finger is on the 9th
fret of the B string and my middle finger

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:45.969
is on the 8th fret of the high E string. For
this, we're not answering anymore. Back down

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:56.660
to the 6th and 6 of these high two strings--and
then 6th and 4 on the high E string here . Back

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:06.930
here to the 6th. That's up here to this chord
that we we're doing here which is the 9th

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.590
fret of a B string and the 8th fret of the
high E string. Then we hit the 6th and 6th

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.731
twice. And then we just go back and forth
between the 6th and the 5th fret on the G

00:01:18.731 --> 00:01:25.180
string. Four, five, six, seven, eight, okay?
Then we're going to go into a riff. Now slowly,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:02:03.910
so far, the second half of the introduction
sounds like this.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.210
And that's almost done with the introduction.
There's one more lick that we're going to

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.390
learn in the next segment. Join me there.
