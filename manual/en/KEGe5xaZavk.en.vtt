Parrot AR.DRONE
The YouTube success story

00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:17.000
Nicolas Halftermeyer, Manager Marketing &amp; Web PARROT
Parrot and YouTube go back a long way.

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:20.284
We started posting our videos on Youtube in 2006.

00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:24.668
We already had over 80 videos before the AR Drone came out.

00:00:24.777 --> 00:00:26.920
During the launch of the AR Drone 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.911
at CES Vegas in January 2010, 

00:00:28.938 --> 00:00:32.583
our server crashed under a 10-fold increase in traffic.

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:34.608
We had no backup option and didn't know what to do,

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:35.950
so we went ahead and decided 

00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:37.137
to upload everything to YouTube.

00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:40.474
We redirected our traffic to YouTube,

00:00:40.518 --> 00:00:42.938
where we could show our videos using their servers.

00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:45.355
Our first AR Drone video 

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:47.204
was our only marketing investment at the time.

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:48.994
The video was an instant hit, 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.791
reaching 1 million views in 2 days.

00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:53.944
So on the advice of Keyade media agency 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.312
we decided to buy 8 home page ads the same day, 

00:00:57.395 --> 00:01:01.076
Sunday, September 5, 2010, with our hearts set on a dream.

00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:02.873
That dream market being the U.S., of course.

00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:06.014
The ad had 80 million views, 

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:07.924
the vast majority of which came from the U.S.

00:01:08.077 --> 00:01:11.359
Our YouTube home page 

00:01:11.372 --> 00:01:13.751
was almost as visited as a Superbowl ad!

00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:18.419
Henry Seydoux, CEO de PARROT
The AR Drone - YouTube campaign 

00:01:18.443 --> 00:01:20.225
has been a tremendous success.

00:01:20.243 --> 00:01:22.388
Which media is best suited for a company like ours 

00:01:22.424 --> 00:01:24.322
that makes ultra high-tech gadgets, 

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:25.947
and can be seen anywhere?

00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:27.010
YouTube.

00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:31.670
There are about 7000 videos from Drone owners on YouTube.

00:01:31.837 --> 00:01:35.368
It's the best way to ensure  

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:39.472
that the Drone remains a hot topic. 

00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:41.873
The impact that YouTube has had on our sales is crystal clear, 

00:01:41.888 --> 00:01:43.899
first in terms of web traffic.

00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:46.027
Our e-commerce site traffic has increased ten-fold.

00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:49.447
Our sales on Amazon.com have exceeded forecasts 

00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:50.661
three times over.

00:01:50.988 --> 00:01:54.204
Before we started advertising on YouTube, 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.628
the AR Drone channel had 1.5 million visits.

00:01:57.657 --> 00:02:00.427
Today we have over 5 million visitors, 

00:02:00.482 --> 00:02:02.253
making it one of the most viewed 

00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:03.961
high-tech product channels in the world.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.098
When it comes to marketing, 

00:02:07.124 --> 00:02:09.081
we see YouTube as a must-use tool.

00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:11.373
Each time we think about promoting the product, 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:12.768
we talk about what to do on YouTube.

00:02:13.022 --> 00:02:16.852
High-tech products are among those best suited to YouTube.

00:02:16.942 --> 00:02:19.331
It's not as sexy as a music video, 

00:02:19.467 --> 00:02:21.891
but we do see a lot of very enthusiastic clips on YouTube, 

00:02:21.983 --> 00:02:23.947
and a lot of unboxing videos too.

00:02:24.023 --> 00:02:26.191
It's often one of the factors that clinches a sale.

00:02:26.348 --> 00:02:28.308
Another point is the demo effect,

00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:29.860
which has become extremely important 

00:02:29.968 --> 00:02:31.544
as tech products become increasingly full-featured.

00:02:32.946 --> 00:02:36.510
Julien BABIN, co-founder, Keyade / Media Agency
As a follow-up to our 2010 action plan, 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.088
in February 2011 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.471
we launched a YouTube campaign based on video ads. 

00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:45.476
We started in 5 countries. Following our initial success, 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.880
we extended the campaign to 4 more countries, 

00:02:47.923 --> 00:02:49.949
and then to another 5 in April, 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.003
making 14 countries in all, 

00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:54.177
with roughly 4 million views since February.

00:02:54.702 --> 00:02:57.466
We ensure that Parrot remains on the cutting edge of innovation 

00:02:57.542 --> 00:02:58.954
through keeping a constant eye out 

00:02:59.037 --> 00:03:00.894
for new Google and YouTube tools.

00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.367
Recently we launched True View campaigns 

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:05.357
which have been highly successful, 

00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:08.250
and which we will be expanding to all 14 countries.

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.352
It's based on YouTube.

00:03:10.392 --> 00:03:13.534
This means that we first post our video on YouTube. 

00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:16.219
Then we distribute it through our media contacts 

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:17.445
as well as in stores,

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.969
where it is shown on in-store video screens.

00:03:20.015 --> 00:03:23.034
But the bottom line is that the video was created for YouTube, 

00:03:23.065 --> 00:03:24.676
which is what's amazing.

00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:27.601
We're a product of the YouTube generation.

00:03:27.728 --> 00:03:30.229
Meaning we've never considered 

00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:33.199
selling the Drone without YouTube, 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.512
and we can't imagine launching any product today 

00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:36.936
without YouTube.

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:39.671
Production:  Aloest Productions
