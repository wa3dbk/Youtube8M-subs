If there is one thing they can do very well at Ford it's that they can built cars that handle very well. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.614
The previous generation Ford Focus RS was great and had nice colours like the fluorescent green and the matte black RS500.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.233
This is the new Focus RS and they asked Ken Block to do some donuts with it. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.393
You can conclude that it's not only a fwd anymore but 4wd.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.600
It is promised to become a very nice system.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.866
 I haven't driven it myself so i can't say if it's good or not but the specs are looking fantastic. 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:50.000
70% of the power, No: 100% of the power can go to the rear wheels and 70% of that power can go to one wheel.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.000
Or it was the other way round, however: you've got massive torque vectoring.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.700
The specs aren't final yet; 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.500
2,3L Ecoboost, the same engine we'll see in the Ford Mustang, but a bit tweaked.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.460
More than 320hp, so 321, 323 or 330hp: nobody knows yet. They are very busy with the development.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.826
This will be a very fast car, but lets ask Ken Block what he thinks. 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.500
Out of the way, my turn!
