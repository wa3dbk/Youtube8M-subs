00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.460
Fovea offers services to schools and preschool
kindergartens

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.970
We are the only company that I know of in
Scandinavia

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:34.370
that does digital printing with a 6000p machine
We go out in schools, take portrait pictures

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.800
and group pictures
of children in schools and preschool kindergartens.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.870
Before we installed the 6000p, we used two
silver halide machines.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:54.950
We decided to buy the 6000p because of the
production costs,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.280
capacity, speed and the quality of course.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.390
The photographers go there, take all the pictures
of the students and employees at schools.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.850
The next day it will be downloaded from the
server.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.690
The images will be adjusted and colour corrected.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.030
The picture is then processed, making it into
packages, different sizes, etc.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.260
We’ll go through the HP SmartStream Production
Pro RIP

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.190
and we’ll print it on the Indigo 6000p
We do the cutting, put it into the packing

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.170
machine,
and send it out to the parents.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.720
The disadvantages of silver halide production
were mostly speed and cost.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.659
The new workflow is about three to four times
faster than the old one

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.670
and productivity has increased three or fourfold.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.950
From the costs saving point of view,
we have approximately 60% lower costs

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.760
when producing pictures with the 6000p.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:10.590
The media we use for the 6000p is photo paper
from Felix Schoeller with a lustre surface

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.640
We’re very pleased with the look and feel
of the paper

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:24.810
and the customers are also very happy with
the paper.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.150
We feel that the quality is better when we
use the WS6000p.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.590
We get a wider color range out of the machines
and also the six colors

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.320
get us better results with the portraits
we take compared to the silver halide machines.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:50.310
We have two other HP Indigos:
we have a 5500 and a 7500.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.270
The main applications for these machines
are school catalogs and yearbooks.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:24.709
There are a 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.349
lot of advantages for us using the 6000p.

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.790
We reduce the cost by using this machine,
we also increased our productivity

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.690
with much higher speed on the new machine.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:47.780
What I like most about the 6000p is the stability,
quality, speed and capacity of the machine.
