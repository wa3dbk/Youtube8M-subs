00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.950
Nicole Mouskondis: Nicholas and Company is
a broad line food service distribution company.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.280
We sell everything that a food service operator
needs.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.280
Peter Mouskondis: We joke about we sell beans
for a living, but it becomes more than that.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.300
It absolutely is about the service industry.
We're trying to source the best products out

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.230
there for our customers.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.119
Bill Mouskondis: Nicholas and Company, in
its development, became very customer oriented.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.900
The customer had to be taken care of, and
that was priority one.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.490
Nicole Mouskondis: We try really hard to make
longterm business decisions. We are a family

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.860
business in its third generation, and we have
a legacy to protect.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.790
Peter Mouskondis: In the Greek culture, there's
a word - philotimo. It means the love of honor

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.260
- to do what's right, and to right the wrongs.
We want to do what's right, and we want to

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.480
make sure that those family values are continuing
to be instilled in our team members, and in

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.710
many generations beyond mine. And I think
that's where Wells has helped us, because

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.800
they put that in mind with us, and they treat
us like the family, versus a big conglomerate.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.070
Pamela Cates: It's a very personal relationship.
I've worked with Nicole and Peter for over

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.900
15 years. I want them to know that I care
about them. I want them to grow, and accomplish

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.039
all of their goals. It is a relationship that
I would like to have for a lifetime.

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:20.759
Bill Mouskondis: The people of Wells Fargo
are great partners, because of their training

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.740
and their expertise and passion for what they
do. And that is critical, because every business

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.920
has potholes that it has to avoid.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.740
Pamela Cates: Like most companies, Nicholas
has had its challenges, and it's challenges

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.439
have been related mostly to their growth.
So the asset-based lending facility was the

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.799
right answer for the company.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.960
Nicole Mouskondis: Growing is very expensive
and very hard to do, but they stood by us.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.149
They took a risk on us, and we have not ever
forgotten that.

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.679
Pamela Cates: The company had been thinking
about expanding into the Las Vegas marketplace

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.670
for a long time. Wells Fargo was willing to
provide the financing to help them accomplish

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.119
this goal, and as a result of being able to
do that, we are in this new facility in Las Vegas.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.499
[cheering]

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.779
Nicole Mouskondis: This is a dream come true
for us. Opening a new distribution center

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:11.630
is probably going to be the legacy that Peter
and I leave for the next generation.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.920
Pamela Cates: As we look out into the future,
and Nicholas continues to grow and expand,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.200
we're going to be there with them.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.540
Nicole Mouskondis: The loyalty definitely
goes both ways in terms of our partnership.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.000
As we continue to grow, we want to make sure
that we continue to use Wells Fargo because

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.290
they have been loyal to us, and we wouldn't
think of having another business partner.
