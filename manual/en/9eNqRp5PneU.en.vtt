00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:08.370
 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:21.379
I see UTS's key strength is its ability in a
very, very long and enduring way to consistently

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.660
produce graduates who are able to tackle the
business problems that are happening today.

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.679
If you're serious about studying business,
then you have to study where business happens,

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:46.679
and that's right here. I think it's wonderfully
well positioned. I think physically, geographically

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.399
it's well positioned. You know, right on the
edge of Sydney's CBD with such close proximity

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.780
not only students, but businesses and headquarters
and everything else that Sydney has to offer.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.780
UTS does a great job collaborating with business.
They've got a very active advisory board,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.220
and that really allows business to work and
collaborate with the university to make sure

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.970
that the programmes they're developing are
going to be what business needs when the graduates

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.990
come out at the other side, but also foresee
the school do a great job working on research

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.560
- collaborative research with business, and
really what that allows the school to do is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.910
not only just understand what today's business
problems are, but help to work with business

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.700
to predict what the future problems are going
to be. I think one of the best things about

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.700
studying at the UTS Business School is the
passion and the knowledge of all of the lecturers

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.140
and tutors that you have as part of your degree.
I'm very happy with my decision of studying

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.890
at UTS. I don't think there'd be any other
university I'd rather be at, because there's

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.020
so much support here and I know that if I
am having trouble with any of my work or anything

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.110
like that I know that lecturers are going
to be there to help me with it. Also the support

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.170
I got with Jumbunna, the indigenous centre
- they've been amazing helping me through

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.420
this year. Most of my lecturers were sort
of either involved in the industry or they've

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.189
been working in the industry for a long time.
So not only have we got a very diverse student

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:26.019
population, but we also have a very diverse
academic staff area as well, and all of them

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.659
have one thing in common of course; is they
have a very broad range of practical experience

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.900
- very highly academically qualified as well,
and they have a real interest in outcomes

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.189
- helping students improve their future career
options as well. The UTS Business School graduates

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.999
are excellent to do business with, primarily
because they have that blend of educational

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:54.200
rigor and outside experience. I think the
key thing that I learned at UTS was holistic

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.629
thinking, and to understand that nothing is
independent, and it's all connected. So we

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.659
took a lot of theory and applied it in a very
pragmatic way, which I could apply to multiple

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.779
businesses and sectors that I've worked in
since. We're dedicated to providing knowledge

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:17.579
with impact, practical, innovative and ethical
business education of the highest quality.

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.670
I invite you to explore the many options available
and find the programme that best suits your

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.700
needs.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.769
 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:22.829
 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:22.859
 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:22.889
 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:22.920
 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.950
 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.999
 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:23.049
 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:23.069
 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.099
 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109
 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:23.359
