00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.540
Last week Justin and I saw the end of an episode
of the X-Files while travelling and shooting

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.920
a different show so of course this week we're
talking musicians who have been abducted by

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:21.320
aliens.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.740
Like you, I spend every one of my endless,
sleepless nights listening to Coast to Coast

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:35.190
AM until five in the morning and preparing
for my eventual journey to the cosmos.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.739
Alien abductions are a relatively new phenomenon.
Although true believers cite so-called paleo-abductions

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.760
documented as far back at 1897, most consider
the 1961 Betty and Barney Hill incident as

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.780
ground zero.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.260
Barney Hill was not actually James Earl Jones,
but the famous hypnosis tapes of him and his

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.109
wife recounting their extraterrestrial experience
leaked to the press in 1965 and made for a

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:21.740
perfectly cornball TV movie in 1975. Staring
Vader himself.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.520
The Hills' story -- lost time, bright lights,
probes - became the blueprint for every abduction

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.929
story you've ever heard. There's even a plaque
in North Lincoln, New Hampshire, to commemorate

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:54.479
it. And so it has gone for the last five decades.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.009
But not everyone visited by aliens is a boring,
normal person. Sometimes, aliens hang with

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:21.050
rock stars.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.120
The very roots of white rock and roll are
space-tinged. Some claim that aliens were

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.360
present at the birth of Elvis Presley -- including
his own father, Vernon. Weirder and somehow

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:41.360
less verifiable is the claim that, at the
age 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.930
of 8, Elvis was visited by aliens and told
his future.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.871
Lupe Fiasco, who is more alive than Elvis,
started bragging all over town in 2011 about

00:02:50.871 --> 00:03:03.690
his abduction and subsequent implant.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:24.620
I want to touch Lupe Fiasco's alien implant.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.260
Sammy Haggar -- former Van Halen frontman
and Cabo Wabo impresario -- has become increasingly

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.100
open about his abduction. He also know claims
that Van Halen's "Poundcake", with lyrics

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.560
like "Lemme get on, lemme get on, lemme get
on some of that / Shake it up, pick it out

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.240
nice / Lemme get on, lemme get on, lemme get
on outta there / I still love my baby's Poundcake"

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:55.370
actually about... aliens.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.810
Ace Frehley from KISS opened up about his
abduction in his 2011 memoir -- the inspiration

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.870
for his alter-ego, the Spaceman from Planet
Jendell. Although I'm not sure I'd trust this

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.860
guy.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:30.570
Maybe it shouldn't be surprising that the
folks who are the loudest about their alien

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:42.540
encounters -- Jerry Garcia from the Grateful
Dead, Rick Wakeman from Yes, Cat Stevens -- are,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:56.120
you know, open-minded types.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.870
None of this even takes into account all the
rock stars who have just seen aliens -- we

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:27.190
can save Mick Jagger's UFO alarm system for
another episode.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.920
What do you think -- are aliens targeting
rock stars? Let us know in the comments, and

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.350
be sure to subscribe for new episodes of This
Exists every week. There's links to all the

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.830
videos we used in the description -- the truth
is out there.
