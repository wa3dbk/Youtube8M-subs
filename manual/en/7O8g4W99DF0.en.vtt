00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:08.410
While Andy Murray was busy beating Roger Federer
for the first time in a major, we were compiling

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.770
the latest and greatest stories from around
the tennis world.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.320
Hey Tennis Fans, I’m Blair Henley and welcome
to the Tennis Now News update!

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.480
In another amazing display of tennis, Murray
topped Federer 6-4, 6-7, 6-3, 6-7, 6-2 to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.760
set up a rematch of the U.S. Open final against
Novak Djokovic.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.390
Things got a little tense at 6-5 in the fourth
set when Murray seemed to pause in the middle

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.050
of the first point, begging an out call.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.640
Andy ended up closing it out with a passing
shot anyway, leading Roger to yell “You

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.989
[expletive] stopped!”

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.129
Federer said after the match that he and Murray
were “just checking each other out.”

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.149
Fed also dropped an audible F-bomb near the
end of the second set.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.309
As tennis writer Ben Rothenberg put it: “It’s
like seeing a unicorn give you the finger.”

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.989
If Murray wins in the final, he’ll be the
first to win his first two Grand Slams back

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:58.989
to back.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.180
If Djokovic wins, he’ll be the first to
three-peat at the Australian Open.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.710
Either way, history will be made.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.340
Jo-Wilfried Tsonga had some interesting things
to say about the women’s side of the game

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.890
after losing to Federer in the quarterfinals.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.880
When asked why there is no WTA equivalent
of the “Big Four,” Tsonga said this:

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.840
“You know, the girls, they are more unstable
emotionally than us.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.910
I'm sure everybody will say it's true, even
the girls (laughter).

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.910
No?

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.910
No, you don't think?”

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.950
He probably should have stopped right there.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.170
But Tsonga went on to dig himself into an
even bigger hole with the ladies.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.200
“But, I mean, it's just about hormones and
all this stuff.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.340
We don't have all these bad things, so we
are physically in a good shape every time,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.450
and you are not.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.450
That's it.”

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.159
Victoria Azarenka is still feeling the heat
after taking a 10-minute medical timeout in

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.770
her semifinal match against Sloane Stephens.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.610
In a post-match interview Azarenka admitted
that after she failed to convert five match

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.310
points at 5-3 in the second set, she was feeling
overwhelmed and nervous – hence the reason

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.160
for her lengthy break.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.520
Later she claimed she didn’t understand
the question, but it seemed that in a moment

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.300
of extreme arrogance or possibly ignorance,
Azarenka chose to say exactly what was on

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.400
her mind.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.000
In some ways, it seems we should be thanking
her for blowing the lid off the gamesmanship

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.480
that so often accompanies medical timeouts
as well as bathroom breaks.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.310
While she’s certainly not the first player
to use the rules to her advantage, the 23-year-old

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.319
IS the first to give us undeniable proof that
the practice exists.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.230
Unfortunately for tennis, it’s something
that happens from 10-and-under play all the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.230
way on up the ladder.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.930
In fact, many coaches are known for instructing
their students to break an opponent’s rhythm

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.379
when possible.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.650
Unfortunately for Vika, her candor will likely
garner her a tough Aussie crowd in the final

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.650
against Li Na.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.780
We can only hope the Azarenka controversy
leads to a rule adjustment in the future.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.370
That’s all for today’s Tennis Now News
update!

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.180
What did you think about Murray’s win, Tsonga’s
comments, and Azarenka’s so-called medical

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.180
timeout?
