00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.900
When we get to those dry summer months good
soil hydrologic function is critical.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.580
We visited with Purdue University's Dr. Eileen
Kladivko to talk about the remarkable effect

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:26.300
that night crawlers have on aiding water flow
into and through soils.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:38.200
Right, in general our soils are in excessively
wet in the spring and that is more of our

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.960
issue and that is why we use tile draining
and things like that, but what I'm getting

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.390
at really is that the night crawler in particular
can be very important for getting infiltration

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.239
of water into the soil during the growing
season so when we get those quick thunderstorms

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.780
in the middle of the summer we usually want
all that water to go in because that is not

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.710
when we have excess water so we want the water
to go into the soil but especially with soils

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.360
that are high silt sometimes you can get crusting
and you have less crusting of course if you're

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.579
in no till but if you have a lot of night
crawlers, those deep channels that the night

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.280
crawlers make can really help get water into
the soil profile where you have a chance for

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.970
your crop to use it as opposed to having it
run off, you know an extra inch or two of

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.810
water in a lot of our summers makes a big
difference in the yield.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.689
I happen to have a few demonstrations of night
crawlers if you would like to see and they

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.040
call it channels if you would like to see
those.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:50.859
So this is my technician a number of years
ago went out and poured the liquid rubber

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:55.931
latex basically that you use in biology classes
on an area where there were some night crawler

00:01:55.931 --> 00:02:01.350
middens and then he came back a couple days
later after it had hardened and he carefully

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.319
dug it out and you can see that these were
night crawler channels all in this one square

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.950
foot area and you can see that basically those
channels are going down, they have broken

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.860
a little bit now in the meantime but some
of these channels were down three feet deep

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.170
and just imagine water flowing across the
surface and into these channels how much water

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.730
can flow down those big and deep channels,
and they are very vertical you can see that

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.170
their (so you got the vertical flow and then
they have the chance to flow laterally as

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:44.380
well....), Oh yes once the water is down in
the soil profile its going to move out from

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.690
those.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.120
I think it's a great demonstration of night
crawler channels.
