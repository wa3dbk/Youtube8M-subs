Hi! I'm Karen for Expert Village. Now we'll
sew the bottom where folded it in. You want

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.291
to keep in mind also what color threads you
have in here. I have white ribbon on the bottom

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:21.010
so I put white in my bobbin. I have a pink
ribbon on the top so I put pink in my upper

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:29.690
thread. Just put that onto the machine and
sew across the bottom. You could put a pin

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:42.999
in there to hold it in place if you want.
Remember when you start to back up just a

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:55.629
little bit to knot that off. We'll put the
needle down right in the edge and pivot. We're

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.629
going to sew as close to the edge of the pink
ribbon as possible and we're going to hold

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:11.110
it carefully in place so that I can see my
flowers through. We're going to have it even

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:20.770
on the design on the other side. Just work
slowly so that you place your ribbon in the

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:31.890
right place.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.630
Now, when we get to the end, again, we're
going to fold down but we will not sew across

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.950
the top. We want to fold that down. We're
going to leave it open on the top so we're

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:58.390
making almost like a little pocket. Then after
you fold it down, you can sew right to the

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:08.130
edge. Then back up a little bit just to knot
that and trim. Then we'll sew down the other

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.941
side of the ribbon. Now we're going to put
it on the machine. Again, you don't want to

00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:21.720
sew the opening on the top because we're making
a little pocket to put our plastic in that'll

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:32.260
make it stiff. Back up a little to knot it
and continue going as close to edge of the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:43.360
pink ribbon as possible.
Continue down to the bottom and then back

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:52.280
up a little just to knot it. Then we'll trim
all our threads. Next, we'll be cutting a

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:00.630
piece of plastic to go inside the middle and
that will give our ribbon bookmark some stiffening.
