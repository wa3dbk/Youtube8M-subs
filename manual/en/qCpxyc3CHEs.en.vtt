00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.929
Tumbleweeds!

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:14.570
Iconic, majestic, all tumbly!

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.500
If the USDA has their way, they’ll be going
the way of the dodo.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.770
But how will we know that we’re in a ghost
town?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.360
Hey folks, I’m Matt Lieberman filling in
for DNews.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.650
Tumbleweeds are a firmly established part
of Americana.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.530
The balls of Russian thistle dry over time
in the hot sun and are ripped from their roots

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.940
by wind, sending them tumbling helplessly
in whatever direction that nature deems appropriate.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.820
This can be a huge problem for all of us non-tumbling
stay-putters, as tumbleweeds can grow to six

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.280
feet in diameter, and, when they finally come
to rest, can clog waterways and are difficult

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.280
to dispose of.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.870
They’re more prickly than a porcupine before
his morning coffee, and busting up and burning

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.699
the big balls of bramble-like bother is a
timesuck that, quite frankly, no one has the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.230
time for any longer.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.159
Also, Tumbleweeds are some of the most cunningly
designed cultivators in nature, which is great!

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.800
Well, it’d be better if they dropped, say,
fruit or vegetable seeds as they bounce beholden

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.050
to the breeze, rather than more russian thistle
seeds, not to mention pests that basically

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.320
get a free bus ride cross-country, making
them that much harder to contend with.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.250
These reasons are enough for the US Department
of Agriculture to take drastic steps, calling

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.160
for the eradication of Russian thistles on
American soil.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.860
So, how are they going to do that?

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.910
If you’re imagining a team of specialists
running after fugitive tumbleweeds with pitchforks

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.760
and torches, you’re really creative, but
mistaken.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.750
The USDA has developed viruses from two types
of dying tumbleweeds from Russia and Hungary,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.420
and are currently testing the effects that
those viruses would have on our ecosystem

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.420
if used.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.950
Under strict quarantine, scientists have exposed
the viruses to 64 and 89 types of plants,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.950
respectively.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.520
The results of those tests reveal that the
closer a plant is genetically to tumbleweeds,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.700
the more it is harmed by these viruses.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.000
Despite the potential damage, the USDA is
currently lobbying for permission to release

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.220
the viruses to curb the tumbleweed population
permanently.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.200
So how do you feel about Tumbleweeds?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.660
Should they be exterminated?

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.111
