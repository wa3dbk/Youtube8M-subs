(funky upbeat music)

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.931
(horse neighing)

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.956
- Hello internet, that's Josh, I'm Chuck

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:19.428
and this is internet roundup.

00:00:19.428 --> 00:00:20.596
That means you're in the right place.

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:21.429
- Yeah.

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:22.620
- We do the Stuff You Should Know podcast

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.761
and each week we dive into the internet.

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:25.594
- [Josh] Yep.

00:00:25.594 --> 00:00:27.896
- and find breaking news or in this case

00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:29.064
super cool old news.

00:00:29.064 --> 00:00:30.415
- Yep.

00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:32.415
- You wouldn't call this new, right, 1916.

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:35.495
- No, it is super old news,
but it's pretty awesome.

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:37.131
- Yeah, I like reading
these old, you found this

00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:40.750
in the New York Times archive I imagine

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.566
or actually you got it
from newyorkcitysubway.org.

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.975
- I think ultimately I got it from Reddit.

00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:45.808
- Well.

00:00:45.808 --> 00:00:47.110
- Just to give credit where credit is due.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.943
(laughing)

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:50.598
- Okay, but I like to read those
old New York Times articles

00:00:50.598 --> 00:00:51.814
just by the way they're written.

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:52.814
It's always kind of fun.

00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:53.806
- Yeah, I like the way they have,

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:56.022
like each one has five, ten headlines

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.558
before they finally get
to the story you know.

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:58.446
(laughing)

00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:00.166
- Yeah, well let's go
over these headlines then.

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:03.895
- Well this one says, the big head is

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:06.903
Tells How It Feels To Go Up In A Geyser.

00:01:06.903 --> 00:01:08.239
- Right, all right.

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:09.589
- And then next is Man
Shot Through River Bed

00:01:09.589 --> 00:01:12.965
from Tunnel Was Never
Squeezed So Tightly Before.

00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:14.405
- And the next one is

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:16.061
- Kept His Mouth Tight Shut.

00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:16.894
(laughing)

00:01:16.894 --> 00:01:17.877
- And the next one.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:20.442
- Body of Third Victim
Found - Damage to New Subway

00:01:20.442 --> 00:01:22.642
More Serious Than Was Thought.

00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:24.021
- Which really should have been the lead

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:26.365
cause that's all they really
cared about in those days.

00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:27.893
- The damage to the subway?

00:01:27.893 --> 00:01:29.301
- Yeah, like how's the subway doing.

00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:30.134
- [Josh] Yeah.

00:01:30.134 --> 00:01:31.213
- They lost lives all over the place

00:01:31.213 --> 00:01:33.405
and as we can tell in this article

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:36.614
the wife of one of the
men who actually survived

00:01:36.614 --> 00:01:38.805
this accident was just
like hey I'm just glad

00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:39.829
he's got this job.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:40.662
(laughing)

00:01:40.662 --> 00:01:41.646
- Very much so, yeah.

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:42.479
- [Chuck] It's pretty funny.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.737
- And the Great Depression
hadn't even happened yet.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:45.809
- Yeah, so we're just teasing this.

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:47.649
What happened is there was some sort

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.713
of an accident in 1916, February 21st,

00:01:50.713 --> 00:01:53.785
and they were shot through
a geyser essentially.

00:01:53.785 --> 00:01:55.209
Up through the bed of the East River.

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:56.615
- Yeah, they were digging a subway tunnel

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:58.215
beneath the East River.

00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:00.763
We did one on how subways work.

00:02:00.763 --> 00:02:01.596
We did a podcast episode.

00:02:01.596 --> 00:02:02.610
- [Chuck] Yeah, it was a good one.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.235
- And it talked about this kind of thing.

00:02:04.235 --> 00:02:06.884
When you're digging a
tunnel underneath the river

00:02:06.884 --> 00:02:08.524
you have to pressurize
it or else everybody's

00:02:08.524 --> 00:02:09.780
get the bends

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.613
- Sure.

00:02:10.613 --> 00:02:12.788
- and die, so they had this compressed air

00:02:12.788 --> 00:02:13.956
going into the tunnel.

00:02:13.956 --> 00:02:15.476
Well apparently there was a crack

00:02:15.476 --> 00:02:18.220
that went up through the river bed.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.053
- [Chuck] Yeah.

00:02:19.053 --> 00:02:20.620
- And the difference in pressure

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.685
pushed this compressed air up into it.

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:24.518
- [Chuck] Yeah.

00:02:24.518 --> 00:02:26.597
- And sucked the workers who were in there

00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:28.533
through an 18 inch hole.

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:30.629
- Yeah, three dudes, two of them died.

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:31.462
- Yep.

00:02:31.462 --> 00:02:33.781
- And one of them I
think, how far did he go?

00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:34.717
- 200 yards.

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:36.992
- Yeah 200 yards and 21 like feet

00:02:36.992 --> 00:02:39.656
up in the air over the East River.

00:02:39.656 --> 00:02:43.384
- From underneath the river,
through the river bed,

00:02:43.384 --> 00:02:45.528
up through the river and into the air.

00:02:45.528 --> 00:02:47.144
That's what happened to those guys.

00:02:47.144 --> 00:02:47.977
- And he lived.

00:02:47.977 --> 00:02:50.136
- One of them lived,
that's the crazy part.

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:52.056
And he said basically what happened was

00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:53.592
he noticed a crack and then realized

00:02:53.592 --> 00:02:56.177
that things were getting
sucked towards this crack

00:02:56.177 --> 00:02:57.321
that was getting bigger and bigger

00:02:57.321 --> 00:02:59.865
and they tried to throw
some wood at the hole

00:02:59.865 --> 00:03:02.237
to get is sucked into the
hole to have it covered up.

00:03:02.237 --> 00:03:03.070
- Right.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.998
- But they said it was too late.

00:03:03.998 --> 00:03:06.270
He went to go grab onto
the pipes and missed

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.014
and he got squeezed harder than he

00:03:08.014 --> 00:03:10.822
ever had been before
and lost consciousness.

00:03:10.822 --> 00:03:13.118
- Yeah he said he wasn't even hurt really.

00:03:13.118 --> 00:03:15.950
No serious injury and he
said he's a good swimmer

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.830
and even though he was wearing
his big, heavy rubber boots

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.430
he managed to keep his head above water

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.825
and they asked about Mrs.
Mabey, he was Mr. Mabey.

00:03:23.825 --> 00:03:26.221
He was only 28 and he
had four kids of course.

00:03:26.221 --> 00:03:27.471
I'm surprised he didn't
have 12 by that point.

00:03:27.471 --> 00:03:28.304
- Right.

00:03:28.304 --> 00:03:30.143
- And she said of course
I know that Marshall

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.239
is in danger every time he goes to work,

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.167
but all work is dangerous,
which is true in 1916.

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:36.000
- Yeah, for sure.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.352
- And my husband is as
careful as he can be.

00:03:37.352 --> 00:03:39.896
His job is a good one, I'm glad he has it.

00:03:39.896 --> 00:03:41.864
- Yeah, and she said stop being a wiener

00:03:41.864 --> 00:03:43.016
and go back to work.

00:03:43.016 --> 00:03:44.120
- I know, my wife would have been like

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.673
you're not going to that job anymore.

00:03:45.673 --> 00:03:46.506
- [Josh] Yeah.

00:03:46.506 --> 00:03:48.241
- Or maybe she would have sent me-

00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:49.457
- Well it's not 1916.

00:03:49.457 --> 00:03:50.610
- For some overtime.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.443
(laughing)

00:03:51.443 --> 00:03:52.497
- It's all about
historical context, right?

00:03:52.497 --> 00:03:54.377
- So that was a good
one, nice job on that.

00:03:54.377 --> 00:03:56.769
- Tell us how it feels
to go up in a geyser.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:57.602
(laughing)

00:03:57.602 --> 00:03:59.201
That's the title of that.

00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:02.202
- And I recommend just going
to the New York Times archive

00:04:02.202 --> 00:04:04.089
and just reading how things
were written back then.

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.922
- [Josh] Yeah.

00:04:04.922 --> 00:04:05.755
- It's pretty fun.

00:04:05.755 --> 00:04:08.394
- It is neat because they have
typically scans in PDF form

00:04:08.394 --> 00:04:09.227
- [Chuck] Yeah.

00:04:09.227 --> 00:04:11.278
- Of the actual article so you've got

00:04:11.278 --> 00:04:14.094
all the cool old timey fonts
and everything with it too.

00:04:14.094 --> 00:04:15.406
Really adds to the experience.

00:04:15.406 --> 00:04:18.118
- And this next bit is from Live Science,

00:04:18.118 --> 00:04:21.382
entitled Humans Broke Off Neanderthal Sex

00:04:21.382 --> 00:04:25.049
after discovering Eurasia
from Charles Choi.

00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:27.406
This is kind of neat, what they found

00:04:27.406 --> 00:04:29.871
when they, in 2010 they
did the first sequence

00:04:29.871 --> 00:04:32.984
of the neanderthal genome,
which is really cool

00:04:32.984 --> 00:04:36.527
cause they found out that modern Eurasians

00:04:36.527 --> 00:04:40.223
share about one to four
percent of the neanderthal DNA.

00:04:40.223 --> 00:04:41.056
- Right.

00:04:41.056 --> 00:04:43.479
- Which in itself is pretty,
a pretty big finding.

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:44.312
- Right.

00:04:44.312 --> 00:04:46.271
- But then they said wait a minute,

00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:49.600
modern humans also lived on
the planet at the same time,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.360
I wonder if they ever
copulated and they did.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.408
- They definitely did, so neanderthals had

00:04:54.408 --> 00:04:57.752
humans beat by about
30 or 40 thousand years

00:04:57.752 --> 00:05:00.392
and they co-existed
for about 200,000 years

00:05:00.392 --> 00:05:02.152
or 170,000 years.

00:05:02.152 --> 00:05:03.584
- Plenty of time to get down to business.

00:05:03.584 --> 00:05:04.905
- Well yeah, and the neanderthals

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:07.795
died out about 30,000 years ago.

00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:08.889
And they're still trying to figure out

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.305
what happened or why, was
it competition, was it war.

00:05:12.305 --> 00:05:13.138
- Right.

00:05:13.138 --> 00:05:17.241
- Who knows, but it was
a fairly surprising find

00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:19.633
to find out that you, me, pretty much

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:24.378
everybody in this room right
now has neanderthal DNA.

00:05:24.378 --> 00:05:25.754
And not just neanderthal.

00:05:25.754 --> 00:05:26.587
- [Chuck] Yeah.

00:05:26.587 --> 00:05:31.242
- But also denisovan, which
is a new kind of humanoid,

00:05:31.242 --> 00:05:33.898
hominid I think is the more
accepted scientific term.

00:05:33.898 --> 00:05:34.731
(laughing)

00:05:34.731 --> 00:05:35.564
- Okay.

00:05:35.564 --> 00:05:36.642
- Humanoid is more science fiction.

00:05:36.642 --> 00:05:38.178
We're talking like paleo history.

00:05:38.178 --> 00:05:39.011
- Yeah, hominid.

00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:42.756
- And at least a couple
other types as well,

00:05:42.756 --> 00:05:43.867
but what they're trying to figure out

00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:48.315
is why, why did we stop
when humans reached Eurasia.

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:50.427
- Yeah and the other interesting find here

00:05:50.427 --> 00:05:54.594
is that we share more DNA than
the neanderthals in Africa.

00:05:56.788 --> 00:05:57.621
- [Josh] Right.

00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:59.258
- Which is kind of reverse
of how you would think

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:01.651
and the theory is that they maybe

00:06:01.651 --> 00:06:04.418
just started copulating
once they left Africa.

00:06:04.418 --> 00:06:05.251
- Right.

00:06:05.251 --> 00:06:08.439
- Or some of them did, not entirely.

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:13.122
Or it was a, they diverged,
and recombined in Africa

00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:17.171
and were just so different
that that's how is shows up so.

00:06:17.171 --> 00:06:19.571
- Which is called a speciation event

00:06:19.571 --> 00:06:23.147
when two formerly similar
or the same species

00:06:23.147 --> 00:06:26.739
have gotten so far off the same path

00:06:26.739 --> 00:06:29.515
that they can't reproduce any longer.

00:06:29.515 --> 00:06:30.348
- [Chuck] Yeah.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:31.868
- We did an episode on
that too, didn't we?

00:06:31.868 --> 00:06:33.747
Evolution in isolation
or something like that.

00:06:33.747 --> 00:06:35.026
- Yeah, yeah.

00:06:35.026 --> 00:06:36.466
- Speciation event.

00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:37.860
- It's all coming back.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.372
So thanks to the Live
Science and Charles Choi

00:06:41.372 --> 00:06:43.020
for that piece of news.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.373
- Yeah, that one's called humans broke off
