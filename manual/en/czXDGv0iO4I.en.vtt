00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.876
(traffic roaring)
(upbeat music)

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:09.032
- There's a lot of water issues

00:00:09.032 --> 00:00:09.865
around the world.

00:00:09.865 --> 00:00:12.704
We definitely feel it here in California

00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:17.416
and just imagine it 10, 20, 50
times worse in other places.

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:20.701
I have a passion to see
people having water.

00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:22.023
My name is Chris Hyun.

00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:24.566
I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.615
in the Energy Resources Group.

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:29.021
One of Bangalore's biggest problems is

00:00:29.021 --> 00:00:31.290
intermittent water supply,
meaning they don't get water

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.968
all the time, there's not 24/7 water.

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:37.072
- This is a problem that
affects 400 million people

00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:39.410
in the developing world,
250 million of those

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.584
living in India.

00:00:40.584 --> 00:00:42.089
- The average household
in Bangalore gets about

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.751
4.5 hours of water every other day.

00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:47.187
It tends to be off schedule.

00:00:47.187 --> 00:00:49.841
Sometimes they have to
wait many hours all day

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.056
for water that may or may not come.

00:00:52.056 --> 00:00:54.803
If you have enough money,
you would store water

00:00:54.803 --> 00:00:55.812
when the water comes.

00:00:55.812 --> 00:00:57.408
They'll build in rooftop tanks.

00:00:57.408 --> 00:00:59.899
If you can't afford that,
you just have to fill every

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.300
bucket and pot and pan
you have in the house

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.299
whenever the water comes.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.533
The way the water utility gets their water

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.415
through pipes to the people is through

00:01:08.415 --> 00:01:10.849
these people called valve
men, and the valve men,

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:12.808
they basically go to
different neighborhoods

00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:16.740
and turn the water on and
off according to a schedule.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.739
And it should work, except
there are a lot of different

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:21.711
roadblocks along the way.

00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:23.596
There could be technical problems such as

00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:27.012
pumps being broken and
just, there's just no water.

00:01:27.012 --> 00:01:28.735
Or there could be
different social problems,

00:01:28.735 --> 00:01:30.831
like maybe the valve man is sick,

00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:32.164
or maybe their child is sick.

00:01:32.164 --> 00:01:33.729
Maybe they're on a lunch break.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.653
And they just can't get
to the valve on time.

00:01:36.653 --> 00:01:38.364
(all chattering)

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.410
And so there's a company called NextDrop,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.203
which was started by UC Berkeley students.

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:46.381
And they tell people when the
water will turn on and off

00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:48.371
because people don't really know when

00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:49.924
they're gonna get water.

00:01:49.924 --> 00:01:53.031
Our resource project was
about looking at NextDrop

00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:56.197
and seeing how its services could impact

00:01:56.197 --> 00:01:58.058
a large city like Bangalore.

00:01:58.058 --> 00:02:00.403
Valve men all have cell
phones, and they contact

00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:03.920
NextDrop every time they
open a valve or close a valve

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.530
and every time there's a delay in service.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.166
And then NextDrop takes that information

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:12.700
and sends that to the
customers, telling them,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.367
okay, your water will
be turned on in about

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.705
an hour and a half, or
your water's going to

00:02:16.705 --> 00:02:19.854
be delayed, or there's
gonna be no water today.

00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:22.690
- It's gonna take decades
to actually pull together

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.723
financing to actually
rebuild these systems.

00:02:25.723 --> 00:02:29.180
But what they've developed
is an intermediate solution

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.029
that makes it much easier
for households to cope with

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.059
what is admittedly a
more deficient service.

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.559
(light music)

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.033
- What we found were the
different inefficiencies

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:45.095
in the water utility and
the various roadblocks

00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:49.099
for valve men to give that
accurate information to NextDrop.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.672
In the developed world, we're used to just

00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:52.136
turning on the water and it's turning on

00:02:52.136 --> 00:02:53.789
and we don't know how it got there.

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.419
And to follow around
the valve men and to see

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.454
what they go through
on a day to day basis,

00:02:59.454 --> 00:03:02.508
to see pipes broken,
to see them not able to

00:03:02.508 --> 00:03:06.392
do their jobs many a times,
you can see the process

00:03:06.392 --> 00:03:09.601
that it takes to get
that water into your tap.

00:03:09.601 --> 00:03:13.791
Even valve men can be quite
crucial to the whole thing,

00:03:13.791 --> 00:03:15.379
to making water systems work.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.962
