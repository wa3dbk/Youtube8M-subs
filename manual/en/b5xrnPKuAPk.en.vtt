00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.920
Harley? You're alive?!

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.260
You survived the fall?!

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.480
Yeah no thanks to you!

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.520
Haha, did you see the way i handled Mista J?!

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.400
Pow! Bam! Boom!

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.680
Haha, Batman beat that!

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.020
Well look who's doing better without the Joker

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.540
Yes, you are far better without him

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.180
I just can't believe Mista J just left me to fall off that cliff

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.080
He didn't even try to save me...

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.800
Hmph!

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.900
Well the joke's on him!

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.000
i won't save his sorry boutonniere next time Batman tries to ruff him up

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.340
Well you sure ruffed him up

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.160
Speaking of ruffing up, i heard about some new

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.840
jewlery and gems being aquired to the Gotham Museum

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.660
Let's say we take a visit

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.940
Harley: But what about Batman?

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.980
Poison Ivy: Don't worry Harl, we'll be able to deal with him

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:56.674
Look Robin it's Joker!

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.920
Robin: Looks like someone beat us to it

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.580
HAHAHAHA!!!

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.520
Not exactly my dear delusional Dark Knight

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.820
Hello Everyone this is GCN and its that time again

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.440

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.960
Puddin...?

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.100
Alright ladies, it's just a matter of time before Batman and Robin show up

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.560
Well! Why don't we give them a warm welcome?!

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.440
Ooof!

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.520
Uh... that didn't happen Batman..

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.760
Batman: Right...

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.660
Poison Ivy, Catwoman, Harley!

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.520
You have one chance to surrender!

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.860
The last time I let my guard down you took me in!

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.960
I won't make that mistake again!

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.700
And all we have left is Harley

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.820
Stay back B-man!

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.460
Pshh, i can take Harley easily

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.860
Ack!

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.340
It wont go down as easy as you think Robbie!

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.160
Don't worry Red, i got you

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.780
Yeah, now let's go!

00:04:23.645 --> 00:04:25.485
Batman: Well that was unexpected

00:04:25.485 --> 00:04:26.865
Robin: Yeah, how did Harley get so good?

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:28.480
She was just a pushover before

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.220
Batman: Well i actually did a biological scan and it seems her

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.000
strength and speed have been upgraded due to some form of chemical experiment

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.060
Robin: From Poison Ivy I presume?

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.640
Batman: Exactly, and Catwoman must of trained her increasing her

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.120
fighting abilities as well

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.800
Robin: Great just what we need....

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.280
So now what?

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.240
Batman: We track them down take them to jail...the usual

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.620
Robin: Alright let's go

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.700
Batman: Right

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.560
*sigh*

00:04:55.114 --> 00:04:57.034
Sooo? What's wrong with you?

00:04:57.034 --> 00:04:59.474
Oh nothing Red, just need some air

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.160
Hmmm

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.880
JOKER

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.200
ooh about time you showed up Harley

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.860
Don't get your hopes up clown, i'm here for answers

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.100
Let me guess, you're here because you failed your math test and you want to cheat? haha

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.740
Harley: Not funny freak! i wanna know what happened that night

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.940
when we fought Batman on the cliff

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.780
Oh of course pumpkin Pie, what is it?

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.040
Why didn't you save me?

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.600
What do you mean?

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.840
You just stood there! Facing away from me!

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.900
You didn't even turn around!

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.180
Joker: no Harley I tried! But Batman had grabbed ahold of me

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.820
i couldn't escape!

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.620
Harley: What?

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.940
Really?

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.840
Ohh of course Poo, would i lie to you? Harley?
