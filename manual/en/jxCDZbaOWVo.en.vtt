Czajnikowy.pl - a good cup of tea!

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.990
Hello and welcome in another episode of our show.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Today Ice Tea again. As it's getting hot and there are plenty of Ice Tea variations, today we're making cold brew Rooibos.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.990
Tips and opinions, tea tests

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.990
Brewing tea, yerba mate

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.990
Forum, teashop

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.990
We've already talked about Rooibos, look at the appropriate episode about it,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.990
but there we missed the subject of cold brew Rooibos

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
while Rooibos rehydrates us intensively, so for the summer when we sweat a lot, 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it's perfect to brew this African herb. It's African red bush called Rooibos or Redbush.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.990
Let's start then. We brew Rooibos in a standard way, with hot boiling water.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.990
Then you need to cool it down. We've got it in our large jug,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.990
It's brewed with hot water, around a teaspoon or a little more for a cup,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.990
pour it over and leave it, any time you want actually.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.990
We should steep it from 3 to 5 minutes but it doesn't oversteep so you can even steep it for an hour or so.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.990
Anyway you like it. Then just cool it down, chill it well in the fridge, 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.990
and you can drink it this way, the Rooibos is ready but it's worth to make it even better.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.990
I think ice tea combines really well with citrus fruit, 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.990
so let's take some orange syrup, just a little for taste,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.990
maybe two tangerine slices, two slices of lemon, it will be more intense

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and also colourful. I wish I had a lime, it would be a good match here but maybe it's better for green tea.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.990
Here we go. Perfect. A bit of ice goes in, and finally Rooibos.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.990
It's our own recipe but I definitely recommend you to experiment with it,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.990
by adding anything that you like. Rooibos tastes really nice with a raspberry, for example.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.990
You could add some raspberry syrup, it's all up to your taste.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.990
Here's Rooibos ice tea, in our own way, I highly recommend it for hot summer days.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.990
That's all we've prepared about cold brew Rooibos for you, it's another ice tea on our list.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.990
I recommend you to experiment yourselves in this way.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.990
Don't hesitate and share your experiences with us, we're looking forward to your comments,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
