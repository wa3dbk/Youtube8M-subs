00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.529
After all these years of reviewing games and
navigating awful menus, Iíve come no closer

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.640
to understanding how developers can design
and program and create a video game...but

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.500
have so little apparent grasp of, like, basic
usability.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.590
And games like this donít really help.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.460
I mean, you can design hundreds and hundreds
of puzzles and fit them onto one cartridge...but

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.020
uh, you canít arrange them in a way that
makes the game easier to navigate, understand

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.020
and play?

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.559
Thatís like building a house without a floor
plan.

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.920
I mean, is that even possible?

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:10.010
Well, I guess it must be, because this is
Puzzler World 2012 3D for the Nintendo 3DS...a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.439
game that contends organization and ease of
use are unnecessary for a compilation ofóoh,

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.299
I donít knowóhow about 1,200 freaking puzzles?

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:26.420
Puzzles in a haystack.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.670
Just released to the 3DS, Puzzle World 3D
isóat least once you figure it outóan acceptable

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.890
compilation of puzzles.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.320
Again, there are over a thousand of them in
this thing, divided into about 25 different

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.320
varieties.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.179
Thereís the typical stuff like Sudoku, Crosswords
and Word Find...but a lot of it is less popular

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.179
stuff.

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.310
At least, stuff Iím unfamiliar with.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.899
So cool, whatever, just tell me how to play.

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:51.899
Oh, wait.

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:52.899
Thatís right.

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.060
It doesnít tell you how to play.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.560
See, thatís where the usability comes in,
and frankly, this kind of stuff really blows

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.560
my mind.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.520
The game never tells you how to play.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.890
I mean, you can navigate through multiple
pages to find a help section that provides

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.340
an overview of each game...but that doesnít
tell you how to actually operate the game.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.400
Itís like you just have to figure it out.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.750
Someone call Summer Sanders!

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.819
And actually, you have to take the same kind
of approach to just finding the puzzles, initially.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.260
The menu is just a series of icons.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.670
Itís up to you to figure out which one is
the gameís primary mode, because evidently,

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.860
intuitive arrangements is for cowards.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.740
Of course...once you find the puzzles and
decipher how to play them, theyíre fine.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.380
Iím just wondering if itís worth it.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.510
I mean, if youíre really into puzzlers, this
isnít a bad game.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.610
Itís just one that confuses me, both because
of its design...and the fact that I have no

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.190
freaking idea what to do here.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:03:00.350
Itís Puzzle World 3D 2012.
