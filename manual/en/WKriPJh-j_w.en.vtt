Hi I'm Jay French at jayfrenchstudios.com
and I'm going to show you how to draw Pokemon.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:14.099
For Pokemon we are going to start with the
main boy, the main human boy character, Pikachu's

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:29.360
friend. This style has very sharp corners,
very exaggerated and there is just a light

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:39.030
curve to this otherwise they are pretty much
sharp corners. The nose is pretty much just

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.840
a sharp angle with a curve on the inside.
There are big eyes which come just above the

00:00:46.840 --> 00:01:00.219
nose, they are really large, just sharp angles
and a much more simplified than most animates

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:06.540
but a lot of fun. Now these will be your inclines.
This line on the inside is just the separation

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.600
between the flesh tone and the white if you
are doing this in color and if you are doing

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.220
this in ink just go ahead and draw that line
for your highlight. The rest of it is just

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.580
done in solid black. You don't have a color
in this character's eyes. We have got his

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:43.890
hat and we have got some bangs that stick
out here and we have got the hair that sticks

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:55.110
out worse than Harry Potter's over here and
pretty much the same thing going on over here

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:06.240
with a very skinny neck and don't forget out
little squigglies under his eyes to show the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:16.590
top line of the cheek. Finish off with the
hat and it has a distinctive symbol on his

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:30.420
and here is our boy. So now Pikachu is fairly
simple shapes, sort of a flattened bottom

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:42.129
of a sphere for his head. His ears are just
slightly curved cones if those are ears, I'm

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:52.709
not sure, distinctive black tips. Like a lot
of animates these are more about just getting

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.350
the details accurate rather than being really
particular difficult to draw because they

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:07.459
are fairly simple shapes. His eyes we have
to highlight they are almost all black. He

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:20.099
has this cute little nose and his cat-like
mouth. He is smiling, usually just a little

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.760
shade under here to show a lot of chin and
the body is extremely simple, let's don't

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.209
forget the red cheeks. Again this will not
have an ink outline, you'll just do red cheeks

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:39.840
there or red circles there and they are perfect
spheres. His paws are extremely simple, just

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:50.190
little semi circles for his hands. His feet,
and he almost has no legs and just the little

00:03:50.190 --> 00:04:02.291
feet that looks like has feet coming straight
out of his torso, a little impression of his

00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:12.740
leg there and then a big lightening bolt tail.
There's your beginning for drawing a couple

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.699
of the characters from Pokemon.
