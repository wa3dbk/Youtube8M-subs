00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.000
Stir

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.500
I am a veteran of Hitsumabushi

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.000
So will not eat three kinds

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.200
I have decided how to eat

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.000
Wasabi

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.200
Yummy

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.900
Did you eat eel?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.900
Yummy

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.700
Green onion

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.200
Green onion is very good

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.100
Condiments

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500
Crispy

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.000
Good!

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.000
The surface of the eel is crispy, so it's very good

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.200
Eel at this restaurant is the crispy type

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.300
Do you eat it pompously the eel?

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.700
Because eel is because expensive

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.200
Tea?

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.000
This is a soup stock

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.000
There are no livers

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.000
It was very good
