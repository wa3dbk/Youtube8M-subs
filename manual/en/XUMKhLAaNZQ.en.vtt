00:00:43.303 --> 00:00:45.178
Tristan and Isolde.

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:47.365
This is the opening
of the 2nd Act.

00:00:47.365 --> 00:00:49.303
What a gorgeous solo
this is...

00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:51.381
I have...

00:00:51.944 --> 00:00:54.115
... well, three things
I want to talk about.

00:00:55.036 --> 00:00:56.365
Just firstly,

00:00:56.365 --> 00:00:58.646
when you look at the solo,
what do you see?

00:00:58.646 --> 00:00:59.709
Well,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.240
just one long slur mark.

00:01:02.944 --> 00:01:05.084
You know, this is
typical Wagner.

00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:06.204
And...

00:01:06.809 --> 00:01:09.122
We start on the low F sharp

00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:11.271
and we ascend to the high D
and down again,

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.980
so it’s one big
arching phrase.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.699
So, what does this mean?

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:16.355
What we want to
concentrate on

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:18.074
is ‘égalité’,
the French word:

00:01:18.074 --> 00:01:19.667
evenness of sound,

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:21.792
top to bottom
of the instrument.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.955
That doesn’t mean that
there won’t be

00:01:24.955 --> 00:01:26.574
a little bit more...

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:28.824
... I won’t say brighter,
but warmer at the top,

00:01:28.824 --> 00:01:32.355
so we want the different
registers of the clarinet

00:01:32.355 --> 00:01:34.761
to blend in with each other
as we go up.

00:01:35.143 --> 00:01:37.393
So, this is a great exercise

00:01:37.393 --> 00:01:39.213
for ‘égalité’,

00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:43.383
particularly
when we get to the top.

00:01:43.383 --> 00:01:46.133
So we’re gonna try
to play it very even.

00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:48.852
And I’m gonna talk
about one other thing,

00:01:48.852 --> 00:01:50.321
which is difficult.

00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:52.258
I have my metronome
here at...

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:54.515
... 60, the tempo...

00:01:55.696 --> 00:01:57.258
... half note equals 60.

00:01:57.633 --> 00:01:59.852
There’s written
on the third bar,

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:02.914
as we ascend on the A flat:
dolcissimo.

00:02:03.497 --> 00:02:05.571
So, we want to do
something special there,

00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:07.539
and how do we do that
without getting behind?

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.259
That is the great challenge.
