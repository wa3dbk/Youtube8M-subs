Hey everybody, I'm Justin with americanmuscle.com.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.490
This is my quick breakdown of the BBK chrome
one and five-eighth inch long tube headers

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.559
available for your '79 and '93 manual 5 liter
Foxbody.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.500
Before we get into all the specifics here
with these BBK long tube headers, I want to

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.450
offer a friendly reminder to subscribe to
our YouTube channel if you haven't done so

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.880
already for the most in depth product reviews
on the web in addition to the best Mustang

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.880
content.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.840
These particular long tubes from BBK do feature
the one and five-eighth inch primary or tubing,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.690
all of which has been mandrel bent to help
increase the flow and increase your performance.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.660
The one and five-eighth version I have here
with me today is definitely going to be the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.760
most popular offering for most street cars
or even cars with a pretty decent amount of

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.649
power pushing nitrous or forced induction.

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.950
I do want to point out that BBK does offer
a one and three-quarter version of this same

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.130
exact header, but unless you're gunning for
big power through big cubic inches or big

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.670
boost, I would stick with the one and five-eighth
version here for cars making 500 horsepower

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.700
or less.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.950
As you can see, these long tubes do feature
that nice, bright chrome finish which will

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.770
no doubt look good underneath the hood of
your Foxbody.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.690
For a few bucks more, guys, you can spring
for the optional ceramic coating which will

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.340
make this finish slightly more durable, and
it is going to help reduce under hood temp

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.340
slightly.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.590
Guys, this is a great time to remind you that
these long tubes will only fit your manual

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.939
5 liter Foxbody.

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.219
So, if you have an automatic car or if you're
just interested in different finishes or sizing

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.259
options, well then you should definitely head
back to the product page at americanmuscle.com

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.719
if you're not there already.

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.670
Getting into some of the smaller yet equally
important details, BBK does include laser

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.520
cut flanges with all their headers making
for an OEM-like fit.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.579
They even toss in brand new hardware and exhaust
manifold gaskets just to save you guys a trip

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:44.770
to the parts store.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.880
Installing a brand new set of long tubes onto
your Mustang can be a little intimidating

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.880
to say the least.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.080
If you don't think you have the mechanical
skills or the tools to get the job done, don't

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.259
hesitate to reach out to your local shop.

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.069
On the other hand, if something like this
is just another day in the garage for you,

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.700
well then leave yourself about a full day
in the garage to get the job done.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.060
Don't hesitate to reach out to a Mustang expert
if you should have any questions.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.440
Before we wrap up this overview, I do want
to remind you that when you do use a set of

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.170
long tubes like the BBKs here, you will need
to address your midpipe because the factory

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.850
midpipe will no longer work.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.580
In this case, of course, BBK recommends going
with their shorty midpipe which is available

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.830
on the site here in both X or H pipe configurations.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.260
Either way, if you do have any more questions
about this, again, just reach out to a Mustang

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.290
expert anytime.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.560
If you're looking for a set of long tube headers
for your push rod 5.0 at a very fair price

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.420
then you have to check out the one and five-eighth
inch chrome long tube headers from BBK available

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.470
here at americanmuscle.com.
