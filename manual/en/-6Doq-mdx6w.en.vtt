00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:11.014
Hmmm, that's not what we want, is it?

00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:13.661
Today's digital cameras do a lot for us,

00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:16.398
but there's no replacement for the human eye.

00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:17.413
It's important to learn

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:19.965
how cameras work with light to create an image,

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:21.669
that way we'll know what's going on

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.836
when it's time to capture a moment.

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:25.256
There are three variables

00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:27.462
that determine if you're getting the right amount of light

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:29.216
for the correct exposure.

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:30.342
With a manual camera,

00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:33.521
we're able to change any of the variable ourselves.

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:36.633
Different settings can result in really different pictures.

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:39.592
Let's look at the process together.

00:00:39.592 --> 00:00:41.217
First, see this here?

00:00:41.217 --> 00:00:42.944
This is the aperture.

00:00:42.944 --> 00:00:45.259
It's the hole that light passes through.

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:46.721
If we make the aperture big,

00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:48.444
we'll have more light, true,

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:50.358
but the sharpness of your photo will decrease

00:00:50.358 --> 00:00:52.351
very quickly from your focus point,

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:53.701
backward and forward.

00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:56.451
This is what we call shallow depth of field.

00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:58.215
If we have a very small aperture,

00:00:58.215 --> 00:01:01.294
we'll have less light but a deeper depth of field.

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.745
For portraits, it can be nice to have a sharp figure

00:01:03.745 --> 00:01:05.989
separate from a somewhat blurry background

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:08.494
so I would suggest a large aperture.

00:01:08.494 --> 00:01:10.720
Aperture is measured in f-stops.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.280
This can get a little confusing

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.617
because lower numbers mean bigger apertures

00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:17.735
and higher numbers mean smaller apertures.

00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:20.505
Next, there's shutter speed to think about.

00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:21.923
The shutter acts like a curtain

00:01:21.923 --> 00:01:23.386
that covers the sensor,

00:01:23.386 --> 00:01:26.529
and it only opens when you release the shutter button.

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:27.856
If we want less light,

00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:30.016
we open the shutter for a shorter time.

00:01:30.016 --> 00:01:31.226
If we want more light,

00:01:31.226 --> 00:01:32.819
we open it for a longer time,

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.197
but we run the risk of getting

00:01:34.197 --> 00:01:36.149
a motion-blurred picture.

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.863
The speed is measured in seconds

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:40.415
and fractions of seconds.

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:43.319
For shooting sports or anything with a lot of movement,

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.118
we'll need faster speeds.

00:01:45.118 --> 00:01:46.863
For taking awesome night landscapes,

00:01:46.863 --> 00:01:48.739
longer exposures will be better,

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:50.492
but we'll need a tripod to steady the shot

00:01:50.492 --> 00:01:52.591
and prevent motion blur.

00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:54.952
Another cool thing we can do with light exposures

00:01:54.952 --> 00:01:56.366
is light painting,

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:57.667
drawing in the dark with a torch

00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:59.630
or the light of a cell phone.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.302
Lastly, ISO sensitivity controls

00:02:02.302 --> 00:02:04.864
how sensitive the sensor is to light.

00:02:04.864 --> 00:02:06.386
If we use low sensitivity,

00:02:06.386 --> 00:02:09.027
we'll need more light to register a photo.

00:02:09.027 --> 00:02:10.179
With a higher sensitivity,

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.452
we'll be able to get a picture

00:02:11.452 --> 00:02:13.527
with less available light.

00:02:13.527 --> 00:02:16.184
100 ISO is a low sensitivity,

00:02:16.184 --> 00:02:19.355
while 6400 ISO is a high one.

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:21.191
If we increase sensitivity,

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:22.835
we'll be able to use faster speeds

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:24.202
and smaller apertures,

00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:26.698
but we'll get noisier images.

00:02:26.698 --> 00:02:28.112
Good thing we have something to tell us

00:02:28.112 --> 00:02:29.990
if we're getting the correct amount of light

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.257
to get a good exposure,

00:02:31.257 --> 00:02:32.865
the light meter.

00:02:32.865 --> 00:02:34.079
Sound good to you?

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.246
Now it's time to get out there

00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:36.588
and practice taking pictures

00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:38.350
under different conditions,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.117
so you know what to do

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:41.994
any time you want to take the best picture.
