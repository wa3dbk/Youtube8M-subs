00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.810
If your washer fills with water but does
not agitate

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.010
or spin, you may need to reset

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.140
your washer motor. 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.609
The Hydrowave washer is equipped with a direct-drive system. This system does not require

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:23.630
a transmission

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.630
to agitate or spin. So, the motor takes
on a larger role in the drive system.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.050
If your washer senses something unusual,
for example, a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.780
power spike, an unbalanced load, or a
disruption in power,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.960
it may send a fault code to your motor.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.680
This fault code can shut down the drive
system.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.880
The drive system could very well be fine,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.050
you as a consumer can reset the motor.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.050
No tools are required. Please follow
these 3 easy steps.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:06.110
One: power down the unit by unplugging the washer from the outlet.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.370
Two: 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.370
wait approximately one minute and plug the washer back into the outlet.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.750
Three:

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.450
you now have 30 seconds

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.299
after the unit is powered up to lift and
lower the lid

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.090
six times.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.679
Once you start lifting and lowering the
lid, you must complete the cycle

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:41.679
six times within 12 seconds.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.600
 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.600
In order to perform this action
correctly,

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.740
look at the underside of your lid and
you will see a magnet

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.170
in the front right corner.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.549
When the lid is closed, this magnet
activates the lid switch

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.060
which is just below the little plastic
rectangle

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.229
that the magnet rests on in the closed
position.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.010
On some, but not all models, you may hear the lid

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.570
switch clicking as you raise and lower
the lid.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.610
Regardless of your model

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.780
and whether or not you hear the clicking
sound, just make sure to fully close the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.330
lid

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.350
as instructed.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.310
You only need to lift the lid two inches

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.300
to break this connection.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.879
Your motor is now reset. Begin by running

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:44.290
a small load without placing clothes in the
unit.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.510
If the unit fills and starts

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.300
agitating, you can place your clothes
inside and complete the wash cycle.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.260
If the unit does not agitate or

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.460
if after several loads of clothing your
washer stops again,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.540
please call for service: 1-800-GE-CARES.
