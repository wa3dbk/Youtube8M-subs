00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:15.890
Here’s an interesting letter from Florence
who lives in Minneapolis: "Dear Mary, my granddaughter

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.120
is to be married in a few months.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.120
I had figured I would wear the dress I wear
to all nice events.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.230
It’s served me well for the last 10 years
and is a very tasteful navy blue.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.130
My daughter is insisting that I buy a new
dress.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.010
She doesn’t want photos of me in the same
dress I wore to my grandson’s wedding a

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.480
few years ago.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.710
I think it’s ridiculous to spend money when
I have a perfectly fine dress here at home.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.040
My daughter has offered to pay for the dress
but I’m just not interested.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.989
So, do I stand firm and wear my navy blue
dress or give in and get a new one?"

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.030
Florence, dear.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.210
Would this be the navy blue dress that has
been dry-cleaned so often it can stand alone

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.930
in the corner of your closet with no visible
means of support?

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.150
And might you have bought this dress 10 years
and 17 pounds ago?

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.310
And when you say the dress is a ‘tasteful’
navy blue, I am wondering if tasteful is a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.710
euphemism for shapeless, as in something my
grandmother wouldn’t even have worn and

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.960
she was the queen of shabby chic.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.240
Frugality is a virtue, certainly, but even
in 3rd world countries you are not only allowed

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.460
but you are encouraged to buy a new dress
every 10 years.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.290
Your daughter is being as tactful as she can
Florence but don’t push it.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.460
I think you should let her buy you that new
dress and maybe to avoid future temptation,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.970
you ought to shred the navy blue.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:58.710
Or maybe burn it.
