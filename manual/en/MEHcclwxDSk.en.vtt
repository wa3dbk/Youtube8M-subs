00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:15.105
Hey, my name is Eric Ebeling, I am the Penn State Athletics Concession manager

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:20.176
On game day, my job is to make sure all hundred and eight thousand people that attend the game

00:00:20.176 --> 00:00:22.899
have something to eat if they so choose.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:28.037
Preparing to feed 108,000 people is a big task, takes a lot of number crunching

00:00:28.037 --> 00:00:31.009
Weather is a huge determining factor on what products we're going to sell.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.071
If it's cold, obviously the hot chocolate is going to sell, if it's warm, we're going to do a lot

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:41.320
of water, cold drinks, that type of thing. It's fairly easy for us to determine what kind of

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.508
game we think we're going to have. It takes quite a few people to run the concession operation at Beaver Stadium.

00:00:46.508 --> 00:00:53.476
There's four full time guys that I work with every day, then game days we have fifty stand supervisors

00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:58.115
as paid employees by Penn State, and then we have over a thousand volunteer people within groups

00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:01.125
that come in and work for the concession stands themselves.

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:06.071
We choose to use volunteer groups, first of all, because of the vast amount of people that we need.

00:01:06.071 --> 00:01:13.187
Trying to get a thousand people, as far as wage-payroll type of thing, to work, that's actually very difficult

00:01:13.187 --> 00:01:17.906
It's a great money-maker for these groups to come in and get a sizeable check to take back

00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:21.172
to their organization so it's a great benefit for them as well to come work at Penn State.

00:01:21.172 --> 00:01:27.067
Hi, I'm Suzie Elder and I'm an associate professor of Theatre at Penn State University

00:01:27.067 --> 00:01:33.463
but I have another role and that is I am the wife of the minister at First Presbyterian Church

00:01:33.463 --> 00:01:41.235
in Bellefonte. There was folks who are members of our congregation who had been running  concession stand.

00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:48.192
They no longer wanted that stand and they came to our governing body and said it was a

00:01:48.192 --> 00:01:53.154
wonderful fundraising opportunity and would the church be interested in taking over this stand.

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:58.089
It's right in the student section right in Gate A when you walk in through the stadiums.

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:09.136
Currently we have one student working with us, his name is Luke, and he will be working

00:02:09.136 --> 00:02:16.128
for three games, so he will receive a total of about twenty one community service hours.

00:02:16.128 --> 00:02:21.131
I was in trouble off campus with the State College Police Department.

00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:26.057
With that I was assigned to have a case with Judicial Affairs.

00:02:26.057 --> 00:02:32.066
We don't ask the students why they are there, why they are serving community service time.

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:37.126
The first thing they do is we hand the students a bank of a hundred and fifty dollars

00:02:37.126 --> 00:02:45.242
and we ask them to take the product of whatever it might be, bottled water, hot chocolate, hot dogs, pretzels, whatever

00:02:45.242 --> 00:02:49.113
And we ask them to go about and sell the product.

00:02:49.113 --> 00:02:54.630
Everyone kind of was very open to me coming in, some people did because of their past experience

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.134
with volunteers were kind of skeptical of what I was bringing to the table.

00:02:58.134 --> 00:03:02.644
But I think I made a good impression on them and therefore they were willing to open up to me

00:03:02.644 --> 00:03:07.557
and be very friendly towards me. If you're willing to find more people like myself

00:03:07.557 --> 00:03:13.082
we're willing to go out there and kind of give it a hundred and ten percent, and this can be very successful.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:22.911
The funnest part about my job is the chaos. It does keep me busy, there's a lot of different little problems that come up

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:28.080
and things that you have to try to plan and predict and organize. It's not just an every day behind the

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.002
desk type job, I mean, we're out, then we're in, intermixing with a hundred thousand people at a game.

00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:40.048
We've had some great seasons lately, and to be part of that, and to be part of the roar in Beaver Stadium, it's pretty exciting.

00:03:42.094 --> 00:03:48.168
Hi, my name is Jeff Tom, I am a senior right now studying advertising with a minor in Chinese.

00:03:48.168 --> 00:03:53.732
And I am also part of the Asian American Christian Fellowship and currently serve as their president.

00:03:53.732 --> 00:04:01.043
Our group has been doing concessions for a little over eleven years. Penn State University gave the student union

00:04:01.043 --> 00:04:06.157
the student organizations a great opportunity to work at the concessions as a means of

00:04:06.157 --> 00:04:11.824
financing their organization or group. And being that our group has a history here we were one of the first

00:04:11.824 --> 00:04:16.291
groups to jump on the opportunity where they started letting students run the concessions.

00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:20.176
You see a lot of the backdrop, the responsibility that you need, and the preparation that

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:26.010
have to come to run the stand but it also gives you a better view of the big picture, which is

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.054
why we do the concession stands and why it's really necessary.

00:04:29.054 --> 00:04:34.942
A lot of the money that we raise during our concession really goes to funding people so that they can go

00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:42.068
to retreats, so they can go to conferences, and so that we can make the price for going to these retreats and

00:04:42.068 --> 00:04:48.832
conferences very, very convenient for the students. Ultimately, we want to serve the student body in the sense

00:04:48.832 --> 00:04:55.084
that we give them that opportunity to go really learn more and go continue to grow.

00:04:55.084 --> 00:05:01.796
So, a lot of the things that we do here aims towards the Asian American population and also the International Students

00:05:01.796 --> 00:05:07.240
because when they do come here we want to give them the chance to hear about the gospel

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.931
to hear about what Jesus did for them, and then ultimately, build relationships with them.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.825
I'm Addie Miller, I'm a forward for the Penn State Lady Icers, the women's ice hockey team here.

00:05:19.825 --> 00:05:25.064
We're a club sport, actually, but we have some varsity priviledges, the men's team, the Icers

00:05:25.064 --> 00:05:29.239
want to go up D1 at some point, so we want to be ready to go up with them.

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:34.953
Girls don't play ice hockey much in this area, ice hockey is an uncommon sport for even guys

00:05:34.953 --> 00:05:39.960
in this area, but we're working on building it up. We do get some physical games, I mean, you don't quite

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.139
get the bone crushing checks such as you might get in the guys games, it's actually illegal for us to check

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:54.640
but body contact is allowed, so, you have to know how to hit. We get a little bit of money from the University, I'm not sure

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.568
of the exact amount, in addition to the money that the University gives us, we work the concession stand,

00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:04.145
at the home football games. It's a huge benefit for us, it's a really good team-building exercise

00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:08.066
especially, it's at the beginning of the year, so you're just getting to know all the new players

00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:12.035
you're there with the same people the entire day, and you really get to know them, get to know

00:06:12.035 --> 00:06:16.412
what they're like, and it helps us better communicate with each other. Especially when that

00:06:16.412 --> 00:06:21.751
first half time rush hits, it just starts getting crazy, and we get a little overwhelmed

00:06:21.751 --> 00:06:25.170
but, you know, we take a breath and get it all done.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.598
Come and see us, just give us one chance, and we'll prove to you that we're something you wanna see

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:35.954
we'll entertain you, it'll be fun...Hockey, especially in this area, not a lot of people play

00:06:35.954 --> 00:06:42.022
So, come out, give us a chance, see what we're all about, and we'll probably win you over.

00:06:42.022 --> 00:06:46.977
My name's Eric Ebeling and I want you to come enjoy Penn State Football, and a hot dog.
