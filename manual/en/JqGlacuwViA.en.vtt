00:00:01.245 --> 00:00:03.248
- [Voiceover] This is lecture 13

00:00:03.248 --> 00:00:04.839
in the Fiber Optic Association

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.113
series of lectures on fiber optics.

00:00:08.113 --> 00:00:12.196
This one is about visual
testing of fiber optics.

00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:20.329
Seeing what goes on in fiber
optics can be difficult,

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.489
because the human eye is not sensitive

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.872
to the infrared light that
we use for transmission.

00:00:25.872 --> 00:00:27.485
It's invisible to most people,

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:31.679
although some can see out
in the 850 nanometer range.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.402
So what we do is we use
visible light sources

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:38.069
to view fibers, or we use a unique tool

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:41.236
that allows you to see infrared light.

00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:48.414
Although our eye is not
sensitive to infrared light,

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.557
digital cameras are.

00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:54.679
The top photo you see here was
shot with a digital camera,

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.127
and the bottom was actually shot with

00:00:56.127 --> 00:00:59.170
a digital camera in a cell phone.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.848
You can use them to check
for power in the fiber,

00:01:02.848 --> 00:01:04.736
to make sure it's safe for example.

00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:07.738
Before you inspect the
connector with a microscope.

00:01:07.738 --> 00:01:10.157
Or you can use them to trace fibers.

00:01:10.157 --> 00:01:13.143
There's a complete YouTube
video about the FOA,

00:01:13.143 --> 00:01:17.060
that shows how to do
this, be sure to watch it.

00:01:18.402 --> 00:01:20.046
One gadget everybody who works with

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.622
fibers should have is a visual tracer.

00:01:22.622 --> 00:01:25.526
Some of the use flashlights like this one,

00:01:25.526 --> 00:01:29.118
some use LEDs, some use visible lasers.

00:01:29.118 --> 00:01:33.504
They use to check fiber
continuity, and confirm polarity.

00:01:33.504 --> 00:01:36.374
That means that the fiber link

00:01:36.374 --> 00:01:39.173
connects a transmitter to a receiver.

00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:43.344
Polarity is often the first
problem that people encounter,

00:01:43.344 --> 00:01:47.511
when they're trying to
connect fiber optic systems.

00:01:50.314 --> 00:01:53.107
A visual fault locator
is a similar device,

00:01:53.107 --> 00:01:56.426
but it uses a higher powered red laser,

00:01:56.426 --> 00:01:58.905
that has enough power that
you can actually not only

00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:01.615
trace fibers, but you can see breaks

00:02:01.615 --> 00:02:04.948
or stress-induced by bends in the fiber.

00:02:06.704 --> 00:02:09.621
It's really good, for
example, for finding cracks

00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:13.752
that occur in fibers when
they're placed in splice trays.

00:02:13.752 --> 00:02:16.835
Or to find problems with patch cords.

00:02:20.438 --> 00:02:22.334
Another use for a visual fault locator

00:02:22.334 --> 00:02:24.919
is to optimize mechanical splices.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:29.385
Or to use it with pre-polished
splice connectors,

00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:32.943
to optimize the splice
in the connector itself.

00:02:32.943 --> 00:02:36.397
You simply attached a visual
fault locator to the fiber,

00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:40.933
and the light that's lost in
the connection will be aglow,

00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:44.909
bright red glow, and
you can minimize that,

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.573
and get the lowest possible
loss from the splice.

00:02:48.573 --> 00:02:51.554
It's a simple process,
been used for many years

00:02:51.554 --> 00:02:54.471
in fiber optics to great advantage.

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.886
We also do visual inspection
with a microscope.

00:03:00.886 --> 00:03:03.082
We look at the end of connector ferrules.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.411
When we're doing terminations,

00:03:04.411 --> 00:03:07.425
we use it to determine
the quality of the polish

00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:09.848
on the connector end, or find scratches

00:03:09.848 --> 00:03:12.037
or cracks in the fiber, so that we

00:03:12.037 --> 00:03:15.046
might end up rejecting a connector.

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:17.946
On any connector we use
it for looking at dirt,

00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:21.146
or other contamination on
the end of the ferrule.

00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:25.256
Typically we use magnifications
of about 100 to 400 times,

00:03:25.256 --> 00:03:29.020
and we use both direct
and side illumination,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.187
so they can show us different things

00:03:31.187 --> 00:03:35.020
about the end of the
ferrule of the connector.

00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:41.332
Here's two views of the end
of the same connector ferrule.

00:03:41.332 --> 00:03:44.280
The direct view, with core illumination,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.061
allows us to see if there are
any defects near the core,

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.655
and to determine if the fiber

00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:52.101
is well aligned in the ferrule.

00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:54.681
But when we look at it with an angle view,

00:03:54.681 --> 00:03:56.406
either illuminating from the side,

00:03:56.406 --> 00:03:58.572
or looking at the connector at an angle,

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:01.299
we can see that this particular fiber

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.253
has been chipped during
the termination process,

00:04:05.253 --> 00:04:07.740
and has epoxy residue on it.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.351
This is also a good method to look at

00:04:09.351 --> 00:04:12.518
connectors when you want to find dirt.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.016
Visual inspection will
show you dirty connectors,

00:04:18.016 --> 00:04:20.879
and show you how well you've cleaned them.

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.748
Look at the size of the piece of dirt

00:04:22.748 --> 00:04:26.831
on this connector, it's
almost as large as the 62.5

00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:29.670
micron core of the multi-mode fiber.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.968
And there are other large pieces of dirt

00:04:31.968 --> 00:04:34.541
near the end of the connector.

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:37.770
These come from exposure
to the environment,

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.617
and actually from what
people call dust caps,

00:04:41.617 --> 00:04:44.396
which at least one
installer I know claims are

00:04:44.396 --> 00:04:48.936
called dust caps because they're
usually filled with dust.

00:04:48.936 --> 00:04:51.319
We inspect the connectors
with the microscope,

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.961
and clean then properly,
then inspect the again,

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:58.128
to make sure they're properly
cleaned each time we use them.

00:05:00.823 --> 00:05:03.361
On singlemode connectors we
do another type of visual

00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:06.472
inspection using an interferometer.

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:09.772
The interferometer can
measure the end surface of the

00:05:09.772 --> 00:05:14.648
connector, and actually
determine the shape of the PC,

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:19.404
or physical contact finished
dome of the ferrule.

00:05:19.404 --> 00:05:22.746
Interferometry is only used
with singlemode connectors

00:05:22.746 --> 00:05:25.776
generally, and it's only a lab instrument,

00:05:25.776 --> 00:05:27.693
not a field instrument.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.916
Interferometers show us three
parameters of singlemode

00:05:37.814 --> 00:05:40.665
dome polished connectors.

00:05:40.665 --> 00:05:44.368
The radius of curvature, the
eccentricity of the dome,

00:05:44.368 --> 00:05:47.149
or is the dome centered on the fiber,

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:48.631
and whether the fiber has been

00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:52.170
undercut during the polishing process.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.273
It's an extremely sensitive
way of determining

00:05:55.273 --> 00:05:58.356
the quality of singlemode connectors.

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:04.336
The FOA has a number of
other YouTube lectures,

00:06:04.336 --> 00:06:07.674
including many on fiber optic testing,

00:06:07.674 --> 00:06:10.568
as well as those in the
basics of fiber optics,

00:06:10.568 --> 00:06:13.984
fiber optic components,
fiber optic network design,

00:06:13.984 --> 00:06:15.369
and installation.

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:17.708
See our other YouTube
videos, and of course,

00:06:17.708 --> 00:06:21.875
don't forget, our online reference
guide on the FOA website.

00:06:26.992 --> 00:06:29.261
We're the Fiber Optic Association,

00:06:29.261 --> 00:06:31.650
the professional society of fiber optics.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.604
On our websites, you'll find lots of

00:06:33.604 --> 00:06:37.021
technical information about fiber optics.
