What's up guys stuart Edge here? We just got done filming and

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:06.029
came to my car, and we saw this note.

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.058
It said "I tried to pull into the spot next to you

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.019
but the person on the left side was parked horribly in the process. I scratched the back left side of your car."

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.528
This is the damage. As you can see it's horrible

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.789
[I] mean look at this! Not really. It's not bad at all. "Please contact me

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.179
and we get it taken care of my number is (this)..." But I was like,  "Hey,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.429
this is a very honest person, let's reward them for their honesty!" The plan is to have Jenica

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.020
my friend over here, she's pregnant with a baby, have her call

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.559
Sydney and then Sydney's gonna be like "Oh my gosh! I hit a woman's car." Hi, Sydney! My name is Jenica

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.169
I got your note about the scratch on my car...

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.759
Would Aggie Ice Cream be okay? Can you meet me there? [Yeah!] Okay! Thanks for calling me! Bye!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I didn't want to say I was pregnant! I got nervous!

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.830
She's pregnant, but she didn't want to say that. I'm already gonna be there and so when she shows up

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm just going to start having a conversation with her. Like, "How's your day been? What happened today?

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.000
What's your name?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.860
My name's Sydnee.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.860
Nice to meet you. What are you here for?

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.180
Well, I hit this girl's car today, so I have to give my insurance information.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.280
That sucks.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.280
I should make her feel really bad and be like,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.800
"Ooo, that's like that's $200 in damage sometimes.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.800
So have you ever hit somebody's car before?

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.780
No. I'm an excellent driver.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.520
Really?

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.300
It was dumb.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.860
Except for today?

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.600
That happen to me one time. It cost me like $200 to fix. My insurance went up like a hundred bucks that month.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.920
Yeah, and I don't want that.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.560
Did she seem like a nice person?

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.040
Oh yeah. She was way nice.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.820
That's the worst, though, the ones that sound nice are usually like the ones that just..

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.060
"I need you to give me this and this..."

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.520
Yeah! That's cool, though that you were honest.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.400
I'm hoping that, just because I was honest nothing will come from it.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.320
But, I'll feel better about myself, anyways.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.060
Well... cool...

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.500
I appreciate honest people

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500
That should take care of it.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.860
What is this?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.920
I just got back from work and had some extra cash, so, I figure you could use it more than me.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.240
No! You're kidding!

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.000
I just appreciate honest people.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.040
You're kidding me!

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.240
No, I'm serious, yeah. I've been in your situation before and I know how hard it can be, so, this is yours.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.260
Can I hug you?

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.080
Sure, yeah.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.920
I'm going to cry!

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.600
Oh, don't cry!

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.480
Honestly, that is the best!

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.420
Yeah, cause you hit my car.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.300
I hit your car?

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.800
Yeah!

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.860
Who was calling?

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.180
And I was just filming you. I was pranking you.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.360
I hate you! But, I love you!

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.160
No! Yeah, you use it!

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.520
But, you're car!

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.520
It's like "that" big.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.580
Do you promise?

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.960
Yeah, I promise. Yeah.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.460

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.080

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.400

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.400

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.840

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.460

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.890
"That's all folks! See ya later!

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.419
