00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.545
It was a day of celebration.
An amazing event had taken place.

00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:09.995
After 70 years
the children and children’s children

00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:13.758
had returned to Jerusalem,
to their ancestral home.

00:00:13.758 --> 00:00:18.814
Nehemiah, their temporary governor,
had faced many obstacles

00:00:18.814 --> 00:00:21.202
with them to get them to this point.

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:26.360
There were Sanballat and Tobiah, 
political and religious enemies.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.718
There were false prophets and prophetesses,
false brethren and false accusations.

00:00:33.718 --> 00:00:38.480
Tobiah and his son even
married into Jewish families,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.819
to try and sneak in
and mess up God's people.

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:48.731
And despite the looming threat
of extinction by Israel's adversaries,

00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:55.541
the Lord had caused the wall of Jerusalem
to be built around the city

00:00:55.541 --> 00:01:01.653
in just 52 days!
What a feat!

00:01:01.653 --> 00:01:04.206
Now the people were
resettled in their cities

00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:07.121
and it was time for
the Feast of Tabernacles,

00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:13.342
for Ezra the priest to read to them
out of a copy of the Law of Moses

00:01:13.342 --> 00:01:18.905
to the people – all 50,000 of them.

00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:20.924
There was just one problem.

00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:26.306
A lot of people didn’t understand
the Hebrew terms anymore.

00:01:26.306 --> 00:01:28.669
What’s a priest to do?

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:32.165
Hi, I’m David Daniels
from Chick Publications.

00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:35.865
This was a classic opportunity
to “update” the Bible.

00:01:35.865 --> 00:01:39.109
There were terms
the young people did not know.

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:42.192
There were concepts
the next generation had never been taught.

00:01:42.192 --> 00:01:47.826
And who knows? The parents may have even
come up to Ezra and said, 

00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:54.036
"Remember, Ezra –
you don’t want to lose the young people!"

00:01:54.036 --> 00:01:56.408
Ezra could have made
“cultural substitutes”

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:59.675
—that is, he could have taken elements
of Babylonian culture

00:01:59.675 --> 00:02:06.399
and put them to substitute
for the old Bible words.

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.946
He could have made an RBV,
Revised Babylonian Version, Youth Edition.

00:02:11.946 --> 00:02:14.744
It was a perfect opportunity.
It was classic!

00:02:14.744 --> 00:02:18.226
But did he? Not a chance!

00:02:18.226 --> 00:02:21.415
Ezra did what God commissioned him,
as a priest

00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:28.865
and his people, the Levites, to do:
he arranged to teach the people.

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:33.898
The priests and the Levites circulated among the people,

00:02:33.898 --> 00:02:38.646
helping them to understand God's words –

00:02:38.646 --> 00:02:44.109
but they read every word
of what God had said, to them.

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.095
They didn’t change a word!

00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:49.172
Take a look for yourself in Nehemiah 8:8.

00:02:49.172 --> 00:02:57.283
8 "So they read in the book
in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense,

00:02:57.283 --> 00:03:01.667
and caused them
to understand the reading."

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:04.181
That’s what God has called us
as Christians to do.

00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:11.394
The Lord Jesus Christ,
in Matthew 28:19-20 said,

00:03:11.394 --> 00:03:14.504
19 "Go ye therefore,
and teach all nations,

00:03:14.504 --> 00:03:19.236
baptizing them in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:24.406
20 Teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever I have commanded you:

00:03:24.406 --> 00:03:31.638
and, lo, I am with you alway,
even unto the end of the world. Amen."

00:03:31.638 --> 00:03:37.654
Teach them. Then when they’re saved,
teach them some more.

00:03:37.654 --> 00:03:42.617
We cannot compromise God’s words
with “cultural equivalents”

00:03:42.617 --> 00:03:48.395
and then pass them off as scripture.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.037
I believe these examples
from the scriptures.

00:03:51.037 --> 00:03:55.852
And I will read my Bible, God's words,

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:58.500
the King James Bible,
God’s preserved words in English,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.127
and I will gladly help them
"to understand the reading.”

00:04:06.127 --> 00:04:09.635
That way they’ll be lifted up,
to understand God’s words,

00:04:09.635 --> 00:04:15.098
instead of (dare I say it?)
dumbing-down the holy scripture of God.

00:04:15.098 --> 00:04:21.471
That way we can observe to do
all things that Christ has commanded us,

00:04:21.471 --> 00:04:27.404
without compromising.
And Christ will be with us.

00:04:27.404 --> 00:04:31.066
I hope you will join me
in not dumbing-down

00:04:31.066 --> 00:04:34.927
—I mean, updating— the words of God.

00:04:34.927 --> 00:04:45.796
God bless you, and have a wonderful day.
