00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.290
Ok folks, in this clip, we're going to talk
about how to learn to use your video camera.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.790
You can read as many manuals as you want,
but as I see it, there is but one solution

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.210
to this problem. Pick up your camera, go outside,
and start shooting. I don't care if you don't

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.880
even know where the record button is yet,
you will figure it out. Basically, that's

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.890
my way of saying, get out there and shoot.
That is by far the best way to learn. Jump

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.610
into the water with both feet. You're not
going to be perfect right off the bat, but

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.590
you'll start to pick things up. The first
thing you're going to want to do, is probably

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.550
learn how to turn it on. To do that, you're
probably going to have to have some sort of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.620
power source, so learn how to place the battery
on your camera, give it some power. Secondly,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.809
learn how to turn it on, find the power switch.
Once the camera is on, there are literally

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.980
now, dozen and dozens of options available
to you. First and foremost, of which, is to

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.079
actually start recording, so you're going
to want to locate that record button. Press

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.920
record. The camera is now rolling. Now, at
this point, you're going to want to learn

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.149
where a couple of things are. You want to
learn where the focus ring is, which is usually

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.150
located right on the end of your lens. You're
going to want to learn how to adjust the light

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.210
settings, which are either usually located
within the cameras menu, along the side of

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.030
the camera, or sometimes if you're lucky,
even on the camera lens itself. You're going

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.020
to want to learn where the in camera microphone
is, so that you can be careful about recording

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.799
sounds. The camera microphone is usually located
on the top,and you're going to want to learn

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.770
how to switch your camera, into VCR mode,
once you're done recording, and learn how

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.340
to rewind, play, or fast forward, as the case
may be.You're going to want to locate all

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.590
these individual areas on your camera, using
the manual, if you need to, but once you really

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.369
start to get rolling with the camera, you'll
see very quickly that it is not all that complicated.

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.280
Obviously, there's a great many things you
can learn about the intricacies of different

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.220
settings, but at the end of the day, it's
very, very easy to pick up the camera, and

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.370
actually start recording footage, so my suggestion,
get out there,and learn from experience.
