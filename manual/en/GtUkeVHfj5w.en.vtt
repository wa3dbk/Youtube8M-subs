Narrator:
Welcome to the West Wing Week, your guide to everything that's

00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:06.133
happening at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.867
This week, "Mailbag:
Summer Edition!"

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:10.734
But before we get to some
letters and e-mails,

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:12.800
a scene from the
President's week.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.533
On Friday, President Obama
welcomed newly-confirmed Supreme

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.133
Court Justice Elena
Kagan to the White House.

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.367
Kagan, who earned bipartisan
support in the Senate,

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:23.600
will be just the fourth woman
to serve on the Supreme Court.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.900
Before hosting an event
in the East Room for her,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.166
the two met in the Oval Office
where the President signed her

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.000
official paperwork.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.667
The President:
There you go.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:31.533
Justice Kagan:
Wow!

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.433
The President:
How about that?

00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:33.500
That's, you know,
that's pretty cool!

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.333
Justice Kagan:
That's pretty cool.

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.133
The President:
Absolutely.

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.367
How do you feel --
has it hit you yet?

00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:37.433
Justice Kagan:
Not yet.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:38.333
The President:
I don't think it will.

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.433
Justice Kagan:
How long did it take you?

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:40.467
The President:
Um --

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:42.767
Narrator:
Our first letter comes from Jonathan Talcott in Pittsburgh,

00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:46.100
Pennsylvania, and it, too,
deals with official paperwork.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.500
Jonathan asks: "Does the
President receive stamps in his

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.433
passport when he travels?"

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:53.433
To find out, we started with the
President's personal secretary,

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:54.600
Katie Johnson.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.633
Ms. Johnson:
The President does
indeed have a passport.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:59.633
In fact, one of my first jobs
when I got here was to fill out

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:04.066
the President's application for
his new passport after he became President.

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:07.900
And in the application form, there's a box that says "occupation."

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.133
And for the President, I got to
put "President of the United

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.867
States," which took up
more than the entire box.

00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:14.700
Narrator:
Where is it kept?

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.567
Ms. Johnson:
His passport is under the safekeeping of our Advance Staff

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:21.500
over in the Eisenhower
Executive Office Building.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.633
Mr. Whichard:
Hey, Jonathan, we're in the White House Scheduling Advance

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:26.367
Office where we actually keep
the President's passport in our

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:29.200
safe here along with all of
the other White House staff

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.233
passports, so I'll open it
up and I'll show you the

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:36.567
President's passport.

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:37.800
So here is our safe.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.033
We keep the President's
passport in the file marked

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.900
"POTUS Passports."

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.834
So here's the cover page.

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:46.133
The President's
signature is on it.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:49.667
And yes, he gets Customs stamps
just like everybody else does.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.333
So this is the back page of
the President's passport,

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:57.700
the endorsements page.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.567
If you zoom in you will find out
that the bearer of this passport

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:03.934
is the President of
the United States.

00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:05.500
Narrator:
Our next letter is
from Jim Bartell in

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.033
Palm Desert, California.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:09.166
Jim writes: "I would like to
know when someone like me,

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:12.333
who is 60 years of age and
has a preexisting condition --

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:15.567
needs two hips replaced -- and
having paid health insurance all

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:18.300
my adult life with the exception
of the last four years,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.967
will be able to get insurance?

00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:22.467
I cannot get health insurance
now because of the hips without

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:25.934
paying around a thousand dollars
a month which is out of reach for me."

00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:27.800
To find out the answer to the
question we asked a genuine

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.166
authority on the subject, the
Secretary of Health and Human

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:32.834
Services, Kathleen Sebelius.

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:36.133
Secretary Sebelius:
Jim, thank you so much for
your letter to the President.

00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:38.567
You've just described a
situation that millions of

00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:41.467
Americans find themselves in
where they have a preexisting

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:45.500
condition and they get priced
out of the insurance market.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.500
The good news is that the
Affordable Care Act does bring

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.066
some relief to your situation.

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:54.266
Step one is that every state
in the country will have a

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:59.867
preexisting condition pool set
up and running by August of this

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:02.066
year in 2010.

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:06.200
The second option is this year
rules will change for private

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.166
insurance companies so they can
no longer limit the amount of

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:15.667
yearly payments that they make
to benefit someone who has a

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:16.967
preexisting condition.

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:21.266
And they can't put an annual cap
on treatments that you receive.

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:24.500
A lot of people who have
cancer or have an illness find

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.500
themselves paying their monthly
premiums only to run out of

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.734
money when they
need it the most.

00:03:29.734 --> 00:03:32.567
But the big news is in the
Affordable Care Act that by

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:36.734
2014, there will be a new
insurance market where every

00:03:36.734 --> 00:03:40.967
American, regardless of a
preexisting condition or not,

00:03:40.967 --> 00:03:44.066
will have an option for
affordable health coverage,

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:48.567
be able to shop in a new pool,
have some competitive plans,

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:51.767
and no longer will insurance
companies be able to limit

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:54.967
adults with preexisting
condition from the treatments or

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:56.734
the policies that they need.

00:03:56.734 --> 00:04:00.300
Thank you for your support and Edies's [phonetic] support for

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.300
the President's
program moving forward.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.133
We're doing our best to
implement it as quickly as we can.

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:08.000
And hope that this
answers your question.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.633
Narrator:
Our final letter comes
from Robert Reid in

00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:11.000
Rochester, Washington.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.333
He has two questions.

00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:14.400
"I have watched you sign
important papers and then hand

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.533
out the pens to politicians.

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:19.500
I was wondering if you ever give
pens to ordinary citizens and,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.633
if so, if I could have one."

00:04:21.633 --> 00:04:23.467
As with all matters
paper-and-pen related,

00:04:23.467 --> 00:04:25.467
we need to check in with the
White House staff secretary,

00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:26.767
Lisa Brown.

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:29.100
Ms. Brown:
Robert, thanks so
much for writing.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.533
As you noted, the President
regularly gives pens to members

00:04:32.533 --> 00:04:35.333
of Congress who obviously have
done a huge amount of work to

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:37.100
get a bill passed.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.066
In addition, he often gives pens
to individual Americans who have

00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:44.800
been either deeply affected by
an issue or who have worked

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.767
really hard to get a particular
piece of legislation passed.

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:50.200
I'm not quite sure
when it started.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.333
We know that President Kennedy
and President Johnson each used

00:04:54.333 --> 00:04:56.867
a number of pens when
they signed bills.

00:04:56.867 --> 00:05:03.133
And the clerk believes that it
started with either Truman or Roosevelt.

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:04.867
He has gotten much
better at this.

00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:06.900
He in fact jokes
about this, actually.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.700
That he, at the beginning, it
does not come naturally to use a

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.333
number of pens when
you're signing your name,

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:15.567
but he has now gotten
very much in the groove.

00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:16.667
The President:
I've gotten good at this.

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:18.233
(laughter)

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:21.100
Ms. Brown:
Robert, I can't promise to give you a pen from the next bill

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.300
that the President signs, but
if you work really hard on

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.433
something that you are
particularly passionate about

00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:28.433
and a piece of
legislation is the result,

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:31.000
I will do my best to
see that you get one.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.967
Narrator:
Thanks so much for joining us for "Mailbag: Summer Edition!"

00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:36.133
For links, transcripts and
videos of the President's

00:05:36.133 --> 00:05:38.834
activities this week,
go to whitehouse.gov.

00:05:38.834 --> 00:05:41.633
And thanks again for checking
out your West Wing Week!

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.900
The President:
Let's see.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.967
Hum.

00:05:44.967 --> 00:05:46.867
I just want to make
sure it reads correctly.

00:05:46.867 --> 00:05:47.867
Justice Kagan:
It's all in order.

00:05:47.867 --> 00:05:50.066
The President:
Did we spell your name properly?

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:52.800
Justice Kagan:
Yes, I believe you did!

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.934
The President:
Uh --

00:05:53.934 --> 00:05:54.967
Justice Kagan:
That would be
embarrassing, wouldn't it?

00:05:54.967 --> 00:05:56.300
The President:
Right.
