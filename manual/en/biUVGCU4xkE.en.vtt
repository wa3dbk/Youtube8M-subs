00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.280
So, if you don't eat cheese, or just don't
dig it, pizza can still be just as enjoyable.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.340
It's all about kind of playing with your mouth
and kind of confusing it, thinking something

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.370
is a little creamier than maybe it is, and
kind of adding a little added texture to your

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.370
pizza.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.510
So, I'm going to make kind of a potato, tomato,
broccoli pizza, with a little caramelized

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.510
onion.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.510
Really beautiful.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.750
To start out, I'm always going to start with
a little extra virgin olive oil, right on

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.860
my pizza crust, alright?

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.570
It's just going to help make the whole thing
a little more crispy, get a little bit more

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.570
earthiness.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.370
I love it.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.830
All the way to the edges.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.840
Awesome.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.869
Alright.

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:45.820
Big pinch of kosher salts.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.820
Awesome.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.170
And then, I'm going to take some tomatoes
and, when you have a bunch of tomatoes to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.300
cut up, and you don't really want to spend,
you know, all afternoon going one by one,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.830
grab a big plate like this, and just stack
it right on top, and just grab your knife,

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.890
and just kind of horizontally go through.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.620
And what took a long time before is now 10
seconds.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.380
So all these are going to kind of get scattered
throughout.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.380
OK?

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.210
A little bit of potato.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.960
Now you want the potato cut really, really,
really thin, OK?

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.280
This is how it's going to cook in the oven.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.660
And I'm using potato to kind of emulate creaminess
of a cheese.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.660
Think about it.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.420
A Yukon gold potato, there's a lot of starch
in there, so it really, really, when it cooks

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.130
through, it kind of becomes nice and golden.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.020
So I'm just going to peek these tomatoes kind
of through.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.020
That looks great.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.280
And then, this is kind of just a fun thing
to do.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.360
Grab your broccoli in your hand, and just,
right over the top, like little broccoli couscous,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.240
you can kind of just shave right over.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.370
These are kind of just the essence of broccoli.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.190
Save the stems for a soup or something, but
for your rustic little no-cheese pizza, it's

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.980
actually pretty cool to just use the little
fronds of that.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.920
And then, some caramelized onions, again,
adding kind of that creaminess to it.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.670
You're not going to miss it at all.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.010
That looks great.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.700
So a little bit of olive oil.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.730
Beautiful.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.099
And this is going to go in our oven, which
is about 500 degrees, for about seven to eight

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.049
minutes, until the whole thing is crispy.

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.799
It kind of comes together and those potatoes
kind of turn creamy and cook through.

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:39.689
Do I smell cheese in the air?

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:45.450
Absolutely not, and I don't care at all, because
I can smell all the other veg, the blistered

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.870
tomatoes.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.159
Look at this.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.590
You'll be so proud.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.819
You can see the paper just kind of burns away.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:55.819
Right?

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.430
You can kind of just lose that bit.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.939
Awesome.

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:06.209
And then just like any pizza I've ever served,
I just add a little bit of olive oil, right

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:13.720
on the outside, a touch of smoke salt around
the edges, and usually I go with a little

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.810
cheese, but this one doesn't need it.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.749
Enjoy your cheeseless pizza.
