00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.730
One of the basic things about feng shui that
I would say would be apparent for every single

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.170
person, no matter where they live is seating,
and facing the door. It's very important that

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:23.429
wherever you're sitting you face the door,
and door is where career is. If you are facing

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:29.189
the door, you are facing your opportunity,
you are welcoming it. It's not going to sneak

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.340
up on you; you know when it's coming. Jason
and Michelle are sitting on their couch in

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.150
their living room, and it is facing the door,
which is great because they can see what's

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.070
coming. They're facing opportunity. That's
exactly where I would put the couch. The only

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.580
adjustment I would make is to actually be
in line with the door, because the door is

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.740
what we call the mouth of the chi. That is
where the chi, or the energy most strongly

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:10.170
enters your home, and to sit in line with
it could be harmful; not necessarily. It depends

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.690
on how strongly that chi is entering. To protect
yourself you don't want to sit right in line

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:23.350
with the door. The way that their couch is,
it actually could be shifted a little more

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.480
over so that they're not in line with the
door. Of course, then you get into things

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.130
like, it's a little too close to the hallway.
What do you do then? If they decided to leave

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.010
the couch where it is and not move it, we
would just have to do something to block the

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.580
chi from coming too quickly at them. We'd
have to put something between the door and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.510
the couch, and there's a couple things that
we can do. One is to actually hang something

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.479
from the ceiling. I'm going to show you a
little bit later that one of those things

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.299
is a crystal; you could hang a wind chime,
even though it's inside. I know that doesn't

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:11.980
make sense. You could hang a mobile, or you
could put something like a rug or some other

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.400
kind of object that would make sense to put
on the ground in the middle of the room so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.980
as not to get in the way of anything, or get
into McKenna's way when she's walking around

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.291
the room. That is the basic thing about facing
the door and opportunity. Does that make sense

00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:35.500
to you guys? Yes it does. Okay, good; let's
move on to our next thing.
