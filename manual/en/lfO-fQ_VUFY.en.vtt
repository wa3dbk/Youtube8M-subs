00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.270
For the chocolatier who is growing and looking
for chocolate coating solutions,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.660
Savage Brothers is pleased to now offer
the re-engineered W.C. Smith Chocolate Enrobing

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.759
Line.
This trusted line has been used by successful

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.670
artisans for years,
and is now offered by Savage Brothers with

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.090
the latest in control technology
and design updates that will take your business

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.770
to the next level.
You can increase production without sacrificing

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.500
the integrity of your product
by using this all-inclusive, state-of-the-art

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.940
enrobing line.
The process starts here,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.260
with the IN-FEED TABLE, which provides a work
surface that feeds the centers

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.449
to be enrobed into the chocolate Pre-Bottomer.
CHOCOLATE PRE-BOTTOMER. Your product center

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.870
will begin its transformation
with a bottom coat of chocolate applied using

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.879
a variable speed, stainless steel wire mesh
belt.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.410
A temperature-controlled, water-jacketed reservoir
with pump ensures

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.500
incoming chocolate is kept at just the right
temperature and puddle level

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.870
for creating a smooth base for the next step
in the enrobing process.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.610
The confection then moves onto the stainless
steel COLD PLATE,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.150
a self-contained chilled surface with variable
temperature control that sets the chocolate.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.920
From there, it enters the WC Smith CHOCOLATE
ENROBER.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.160
The product will go under a TWO-CURTAIN chocolate
flow pan to completely surround it with chocolate.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.310
It then passes under a Variable speed BLOWER
with adjustable height.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.110
This removes excess chocolate and blows it
into the chocolate return, reducing waste.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.170
Avariable speed SHAKER and DE-TAILER further
help to remove excess chocolate to give the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.130
confection
a polished, finished look.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.200
Each of these process functions are independently
and individually controlled

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.890
via a PLC Touch Screen control panel.
A heated, water-jacketed chocolate reservoirwith

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.360
an agitator is capable of tempering and maintaining
temper

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.070
for your chocolate. It is on roll-out casters
for easy cleaning or product changeover.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.499
Like the Pre-Bottomer, the Enrober features
a

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:14.170
Stainless Steel WIRE MESH BELT
with variable speed to meet your production

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.933
requirements.
After the ENROBER and before the cooling tunnel,

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:17.933
the chocolate piece goes through the DECORATOR
SECTION,

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:18.933
which separates cold air from the tunnel coming
into the Enrober

00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:21.989
and provides a space to permit hand or stringer
decorating.

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.349
The confection is now ready to enter the WC
Smith Cooling Tunnel,

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.420
which features Stainless steel construction
on the frame,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.209
belt table and virtually all surfaces that
contact the product belt.

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.049
Heavy duty stainless steel conveyor rollers,
with sealed bearings,

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.120
are designed for minimal maintenance over
the lifetime of the machine.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.469
An electronic eye monitors belt movement and
adjusts tracking accordingly,

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:51.609
so no contact with the belt is required.
An electronic pressure switch also verifies

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.319
that incoming air pressure is sufficient for
safe belt operation.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:03.439
The heavy duty, quiet gear drive product belt
has an adjustable speed from 2 to 8 feet per

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.909
minute.
With this unique modular and expandable design,

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.349
an artisan can simply add sections as production
expands.

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.930
Because the sections communicate via an ethernet
cable,

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.859
no complex wiring is required. Just “Plug
and Play”.

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:25.370
The cooling tunnel also has an intuitive PLC
touchscreen control for all machine functions,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.459
with abright, full color screen. In fact,
each of the PLCs on the enrobing line

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.919
can monitor and control any and all of the

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.749
The last stop in the Enrobing line is the
OUT-PACK TABLE,

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:41.819
which is a handy surface to use for hand packing
the finished product,

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.780
or for connecting to a separate packaging
line.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.239
The reliable W. C. Smith Enrobing line has
been proven to bring to your chocolate creations

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.299
