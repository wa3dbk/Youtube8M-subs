00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.720
(Music)

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:14.160
It was the day of Christmas and already awake
was an excited young Edd excited as... Cake.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.600
He summoned the others and ran to the tree
to uncover the presents awaiting them three.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.000
As they grabbed their gifts they unwrapped
them fast, but their joyful expressions sure didn't last.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.560
Edd found a bottle of discount Coke. Matt
found a joke book with only one joke.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.040
For his present this year Tom received a poster
of a picture of Matt admiring a toaster.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.720
The cards they read which increased their
woe were letters from fans.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.760
"Can I be on your show?"

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.480
The phone suddenly rang disrupting their sadness.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.840
On the line was Matts grand-mum, he answered
with gladness.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.360
She wasn't too happy about the fact he hadn't
called her for two years flat.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.880
Several hours later after the phone call had finished.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.760
Edd's christmas feast was done and the others were famished.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.200
Edd presented his bird for them to admire.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.160
Little did he know it was still on fire.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.240
The fire then spread to the potatoes and mash.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.680
And soon the whole dinner was alight in a flash.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.760
So, after the fire was extinguished with gravy.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.200
They rescued dear Matt still screaming like a lady.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.320
They sat on the sofa and turned on their tele.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.080
And soon their sad faces were transformed into merry.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.320
So, to make the most of your Christmas there
is really only one way.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.360
Anyone can enjoy the television even those
who hate this day.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.680
(TV static)

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.440
Okay, guys from the top. Try not to screw
it up this time.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.240
You're a screw up.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.920
Sorry.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.640
And a 1, 2. 1, 2, 3.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.760
What song are we doing again?

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:10.520
We wish you a Merry Christmas, We wish you
a Merry Christmas and a happy new year!

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.960
That was... FANTASTIC!

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.860
Well, that sucked.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.480
You suck.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.120
Oh.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:05:08.600
(Then the video plays again with no audio... Weird right?)
