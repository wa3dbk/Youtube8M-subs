00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.650
 Sunset Overdrive

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.779
 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.429
 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.750
Hi all, so today we're taking a look at
Sunset Overdrive

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.570
a Microsoft Xbox One exclusive. Now

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.640
this is a game that really knows what it's
trying to be

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.169
and no other way but fun. That's it.

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.489
That's what this game wants you to do. It wants you to have fun. Now the plot

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.329
is quite frankly ripped out of pretty
much any movie you could possibly mention

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:31.730
that has Sunset Overdrive

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.320
mutants and zombies in it. Effectively
a corporation has created a new

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.140
fizzy drink

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.840
which turns the majority of the city into,
well, OD.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.040
These OD are basically mutants who want to consume more and more of that fizzy fizzy drink.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.550
They will be the main bane of your life
in this world

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.680
although there are other factions that you'll have to contend with as well.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.480
The Fizzco security bots who are trying to
clear up the mess and suppress anybody

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.850
from Sunset Overdrive

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.870
leaking word to the outside world and,
well,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.670
some guys called The Scabs which are really kind of your post-apocalyptic

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.180
wasteland guys. That's probably the
easiest way to describe them.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.680
They're also a pain in the ass but you
know, not as much as the OD.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.790
Sunset Overdrive really wants you to have bags of fun.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.780
It's fusing together Jet Set Radio with
Dead Rising 3

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.799
and a healthy dose of Saints Row thrown
in for good measure. Sunset Overdrive

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.110
Kind of mixed together and blended in a
way that creates its

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.600
own unique thing. You could definitely not accuse Sunset Overdrive of being

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.970
absolutely a carbon copy of something
else. The graphics here

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.900
are truly fantastic, I mean so colourful
and so many

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.280
enemy AI on-screen at any one time. It's a wonder the Xbox One 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.710
does deliver such great visuals with no
stutter,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.790
no frame rate drops whatsoever in our play
throughs.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.950
Really is a remarkable achievement even
when you've got some

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.590
truly ludicrously big bosses going on
and all of the speed that

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.560
Sunset Overdrive throws in there as well,
the game never slows down and never

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.200
slouches.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.360
A truly remarkable piece of work I feel. Sunset Overdrive

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.410
The weapons here are varied, and as you
might expect, completely over the top.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.970
Everything from TNT teddies to freeze
bombs

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.569
and all sorts of wacky stuff and it's all
again designed to make you have fun

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.709
and it fits in with the way the game
mechanic actually works

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.010
always wanting you to be constantly
moving, grinding

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.209
jumping, bouncing and at the end of the
day destroying as many as OD as you

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.000
possibly can

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.870
as you're going along. A special mention must be given to the humour Sunset Overdrive

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.080
which really understands what it's
trying to be.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.480
It understands it's a computer game and it
references that fact multiple times throughout 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.299
your play through.

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.660
The characters you meet and the dialogue
they spout

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.370
helps to add to the texture of this very
over the top and humorous world.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.940
There was only one bum note in my entire play through in my opinion and that is where

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.459
you meet

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.810
and I'll try and be as politically
correct as I can here, a paraplegic 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.340
scout master

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.799
who is going to need rescuing. Some of that comedy I'm afraid 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.360
fell flat for me with my British
sensibilities but I'm sure will play

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.620
much better to an American audience. In the UK

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.780
that kind of humour is going to leave a
little bit of a 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.400
cold shudder running through people
I'm afraid. But that was only one bum

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.769
note Sunset Overdrive

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.329
in a wonderful plethora really of great
comedy moments.

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.720
Those little lines of dialogue, the little
sarcastic and witty

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.590
put downs, it all works beautifully here to
create a really fun and vibrant world.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.040
The characters you meet you actually
give a bit of a damn about

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.620
even if they are over-the-top
caricatures. The lead character you play

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.810
is full of witty one-liners in the best
traditions

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.769
of Duke Nukem and his ilk but never quite
straying into the grotesque.

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.510
The single player campaign is really
where this game is at. The multi-player

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.670
whilst fun and completely frantic and at
times quite difficult to kind of

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.840
orientate yourself to, never really felt like a
compelling

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.250
part of this game. It really feels to me more like an add-on

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.159
than something that well is an
intrinsic part of this world.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.389
Others may disagree with me but I didn't
really feel the multiplayer Sunset Overdrive

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.579
was all that special in my opinion. Just
really a bit of a chaotic mess,

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.079
Sunset Overdrive shows what Microsoft
is really capable of

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.970
when it stops messing around with
marketing and focuses on delivering

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.970
great games.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.639
If anything I would say Forza Horizon 2 and Sunset Overdrive

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.669
shows what Microsoft is really capable
of. It's not for the gamers 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.430
but it is good quality gaming. My final
score for Sunset Overdrive

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.830
is a nine. There's enough here to  Sunset Overdrive

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.190
really really enjoy. Hours upon hours of gameplay, not to mention all of those side quests you can do.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.270
It all works exceptionally well and I

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.020
honestly believe Microsoft has delivered
one of the best first party titles we've

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.220
had this year,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.729
possibly a definitive release for
Microsoft, overall.
