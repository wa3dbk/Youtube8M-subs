Hi I'm Karen for Expert Village. Okay now
we are going to quilt the bottom section.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.990
You want to take your two pieces of fabric
and with the interfacing put the interfacing

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.330
together. So you would have the outside of
the fabric on both sides like this. Then we

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:30.900
are going to quilt that by just sewing a straight
stitch in any kind of fashion you want. You

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:39.900
can make wiggly lines or straight lines. You
want to set your stitch length in about a

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:51.059
normal stitch length about two and a half.
I'm just going to zig zag. It does not have

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.579
to be precise we are just quilting the two
pieces together. It actually gives a nice

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:11.860
look when it is a little bit wavy and crazy.
I'm just going back and a forth in a rough

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:26.220
way. You can do this also with a contrasting
thread if you want to see the pattern. There

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:43.000
you go and when you finish just end by knotting
it and trim your threads close. Then I'm going

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.780
to go around the edges and just finish off
with a zigzag stitch to hold those two pieces

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.780
together and keep the fabric from fraying.
This would be on the inside of the bag so

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.820
you don't have to worry so much about finishing
it but you don't want the fabric fraying in

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.270
the inside. Now if you have a over locked
machine this is a nice thing to do with the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.260
over locked machine. If you don't have the
over locked machine a simple zigzag would

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.580
do. So set your stitches width to four and
your stitch length you keep at two and a half

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:36.820
and we are going to zigzag around the bottom
section. You want to stop and pivot the material

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:52.810
in the corners. This would just keep the faberic
from fraying.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:02.730
The last side
and to end you just back up a little bit,

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.640
knot the threads and just trim any threads
you have hanging around.
