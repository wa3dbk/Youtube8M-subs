00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.049
Today on this 2010 Subaru Forester we are
going to be installing Draw-Tite hitch part

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.020
number 24807.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.880
This installation will also apply for Hidden
Hitch part number 60893.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.420
We are underneath the vehicle and the first
thing we need to do before we can get started

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.910
installing the trailer hitch is to lower the
exhaust off both the driver and passenger

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.950
side frame rails.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.140
There are two exhaust hangers per side that
we need to lower the exhaust off of.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.170
There is one here at the more rear side of
the vehicle towards the inboard side and then

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.369
one on the outboard side a little bit forward
of the exhaust.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.900
Then there is a fifth hanger we need to lower
it off of as well and it is forward on the

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.879
vehicle almost even with the rear axle.

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.870
00:34
Before lowering the exhaust off of all five

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.879
of its hangers it is a good idea to put some
form of support strap across the forward exhaust

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.840
tube because once we remove the exhaust off
its hangers the exhaust is going to fall down

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.449
and if it is not properly supported it will
damage the exhaust system.

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.620
When removing the exhaust off of its hangers
we are just going to use a spray lubricant.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.620
Spray the studs down.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.709
You can either take a pair of pliers or a
pry bar and slide that in behind the rubber

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:04.559
hanger and pry it right off.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.549
You can see as I remove it off of its final
hanger 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:02:31.590
that 
the exhaust 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:44.930
is 
going to 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:03:46.460
fall down.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:04:47.790
