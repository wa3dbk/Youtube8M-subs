Corned Cabbage Recipe - Vegan Corned Beef - Cabbage, Corn

00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:04.760
Hey my Sweet Vs, it's The Sweetest Vegan here 
 Today on the show we are making Cabbage.

00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:04.760
Hey my Sweet Vs, it's The Sweetest Vegan here 
 Today on the show we are making Cabbage.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:11.006
Why are we making cabbage? Because we had leftover cabbage from 
 the other day when we made those stuffed cabbage things.

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.839
And we couldn't figure out how to peel the rest.

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.924
Thanks for your comments by the way, those tips were very helpful, 
 and I will use them next time I make stuffed cabbage.

00:00:18.924 --> 00:00:22.523
Which I will because it is in the Southern Cooking 
 Bible so I will have to re-do it.

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:29.513
So, we're on a budget, so yes we are being really cheap and we 
 are going to use the rest of that cabbage we didn't use

00:00:29.513 --> 00:00:35.039
and in the Southern Cooking Bible they had fried 
 cabbage, stuffed cabbage, but I already made those

00:00:36.153 --> 00:00:38.568
So I will do those a little bit later. Then 
 I cam across the recipe for corned beef.

00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:42.771
And corned beef is usually served with cabbage and that 
 is how she had it in the recipe.

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:50.284
But I was like, I don't want to do a corned tofu anything. Like 
 I am not in the mood for imitation meat right now. 

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:57.024
So lets just corn the cabbage and I was like that 
 would be hilarious if I just corned the cabbage

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:58.561
and called it corned cabbage.

00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:02.810
You might not think it is as funny, but that 
 is what we are doing today. So, lets go.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.104
Corned Cabbage Recipe - Vegan Corned Beef - Cabbage, Corn

00:01:08.104 --> 00:01:13.398
So you want to start this recipe by bringing 
 a large pot of water to boil.

00:01:13.398 --> 00:01:17.299
And then you want to quarter you cabbage. This would have been 
 really helpful the other day when I made those cabbage wraps.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:24.033
But quarter your cabbage and if the still have the 
 core in them, just cut diagonally across the cabbage

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:25.705
to take the stem and the core out.

00:01:25.705 --> 00:01:29.304
And that is much easier than trying to core the entire head of cabbage.

00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:36.084
So much easier, then you are going to slice the head 
 of cabbage into about an inch thick in width. 

00:01:36.084 --> 00:01:37.631
You don't even have to slice if you do not want to.

00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:44.510
But you can just to avoid having to slice it later for kids 
 or have it cook faster, you know whatever, just slice the cabbage.

00:01:44.513 --> 00:01:50.430
And then we are going to put it in our big pot 
 of water. And of course in normal Sweetest Vegan fashion,

00:01:50.434 --> 00:01:57.100
my pot is too small. I mean what would the show be 
 if I chose the proper size pot from the beginning.

00:01:57.098 --> 00:02:01.820
So put it in a larger pot and then we are 
 going to add in the rest of our goodies

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:05.640
I have one bag of frozen corn, thats 12 oz of frozen corn.

00:02:05.643 --> 00:02:12.170
Just pour that on into the pot, and then I thought if I were 
 to make a corned beef what did that used to taste like?

00:02:12.168 --> 00:02:17.300
It's a little bit of smoky, a little bit of sweet, it's 
 a little bit fatty, it's a little bit of salty.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.760
So I decided to incorporate those flavors. So 
 we have soy sauce for our salty,

00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:24.850
a little olive oil to add a little bit of fat,

00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:31.600
then we have a little bit of agave nectar for our 
 sweet, and sriracha sauce just for that heat and 

00:02:31.603 --> 00:02:38.060
that extra chili flavor. It is really good. Sriracha sauce is excellent. Plus 
 it has vinegar in it and that really goes with 

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:38.940
cabbage too.

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:38.940
cabbage too.

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:38.940
cabbage too.

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:38.940
cabbage too.

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:38.940
cabbage too.

00:02:41.797 --> 00:02:45.330
If your pot isn't still boiling, bring it back up to a 
 boil and then reduce it to a simmer and cover.

00:02:47.718 --> 00:02:51.110
Let's let it cook for 30 - minutes to an hour, depending on 
 how tender or crisp you want or don't want you cabbage.

00:02:51.108 --> 00:02:56.120
You know, let it cook longer if you like it really stewed to death.

00:02:56.123 --> 00:02:59.580
I just let mine go for about an hour and it came out perfect.

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:01.790
I am going to serve this up and lets see how it taste.

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:08.680
So here we have our bowl of cabbage, let me just 
 get some corn. Aw I lost all my corn.

00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:17.390
There we go. It is really flavorful, it has a lot of flavor.

00:03:17.393 --> 00:03:22.970
And it has a lot of different flavors so nobody will be 
 able to tell, like oh my gosh, what is in this.

00:03:22.966 --> 00:03:27.240
They'll just be like, this is delicious can I get 
 the recipe, because it has so many layers.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.270
Yes is has that salt that doesn't really taste like salt, and it 
 has a little bit of spice, because you know sriracha sauce

00:03:34.274 --> 00:03:40.490
hits your palate really late and really in the back at the 
 end, so people will not know what that is coming. 

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.930
And it taste really good. It's really subtle and mild. 

00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:50.970
And then you have the agave nectar but thats really not too sweet. 
 And then you have olive oil which is hitting people in that

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.930
fat craving. But they will not know what hit them.

00:03:53.934 --> 00:04:01.070
This is really delicious. Bye yall, bout to go eat.
