00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.380
welcome back I'm Curtis Smith today
Albuquerque Master Gardener Laurie Katie

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.450
is going to talk to us answering some of
the questions they get about winter

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.229
composting Laura you do winter
composting junction

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:21.230
-I do i compost all

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.500
year around

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.360
-and how do you do that

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.440
-I have a compost bin that I really quit

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.510
adding to about the first of November so
it'll be ready to take out by spring and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.060
then I start trench and whole composting
you just go dig a hole out in the garden

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:49.970
and about 8 to 14 inches deep just put
in your kitchen scraps dig it in and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.480
cover it back up

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.719
-and I also know you
like to compost paper because you've

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.260
given me some of this shredded paper and
this is mine it's been sitting around in

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.680
a pile for a year and it still looks
like it did when you gave it to me it's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.639
nice and moist it ought to be composting
but it's not you use this don't you

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:10.130
-I use that all the time I am just I love
kind of freaking people out went by

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.600
composting paper because they always
think first that is the ink will poison

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.329
you the ink is soybean based it breaks
right down if anything it might even add a

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.360
few minerals to garden

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.720
now this is my
paper that I have been composting for

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:26.800
about a year

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800
-just compare your paper and
my paper

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.560
I like your paper better [Laughing]

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.819
-there Pete you can't just put it out there and
let it compost it just sits there as you

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.560
can see

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.060
-right mine I'm saving mine to
use another time but it will sit and

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.040
wait wont it

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.099
-it will sit and wait on
you to feed it

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:47.419
-so you mixed it into your

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.460
soil

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.600
-I actually didn't have soil to mix
it into [laughing] I had caliche

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.040
-ok will be precise

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.260
-I tore my grass out and after
about an inch and a half I had, I

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.340
thought it was rock at first but it
was caliche

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.750
and I worked at lose gradually by
soaking it and digging it's very slow

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.360
took me a couple of years to do my whole
yard to break through the caliche

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.420
and then you just work the paper into it or
into your soil or your sand or whatever

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.660
you're working with about which if you
want to be cautious equal parts but I

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.599
actually went about three parts paper to
one part of dirt and then it's very

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:37.340
important that you mix nitrogen into it
if you do not mix the nitrogen into the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.420
composting paper you will have Curtis's
paper[chuckle]

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.000
-good paper stockpile

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.940
and that's

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.740
what's really wrong here is it doesn't
have the nitrogen to feed the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.700
organisms which will do the decomposing

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.300
-right

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.140
-we're in soil you've got a lot of

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.920
organisms in the soil but you've got to
give them the nitrogen to feed the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.900
process

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.440
-that's correct so what I would
do is I mix my paper with my soil and

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.140
then I sprinkle in not nitrogen

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.160
-and this is  ammonium sulfate here but you could use

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.240
ammonium nitrate you could use any
lawn fertilizer that contains nitrogen

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.120
-and mix it in I don't know a cup to
a two foot square or something dig it

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.660
all in together and then the other thing
is it'll just sit there if you don't

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.000
water it in

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.380
-ah New Mexico needs water

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.819
-you need to water it in and keep it moist at

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.019
least for the first couple weeks and
then you just let it do its thing

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.040
-how about if we use this

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.019
-it, this makes a great mulch a great row cover it will

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.489
prevent weeds from coming up and let the
water through it also will break down

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.300
but it's much slower

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.180
-right the smaller the particle of faster it will break down

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.480
-right what I used

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.660
was one thirty-second
million shred many banks use this and

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.180
private businesses and you just get
their happy for you to take it off their hands

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.480
-so that's easy to do but remember the

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.790
soil mix it in add the nitrogen and add
the water or put it down as a mulch

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.450
water it down so it doesn't blow away
and then let it slowly decompose there

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.320
but you said in this one you also did
the whole composting where you dig a hole

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.340
-put in my kitchen scraps I did that
over the winter and just let it go and

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.600
that helps break it down first also

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.660
-and do you use worms in your composting

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.820
-I have worms in my compost bin if you compost
your yard well you will have earthworm

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.560
-im gonna open this one up just

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.920
-one of my neighbors told
me one time

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.540
if you have good soil they

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.460
will come and I found out they do come

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.099
-well there we go and this is one that

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.860
came from a compost pile and they need
the organic matter this is a compost

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.780
worm or red wiggler

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.280
-yes

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.180
-and this is good
for adding to compost because they'll

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.800
stay in the compost pile whereas the
native earthworms run away

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.720
-that's true in the winter they you don't see them if
you're digging in there they seem to go

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.590
down underneath into the lower layer and
hibernate and then they come out but on

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.690
nice warm days you will see them out
around the compost bin in the dirt or if

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.100
you're out digging sometimes the
earthworm's come to the top

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.740
-that's right

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.520
well Lori thank you thanks for sharing
how to make paper and caliche into good

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.560
soil and some of the other things you're
doing in your compost

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.440
-it just takes patience to persevere

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.500
-and nitrogen and
water

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.320
-and nitrogen and water

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.960
-thank you

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.980
-thank you

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.160
