Hi! I'm Susana from Pink&amp;Fun

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.620
and today I want to show you the mini album I've made to a friend who's pregnant of twins.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.720
Because it's a couple,  this kind of album seemed to be perfect for what I wanted

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.210
because it divides the boy side from the girl side, alternating the pages.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.540
Let's see what I can show with one hand only.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.540
This is not helping...

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.940
In this side there's a waterfall

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:57.980
and in the other side, a pocket with a tag for journaling or photos,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:07.720
As I said, the pages are interspersed
and all have a pocket with a "photo mat" for more photos

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.220
I think that this album can take around 30 photos

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.200
So, girl's page with the photo mat...

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.360
...and the boy's page

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:39.060
One side is more girlie... the other more boy related

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.660
like this car...
The girl side has more butterflies, flowers...

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.400
And finally, a flap,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.540
one pocket,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:32.340
and some cards for more pictures or journaling

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.920
girl... boy... girl... boy... girl... boy...

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.160
oops...

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.170
It was not a good presentation but I hope you enjoyed

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.690
Thanks for watching and see you next time!
