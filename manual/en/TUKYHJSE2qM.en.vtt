Hi I'm Kim with Simply Beautiful in Austin,
Texas. Let's talk a little bit about how to

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.360
make your pores smaller. Well I'll tell you
this. In real life you can't make your pores

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.880
smaller. Once they are big they're big. Once
the dirt and impurities have come to the surface

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.859
and you have let your pores get big, to really
make them smaller is I'll tell you the truth

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.720
just almost impossible. So what we are going
to talk about is how to make them appear smaller

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.480
and we do that by keeping our skin very clean
and using a toner, an alcohol free toner.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.280
Toners all help your pores reduce and they
also get your skin really really clean and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:49.539
make it feel really fresh. I like to ask you
to avoid using a lot of alcohol in your toner

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.949
or any alcohol in your toner because I think
alcohol on the surface of your skin will dry

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:02.230
out your skin and that is not even good for
people who have oily skin. The next and best

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.210
thing that you can do to reduce pore size
is to mask. A good clay, heavy clay mask twice

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.910
a week will absolutely make your skin you
pores appear smaller so we are just going

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.750
to take a quarter size per side of your face
and I am just going to do it this side of

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.299
Alena's, put it on relatively thickly. You
don't want to be able to see your skin through

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:33.979
the mask. Do your whole face and don't do
around your eyes. Don't get, you know you

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.540
don't want to get the clay mask in your mouth
so don't do it around your lips either but

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.060
get it in the corners on your nose anywhere
where your pores appear large. Leave that

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.060
on 8 to 12 minutes. Don't let it get dry on
your skin because then again we are drying

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.430
out the surface of your skin. Rinse this off
with warm water and follow that up with cool

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.560
water. I don't want you t use cold water because
if you are going to use products afterwards

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.450
if you are going to use any of your Benzoperoxides
or a moisturizer it won't absorb into the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.030
skin with your pores that tight but if you
are not going to then we are just going to

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.010
use some cold water because cold water does
shrink pores. And if you do that often enough

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.140
you are going to see your pores are greatly
reduced in size.
