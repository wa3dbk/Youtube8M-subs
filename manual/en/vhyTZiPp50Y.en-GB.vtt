Welcome to #AskAmanda! Now today’s video is actually
inspired by two people, Nick Henry who asked on twitter :

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:12.179
“What are the most protein rich foods”
and also Make Up with Kate asked “Is protein just

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.650
for bodybuilders”

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.559
Great question, so Let’s talk about

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.610
What protein is
How it affects the body

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.020
And what the best sources of protein. Alright let's talk about the geeky sciency bit first

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.100
Protein is made up of long chains of amino
acids, which are also known as The Building

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.320
Blocks for life. Think of each amino as a
different colour of Lego block - some are

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.320
more important for things such as: skin regeneration,
others for hair growth and others for muscle

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.980
muscle and joint repair.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.710
 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.329
Now some "Lego Blocks" can be made by the
body, but unfortunately others cannot. So The ones that can't

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.329
are called ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS meaning - you
have to get them from your food, its essential. So put simply...

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.649
every meal should include at least some protein, i'm sure you've heard that before..

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.340
Your most basic and readily available sources
of protein are

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.189
Fish
Chicken

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.979
Meat and eggs
(I’ll get to vegetarian and vegan in a sec

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.979
now, let’s talk about the significance
of eating protein after a workout, so when you it's kind of key actually.

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.729
When you're starting even a modest workout, your muscles and joints they're gonna undergo 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.729
an awful battering, so when that happens, we get  “micro
tears”. These have to be repaired, so

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.189
in order to repair them we need to increase
our intake of protein. (remember the building

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.029
blocks for life?

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:46.240
Overall, makes sense, that the more exercise you do, the more
protein you need because that is the key to a

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.240
a long lean look. It makes sense. Plus, research has shown
that if you UP the amount of protein in your

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:59.109
diet ­it can actually increase the rate in which the
body burns body fat! so thats a win win situation all round. 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:06.109
Now. What if you are vegan or vegetarian? Well there
are plenty of sources of protein such as:

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.829
Eggs
Legumes - Lentils/chickpeas/beans

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.930
Quinoa is fantastic
Tempeh

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.290
Spirulina interestingly, tofu but SOY in small doses i'll get to that in another video..and also

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.730
Hemp seeds are fantastic

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.730
But just bear in mind though that none of these on their own i just mentioned
has all of the essential amino acids that

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.560
you might find in meat or fish so youre probably gonna have to combine the sources. So maybe take some leafy greens

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.569
and put them with pulses or get some quinoa and chop up some tofu, stick that in there.

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.140
But remember also the plus side of vegetarian diets is that
they are probably a little bit healtier  when compared to

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.000
that of meat eaters ---- but we'll talk about that in another video aswell

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.549
Lastly, I just wanna talk about protein shakes, because people always ask what they're for and when do I have them? 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.180
After a workout, it’s a convenient
and speedy way to re­ build those micro tears i talked about, 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.790
when your muscles need to repair and become
lean.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.790
HOWEVER, a lot of those powders do contain unhealthy
sweeteners so i'm not a fan of those at all.. and also whey protein is dairy so if you're intolerant 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:23.709
then stay away from whey. So i reckon if youre going to have them have some VEGAN protein powder

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:30.689
Just remember. Its a quick easy was to rebuild the micro tears
personally i think if you can, eat not drink your protein. 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.359
So that’s my lowdown on protein. I hope
you got to grips with it and don’t forget
