Hi I'm Miss Pop, a New York City based nail
artist, and we are here at my favorite bar/nail

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.620
salon.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.840
Beauty Bar, right here on 14th St in New York
City.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.780
Today I'm going to show you my favorite nail
designs and let you in on some secrets.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.090
So lets get started.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.350
Arrgh!

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.730
Next up is skulls and crossbones!

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.770
So first, I'm going to start out with some
white on my brush, and I'm going to lay down

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.250
the skull.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.079
The top of the head, the cranium, should be
really much bigger than the bottom where the

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:37.079
jaw is.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.280
It's a good idea to sketch out what you want
to draw first especially if you're going to

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.280
outline it in black.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.239
It gives you a sense of the shape, and it
gets your hand used to sort of doing that

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.750
motion.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.960
Now for the basic bone shape, I just do a
good cross... just a good X.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.570
You want to leave yourself plenty of space
on the nail not only so it looks well-laid

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.870
out but also because don't forget, we're going
to be outlining this in black... for that

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.090
extra bony look.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.909
Now I'm going to load it up with black and
just go in and do some outlines.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.270
Just want to go in and sort of press the brush
as sort of an upside-down heart and it'll

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.530
make the perfect nose!

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.220
OK, now I'm going to go in and do the teeth.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.690
So first, I do a smile and then I do like
little individual teeth.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.810
I feel like that looks better.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.970
And now, I outline the bone.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.580
These don't have to be perfect lines.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.080
You know, it's almost better if they're not
perfect.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.480
You just want to kind of outline the bones
and give them that sort of like black edge.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.081
If you want to give it an eye patch, you can
just go in there... do a straight line.. and

00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:51.560
then with your motter add AARRR!

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.450
Now for all you girly-girls, we're going to
add a rhinestone in for the other eye - make

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.700
it pretty just putting a little topcoat on
the back of this rhinestone before I apply

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.700
it.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.790
And don't worry if you pick up a little polish
around the edge of it.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.860
No one will ever see that.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.670
Just add some topcoat and you've got a skull
and crossbones to shiver me timbers!
