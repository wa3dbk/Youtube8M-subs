00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:17.340
Between the great cities of San Francisco
and Los Angeles there exists a place where

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.590
few and fortunate have come to call home.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.990
Where ancient volcanic peaks line the horizon
to the sea.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.160
Where the good and better learn, work, and
live a life to be envied.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:42.460
To say the least, San Luis Obispo is the best
of

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.340
California.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.239
At its heart lies a university where 20,000
carefully-selected minds find their paths

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.379
and their future every year.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.539
But what they come here to experience is something
more.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.070
They come here not only to find their paths,
but to blaze them.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.320
Not just to learn, but to experience.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.159
To become something that the world beyond
holds in high demand.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.330
In the real world the only thing that matters
is what you do with what you know.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.660
From across the state of California, from
across the United States, from around the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:33.560
world, they come to Cal Poly to Learn by Doing.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.350
Students get involved and they do.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.130
They don't just learn - they do.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.460
If you go back to thinking about how kids
learn about gravity, it's not what they learn

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.810
in high school in their physics classes.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.240
It's generally by dropping things and watching
them fall.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.570
And it's that learning that Cal Poly continues
to tap into.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.590
Where else could you go where there is a pier
that belongs to the university and you could

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.640
be an engineering student writing code for
an autonomous vehicle that's part of a marine

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.110
science experience?

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.760
Where else could you go that you could walk
from your residence hall that is a beautiful

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.860
apartment, and 10 minutes away be in a horticultural
setting or be at a sustainable ag farm.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.430
Or right across the way walk into the Mustang
60 lab and get your hands-on experience in

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.430
engineering?

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.641
It is a very unique place, but it's a unique
place because of the people.

00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:48.530
You take really great students, great faculty
and our staff, and it equals a wonderful experience.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.069
Coming to Cal Poly was one of the best decisions
of my life.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.930
My goal in life was to build medical devices
that can save people's lives.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.730
And even as a student here I'm already building
devices that are going to be used in the industry.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.560
One of the most important things for students
to be successful is learning to learn in a

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.730
community that's similar to the world.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.760
We're in a global economy, so having more
international students at Cal Poly is part

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.970
of our goal of getting more of the world to
Cal Poly.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.910
But we also want to get more of Cal Poly to
the world.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.170
Here students build devices, they launch satellites.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.340
You're applying what you know.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.690
Since I've been in school here I've realized
that there's a huge social element to architecture

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.940
that's really important.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.440
Understanding the very people that you're
serving for these spaces is key.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.980
My dream is to work for a big company to make
a living and provide for my family.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.040
Orfalea College of Business is one of the
famous programs of business on the west coast.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.650
Everybody here is just like your family.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.500
They're supporting you and helping you to
get everything you need to be successful.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.590
You don't just go to college to say, "This
is my path.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.870
This is exactly what I'm going to do," because
that's not the way that life works.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.489
You discover yourself as you're going through
college.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.930
In Cal Poly, if you extend yourself, everybody
has the opportunity to shine.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.069
It's about embracing everything and being
part of a greater community.

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:31.210
Cal Poly - it can contribute to the growth
of you as an individual, contribute to the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.760
growth of you as a member of the Cal Poly
and San Luis Obispo community, but critically

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.199
it can contribute to your growth as a global
citizen.

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:49.129
And the planet definitely needs more global
citizens.

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:54.240
In choosing a university, you embark on one
of the most important decisions of your life

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.249
- one that lends the question, "Is Cal Poly
right for you?"

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:06.800
If your answer is yes, you seek a university
that ranks among the best in the nation.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.729
An education where you can learn by doing.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.509
Where you can combine your passion for new
ideas with your deep desire to try out those

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.099
ideas.

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.340
To test them.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.150
To fine-tune them for yourself.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:30.680
You seek a place of learning where ideas roam
free across disciplines, across physical borders

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.090
and cultural boundaries.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:38.090
Where classes extend far beyond campus and
deep into the workplaces and communities you

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.439
dream about transforming.

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:46.300
You're looking for a beautiful campus you
can call home in an exciting location that

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.819
connects you the people, opportunities and
resources you need to become a resourceful,

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:53.199
innovative leader.

00:05:53.199 --> 00:06:00.059
A town that offers you all the warmth, laid-back
charm and sun-soaked beaches of small-town

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:03.559
California.

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:08.379
If this is what you seek, at Cal Poly we're
looking for you.
