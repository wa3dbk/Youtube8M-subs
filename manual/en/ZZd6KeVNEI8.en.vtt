Today on Drinks With Diablo,

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.600
we're travelling all the way down to the West Indes and Bahamas

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.100
to capture the Yellow Bird.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.100
TheFNDC.com presents Drinks With Diablo:

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.200
The Yellow Bird cocktail.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.800
Welcome back to Drinks With Diablo.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.600
This is your host, Jöhnny Dîablø,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.800
and today we're bringing you the Yellow Bird,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.010
as requested by our viewer,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.500
Squirts Warren.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.000
We're going to 1¼ ounces of light rum.

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.500
In this particular version, we add ½ ounce banana liqueur.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.666
I'm using 99 Bananas.

00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.500
You could probably use that Creme De Banana

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.000
and it will give it more a yellow color.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We're going to add ½ ounce of Galliano.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.200
And that will help give it more of a yellow color.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.200
We're going to add two full ounces of orange juice.

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:04.200
And two ounces of pineapple juice.

00:01:06.777 --> 00:01:08.600
And I'm thinking this is going to be 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.000
more tropical and less Tiki.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Let's try.

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.666
Okay, this one is looking good.

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.666
I think it's going to be more yellow, and sure enough,

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:21.222
it is more yellowish.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.000
I'm smelling the pineapple right away.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.500
Let's give it a cherry or two.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.500
Let's give it a little umbrella.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.500
Whoa.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.300
Okay, a little umbrella.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.500
This is the Bahamas Yellow Bird.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.500
Let's taste this one and find out.

00:01:44.222 --> 00:01:45.333
This one I like.

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:48.000
This is the Bahamas version of the Yellow Bird.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
This is definitely pretty awesome.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.125
It's got banana,

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:52.500
it's got the orange.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.777
The pineapple is kind of in the background.

00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:58.777
I think the Galliano adds something there.

00:01:58.777 --> 00:02:00.500
It tastes very tropical;

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.800
very fruity.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.800
You can taste all the flavors.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.500
It tastes more like juice.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.500
I think this is going to have a wide appeal.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.000
It looks better in your cup and it tastes better

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.888
than the other version.

00:02:12.888 --> 00:02:13.800
The Yellow Bird—

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.125
it's an amazing tropical drink.

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.125
I think it should be in your repertoire.

00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:21.000
Now, if you want to find more amazing drink recipes,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.888

00:02:23.888 --> 00:02:25.999
My bad, the camera ran out of memory.

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:28.100
Thanks again so much for being here,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.222
and as always,

00:02:29.222 --> 00:02:31.222
Happy Drinking.
