00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:05.549
Genre.

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.959
Now that’s a fun word to say.

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:09.000
Genre.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.830
Do you know what a genre is?

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.000
A genre is a category.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.660
When you like movies, you don’t always like
every kind -- or every genre -- of movie.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.279
You might love comedy movies, but not the
scary ones.

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.659
Those are two different types, or genres,
of movie.

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.500
We put other things into genres.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.829
We might split our building sets into different
categories, like, say, I don’t know, Space,

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:33.829
Castle, or City.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.150
Books work the same way.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.110
Most chapter books are part of a large genre
called “fiction,” which just means those

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.890
books tell a story that came from the author’s
imagination.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.940
But fiction alone doesn’t give us many details
about what’s in the book.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.429
So we can divide books up into more specific
fiction genres.

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.890
Harry Potter and Charlotte’s Web are both
fiction books, but they have very different

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.890
settings and characters.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.230
So we put them into different fiction genres.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.550
Let’s talk about one specific fiction genre
right now.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.850
You know those books that have spaceships
and robots and aliens and time travel … stuff

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.850
like that?

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.360
We call those kinds of stories “Science
Fiction”, or SCI-FI, for short.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.300
Science fiction, like most fiction, tells
a story that came from the author’s imagination.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.320
But what makes it different from other kinds
of fiction?

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.820
Science fiction contains unreal things that
could be real in our world in the future.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.520
The unreal things in science fiction could
be those amazing spaceships or robots or aliens

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.050
or time machines or any other kind of technology
or discovery that just maybe possibly could

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.050
happen.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.160
A lot of imagination goes into writing science
fiction and building a world of possibilities.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.310
That’s why it’s so fun to read.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.720
Science fiction often explores what happens
when things go wrong with these tools or advancements.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.660
It’s cool to build rockets and explore outer
space, but what if the aliens we meet aren’t

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.660
so friendly?

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.070
Sci fi can help us think about the many different
outcomes of our actions.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.369
Most science fiction takes place in the real
world, or at least in a world with similar

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.979
rules to ours.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.520
Sci-fi books have amazing, inventive things
in them, but those things play by the rules

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.160
of our world, of what we know and really experience.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.380
In other words, cool stuff happens because
of science, not magic.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.480
If someone can turn invisible in a science
fiction book, it’s because they built a

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.490
light-refracting hologram projection device,
and not because they drank an enchanted potion.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.040
Science fiction is typically set in the future.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.170
Now the future might be the next century,
or the next day, but in the imagined future,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.010
there is a technology or scientific discovery
that makes things possible that would be impossible

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.010
in the present.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.740
Of course, some science fiction can be set
in the present, in an alternative but familiar

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.740
world.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.690
There are even subgenres of sci fi set in
the past, such as steampunk, where advanced

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.960
technologies are imagined to exist in a time
before electricity.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.740
When you get into genre study, you have to
remember that there’s always an exception

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.319
to every rule.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.240
Genres get mixed and remixed all the time,
and that makes it fun.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.320
So that’s science fiction.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.770
It’s full of unreal things that could be
real in our world or a similar world in the

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.300
near or distant future.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.990
Sci fi authors write about what if and what
could be, and that helps us think about what’s

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.630
happening right now and how our choices affect
the future and the world.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.740
And the elseworlds beyond the multiverse.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.980
Yeah, that’s the kind of stuff you’re
read in science fiction, so get used to it.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.580
It’s awesome.
