00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We tend to think of Mars as a dead planet where all the exciting geologic activity

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
happened billions of years ago.  But information from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
shows us that Mars is still a very dynamic place.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Mars has a permanent ice cap made up of water ice at its north pole.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This pole is ringed by sand dunes, which we're looking straight down on.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
These dunes are made of small bits of basalt, dark volcanic rock similar

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to the rocks found around the Hawaiian volcanoes.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In the fall and winter, the temperatures are so cold that 30 percent of the Martian carbon

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
dioxide atmosphere freezes onto the ground, forming a seasonal polar cap.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The ground gets covered with a bright layer of seasonal carbon dioxide ice,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
or 'dry ice,' that's about one to two feet thick.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
When we flip between images taken at different times in the spring, we can see the dry ice

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
cracks form under the sun's heat as the solid carbon dioxide turns into gas.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The gas beneath the ice escapes, carrying dark sand and dust that move,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
as we can see,  down the steep sides of the dunes.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We are now looking at different parts of the vast field of dunes. These are called Barchan dunes.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
At the start of this time-lapse, the dunes are covered

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
with seasonal dry ice so everything is roughly the same color.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The dark streaks and splotches are sand from the dune.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
There are small splotches of sand at the crest of the dune. Then we start seeing the ice crack.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Sand is pushed to the top of the ice layer by the escaping gas outlining the cracks.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
As time goes on, the cracks widen and fresh bright frost condenses in the vicinity.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Now, we see sand coming from the crest of the dune and sliding down the steep dune slopes.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
A ferocious wind has picked up, blowing sand and dust across the dune.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Until the dark sand dune is free of seasonal ice.  Let's watch that whole sequence again.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We start with ice-covered dunes in the early Spring.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Some areas of the ice rupture and crack, allowing sand and dust to escape along with the escaping gas.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The gas from the dry ice destabilizes the slopes, reshaping the dunes.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
This activity happens every Spring in the vast dune fields of the Martian polar regions.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
These are not the sort of events that would naturally occurs on Earth. Mars may look

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Earth-like, but in some ways it is a very different planet from our own.
