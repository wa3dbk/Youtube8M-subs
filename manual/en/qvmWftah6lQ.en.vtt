Hello everyone, welcome back to my channel!

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.610
Today I am going to be sharing with you, my
top 5 favorite things to use to bronze my

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.610
skin with.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.190
I know summer is coming up, right around the
corner... this year is already going fast!

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.330
It's already March.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.599
So, we are looking into springtime, but I
wanted to jump ahead and kind of give you

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.440
some of my favorite powders, and even cream
concealers that I use to contour and bronze

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.440
my skin.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.860
So if you are interested in seeing my top
5 favorites, keep on watching!

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.550
Alright, so the first product I want to talk
to you guys about is by Milani, and this one

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.550
is the tan-tastic.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.829
And this one; I can only wear during the summertime,
I feel like.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.469
Because, it is super shimmery and super bronzy.

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.791
But, nonetheless, I really do love it.

00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:50.289
And I'm really excited to bring it out to
play for this summer.

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.730
And, this is what it looks like, for face
and body.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.159
It comes with a body brush &amp; also comes with
a Mirror so you can just add it to wherever

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.649
you want it to be and, be on the go.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.930
This would be my ultimate top favorite bronzer
because it not only bronze's the skin, but

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.150
it highlights my body and gives me the most
beautiful tanned skin glow.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.400
So, a cream type of contour or, bronzing.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.729
I like to take the darker colors in my concealer
palette.

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.660
This one is by, (Who's this by?!)

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.660
... Coastal scents!

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.350
This is their camouflage palette.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.270
It has 10 pans of concealer.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.689
Obviously some are a little too light for
me, and then I have the mid-tones type of

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.439
rangiest that I can use; I have super dark
ones.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.420
I put this on the hollows of my cheeks and
blend it out.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.520
I like to apply it with my fingers sometimes.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.350
Or sometimes, I'll use a brush.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.200
Most likely, I'll use my fingers and then
use a brush to kind of, buff it in.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.750
But it's a matte type of way to bronze your
skin and I'll go over on top of it with a

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.039
matte face powder or even a different kind
of bronzer for it.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.590
So we are going to go ahead and get into some
powders.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.509
So, the nix cosmetics matte bronzer is one
i've been using for a very longtime.

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.210
Obviously, you can see i've hit pan on it.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.841
This one has more of an orange type of undertone
to it.

00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:06.880
And it can get a little "oompa lumpa-ish"
if you go a little too far.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.130
I definitely recommend that you feather it
on and build it up.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.140
And not just go dive in, and just kind of
apply it to your face.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.960
I find, when I have darker skin, I have more
of a reddish undertone to my skin.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.130
Thats when I can use this.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.600
Otherwise, I kind of stay away from it.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.910
Especially, for contouring.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.630
And then, I have the Milani bronzer all over
bronzer duo powder.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.720
This is another Milani product, but this is
one of my favorites.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.070
It smells....

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.570
It smells so good you guys!

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.080
It has two different color-tones, so you can
do a sun kissed super bronzed look; or you

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.450
can do a nice lighter type of "Touch of a
kiss look".

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.240
That's what I really love about this one.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.480
This is called the 01 Tan in a pan for all
skin types.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.050
You can use this for face and body, pretty
much everything that i've mentioned today,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.790
you can use for face and body.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.380
And that's going to bring me to my very last
product.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.500
This one is the cover girl queen collection
face matte powder.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.070
This is actually a powder for someone skin.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.070
And, I was just thinking... one day.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.060
I was sitting and I was like " I wonder if
I could just find a deeper color powder, and

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.380
just use that to contour and use that to bronze
my skin" ... this one is in the color medium.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.140
So, it's from the queen collection - it's
an actual face powder and the reason why I

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.090
got an actual face powder, was because I didn't
want any shimmers.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.560
I wanted it to be completely matte.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.360
I didn't want any hints, I didn't want any
types of sheen.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.870
When you contour, I was reading, you want
it to be matte.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.290
Especially if you are trying to sculpt and
change the way your face is shaped.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.670
So, I went ahead go this product, tried it
out.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.670
Fell In love.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.040
I will not be purchasing anymore bronzers,
unless I want something with a shimmer.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.840
Um, but, for the most part, this is like my
all time favorite.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.980
So hopefully you guys enjoyed this video.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.520
