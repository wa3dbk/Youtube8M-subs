00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.919
Hi! This is a pork-roast grilled in a herb Box

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:08.700
This is a cedarwood-Box filled with dried herbs from the company "Axtschlag"

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.139
and i will show you how to make this roast.
in this Episode of "BBQ aus Rheinhessen"

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:19.810
Enjoy the show!

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.700
Here are the ingredients you need for the pork-roast in

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.370
a herb-box. First of all... the roast itself

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.500
this is a nice pice of ham with a fine fat-side on the top.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.200
it´s perfect for grilling

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.310
and here is

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.590
the herb-box.. from Axtschlag. It´s a Cedar-Box

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.540
filled with dryed herbs

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.480
this ony is specially for meat.. there is special one for fish and seafood

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.750
i am really curious about it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.460
to speed up things a bit.. i got my

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.040
vacuum-marinator with me

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.160
let´s prepare the meat

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.190
first cut the skin and fat of the meat

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.279
very important.. if you want to cut the skin... you will need a very sharp knife

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.909
just cut the skin and the fat..

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:18.339
NOT into the meat

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:19.360
ok

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.360
the meat is prepared and now drop it in a bowl

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.779
skin-side down

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.659
now add a bottle of beer

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.600
ok now close the lid and marinate

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.299
for one hour... if you marinate i a normal bowl

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.029
you should marinate for at least 2 hours

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:49.500
so the skin and fat can soak up the beer flavour a bit

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.800
maybe you just though: What?? there is gas in the beer and it will ruin the vacuum..

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:27.200
i vacuumed 2 times.. and pulled out the gas... i will check the vacuum every 20 minutes

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.279
but now.. it´s pretty well sealed

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.229
and i will let it marinate

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.239
a hour later...

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.409
our meat is well marinated and i will let air in my marinator...

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.959
take off the lid

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.369
here is our Herb-Box

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.589
now place the meat.. skin side up

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:05.509
on the herbs...

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:10.000
it fits perfectly

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.909
now i will rub

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.370
some salt on the scored skin

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.689
this will give us a tasty crust

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:27.509
now it´s time to go to the grill

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.710
the Grill is preheated to 180° Celsius

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.979
i prepared a indirect heat setup

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.210
now place the herb box in the indirect zone

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.550
close the lid

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.159
and take care temperature does not go over

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:48.969
180° Celsius

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:53.180
so our herbs can give their flavour to the meat and will not get burned

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.379
i will stick in a thermometer

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:02.360
our desired core themperature will be 67° Celsius...

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.260
exactly 2 hours later... we reach the 67°

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.030
and it smells so good

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.800
the herbs.. the cedar-wood

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.300
and now let´s take a look

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.569
yeeeeesssssss :)

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.210
this looks great and smells so much better!

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.449
now take the roast off the grill

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.539
and let it rest for 10 minutes

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.569
and here it is... fuicy and tender

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:35.499
wonderful

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:38.370
there is the herb box

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.479
the flavour are awesome ..the crust.. is crunchy

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.110
you really have to try this

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.889
