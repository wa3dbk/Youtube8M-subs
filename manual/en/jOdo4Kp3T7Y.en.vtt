00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.859
To understand behavior,

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.769
you have to understand human beings from the cellular level

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.500
to the societal level.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.000
Biobehavioral Health is a graduate and undergraduate program. It's a department in the College of Health and Human Development at Penn State.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.150
It was originally envisioned as this interdisciplinary department

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.949
where geneticists and molecular biologists would share the same

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.949
buildings and classes with people who do public health level

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.100
epidemiology research.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:35.630
Biobehavioral Health just by its very nature addresses issues at the global level

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.000
in ways that emphasize the local as a part of the global.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.920
So we're really truly

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.000
interdisciplinary.  We have people in our department who are geneticists

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.640
and we have other people like me

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.510
who are working in communities and trying to translate what my colleagues

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.000
are learning in the lab to what we are doing out in the field.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.500
(background) These are the subject numbers which are located on the tubes. (background)

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.100
So what really attracted me to Biobehavioral Health was the opportunity

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.500
to interact across multiple disciplines.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500
The work isn't silo-ed. The work is collaborative.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.000
This is what we do.  We were all at one point in time in traditional departments.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.100
We shouldn't talk as though one is more important than the other.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.200
Genes to genomes.  We're interested in what's going on in the lab and then what we're doing

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.680
bedside in a hospital.  And I think Penn State fosters collaboration,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.460
not only among faculty members, but also among students as well.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.550
We encourage students to take classes outside of our

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.770
department, because we want them to have a breadth of knowledge.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.920
(background) When we are talking about equality, we are talking about sameness. (background)

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.270
(background) When we're talking about equity, we're talking about fairness, (background)

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.000
(background) and what is considered to be fair. (background)

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.869
We were one of the first to do this innovative model

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.229
of this trans-disciplinary within the same department.  And our individual faculty

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.259
have been really productive and prominent within their own sub fields.

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.340
We all chose to come here to be innovative, to do something different.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.380
Willing and excited to engage in cutting age research.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.640
Taking risks to improve

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.400
human health and wellness.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.800
To actually have a building that sort of symbolizes

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.110
this coming together of different disciplines

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.370
to address behavior is just beyond words.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.960
This new building is amazing.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.010
It encourages social interactions among faculty,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.640
among graduate students, it's a beautiful place to meet

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.000
and work with one another.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Open and direct conversations are very important for developing

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.720
collaborations and extending interdisciplinary science

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.960
in new directions where new fields are developed.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.090
We are the people that are starting the traditions

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.000
and have been starting the traditions for 20 years now.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.180
That is what is unique about Biobehavioral Health, and that is why we say it's innovative,

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.600
the program is trans-disciplinary because it cuts across disciplines. And the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.290
investigators are multidisciplinary in the traditions they bring to the table.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.000
(background) And I'll be working to get you some individual feedback. (background)

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.390
We train graduate and undergraduate students and we have world class scientists, from around the world, that contribute their research

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.700
to our growing department.
