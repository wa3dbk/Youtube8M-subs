Hey Everyone Shakarez here and welcome to
yet another video.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.939
Today we'll be discussing some basic notions
to help you successfully split push.

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.710
Playing the split push is forcing the enemy
team to make a very difficult call, they either

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.149
commit to defending and leave the other 4
opponents to pressure the map elsewhere or

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.410
they try to fight with numbers advantage but
risk losing their base.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.780
Most champions can be situationally very good
split pushers, usually the main requirement

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.440
is to be ahead in gold, though some champions
just need to hit certain item thresholds to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.500
be very strong at split pushing.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.160
Today I'll be focusing on split pushing as
a toplaner, however some of these points can

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.640
be applied to any role who wants to split
push.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.090
Establishing vision is probably the most important
point to create a good split push.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.600
As a split pusher you'll be deep in the enemy
side of the map, so you'll need to see them

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.300
coming in order to react, especially when
they send more than one member.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.140
Assuming you're still split pushing on top
lane, the best warding locations to warn you

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:20.540
of incoming danger are these when playing
red side and these when playing blue side.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.009
Obviously the locations of these wards change
with the progression of the game and how the

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.900
rest of your team is playing it.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.720
If they're pushed up as well and the first
mid turret is down, chances are you don't

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.450
need wards in the river, as it'll be hard
for the enemy team to flank through there.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.409
It's also very important to constantly look
at the other lanes and see if they're being

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.560
pushed and also if your opponents are in the
lane.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.170
If the enemy mid laner pushed his lane and
is missing chances are he's coming for you!

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.829
One of the best ways to help you have better
ward coverage is upgrading your warding totem

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.860
to a greater stealth totem.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.460
With it you can place 3 minute wards.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.399
The best part about it is that it stores a
charge every 60 seconds, up to 2 charges,

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.350
so you can put a ward per minute and always
have two active wards in the map just with

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.030
the trinket, not to mention you can put two
at once if you stored up the charges.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.510
Elixirs are a huge part of helping you split
push, three of four of the Elixirs can directly

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.010
help your split push, depending on what type
of champion you're playing.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.810
The Elixir of Sorcery is a great tool for
AP split pushers like Kayle, Teemo or Diana.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.900
Not only does it give a good amount of AP
and flat mana regeneration, it also gives

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.410
you 25 true damage on hit.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.849
This has an internal cooldown versus champions,
but when sieging versus towers it applies

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.260
25 true damage every hit, making your AP champion
a very strong split pusher

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.900
Elixir of Wrath should be your elixir of choice
for any type of melee or ranged AD heavy carry,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.569
like Fiora, Tryndamere, Master Yi or Vayne
for example.

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.450
While realistically the only stat given to
help you take down towers is attack damage,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.180
Bloodlust is an awesome tool for duels and
will ensure you have the upper hand in these

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.129
situations
Elixir of Ruin is probably the one you see

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:12.840
the least, but it's especially useful for
those split pushing tanks like Shen or Singed.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.750
They don't have the best turret killing capabilities
so 15% extra damage and a buff to their minions'

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.640
damage to turrets is very helpful.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.310
The biggest thing to mention here is Teleport
versus no Teleport.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.340
Both work really, but your summoner spell
will dictate how you play split push.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.080
If you're playing with a combat summoner like
Ignite or even Exhaust, chances are you're

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.540
mainly looking to kill your opponent whenever
he comes to defend from your push.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.870
If you have teleport you want to use it to
join a teamfight in case it breaks out.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.780
Having teleport generally means you can put
pressure and still be available to help your

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.830
team in a fight.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.090
Having teleport also gives you the choice.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.310
In some situations you might just be better
off split pushing instead of teamfighting.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.150
Teleport can also be used as an escape tool,
as you can teleport back to one of your towers.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.150
Split pushing as a strategy can yield very
positive results in solo queue, where the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.230
opposing team doesn't always coordinate well
enough to respond to it, however it may be

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.450
somewhat hard to have your teammates understand
and use it to their advantage.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.560
This goes doubly for joining your team with
Teleport.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:29.270
Above all, ensure you communicate with your
teammates when split pushing for optimal results.
