See, you don't need to get Shotgun Ice for this. =P

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.200
Let's get outta here!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Capcom made some neat attention to detail here.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:48.820
Since the Air Ship crashed in this stage, it not only shows the resulting destruction at the beginning, but it actually affects gameplay here too.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.940
It blinds the player by disabling those electrical sparks that fly across the floor in the beginning too. Clever.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.120
Oh, and its easy to figure this out too, if you see were those flying things are going.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.500
Ouch!

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.100
How did I just heal?

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.400
Heart #3

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.160
HA! Who said you needed the boomerang?
