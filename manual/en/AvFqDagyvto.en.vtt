The Florida Family Association is one of those
groups whose purpose can be entirely divined

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.200
from the words "family association". They're
the kind of folks who literally hire airplanes

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.139
to fly around Disney World and warn about
gay people. Yes, this actually happened. So

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.430
it comes as no surprise that they would take
issue with the ABC Family show Pretty Little

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.320
Liars. I don't know anything about this show,
but apparently some of the characters are

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.020
lesbians. And as the Florida Family Association
points out, sometimes they kiss each other!

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.290
And children might see this! How terrible!
According to the FFA, "ABC using salacious

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.850
and glamorizing scenes portraying young, pretty
women as lesbians sends the wrong message

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.340
to these young girls, a message that reinforces
and legitimizes this homosexual lifestyle

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.470
in a manner that could affect these young
girls' sexual identity for a lifetime." What,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.260
are they afraid people are going to find out
that being a lesbian is just that awesome?

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.670
In response to this outrageous display of
lesbians kissing just like straight people

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.400
do all the time, the FFA has been urging businesses
to remove their ads from the program. This

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.299
week, a representative from General Mills
replied to say that they will no longer be

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.780
sponsoring the show. In other words, they
don't want to be associated with a show that

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.210
treats lesbians like people. This is explicitly
an attempt to suppress something so basic

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.020
as gay and lesbian visibility. It's a denial
of the reality that lesbians exist and have

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.600
relationships just like anyone else. And it
only serves to affirm that television, and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.950
by extension, romance itself is a sacred hetero-only
zone. Not everyone is straight, you know.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.150
But apparently General Mills would rather
not recognize that. So if you'd like to let

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.420
them know what you think about their concessions
to homophobia, you can email their consumer

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.290
services director. And until they reinstate
their ads, here's a list of General Mills

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.729
brands that we really have no reason to buy
anymore.
