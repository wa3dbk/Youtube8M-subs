00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.570
Salutations celestial sight seers!

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.720
I'm David Fuller, welcome to Eyes on the Sky;
what's up this week?

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.720
A lot of interesting naked-eye phenomena occur
this week.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.960
At the beginning of the week, Mars is just
one degree away from the first magnitude star

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.460
Regulus in Leo the Lion.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.050
Easy to find!!

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.820
Now, this is a bit of an early-bird event,
but with sunrise occurring later in the morning

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.320
hours than a few months ago, you can get up
as late as 5:00 or 6:00 am and still see the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.180
red planet one pinky-width at arm's-length
from the bluish-white star.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.840
A nice little pairing, certainly, and if you're
really ambitious, get up an hour or so earlier

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.869
with a telescope to see the 94% illuminated
disk that sports a rather small 4.6 arc seconds

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:10.930
of diameter.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.100
That makes it hard to see much, but it may
be possible to spy a polar cap and a few of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.330
the largest dark markings if no major dust-storms
are occurring then.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.420
On the evening of the 16-th, Venus is just
a hair farther away than that from the star

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.829
Antares, with the brilliant white planet just
1.6 degrees from the orange-looking red giant

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.820
star in Scorpius.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.780
There are other opportunities if skies are
poor for you on the 16-th; the planet skirts

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.960
nearby the star from our perspective over
the course of the work-week, from Monday through

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.960
Friday.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.329
Because Venus doesn't offer much more than
a phase in terms of telescopic detail, binoculars

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.950
can enhance the framing of this pair together
as you cast your gaze southwest an hour or

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.909
so after sunset to observe these two celestial
objects.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.810
Dark Sky Fact: As leaves fall, outdoor lighting
will travel farther if left unshielded.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.750
Consider changing your own outdoor lighting
to fully shielded fixtures available at Lowes,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.660
or using silver crown bulbs in post lamps
to direct most light down in the area around

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.640
the lamp.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.090
On Friday the 18-th, the Moon is full, and
for the final time this year, we can spot

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.880
at least a partial lunar eclipse.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.020
This will be visible in it's entirety from
about Pakistan back west across Africa and

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.500
Europe to about Brazil on north to Nova Scotia.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.640
For United States observers, the eclipse will
already be underway at moonrise, and for everyone,

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.870
the darkening of the Moon will only be penumbral.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.360
So we won't see the typical darkening that
occurs when the umbral shadow of Earth seems

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.140
to take a "bite" out of the Moon as it revolves
through our planet's shadow stretching out

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.400
into space.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.980
No... what is more likely is a subtle shading
and darkening as our natural satellite's inclined

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.930
orbit takes it slightly above the Earth's
plane with the Sun.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.690
At maximum eclipse, the Moon will only have
about 2/3 of it's disk in the penumbral shadow,

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.850
as seen here.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.830
So look carefully -- it might be easy to miss
if you're not looking for it.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.410
Did you see it?

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.790
Let's look again.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.980
Ah... there it is.. yeah, it's THAT subtle.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.590
Be on the lookout; it may be easy to miss.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.870
And lastly but not least, and more of a telescopic
event, look for a double moon transit on the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.470
face of Jupiter during the early morning hours
of Saturday, October 19-th (North American

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.160
observers, start looking after midnight from
the night of the 18-th).

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.460
As the four Galilean moons shuttle back and
forth along the equator of the planet, the

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.330
moons Io and Europa will be casting their
shadows onto the gas giant's surface clouds.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.040
Zooming in with sufficient magnification (try
for 150 to 200 times or more, if you can get

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.420
a clear image), watch them as they touch the
edge of the planet, then transit their way

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.710
across the disk, and finally leave it.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.240
It's a fascinating sequence to observe, especially
when two of them are transiting at the same

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.240
time.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.720
See if you can spot this event either from
the beginning or sometime during it.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.960
Look for times/date information at eyes on
the sky dot com.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.330
Along The Ecliptic: Early in the week 6.0
magnitude Uranus passes within 7 arc minutes

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.660
of a similarly bright 6.4 magnitude star.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.889
And furthest out Neptune is less than a binoculars
field away from 4.2 magnitude Theta Aquarii.

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:35.889
That's all for this week.

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.220
Keep your eyes on the sky and your outdoor
lights aimed down, so we can all see, what's

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.220
up.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.470
I'm David Fuller, wishing you clear and dark
skies.
