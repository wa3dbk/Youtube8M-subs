00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.529
How to Save Money with Frequently-Missed Tax
Deductions.

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.820
Make sure you're keeping every penny you can!

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.049
Here are some legitimate deductions that filers
often miss.

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.270
You will need Mileage calculations and receipts.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.760
Step 1.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.230
Deduct your state, local, and foreign income
taxes, and non-business property taxes.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.369
Experts say taxpayers often forget that these
are deductible.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.019
Step 2.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.450
Calculate mileage related to medical needs
for you and any dependents, like trips to

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.410
the doctor and pharmacy.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.320
Mileage pertaining to charitable works is
also deductible, as long as the organization

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.720
is a 501(c)3 non-profit.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.210
Keep receipts for everything you take as a
deduction; if you're audited, anything you

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.270
can't document won't be allowed.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.760
Step 3.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.480
Deduct expenses related to a job search as
long as you're seeking a position in the same

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.100
field as your current field.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.110
Step 4.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.150
Cut your gambling losses: If you won more
than $600 gambling, but your losses exceeded

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.120
those winnings, you may deduct the amount
you won.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.880
You must be able to prove your losses, so
save receipts from trips to the casino and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.500
lottery ticket purchases.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.970
Step 5.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.791
Claim your parents as dependents if they earn
less than the exemption amount, and you can

00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:19.140
prove you are responsible for at least half
their living expenses.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.340
Dependent parents don't necessarily have to
live with you.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.590
Step 6.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.290
If you paid for financial advice, claim it
as an investment expense.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.759
Step 7.

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.520
Deduct home renovations that are medically
necessary, like a wheelchair ramp.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.689
Step 8.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.170
If you have rental property, deduct any and
all expenses related to managing and maintaining

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.830
it, including mileage involved in checking
on the property, collecting rent, or running

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.970
around getting the supplies to make a repair,
the cost of which is also deductible.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.130
Step 9.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.549
If you missed these deductions or any others,
you may file amended tax returns going three

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.290
years back.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.099
Did you know Americans spend about 100 days
a year working just to pay their income taxes.
