00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.010
Why hello there. Today I’m going to tell
you some things you may not know about the

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.180
popular electronic computer game series “Grand
Theft Auto”. I have never played a Grand

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.259
Theft Auto game and almost certainly never
will, but I know all of these facts off the

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.159
top of my head because I’m the best at explaining
things. Let us begin:

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.860
In Grand Theft Auto 4 you play as a struggling
immigrant named Niko, I’m sure all you nerds

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.789
knew that, but you might not know that Niko’s
look was inspired by Sasha, the villain's

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:59.749
right-hand man in the 2001 film Behind Enemy
Lines. Rockstar acknowledged this influence

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:06.110
by naming one of Niko’s clothing options
“Sasha’s Outfit”, after the deadly henchmen.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.110
Claude’s story in Grand Theft Auto 3 may
also be inspired by a movie character; Porter,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.870
Mel Gibson’s character in the 1999 action
thriller Payback. Like Porter, Claude was

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.900
shot by his partners after a robbery and left
for dead, causing him to seek revenge. In

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.180
both the movie and the game, the old partners
send a hit squad to take him out; in the movie

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.660
they send mob members, in the game, the Colombian
Cartel. Have you ever been in a balls-to-the-wall

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.360
fight for your life against the Colombian
Cartel? Happened to me back in ‘79, hooo

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.520
boy, talk about a shitstorm, but that is a
story for another day.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.180
Almost every Grand Theft Auto fan knows that
Rockstar took a large amount of inspiration

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.190
from the 1983 gangster picture Scarface when
creating the insane coked-out world of Vice

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.189
City, hell, my buddy Jack Nicholson knew that,
and he thinks that Richard Nixon is still

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:24.749
president most of the time. But you may not
know that there’s some more specific references

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:30.890
in there as well. For instance, search for
the right apartment building and you’ll

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.810
find a gruesome bathroom with a chainsaw inside,
this is a shout-out to the infamous scene

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.659
in Scarface where Tony’s associate Angel
is dismembered with a chainsaw. This sequence

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:49.139
is especially notable for causing huge moral
controversy (much like Grand Theft Auto 3).

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:56.139
At the time of its release, it had to be re-edited
three times before it was granted an “R”

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.120
instead of “X” rating.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.739
The Vercetti Estate also bears an obvious

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.260
resemblance to Tony Montana’s mansion in
Scarface. Tony’s bloody final stand is very

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.010
similar to the Vice City mission “Keep Your
Friends Close”, where the player must face

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.379
wave after wave of enemies who have invaded
your estate, even players who haven’t seen

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:30.999
the film will know this scene from its often-quoted
line: “Say hello to my little friend”.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.120
Are you noticing a common theme with these
movies? Yes, yes they are all very violent,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.120
but more importantly, none of them feature
me. This, in my opinion, some colossal bullshit.

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.290
How about throwing in a reference for all
those Evan Almighty fans out there? Or hey,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.930
how about The Shawshank Redemption? That’s
a pretty violent movie, I mean it’s got

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.129
“shank” right there in the title. 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.900
It’s only the best goddamn movie
ever made according to the biggest movie website

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:15.239
in the world. But I digress, the point is
that Grand Theft Auto references a lot of

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.959
movies and none of them are mine.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.460
Let’s move on to some cars, everyone likes

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.789
cars, right? Well, Grand Theft Auto 5 features
a lot of vehicles that are parodies of those

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:43.789
found in real life, some are more obvious
than others. The cleverly named Coil Voltic

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:50.289
is a reference to the electric-powered Tesla
Roadster, the Vapid Peyote recalls Ford’s

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:57.160
classic Thunderbird convertible and Trevor’s
truck of choice, the Canis Bodhi, is based

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:04.160
on the Kaiser M715. It is also worth mentioning
that the Truffade Z-Type, which is based on

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:12.259
the Bugatti Atlantic, looks kind of like the
car that I drive in the 1989 Best Picture

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:18.710
Winner Driving Miss Daisy; but how often do
they reference it? You guessed it: not even

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.370
once. I mean come on, that’s a heartwarming
classic you can really sit down and have a

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.650
good time watching with the whole family!
What’s a man gotta do to get his movie referenced

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.460
in one of these stupid things? Dismember some
guy in a bathroom apparently.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:43.460
Let’s talk locations, the vast state of
San Andreas was obviously inspired by Los

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.659
Angeles and the surrounding area, but you
may not know about all the specific locations

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:57.319
that are recreated in Grand Theft Auto 5.
There’s the big tourist spots like the Hollywood

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:04.959
Bowl, which appears in the game as the Vinewood
Bowl, or the Chinese Theater, a location called

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:11.150
The Oriental in the game. Not all the locations
are quite as well-known though, take the Los

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:18.150
Santos Observatory, which is a very accurate
recreation of the Griffith Observatory, found

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:25.360
on a similar hill in LA. Or the Van Crastenberg
Hotel, a faithful recreation of the Roosevelt

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:32.919
Hotel, a historic building that dates back
to 1927. My personal favorite recreation is

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:40.060
actually an Easter egg, the Playboy mansion
is quietly hidden away in northwest Richmond.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.110
Spent a lot of time there back in the day,
still trying to get my lifetime ban lifted.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.240
Well boys and girls, this is where I would
normally make some sort of inspirational speech,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:06.240
which would undoubtedly change all of your
lives for the better, but I’m old and tired.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:13.259
If you’re watching this video you’re undoubtedly
white, and chances are you’re a dude too,

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:17.960
so how’s about you man-up and share some
of your own Grand Theft Auto references in

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.099
the comment section below. And don’t forget
to “Like” this video too. People worked

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:29.000
hard on this shit. Oh, and you best “Subscribe”
while you’re at it. That’s if you don’t

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.780
want me coming to your house to whoop yo' ass.
