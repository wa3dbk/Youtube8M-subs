00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.789
Hi. Ny name is Kirsten Segler from The
Greenery

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.619
and in this segment we want to talk
about a variety of tender succulent called

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.250
Echeveria. This is going to be just part
one of many more parts the come.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.279
This is my favorite type of succulent

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.429
and is the one we have the most
selection of. This

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.519
example here in front of us are
a mixed bowl

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.650
of Echeveria. It just gives you an idea
of what you can do with these

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.309
type of plants. They won't survive our interior

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.350
winters. They would survive on the West
Coast

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.690
but that doesn't mean you can't use them
in this kind of a feature

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.229
in a mixed shallow bowls. Very, very
drought tolerant. We only water this

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.670
I think only about four times all season. So
for a low-maintenance,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.189
heat-loving plant, nothing beats the
Echeveria for the Okanagan.

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:05.239
We're just going to do a small
introduction to a

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.240
few other varieties. We do carry many more
than this but

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.220
just selected some of my favorites and
some of our bestsellers.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.750
I was going to show a little close up on them and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.270
introduce the name to you. So up front
here, this first one

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.640
is called Woolly Rose. Obviously
has a a woolly look to it. Very

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.900
hairy type leaf so that's why it's
given that name

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.540
Woolly Rose. Coming up behind here,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.760
this is called Chroma. A little
smaller head to this

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.970
which is great if you like the flowering
effect of these. These all do have a

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.300
flowering period by the way.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.500
So the more heads you get in a plant,
the more flowers you'll get.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.840
So you'll notice as this part goes on,
there are going to be some varieties with really large

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.590
heads while

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.120
in that type of a plant, you won't get quite
as many of these flowering

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.540
stocks. So this again is called Chroma.
Given that name because it does have

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.350
a little bit of coloring on the edges 
in the leaf, little patches of,

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.229
kind of a chrome coloring that does
appear at times.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.239
Over here, this is one of our best
sellers.

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.500
We do produce a lot of this one.
This is called Pink Frills.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.340
So it does have a little, really
pink edge on it.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.349
Good, solid grower and nice blooming
habit to it

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.990
as well.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.210
Up front here, this one's quite a rare

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.830
variety. This is called Mexican Giant. It has
a white

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.350
powder on the foliage that to you can
see

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.930
like that, it rubs off. A very nice look to
that one.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.020
Contrasting to the one

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.080
beside it, this is one of the slowest
growing varieties there is.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.570
It is called Black Knight. It is the
darkest one that I know of.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.750
We're just starting to get some heavier
production to this

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.790
so I will have this available for sale
next year and it has also the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.500
darkest

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.890
flower that I know too. Nice, dark red
flower

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.910
with the dark foliage. Behind, a little bit
of contrast to the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.519
the dark one, we have one called Lemon
Lime.

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.600
So it does have sort of that lighter lemony look
to it.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.420
Great for mixing in a bowl. You know,
you can get some silver in there, some

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.050
black, some lemon and they just

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.870
work great against each other,
contrasting colors.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.910
Another smaller one here,

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.130
Mexican Snowball. More rounded

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.690
head to it. Obviously I think that's why it was given the
name Snowball.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.420
So that's this one here. And

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.250
this would be our best seller now.
This is called Metallica.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.299
Now it's almost identical to Perle von
Nurnberg. The average person

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.070
wouldn't be able to tell the difference
between those two varieties but to

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.150
you think that this one is just a shade
darker, more pink

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.650
but our most popular variety by
far, Metallica.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.709
And moving along here now

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.230
to the front, it looks almost like a
miniature variety.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.890
This has taken a long time to get this
stock pot to this size, called

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.610
Pulidonis.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.400
It has a neat, little red edge. Just
down the

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.810
edge of the leaf there. Makes that one stand out
a little bit different

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.810
from some of the others.
