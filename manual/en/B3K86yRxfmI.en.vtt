Hey! How's it going everybody? Welcome to another video on Ross Goes Drumming. 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.799
Today's video is going to continue on from where we left the other one.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.030
Just focusing on that little groove I played at the end. 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.389
So if you want to watch that video first before watching this one, there's an annotation link...

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.039
Here: 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.980
So, everyone else who's still here watching this video, let's get started. 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.699
So the best place to start with that groove is to look at playing our accents 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.220
on 16th notes as every third 16th. 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.700
So, here's an exercise to build up to that. You start off by tapping a tempo with one of your feet.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.300
And then you start adding in just 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.840
straight 16th notes

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.840
and then we'll start to build it up into those accents. 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.020
Let's try that a little bit slower. 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.890
The next step

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.079
can be to push those accents 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:32.170
down onto the bass so that way we've got our every third 16th stroke on the bass as accents 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.260
and the rest are just up the top on the snare. 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.270
I'll show you how that sounds. 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.530
So, make sure that you're tapping one of your feet to keep that every quarter note tempo going there. 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.229
Because

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.630
the next step is to bring in a snare drum accent

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.630
on beats two and four so it starts to become a groove. 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.499
So, through that exercise our accents have been on that every third 16th note

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:54.329
and that's that polyrhythmic feel. So we moved those accents down onto the bass and then added 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.779
our snare on 2 and 4

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:58.309
and we have a groove. 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:02.059
So, if you've got all that together, here's something else you can try. 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.840
This is probably my favourite variation on that groove. 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.650
Those bass drum accents on every third 16th that I talked about 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.270
we're now going to double those up by following them with another 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:20.270
accent the 16th note after. I'll show you how that sounds. 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.799
And so that's where we'll leave it for this video. If you want to continue on this journey 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.639
of where we're going with these patterns at the moment and perhaps you'd like a more

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.549

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.260
