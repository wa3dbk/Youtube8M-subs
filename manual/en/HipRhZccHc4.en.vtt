00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.500
I feel much older now.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.450
Not because of time...

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.240
But, because of circumstance.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:18.480
Sweden, the land of mountains, streams, rivers,
and forests.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.869
Majestic and oh, so tranquil.

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.230
I was just a farm boy from Halmstad.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.000
A quiet place in the middle of nowhere.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.350
All I ever knew was the farm, our town, and
our peaceful way of life.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.670
Our skies were always blue.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.800
Our rivers were always clear.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.090
Our harvests were always plentiful.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.350
I never thought that our quiet farmland would
become the center of hell.
