00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.109
A fruit drink full

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.479
with vitamins and fibers and antioxidants.

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:28.909
Smoothies help you increase your intake of

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:33.100
of fruits and veggies and is the perfect drink to throw in additional nutritional add-ins

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.030
as flaxseeds

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.430
or chia seeds

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.610
you can use almond milk known for its
high nutritional value or any other

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.610
milk you may like.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.830
the secret ingredient are the baby spinaches
that you won't be able to feel the taste

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.620
but you'll enjoy all its health benefits and it will add your smoothie

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.130
fibers and leafy green nutrients.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.150
The fresh mint and the ginger root will give your smoothie a spicy kick.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.670
All these yummy fruit and veggies will help you naturally boost energy

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.479
Smoothies are a great way to get kids to eat fruit and veggies, not tasting green

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.030
at all.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.060
