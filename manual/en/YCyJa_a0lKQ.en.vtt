00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.960
Hello, it's Liz Walker here. Today I'm going
to show you how to make an Exploding Handbag.

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:21.029
You could use this as a card for somebody
and you could decorate the inside with a sentiment,

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.660
or you could use it to put a gift in. It's
very easy to make. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.140
All you need are two 12"x12"

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.740
matching pieces of paper. 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.160
Let me show you how you make this. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We're going to take one 12"x12" piece of paper, and I've done this on white so you can see 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.260
where I'm going to score. 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.560
We're going to score 4" all the way around the piece of paper to create a pattern like this. 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.960
When we've done that, we need to score

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.970
diagonally out of the four corners of the
center square. 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.270
Then we're going to measure the center, which would be 2", of the 2 sides,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.690
and score in diagonals to the pattern.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I'm going to take my piece of paper to score - 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.060
I have prescored this so I'm going to fold along the lines.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.220
Then we're going to fold the corners inside. 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.640
The center squares are going to fold like that, so that we have the base of our handbag. 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.980
As you can see, the corner
pieces overlay each other and sit nicely, and then the bag can open and close.. 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.080
Next we're going to take the other piece of paper and cut a 12"x3/4" strip 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.400
and score 1-1/2" from each side.

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:46.349
Again, I've done this on white card
so that you can see better where the score lines are.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.820
This is going to be the handle
for the handbag. 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:05.019
We also need to cut a piece of the paper that is 7"x4". 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.019
We're going to score at 4" and 5" to make a  4", 1", and 2" section. 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.220
This is going to become the back
of the handbag here and the top and flap.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.079
We're going to adhere this onto the back.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.140
I have my pieces already cut out and I'm going

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.000
to score at 1-1/2" from both ends.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.320
 That will
be my handbag handle. 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:03.419
Again, I'm going to take my piece of paper - I already prescored this. I'm going to fold it over like that.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.900
As you can see, I've used the pattern here
of the paper to become the flap of my handbag,

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.780
so that will sit like that. 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.379
Now I'm going to take my glue - I'm using all-purpose glue

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:37.379
for this one because it's movable, it doesn't
adhere straight away. That gives me a little

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.700
ability to be able to move my pieces of paper.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.480
I'm going to adhere it to the back of my handbag.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:00.560
I can move it around, which is great. Then
just get it in place before it sticks permanently.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.300
I've got my little flap. 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.639
What I have to ensure the flap sticks down is a small piece of self-adhesive

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:29.639
Velcro, which I will adhere in a moment. I'm
going to take the handle. 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:39.490
This time I'm going to use tacky glue to adhere it to 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.330
the narrow scored piece on the inside. 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.560
Again on the other side. 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.990
All that's left to do is

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.950
fit my self-adhesive piece of sticky Velcro.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.020
What I do is adhere the top piece first and

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:37.029
then bring it together just as I want it to
sit and let it sit there. 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.940
There we go - handbag all ready to be decorated.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:50.940
 I hope you've enjoyed
that, and have fun making your own! 

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:53.509
Thanks for watching and listening - see you next time.
