00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.500
The Real Number System

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.540
Numbers can be classified in many different
ways.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.720
Let's look at some of those,

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.600
starting with
natural numbers.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.160
Natural numbers is the set of counting numbers,
like

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.660
1, 2, 3, 4, etc.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.980
Whole numbers include the set of natural numbers
and also zero.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.000
Whole numbers would be numbers like 0, 1,
2, 3, etc.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:53.100
Integers include the set of whole numbers
and all their negatives.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.700
Integers would be numbers like

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:06.040
-3, -2, -1,
0, 1, 2, 3, etc.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.260
Notice it goes on in both directions. It would continue going in both directions.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:25.220
Rational numbers include this set of integers,
so -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, etc.,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.420
but it also includes the whole set of numbers that can
be expressed as a ratio of 2 numbers.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.920
Notice that the root of rational is ratio.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.380
A ratio is a fraction, or a comparison of
two numbers.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.880
Rational numbers not only include the whole
set of integers,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.360
but also the set of numbers that can be written as a ratio of integers.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.640
For instance,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.900
1/2 is a rational number.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.600
It's a fraction, or a ratio.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.340
Also, -4/3.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.440
That is a rational number, because it's a
ratio. It's a fraction.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.540
Rational numbers also include repeating and
terminating decimals, like

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.220
3/10 repeating and 25/100.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.660
3/10 repeating is the repeating decimal, and
it can be expressed as a fraction (1/3).

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.520
Again, it's a rational number, since it can
be written as a ratio.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.880
25 hundredths is a terminating decimal and
it can also be written as a fraction (1/4).

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.400
Again, it's a rational number, since it can
be written as a ratio.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.460
The real number system also includes another
set of numbers: irrational numbers.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.640
Irrational numbers, if we look at the word,

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.440
ir- (the prefix) means "not".

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.360
Then we see that word again. Rational.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:15.040
Irrational numbers is the set of numbers that
are not rational, or numbers that cannot be

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.620
written as a ratio, which means numbers that
can not be written as a fraction.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.580
This set of numbers includes things like pi.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.660
Pi is an irrational number.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.280
It's 3.14159, etc., etc., etc.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.980
That number goes on for ever,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.520
meaning it doesn't
repeat

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.320
and it doesn't terminate.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.340
Therefore, it cannot be written as a fraction.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.780
It's not rational.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.880
Another example would be like the square root
of 2.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:01.780
The square root of 2 is 1.414, etc., etc.,
etc.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.920
Again, it goes on forever, so it's not rational.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.120
It doesn't repeat like .3333333 and it doesn't
terminate.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.620
It never ends. It goes on forever.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.400
The real number system is made up of two different
groups of numbers:

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.940
rational numbers and irrational numbers.
