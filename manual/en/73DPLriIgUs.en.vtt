00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.030
So these are the instructions for an origami
lotus flower.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.010
So for the origami lotus flower we're going
to start with a blintz fold.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.660
In
order to get the blintz fold we have to find

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.550
the exact center of the paper.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.780
So, we're going to fold a diagonal crease.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.290
So, make sure that it's nice and
exact where you can see the two points are

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.590
right on top of each other and
just make a little tack right here.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.890
You don't' have to make the whole
crease, just make a little mark so that little

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.890
crease shows up.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.400
I'm going to do the same thing on the other
side.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.610
Go ahead and find the
other diagonal fold, get it nice and lined

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.270
up and then just make a little
crease right there.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.450
The only part that's important is right where
they

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.450
intersect.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.300
That's the exact middle of the paper.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.600
Now we're going to take all four corners and
we're going to fold those into

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.480
the center of that intersection.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.350
So, go all the way around and fold up to the
center of the intersection.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.330
And this is a blintz space when we fold it
the first time.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.820
Now, we're actually going to do a second blintz
space as well.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.119
So, we're
going to take all four of these new corners

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:25.680
and fold them into that center
and work that all the way around.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:34.229
This is called a double blintz space.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.630
Just like that.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.909
Now after you've done that, the next space
is a triple blintz space.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.859
So
we're going to do it one more time.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.429
Go for all four corners, fold those into the
middle.

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.569
Again the papers going
to start getting a little thick here but that's

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:49.679
okay.

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.869
Go ahead and get that all the way up.

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.299
It is helpful if they don't touch so that
they don't overlap on the edges.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.999
It'll make it a little bit simpler for you,
like that.

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:08.170
And now flip the whole thing over and we're
going to do one more blintz

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.950
space and this is after we've folded the paper
over.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.180
So it's going in the
opposite direction.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.069
So that is the fourth blintz space that we've
done on that sheet of paper.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:30.390
And it does get a little thick here and it
does get a little tiny.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.181
So after we've done the fourth blintz space,
we folded those all up, we're

00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:38.000
going to fold one corner and this is the hardest
step here.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.060
It really
doesn't want to do it.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.610
Just fold one corner down about halfway.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.780
This is not
going all the way into the middle.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.250
This is just coming down just about that
far.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.390
And the papers not going to be too happy about
it.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.900
But this will still
work, just like that.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.920
Now when you flip it over, you'll see these
four shapes and these are going

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.290
to be the petals for the lotus flower.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.810
Now the step that we're going to do, if you're
not careful you can actually

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.810
rip the paper.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.500
So try and be as careful as you can with this.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.900
We're going
to flip them all inside out.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.120
We're going to wrap them around the other
direction.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.320
And the way this works, it's helpful to push
and provide pressure on these

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.870
two points right here as you try to flip it
around.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.220
So go ahead and give it
a shot.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:41.960
We're going to push on both sides and once
the paper comes around, you get

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:55.540
it around that corner; it'll turn around like
this.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.400
Just like that.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.040
You can see, you can push in a little bit
and pull out some of that paper

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.870
that's tucked in under there and you see how
that comes up and that creates

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.690
that nice petal right there.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.650
Now there's' a couple ways you can do that
just by rotating and pushing it

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.790
all the way through.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.910
You can also unfold a couple of these things.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.840
Its' a
little bit more complicated and then sort

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:27.969
of wrapping it around and re-
maneuvering it back, like that.

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:29.400
Whatever works for you.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.590
So try and be as careful as you can so that
you

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.550
don't rip the paper.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:44.920
So, we're going to do that eight times all
the way around the model, just

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.920
like this.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:58.960
Pick it up, push it through, wrap it around.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.469
Sometimes it's too hard to try and unfold
some of the paper so you sort of

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:11.430
have to get this all to flip inside out as
carefully as you can.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:18.050
Okay, so those are the four to start off with.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.110
Then for the next set of four, what can be
helpful is to fold it in half a

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.569
little bit so that you lessen the amount of
stress around the outside and

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:33.430
when you do that it's easier to pull it around
to the top, like that.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.319
I'm
sort of pinching right here in order to lessen

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:44.840
the stress for getting this
to wrap around and turn inside out.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.340
So the second set of four a little bit easier
then the first set of four.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.969
Wrap that around, and then the last step,
go ahead and open this up on the

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:02.430
bottom and that'll give you a little bit of
some leaves on the bottom.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.610
You
flip it over and these are all the petals

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.409
so you can curl them as much as
you want in any direction.

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:20.719
But this is the origami lotus flower.

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:23.979
In order to get a colored version of the lotus
flower just start with the

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.610
paper the opposite direction and then do all
the same folds.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.989
This makes a white one as I showed you on
the back side.
