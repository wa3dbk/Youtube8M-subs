Hi! This is Ginny with Simply Beautiful Crafts
on behalf of Expert Village and today we are

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.090
going to make a very nice Victorian ornament
for your tree or a gift for someone who is

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.369
into Victorian. This is my Victorian wreath.
I went to the store and found different kinds

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.050
of ribbon; I also raided my own craft box
and found many kinds of ribbon. What you want

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.929
to do when you begin any wreath once you have
your shellacked wreath, is to take your ribbon

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.570
and you can measure it by going once and a
fourth around your wreath and that will give

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.170
you enough ribbon with a little bit to spare.
Then you want to weave your ribbon through

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.890
your pretzel wreath, you always want to cover
a joint, so you start here, bring it through,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.990
you have to be careful because that salt can
grab, especially if it is a lace ribbon like

00:00:50.990 --> 00:01:00.350
this, going in and out carefully making sure
that you keep your design on top and watching

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.250
out for that nasty salt that likes to grab
your ribbon, bring your ribbon in and out,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.320
in and out. Once you have gone all the way
around, what I did here too was I pulled it

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.350
up a little bit so that it had a bit of a
puff and if you want to do that you can make

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.570
it have your puff and then glue it between
each one, so that do not accidentally pull

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.990
it tight, that gives it a little bit more
of a 3D effect. Once you have gotten your

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.550
ribbon all the way through, you are going
to want to secure your ribbon at the end of

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.300
the wreath and for this you can use a hot
glue gun, it will keep ribbons and embellishments

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.370
tight on your wreath. It will not keep your
wreath together. You will need to use Elmerâ€™s

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:49.840
glue or liquid glue for that. Once your ribbon
is secure on the back, put that bead of hot

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.530
glue gun in there and then secure it, then
you want embellishment, I found buttons and

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.869
that is what I used on mine. Lay your buttons
around wherever you think that you would like

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.560
them to go before you glue them on, so that
you have an idea what your balance will be.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.119
Get your hot glue gun and you either glue
the spot or glue around the button, stick

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.099
them back on where you got them and then what
I did with mine was to take another ribbon

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.579
that was already a ruffled ribbon and put
it on the back and that is very simple. Just

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:25.579
put a bead of hot glue and hot glue it as
you go. Go all the way around and the last

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.010
thing you want to do is make your little bow
for the bottom, with little embellishment

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.459
in it, put a hanger on the back of it and
because you are using hot glue your Victorian

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.599
wreath is ready to hang on the tree and enjoy
for your very Victorian Christmas.
