Hello. It's today's "Snack Time".

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Have you watched HANAFUBUKI's new video "Red Kettle"?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's my red kettle. I love it.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I think it's so fun!

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So today's snack is...

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
"Tamago Gani"

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I bought this one at section of a supermarket selling something to munch on with a drink.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
a small size crab.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's a real small crab.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Can you see it?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It has claws and legs.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
There is a snack like this.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm going to try this for the first time.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
the inside of the crab.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's crunchy and good!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It's Mirin flavor.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Japanese (sweet) Sake flavored.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.000
Now I want something to drink ;)

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Take care everyone :)
