00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:01.600
Hey, check it out.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.100
We're looking at one of these new
ultra low voltage netbook things.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.670
Stay tuned and we'll talk 
about it in a second.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.410
Alright, check it out.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.020
So here's one of these kind of bizarre, 
odd, Frankenstein netbook things here.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.360
Now, technically speaking 
I'm not supposed to call it a netbook;

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.850
it's technically, supposedly, 
a very, very small notebook.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.130
But I'm going to 
go out on a limb here 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.570
and just say that this is a netbook.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.440
I don't care what rules you have

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.770
this is pretty much a netbook.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.880
It's not a full sized laptop

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.330
but I tell you what 
it does have a few advantages.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.340
Now, these are really, really nice.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.950
This is the EC1805U from Gateway,

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.240
if I didn't mention that 
already earlier. 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.550
Basically you're looking 
at an 11.6" notebook. 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.320
So forget about 
your 10.2" notebooks 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.820
that the screens are too small

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.590
and they only give you 
600 lines of resolution.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.530
This one has a very, very nice 
1366x768 resolution.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.500
So it will do a 720p video,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.630
it's a little bit bigger.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.110
It also means that he graphics 
on netbooks is usually terrible;

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.100
they had to up the graphics 
a little bit and they did.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.720
You're getting the 
GMA 4500 MHG chipset 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.180
so that will let you 
do some HD videos. 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.380
And it's not only the graphics 
and the screen that got an upgrade,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.620
you also get a very, 
very nice processor. 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.990
It is the ultra 
Low Voltage Intel SU3500.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.610
So that's a very, 
very nice 1.4 GHz. 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.630
Now, you think 
"1.4 that's slow, and I want 1.6". 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.030
Well, I tell you what, 
this is a real processor.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.600
It actually works, 
it does things. 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.770
Atoms are cool,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.140
sure they only burn four watts
and they are all efficient

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.400
but they are slow, 
they are boring.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.650
You're on a netbook sometimes 
and you get a little but upset at the speed.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.080
This gets rid of all of that.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.010
This is like one step up.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.910
It's not like three steps up, 
but it's one step up.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.980
Very, very nice

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.110
and it makes the whole netbook experience
that much more enjoyable

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.500
when you know that you have the ability 
to do certain things with your processor;

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.930
it's going to open up programs fast,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.960
it's going to let you do 
little things like Photoshop.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.630
The extra resolution on the screen, 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.110
again it's only 11.6, 
it only went up a little bit,

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.530
but now you're getting 
over 700 lines of resolution

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.900
so you can do HD videos.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.230
And, my favorite part is,
that now that there is HD

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.440
they obviously gave you an HDMI out.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.880
So, that's really important 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.450
because that means that you can 
take this to your friend's house

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.420
pop in an HDMI cable 
and put it on your TV, 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.780
or at your house,
even better. 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.880
You don't have to go anywhere.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.020
So, very cool, 
like it a lot. 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.620
Now, let's talk a little bit 
about specs on this thing.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.730
I'm going to give you 
a brief tour real quick.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.090
Starting from this bottom 
back left corner here,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.660
you've got a VGA adaptor,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.440
this is where you'd 
plug in your power. 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.470
This is the fan louver.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.000
You've got HDMI, 
which will also let you do audio.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.220
Again, great for outputting 
some nice video to a big TV.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.740
You have a USB 2.0 port.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.680
You'll see right there you've 
got a couple indicator lights 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.650
for hard drives and Wi-Fi 
and all that good stuff.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.190
And right underneath it you've 
got switches for that good stuff.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.030
So, if you want to turn your Wi-Fi on, 
right there,

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.260
and your Bluetooth, 
right there. 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.070
Those are both very nice 
conveniences to have.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.030
You do have a very, 
very nice track pad; 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.930
two buttons, 
very wide. 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.300
You can feel the edges, 
which is nice. 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.700
I recently did another one of these little
ultra low voltage netbook kind of deals

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.900
and you couldn't feel the edge,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.440
so you never knew if your finger 
was on the track pad or not.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.950
It's got the little grated 
little holes here,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.910
I don't know if you can see it. 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.210
Let's get it into the light.
There you go.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.650
So you've have kind of like a football,
little holes.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.170
Very, very nice; 
I like that a lot. 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.450
Now, when you move on to this side

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.250
you still have a lot 
of really good stuff. 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.770
Right over here, multi-card reader.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.060
OK, same one you're going 
to seein most computers.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
It's going to do SD cards,
and MS cards, 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.790
and Sony cards, 
and all that good stuff. 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.200
You have input and output 
for your headset and microphones.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.530
Mind you that the 
headset is also SPdif,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.010
so that's really cool if you want to
transfer awesome multi-channel audio.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.280
You got two USP 2.0 ports, 
very nice. 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.510
Kensington lock.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.990
And a 10/100 Ethernet to 
compliment the N-Draft wireless

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.420
that is built into this thing. 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.800
That's right, I said N-Draft wireless.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.470
It's also really important to note that, 
well you can see it on the screen,

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.030
this is a Vista Home Premium 32 bit edition,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.150
that's what it comes with 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.100
but do not forget that you actually 
get a Windows 7 upgrade on this thing,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.030
so you won't be 
seeing that anymore. 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.230
You'll be seeing the Windows 7 
task bar down there eventually,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.300
when it comes out.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.140
It's also important to know 
that you do get a one year warranty 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.110
with this great little 
piece of technology. 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.510
So, that's also very important to know.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.010
Also, you do have a webcam.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.280
And that is a 1.3 Megapixel webcam;

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.720
great for Skype, 
Instant Messenger, 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.080
you name it 
it can do it. 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.190
Alright, now my favorite feature though,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.980
one of the most important ones by far 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.490
that most people that are 
going to be looking at these

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.800
is again we're talking 
about the efficiency. 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.270
It really is actually that efficient.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.400
It's very impressive.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.400
Now, first of all you've got 
the LED backed screen.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.260
OK, so it's an LCD screen 
but it's LED backed.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.110
That means that it's going 
to conserve more energy.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.550
And you have a 4400 mAh battery

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.090
and that equals to eight hours of battery 
life if you're using this thing wisely,

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.880
if you're not, you know, 
going crazy surfing the web.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.190
But, if you're just surfing the web,
monitoring stocks,

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.220
doing little things here and there, 
checking your Facebook,

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.090
you get up to eight hours 
of battery power 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.700
and that's absolutely ridiculous.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.390
Also, in case you guys want to see,

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.060
that is what the front 
of this thing looks like.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.660
It's got this really nice little accent here;
it says Gateway.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.270
Kind of nice right there.
Looks elegant.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.210
Chrome, the rest of it is red.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.210
This thing is also available in black.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.140
And I'm not usually a fan 
for colors on laptops

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.340
but it is a nice red.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.450
I'll give it to them, 
they picked a good color.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.850
And boy, I love the battery.
What can I say?

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.490
It has nothing to do with the color 
but that battery is awesome.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.120
So very, very nice.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.750
Again, it's the EC1805U from Gateway.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.100
Not really a netbook technically.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.870
I call it a netbook because 
it's just a little tiny bit bigger.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.370
It has avery very nice, 
nearly full sized keyboard.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.900
It's a really nice keyboard.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.100
I can type like crazy,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.940
if you remember some other netbooks 
that came out recently,

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.340
actually they were very small laptops,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.910
had flimsy keyboards that kind of felt 
like you were pushing through them,

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.490
this one does not.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.740
Very, very nice LED backed screen.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.050
Great battery.
Great trackpad.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.880
Awesome, awesome little guy 
from Gateway. 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.420
If you have any questions on it 
feel free to email me

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.960
and I'll see you guys later.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.350
For more information on the 
Gateway EC1805U Netbook

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.650
type in
G180-11600 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.320
into the search engine 
of any of these major retailers.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.700
For Computertv 
I'm Albert.
