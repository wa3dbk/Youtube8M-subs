00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.710
Check out this brand new and 
very minimalist big laptop from HP.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.500
It's the 6830s and 
it's actually loaded

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.590
with some pretty 
decent harware

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.930
in a nice desktop
replacement sort of package

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.600
and a very minimalist design.
It's got a Core 2 Duo

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.430
2 gigahertz processor,
the T5870 on board.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.730
4 gigs of DDR2 RAM.
Pre-loaded with XP Pro.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.900
It's got a 320 gigabyte hard drive.
It has a blu-ray reader

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.600
so you're going to be able to
watch your hi-def blu-ray disks

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.700
on this particular laptop.
17 inch screen, nice big screen

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.220
but what's nice about this one
in being a 17 inch laptop

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.060
it doesn't feel huge. 
Sitting and looking at it,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.790
it kind of looks like
more like a 15.4 inch laptop

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.320
but it's definitely 17 inches. 
It's got a 1440 by 900 resolution

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.860
on the screen, nice
high resolution screen.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.360
Discrete graphics, HD Radeon
Mobiliity 3430 on board

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.350
so you do have the ability to 
play games and decode HD video

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.600
and all that stuff 
without any problem.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.210
It's totally hooked up
on the wireless front,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.210
it's got a, g, n and it has
gigabit ethernet as well

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.560
so you have all the wireless
standards taken care of

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.900
as well as gigabit. And it 
only weighs 6.5 pounds

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.760
which is very light
for a 17 inch notebook.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.010
The design is really cool,
it's all matte black.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.300
None of the, none of the sort of
gloss that you're used to seeing

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.240
on a lot of modern day notebooks.
All flat, you have a speaker bar

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.170
right here underneath
your monitor

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.770
that is not crowded with
media buttons or controls.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.680
All it has is a power button and a button
to turn your wireless on and off

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.880
and of course that's
flanked by the speakers.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.950
Up in the screen bezel you do 
have one of your HP webcams

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.250
right up here and 
a microphone as well

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.890
so you're going to be able 
to do all of your web chatting,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.790
all of your video blogging,
and all of that stuff

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.630
without any problem. Now over on the
side is where you're going to find

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.680
that blu-ray reading drive and of
course that's also a DVD-RW drive

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.870
so you're going to be able to 
burn DVDs and watch blu-rays.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.740
You've got dual USB ports
right over here.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.050
Along the front you're going 
to find your headphone

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.100
and microphone ports,
as well right over here

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.950
is your SD card reader so 
you're going to be able to plug in

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.990
all of your SD cards
from your digital camera.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.520
Over on the other side you're
going to find your ethernet,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.800
VGA, your power, or I'm 
sorry this is the modem,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.300
this is the ethernet right 
here, and two USB ports

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.240
located on this side as well 
and hidden right above there

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.040
is your Express 54 slot so 
you're going to be able to use

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.700
any of your larger format Express
cards with this particular notebook.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.450
Full size keyboard 
with a numeric keypad

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.180
So if you're a number cruncher
you're going to appreciate that

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.260
but all in all it's a very 
nice basic notebook

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.660
that doesn't sacrifice 
on the built quality,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.070
doesn't sacrifice on
the components,

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.730
it's just a nice size
at a good price.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.840
It's the HP Compaq 6830s
17 inch notebook.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.900
To get more info on the
HP Compaq 6830s

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.700

retailers you see here

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.300
and type in

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.000
