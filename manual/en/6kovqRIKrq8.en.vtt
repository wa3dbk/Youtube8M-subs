00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.040
When people travel to Thailand...

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.960
they want to see an elephant.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.240
To ride one and feed it.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.380
What people don't realise is the abuse
that builds has led...

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.120
to making the elephant allow you
to mount its back for that ride.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.140
Many elephants will actually kill
their calves immediately after birth.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.020
They know what kind of life
that baby is going to have.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.420
And they don't want their young
to go through it.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.220
They'd rather kill it as soon as
it's born.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.460
There is a chain of cruelty
that we have to stop right now.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.220
The people who can stop it
are the tourists in Thailand.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.460
They have the power.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.880
I am Katherine Connor of BLES,
the Boon Lott's Elephant Sanctuary.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.620
Here in Sukhothai in Thailand we focus
on the elephants' welfare.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.020
We are not interested in profit or
keeping tourists happy.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.800
We want to make a difference to the lives
of these abused elephants.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.080
The pace of life here is beautiful and slow.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.300
We work on elephant time.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.180
When they want to go, we follow.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.580
If they want to graze, we wait.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.660
For lots of people who come here...

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.460
it's a very different world,
a whole new way of life.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.700
We change people when they come here.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.260
Here we have Pang Noi and Pang Suai.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.440
And behind you Wassana, Lotus and Pang Dow.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.360
They are known as the gossip girls.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.820
They are trumpeting, roaring,
squeaking and purring non-stop.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.200
Normally the cameras are all on them.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.000
They're wondering when it will be
their turn.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.120
I have always had a passion for animals.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.880
When I came to Thailand,
I wanted to see elephants.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.440
I began to volunteer at an elephant centre
in North Thailand.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.520
I met a baby elephant called
Boon Lott, which is Thai for survivor

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.580
That elephant reached out and touched me
and changed my life forever.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.840
If he hadn't died, I am not sure
that I would have started BLES.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.600
I would have given all my attention
and my funds to him.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.340
Elephants in Thailand were always held
in high regard.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.480
They were used for logging.
That was banned in 1989.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.520
Thousands of elephants and their owners
were suddenly without work.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.620
What did they do?
They didn't give up their elephants.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.380
They needed to feed their families.
That is how elephant tourism was born.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.920
Elephants are forced to perform tricks.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.900
The training that is needed is diabolical.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.420
They go through a breaking process.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.460
The baby elephants are stabbed
and beaten repeatedly...

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.000
until their spirits are broken.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.620
It then becomes a machine
for the tourist industry.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.320
This is Boon Tong. She gave tourists
trekking rides in Pattaya.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.360
She had a big, heavy chair on her back.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.240
As a result of years of doing that...

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.400
she has a broken back.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.980
This is Wassana.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.100
She stood on a landmine when she was
illegally logging on the Thai border.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.560
Despite her maimed front foot...

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.440
she was still sold into the tourist trade
and forced to give rides.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.000
I don't think that people are cruel.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.600
Most of the cruelty that goes on
with elephants in Thailand...

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.140
is caused by lack of education.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.760
Most elephant owners don't know
the harm they're doing to the elephants.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.260
If they knew, I would hope they'd stop.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.960
We have three guest houses for two people each.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.100
We charge people to stay here.
We have no programme or schedule.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.560
We never encourage guests to approach
the elephants in their own space.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.040
We want to rescue abused elephants...

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.360
to help them recuperate.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.220
Teach them to be elephants again
and release them onto protected land...

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.340
where they can live as wild elephants.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.880
What amazes me the most about these elephants...

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.080
is their ability to forgive.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.820
All of these animals were abused
by us, by humans.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.880
And yet, here they are, comfortable.
Accepting us.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.060
Allowing us into their space.
Allowing us to walk beside them.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.980
I find that incredible.
