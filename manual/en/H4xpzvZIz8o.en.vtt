00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.400
A keen pig and deer hunter,
a man in tune with his environment,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.880
Inia Mikaere-Kiel (52) died

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.040
during a storm that hit Te Urewera,
Ruatahuna on Saturday.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.640
Here's Hinerangi Goodman.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.160
Cries of sadness and despair
for their dad and granddad,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.040
who passed away in the Urewera
Ranges while hunting in the weekend,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.880
leaving those
who were very close to him

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.320
to carry on with the work he loved.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.400
Mikaere grew up
at his grandfather's side.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.040
Although he's only 10 years old,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.240
they shared the same passion
for hunting in the forest.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.840
This occasion found them hunting

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.280
for the big one to enter in
to the upcoming competitions.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.560
The body of Inia Kiel
will be taken from his home

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.240
to lie at Rongomaipaapa Marae
at Horohoro.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.920
The funeral will be held
at 11am this Wednesday.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.520
Hinerangi Goodman, Te Karere.
