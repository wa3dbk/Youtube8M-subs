"Dietary Prevention of Age-Related 
Macular Degeneration"

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.957
Anyone who has ever got a sunburn knows

00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:13.357
how damaging the UV rays 
in sunlight can be.

00:00:13.357 --> 00:00:15.357
Imagine what those rays are doing

00:00:15.357 --> 00:00:18.686
to the back of our eyeballs, 
our retinas?

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:22.041
The eye's designed to take 
sunlight and focus it

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:26.157
like a magnifying glass 
into the back of our eyes.

00:00:26.157 --> 00:00:29.476
Thankfully we have a layer 
of cells in our eye

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:31.558
called the retinal pigment epithelium

00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:35.277
that supports and protects our 
delicate retinal eyesight machinery.

00:00:35.277 --> 00:00:40.862
This layer builds up yellow plant pigments 
from our diet, like zeaxantin,

00:00:40.862 --> 00:00:45.998
which absorbs blue light and protects 
the retina from photo-oxidative damage.

00:00:45.998 --> 00:00:49.817
The yellowing of our corneas 
when we get cataracts

00:00:49.817 --> 00:00:54.071
may actually be our bodies' defense 
mechanism to protect our retinas.

00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:58.148
In fact when we go and surgically 
remove those cataracts,

00:00:58.148 --> 00:01:01.237
our risk of blindness from macular 
degeneration shoots up

00:01:01.237 --> 00:01:04.385
since we've removed that protection.

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:07.758
Instead of trading one type 
of vision loss for another,

00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:10.917
instead of pigmenting the front 
of our eye with cataracts,

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:15.959
better to pigment the back 
of eyes with diet.

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:20.596
The pigment in the back of our eye 
is entirely of dietary origin,

00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:23.918
thus suggesting that 
the most common cause

00:01:23.918 --> 00:01:26.243
of going blind in the Western 
world could be delayed

00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:31.077
or even averted with appropriate 
dietary modification.

00:01:31.077 --> 00:01:33.477
Where in our diet do we get it?

00:01:33.477 --> 00:01:37.837
Well, the egg industry brags 
that eggs are a good source,

00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:41.557
but have an egg nearly day, six 
eggs a week for three months,

00:01:41.557 --> 00:01:46.276
and the pigmentation in 
our eyes barely moves.

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:50.317
And these were the high lutein, 
free range, certified organic eggs,

00:01:50.317 --> 00:01:54.468
not purchased at the supermarket, 
but from a local farm.

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:56.505
Instead of getting phytonutrients

00:01:56.505 --> 00:01:58.982
from the egg that came from the chicken

00:01:58.982 --> 00:02:02.437
that came from the corn and 
blades of grass you pecked on,

00:02:02.437 --> 00:02:05.158
what about getting it from the source:

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:09.477
a cup of corn and a half cup 
of spinach a day for three months?

00:02:09.477 --> 00:02:13.878
A dramatic boost in 
protective eye pigment.

00:02:13.878 --> 00:02:19.678
Just to compare to the eggs, 
here's the best that eggs can do.

00:02:19.678 --> 00:02:23.676
But if you cut out the middle hen 
and get these nutrients

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:29.157
from plants directly, 
you can get up to here.

00:02:29.157 --> 00:02:32.437
What's also so neat about 
this study is that it went back

00:02:32.437 --> 00:02:35.515
and measured the levels three 
months after the study stopped,

00:02:35.515 --> 00:02:39.558
and the levels were still way up here.

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:42.357
So once we build our 
macular pigment up

00:02:42.357 --> 00:02:45.365
with a healthy diet, our eyeballs 
really try to hold on to it.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:46.865
So even if we go on vacation

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:49.957
and end up eating more 
iceberg lettuce than spinach,

00:02:49.957 --> 00:02:54.461
our eyes will hold out until we get back.

00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:57.716
Yes, eyes can increase zeaxantin 
levels in the blood,

00:02:57.716 --> 00:03:00.905
but they also raise bad cholesterol 
levels and risk of heart disease,

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:04.198
therefore an egg yolk based 
dietary strategy

00:03:04.198 --> 00:03:08.518
to increase plasma zeaxantin 
cannot be recommended.

00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:13.599
An alternative, you know, a cholesterol-free 
food source is desirable,

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.746
like goji berries for example, which have

00:03:16.746 --> 00:03:19.317
up to 60 times more zeaxantin than eggs.

00:03:19.317 --> 00:03:24.488
A modest dose markedly 
increases levels in our body.

00:03:24.488 --> 00:03:28.238
An inexpensive, effective, safe, 
whole foods strategy

00:03:28.238 --> 00:03:30.730
to increase the zeaxantin 
in our blood stream.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:33.652
But we don't need it in our blood.

00:03:33.652 --> 00:03:36.038
We need it in our eyes.

00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:40.641
So how about a double-blind randomized 
placebo-controlled trial?

00:03:40.641 --> 00:03:44.236
To preserve eyesight in the elderly 
in traditional Chinese medicine,

00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:48.876
people are often prescribed 
40 to 100 goji berries a day.

00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:54.116
But here they just used 15 berries 
a day for three months.

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:59.038
But still found it could 
protect against loss of pigment

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.315
and prevent the buildup of 
what's called soft drusen,

00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:03.967
which is just debris that builds up 
in the back of our eye,

00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:07.679
both of which are associated with 
age-related macular degeneration,

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:11.399
the leading cause of legal blindness 
in older men and women,

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:15.117
affecting more than 10 million Americans.

00:04:15.117 --> 00:04:19.718
Now note they gave the berries 
with milk in this study,

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.438
so the butterfat could increase

00:04:21.438 --> 00:04:23.472
the absorption of the carotenoid pigments.

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:25.310
A healthier way to get the same effect

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.196
would be to just eat goji berries

00:04:27.196 --> 00:04:33.920
with nuts or seeds, in other 
words, Goji trail mix.
