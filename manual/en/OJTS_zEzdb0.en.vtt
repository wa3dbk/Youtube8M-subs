Hey I’m Sean Martin master screw turning
technician for Donek Snowboards I am in Soelden

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.830
Austira for carving masters its actually one
day before the event it starts tomorrow I

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:29.539
am in the gondola going up the hill this gondola
takes off from about well it services the

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:37.690
very top of the mountain and I think this
is right out the window right here the primary

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:46.990
run we see a lot of photos from at this event
this is a map of Soelden here what’s really

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:54.000
open while we’re here is the upper portion
of the mountain we are riding primarily on

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.949
over on this gondola right here right now
and the interesting this about this gondola

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.520
is this looks relatively small in the map
but the amount of the terrain the gondola

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:18.110
serves is probably more serviceable acreage
than Arapahoe Basin just between about 4 5

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.289
runs its massive up here
