00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.860
So in this tip, I'm going to show you how
to access your bios.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.970
Now, first of all, what actually is your bios
on your computer?

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.690
Well, bios stands for "basic input output
system," and what it is, it's a low level

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.030
way of configuring your computer.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.760
And what I'm talking about here isn't your
font size or anything like that, it's about

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.550
the system clock, it's about how fast your
processor is running and what kind of hard

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.670
disk drive your computer thinks it has.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.190
Now, normally, this is stuff that you wouldn't
need to access everyday, but sometimes, for

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.890
example, you are reinstalling your operating
system, you may need to enter the bios to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.739
change the boot order to make sure your computer
boots from a CD rather than from the hard

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.379
disk drive.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.530
Other people who may use this are people called
"Over Clockers" who want to try and get their

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.360
computer to run a little bit faster than it
normally would, but make sure you heed my

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.220
warning later on.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.200
So, let's take a look at how to do it.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.320
So the time to access your bios is just as
the computer is starting up from being powered

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.320
off.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.740
Now, it's different on every computer.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.670
On the Dell computer here, you do it by pressing
F2.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.810
Now on other computers, there are different
ways of getting into the bios.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.680
It's best to have a google search to find
out what they are.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.619
But quite frequently, it's F2.

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.240
So, you can see on the screen here, some of
the information that the bios gives you, so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.909
for example, I can see here the kind of processor
that this computer is running, exactly what

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.990
memory is installed on the computer, and also,
what we were talking about earlier on, which

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.159
is the boot sequence.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.030
So, for example, here, it's going to be from
the hard disk drive first of all.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.380
If we were installing a new operating system,
we'd want to make it boot from the CD drive,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.890
first of all.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.000
Other things that you can have a look at are
which hard disk drives are installed, any

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.610
other on board devices and so on, but I think
you get the idea.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.500
It's really low level configuration and stuff
that we're looking at here.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.690
Now, one word of warning, some bios let you
tamper with and fiddle with all kinds of settings

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.630
and it's really dangerous to do that if you
don't know what you're doing.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.590
I always make a note of what settings I'm
changing, what they were before I changed

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.819
them, in case the computer doesn't quite respond
properly after I booted it back up again.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.650
In a worse case, you can actually fry the
inside of your computer, if you start tampering

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.700
with the processor's settings.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.750
But, with all of those warnings in mind, do
have a look around.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.370
It's a great way of learning more about how
your computer works.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.631
And that's how to enter the bios on your computer.

00:02:58.631 --> 00:02:59.631
Tech expert, David McClelland, shows you how
to access the bios on your computer and gives

00:02:59.631 --> 00:02:59.641
a healthy word of caution on tampering with
the bios.
