The Christmas tree is coming

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.640
Stupid Christmas lights! These clearly have some kind of conspiracy against me!

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.520
Stop crankig Bao Dai. The lights aren't alive

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.000
They won't do any harm

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.860
Are you so sure about that?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.200
They are attacking me!

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.520
No they aren't. I just switched them on

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.780
Um...I mean I knew that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.980
Okay, let's put the decorations on the Christmas tree

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.660

Okay, it's time to decorate

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.800
Oh how awesome this tree is!

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.080
I'm actually more beautiful than that tree

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.680

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400
The world's most beautiful person

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.160
I'm actually the most handsome one, and the most beautiful one.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.980

What is he screaming again?

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.860
I agree. He is disturbing our creative fashion work

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.580
What fashion? Where?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.720
What ugly thing is this?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.420
What a rag!

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.060
What!

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.760
How rude thing to say

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.660
Well I was making that 'rag' for like 10 hours!

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.320
Well that was a waste of time right there

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.940
Olli Polli, I also want to go and decorate the Christmas tree, Olli

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.060
Well let's go then

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.440
But Daichi brought such crappy decorations

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.160
Go and tell him that he is stupid

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
What? I can't say that

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.280
Yes you can!

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.640
Um..Daichi?

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.680
What?

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.420
You are quite silly 'cause you...like...brought those silly, decorations?

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.380
Huh?

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.500
He can't even say that you are a moron

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.520
How embarassing!

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.920
Well, how is it going...you really need to come help us wrap Christmas presents

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.140
You have just been sitting here meditaiting this whole time

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.200
I'm enlightened

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.380
Um what?

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.520
Now I know that the best thing you can do for your spiritual wellbeing on Christmas is to wrap presents

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.580
Okay...can you come then and help?

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.460

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.360
Big brother wake up! Come decorate the tree!

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.660

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.500
You have slept the whole evening. Come decorate the Christmas tree!

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.780
No I won't

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.140

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.940
Would you go on a date with me now that Bao Dai isn't here?

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.320
Sure, why not?

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.300
Well, what's happening here?

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.760
You can't ask my Nalle on a date!

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.040
Hey, we are only missing a star from the top

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.420
Well now we have some kind of star, quite unique I think

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.340
Merry Christmas!
