Let us discuss after the delivery of the baby

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.239
moment the baby is delivered, mother should feed the baby within 2-3 hours of birth

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:49.996
This milk makes the child immune system strong

00:01:50.346 --> 00:01:52.426
to all his body parts, his brain

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:53.810
to strenthen his liver

00:01:53.962 --> 00:01:55.802
this milk is most important

00:01:56.116 --> 00:02:00.036
Within 2-3 hours of birth, give your baby your own milk feed

00:02:00.257 --> 00:02:02.257
Never in anger with your child

00:02:02.257 --> 00:02:03.390
or in mental tention

00:02:03.658 --> 00:02:05.898
you are then don't feed your child

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:07.506
Keep one thing in mind

00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:12.441
the kind of mental frame you have that kind of nutrition child will get

00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:15.493
do not feed the child when you are mental tention

00:02:15.493 --> 00:02:17.957
You have to feed the baby with your own milk till the baby is 9 months old

00:02:17.957 --> 00:02:20.523
you can feed with your own milk till the age of 9 months

00:02:20.523 --> 00:02:22.704
Now let us talk from the beginning

00:02:23.063 --> 00:02:25.223

what will happen with this, baby's mind will be perfect

00:02:50.175 --> 00:02:51.562
Keep one thing in your mind

00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:53.302
begin with the baby of 3 months old

00:02:53.302 --> 00:02:58.287
make sure that you make baby lying on his stomach on bed at least 3 minutes in a day

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:03.018
and gradually expand the duration of lying on bed on his stomach

00:03:03.018 --> 00:03:06.289

Before giving bath to your child

give him a mustard seed'soil

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.920
