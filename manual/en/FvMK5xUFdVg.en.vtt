00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.720
 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.900
 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.400
So here we are with the Amazon Fire phone.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.000
This is Amazon's new hardware device. They have finally entered the phone market Amazon Fire

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.640
and it's going to be very interesting to see

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.970
how this, well, catches fire with the
general public.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.460
Yes, bad pun time. Now overall

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.700
I really like the design of this device, it's quite Amazon Fire

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.489
beautiful to look at. It has a kind of
almost iPhone-esque

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.120
feel to it but skewing slightly into the
Nexus kind of look and feel Amazon Fire.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.120
Kind of if you were going to take an iPhone and an Android device and smoosh them together.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.490
They've added their own hardware buttons but it

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.560
kind of eschews the usual Android
front-facing soft button controls

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.570
and everything's physical controlled
here. They've they got dual

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.780
stereo speakers on the bottom of the
device and 4.7 inch Amazon Fire

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.980
IPS LCD display which reminds me a lot

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.850
of the HTC One M7.  Now from an

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.170
industrial design point of view, this is a
really nice looking device.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.679
It's  difficult to kind of pick anything
that you kind of look at and go mmm

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:14.119
that's a little bit ugly. Obviously when
you're designing

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.659
any smartphone you're going to be limited on where you can put various things

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.399
like your  speakers without them making the device potentially

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.829
bigger, longer, fatter or heavier. So really Amazon Fire

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.490
a nice trade-off here I think, not really
breaking the mould too much

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.350
but delivering something that looks good
and you're not going to mind taking out of your pocket to show your

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.479
friends. They've gone with quad core 2.2
GHz processor Amazon Fire

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.619
and the and Adreno 330 graphics GPU

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.130
backed up with 2gig of ram. This is
pretty standard stuff.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.509
No word on exactly which processor is in
here but I'd expect it to be

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.079
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 or an 801 series CPU.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.719
Now brilliantly here they've gone with a
13-megapixel camera

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.349
with optical image stabilisation. As you
know I've

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.959
rounded on camera manufacturers this
year for not putting in

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.779
the optical image stabilisation into their
camera modules Amazon Fire

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:11.230
and then selling them out to people like
Samsung, iPhone, HTC.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.439
There's either been a major supply
constrain going on

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.500
or something else but ultimately the
guys making those camera modules Amazon Fire

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.370
are simply selling, well, rubbish camera
modules to the main manufacturers.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.670
Without optical image stabilisation you
get a poorer picture

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.260
as Amazon have kind of demonstrated. Their camera is producing

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.409
much better low light pictures with less blur. The dual stereo speaker set-up as I've

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:34.219
already touched on,

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:38.060
it's pretty much the muchness as you might expect, but what's interesting is that

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.790
they've gone with their own head buds,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.390
headbud designs in the box. A tangle-free

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.650
cable. We'll have to see what the sound
quality is like but

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.969
hey, anything that helps to innovate on
the quality of the

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.870
earbuds you actually get in the box so
they might be useful rather than just Amazon Fire

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.250
being something you throw away

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.909
has to be a valuable move forward. Now Amazon has put a lot

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.730
of focus really here on how it integrates
this device

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.890
with, well,  its entire shopping experience
and I suppose

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.480
knowledge acquisition as well on
behalf of

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.590
the user. So the idea here is that you can
use the camera to scan

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.489
a massive range of products, millions of
them by the looks of it.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.640
As you scan those products they're added
into your list

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.939
and you can then browse more information
about that product or if you want to

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.549
purchase the product from Amazon, obviously. Now it works Amazon Fire

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.560
with a wide range of different product
types so

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.989
everything from, you know, household goods to books and it can even pull information Amazon Fire

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.659
directly from posters and flyers

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.159
as well. But the real standout feature

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.159
for the Amazon Fire is this depth

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.489
perception camera system they've got going on here. Now this is kind of the third way you

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.969
can do 3d effects.

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:52.469
You can do a parallax barrier onset
of glasses, you can do a parallax barrier 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.719
on an actual device like the 3DS or

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:59.549
you can use two stereo cameras with
infra-red built into them Amazon Fire

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.569
measure the distance between the person

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.620
and the actual device as they're holding it so you know how far away the phone is 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.079
effectively from the face and using
that information

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.329
you can create an extrusion effectively
backwards Amazon Fire

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.549
into the device giving you a depth plane and this effectively allows for as you're

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.800
going to see in a moment a feeling

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.170
of depth - something we've not really had
on the smartphone before Amazon Fire.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.590
We've seen these techniques done in kind of demo videos, in hack togethers but

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.000
this is the first time I think we've ever really
seen in a commercially viable product.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.670
Now Amazon are kind of taking this one step further

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.010
forward by using the various accelerometers,

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.960
gyroscopes within the device they're
also able to add in things like smart

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.320
tools Amazon Fire,

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.170
something we've seen on the Galaxy range
previously. Now this basically allows you to 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.130
tilt the device forward, back,

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.340
left or right and scroll on the screen.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.950
So for instance if you're looking at a web
page you can scroll the webpage up and down Amazon Fire.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.740
But they've extended this. They've taken
it and put it into their SDK as well

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.870
so game developers can create a new
dimension

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.750
on their games as you can see there. By
tilting the device

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.470
the game's plane changes as well. Now it's a cute little feature for sure

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.830
but it's one that's bound to cause quite
a bit disruption in the market

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.010
especially if other companies are prepared
to take this technology on

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.160
from SDK point of view and build it into their apps.  Amazon has a unique

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.350
selling point here something that no
other manufacturer

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.880
is able to do right now. Now yes we've
got duo cam on the HTC 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.020
One M8 but as I pointed out when that
launched it

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.090
wasn't actually required. You don't need a
second camera

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.180
to take the original picture. What you need to do is use software algorithms

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.020
to take a flat image and add that depth and extrusion to it

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.860
effectively. Now as you can see here, Amazon are using four cameras although  only 2 are used at any

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.630
one time Amazon Fire

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.170
depending on the orientation of the device. Now this is because, as you know, when you

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.280
you're turning your device round, 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.420
you're likely to cover at least one of the
cameras at any one time.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.510
By doing it this way they've always got
two cameras able to point at your face.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.830
They also aren't using a rolling shutter
style of system here

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.530
to take the images. Now that basically means that you're dropping like a 
digital shutter effectively

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.130
over the top

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.920
of the image each time. What they're doing is using global. Now that basically means it's just constant

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.430
taking in Amazon Fire

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.870
information. There's no kind of 30 frames
a second thing going here

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.970
where effectively you are losing some
frames every other frame

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.170
or anything like that. You're getting all
of that the information the camera's then able 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.230
to make use of it. You can see here a kind
of technical test.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.290
How this kind of works, how it tracks the camera. The Amazon Fire is certainly

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.210
looking like a top quality device packed
with amazing features.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.540
Obviously I want see Android 4.4
actually running on there rather than 4.22

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.550
so we have full access to things like
low-powered Bluetooth

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.710
for things like fitbit. At the moment the Amazon Fire

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.360
is a little bit stunted for some of the more

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.720
technical aspects of smartphone use we might want to do.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.140
But the addition of that depth
perception camera system

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.550
and the other image recognition
technology make this a really stand out

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.710
phone for this year.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.910
It's going to be very interesting to see what
the first hands-on reviews

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.210
really able to tell us about this device
but from what Amazon are offering us

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.440
there's something here I think quite a lot of
people are going to be very interested in.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.120
