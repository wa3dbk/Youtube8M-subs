Hey guys, John here with Realtruck.com.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:12.210
Today I want to show you how to install the
RBP RX3 Nerf Bars onto this 2014, Chevy Silverado.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.220
Got everything laid out here; you can see
that these come with everything you need to

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.220
get them installed.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.430
You have your bars, you have all your bolts,
all your washers, your u-nuts; also you have

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.430
your rivet nuts and the tool to install the
rivet nuts.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.840
Everything you need to get this on including
the instruction sheet and a product manual

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.440
from Rolling Big Power.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.750
Now, some of the really awesome features of
this step is it gives you a great way to get

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.540
in and out of your truck, looks awesome on
the truck; it's a very uniquely designed set

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.460
of bars and the way that these steps are designed,
they're designed to help so that you don't

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.320
slip on these bars when you're climbing in
and out of the truck.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.230
So, take a look at this and you'll see what
I'm talking about, how these actually will

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.980
grip and there you go.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.819
The next thing we want to do is get these
on the truck.

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:12.170
What we're going to do is we got our Nerf
Bar set up here so we can see where we're

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.939
going to have to attach it.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.390
So what we're going to do is we're going to
take our u-nuts and we're going to attach

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.700
those onto the body panels where we're going
to need to put these.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.810
So I'm just going to tap that up in there
and place.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.619
So that way, it's set up and ready to go when
we start to put these on and then we're going

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.469
to . . . we're going to do something a little
different here.

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.999
This is where we're going to use one of those
rivet nuts at, it's going to go right here

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:44.789
but we're going to put the rest of these u-nuts
on; there's going to be two of them, it's

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.680
going to go back here in the back.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.500
And then what we're going to do is we're going
to pull this plug out of here; I'll have to

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.490
get a popper to do that and then we're going
to put another one in here as well and that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.159
will take care of all of our catching points.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.090
Then I'll show you how to put that rivet nut
in.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.929
We got the plug out of here so now we're going
to take our u-bolt or our u-nut rather and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.209
we're going to push it in place here and there
we go.

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.590
That will give us someplace to bolt our back
one up to right here.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.900
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab
that rivet nut and I'm going to show you guys

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.900
how to install that.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.349
This is where we're going to put our rivet
nut but as you can see it doesn't quite fit

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.000
in the factory hole there.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.730
So what we're going to need to do is take
a half inch drill bit and just drill that

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.709
out so that way, our rivet nut will fit in
there.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.409
That will work; we're going to take our hammer,
we're going to tap that in there and we should

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.450
be good to good.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.980
We got our rivet nut in there, into the hole;
we have our tool that puts it in on there.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.950
So the next thing we're going to do then is
we're going to go ahead and attach that and

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.810
the way we do that is to put a wrench on that
nut and then another one on the bolt and you

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.069
have to hold the nut and crank the bolt.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.530
And essentially what we're doing is we're
actually crushing that rivet up against the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.170
backside of your rocker panel.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.209
Got it tighten down, should be good and crushed
in there.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.930
So what we're going to do is we're going to
loosen this bolt up here.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:30.030
Remove our installation tool and there you
go guys; that's what it looks like once it's

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.790
all set in place and it's basically another
spot just like on the front that we can screw

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.790
a bolt into.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.060
So there you go, that's how you do it.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.310
Get that set up there, get this bolt started
here.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.810
We'll get our bolt started up here in the
front one.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.409
As you can see, we got our bolts all started
on our brackets, so the next thing we're going

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.959
to do is we're going to go through now and
make sure that this is all lined up which

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.000
it's pretty much where we want it.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.340
So we'll start tightening everything down
and once we get these all tighten down, we'll

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.139
go over and do the one on the other side.

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:18.380
That's how simple, quick and easy it is to
install a set of RBP RX3 Nerf Bars onto your

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.330
truck and one other really cool thing about
these Nerf Bars is, these look really good

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.700
on this truck in black but they also are available
in stainless steel in case you want a more

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.190
shiny chrome look too.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.500
So that's it, the only thing left to do is
get this truck down so you guys can take a

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.170
look at what these look like on the truck.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.790
So remember; until next time, happy motoring.
