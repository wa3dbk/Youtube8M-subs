00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.931
Hello my friends today we will talk about the pitahaya

00:00:02.931 --> 00:00:04.269
What is pitahaya?

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:06.401
It is the fruit of a cactus

00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:07.608
rather, various cacti

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.600
the pitaya is known also as a dragon fruit or the dragon's heart

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.620
big strong and full of antioxidants

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:16.835
for our body

00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:17.666
There are two types of pitahaya

00:00:17.993 --> 00:00:19.993
red and yellow pitahaya

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.139
the dragon fruit actually comes from two different cactus

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:24.868
red one fro Hylocereus undatus

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:28.696
and yellow came from Selenicereus megalanthus

00:00:29.297 --> 00:00:31.297
good, but you not need to remember these outlandish names

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.540
simply red dragon fruit, and yellow pitahaya and ready

00:00:35.852 --> 00:00:37.852
red dragon fruit is so precious

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.600
a most precious colored beautiful inside

00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:43.984
look that fantastic color

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:46.616
It seems a pre-Hispanic indigenous picture

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.360
the ancient Aztecs used to rehydrate itself with the Pitahaya

00:00:51.876 --> 00:00:53.876
to withstand great heat

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.899
which at that time they were like right now

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.533
same or worse

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.860
pitaya water used for various uses

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.180
They used it as a cathartic

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.195
cathartic that's that?

00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:06.727
It means laxative

00:01:06.727 --> 00:01:08.725
laxative eh? What is that?

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.600
laxative means it is a substance that causes the intestines to move us to go to the bathroom more often

00:01:16.127 --> 00:01:18.127
ah this is very interesting!

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.180
very interesting because it can be used

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:23.405
in the treatment of obesity

00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:24.959
To lose weight

00:01:25.077 --> 00:01:27.077
It is also a heart tonic

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.000
Use very little known and very important

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.520
It is anthelmintic and antiparasitic

00:01:34.144 --> 00:01:36.144
Most people think they have to be discarded peels

00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:37.871
eat fruit

00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:43.503
and peel to throw it away

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:44.702
very bad!

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.220
It can also be used to improve heling scar

00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:49.821
simply take the peel

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:52.226
which you normally throw

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.740
but we have said here do not throw nothing, here use all

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.960
and we learn so that they can serve things

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.760
with same peel we rub the part you want to heal

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.989
It is a little painted

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.020
and so we leave it to dry

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.340
with that we will see great progress

00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:11.340
in healing (healing scar)

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.280
pitahaya is also an excelent food

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.100
very rich and exotic

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:18.657
and it is mainly produced in two parts of the world

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.679
in Vietnam and across Latin America

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:23.818
including Mexico of course

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.020
Today we will learn how to make a potion

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.260
and leverage the properties of dragon fruit peel for the rest of the year

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.380
that is, when the dragon fruit not fruit

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:36.929
We take the shell of a pitahaya

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.640
if you look it has virtually no thorns, does not mince nothing and can be taken safely with your fingers

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.980
and put in a jar

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.340
then we cover peel pitahaya full with drinking alcohol at 30%

00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:54.269
and what is drinking alcohol?

00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:58.525
you will make me crazy

00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:00.327
drinking alcohol means

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.140
any ethylalcohol that we could drink

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:12.200
bind brandy, vodka, any white liquor can be used

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.531
let the secondary metabolites are extacted

00:03:15.531 --> 00:03:17.370
from the pitahaya peel

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.820
It will become a pinky liquid medium, curious and nice color

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:33.900
and this we can use for the rest of the year as an anthelmintic, antiparasitic and also to increase the power of our heart

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.540
will lower the pressure and increase the power with which the heart pumps

00:03:40.993 --> 00:03:42.993
usually it is taken as microdosis

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.320
We put 20 drops of tincture

00:03:46.636 --> 00:03:48.636
It means alcohol we prepared

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.960
in a glass of water

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.895
and we take it twice daily

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.040
