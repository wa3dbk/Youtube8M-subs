00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:08.099
The first project that we're going to work
today, you can use anything to make it, markers,

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.170
water colors, pastels, crayons, colored pencils,
the usual things you have around the house

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.890
for kids art projects. I'm going to start
with a black marker and you can just use computer

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.300
paper and we're going to make a little drawing,
and what this is going to do is show us how

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.590
the colors are constructed and how they go
together. And, this will help kids memorize

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.520
the colors in an easy way. The first thing
that I'm going to draw, almost to the top

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.010
of the page, is I'm going to make a square
and I'm doing it in marker so you can see

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.750
it but you could do it in pencil and we're
going to make a triangle with these squares.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.780
So, I'm moving this square down here at the
bottom and I'm going to put one over here

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.310
now, what we're going to do with those is
color in our primary colors and I'm going

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.530
to use a marker to start with. If you have
the kids lay out their colors, and we just

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.750
want these primaries, these will work fine.
And, while I'm coloring this I'm going to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.710
tell you about art materials. It really is
a great idea to get a good brand because part

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.200
of thing you end up doing is struggling with
the materials when you use something that's

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.290
not as good. I'm using Crayola, they really
do know about kids art work and how much fun

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:45.340
it is to. This color chart that we're making
is to help kids realize how you mix colors

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.980
in a very concrete way. So, you can see what
I'm doing, I'm drawing an arrow to show the

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.920
colors we're going to mix together. We know
those because we just saw that with the dye.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.250
OK, if I mix the red and yellow together I'm
going to make a circle and the circle is going

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.091
to represent our secondary color and if I
make the blue and yellow go together, we know

00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:15.200
what we're going to get. Alright, so here
is our color chart, now we can fill those

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.810
in and this is a really good exercise for
kids. OK, the red and the yellow makes orange

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.280
and the reason I'm using marker is it colors
quickly and you'll find that, and it's fun

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.910
for kids to try different materials and then
you learn, do I like oil pastels, you know,

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.340
markers are always fast. Colored pencils are
always going to be slow, but some kids love

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.950
them. I happen to be a colored pencil artist
myself, and I have a lot of art work that's

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.200
hanging in art shows and libraries and things
done with colored pencil but they take a long

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.980
time to do. Alright, here's our basic color
chart that we just learned with the dye of

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.040
the colors that go together. Now in the middle
of those I'm going to put some triangles and

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.900
what that's going to do is tell me that there
are some colors in between and as we get going

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.719
with mixing color we'll find out what those
are.
