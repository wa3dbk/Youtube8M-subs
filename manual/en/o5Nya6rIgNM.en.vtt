00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.730
You've probably seen a time-lapse movie like
this before.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.519
This was created by shooting one frame every
so often and then stringing all those frames

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.140
together into a movie, which shows a tremendous
span of time.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.949
There are two ways of shooting time-lapse
on the D800.

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.879
The first is an interval timer, which simply
tells the camera to fire off every so often,

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.420
for a certain amount of time.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.750
The second mode is the Time Lapse Photography
mode, which actually spits a movie directly

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.840
out of the camera.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.989
The advantage of doing time lapse with the
interval timer is that it's actually shooting

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.570
normal still frames exactly to your specs.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.219
So you can choose to shoot in raw, which gives
you a lot of extra editing power.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.469
You've also got access to each individual
frame of the movie.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.119
When you drop those into a video editor you've
got more options for controlling time within

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.370
the movie.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.909
You might also use the interval timer simply
for times when you need to collect some data

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.020
about a scene over a certain amount of time.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.310
Maybe someone's stealing crabapples off your
tree and you want to know who, so you set

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.560
it up to take a picture every hour or something
like that and review them later.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.140
Finally, when shooting with the interval timer
you get full-pixel-count images, which gives

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.490
you a lot of additional postprocessing options
later.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.910
You could crop just a part of a scene out
of an image.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.340
You've got more resizing options.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.300
When you shoot with Time Lapse Photography,
you're going to be outputting at standard

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.830
video sizes.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.950
To configure for time-lapse, I go to my menu,
and in the Shooting menu I have an option

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.990
called Interval timer shooting, which of course
defaults to off.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.500
I'm going to come in here and take a look
at this.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.119
I've got a range of parameters that I'm going
to be scrolling through from left to right

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.640
up here, and this down here is a status display
that's going to show me how things are progressing

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.729
as I set each of these options.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.110
First, I can choose to start my time-lapse
as soon as I'm done configuring, or I can

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.360
set a time.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.950
So this is really nice if you're wanting to
do a time-lapse of sunrise.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.680
You don't actually have to get up before the
sun rises and configure your camera.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.709
You can say start this at 5 a.m.

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.610
or whatever.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.100
After I've configured this, I can hit the
left or right arrow button here to go to the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.370
next parameter, and that is the Interval:
How often do I want it to take a picture?

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.930
By default it's set for 01 second.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.230
I can configure this for hours, minutes, or
seconds, or some combination thereof.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.870
After that, the number of times, that is the
number of intervals that I want it to go through,

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.190
and the number of shots that I want it to
shoot at each interval.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.840
So to figure out the number of intervals I
would need to do some calculation on my own.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.450
If I want to cover a certain number of hours
and I'm only shooting once every five seconds,

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.140
I would need to do the math to figure out
how many specific intervals that I would need

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.340
to go at and then dial that in here.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.730
At each interval I can tell it to take a number
of shots.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.340
So say, for example, I am shooting an HDR
time-lapse and I want 3 shots taken at each

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.569
one of my intervals.

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.060
I would configure it this way.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.620
I would need to make sure that I've turned
on Auto Bracketing and configured that before

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.569
I start my time-lapse.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.540
Finally, I get to this page.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.120
I'm all set up here.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.450
It's saying that it's going to start right
away once I start it.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.920
It's got a 1-minute interval.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.950
It's going to go 111 intervals, shooting 3
shots each time, for a total of 333 shots.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.690
Finally, this is simply a clock showing my
current time.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.520
You want to be sure if you're traveling that
you've adjusted your time zone appropriately

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.069
to be sure that your clock is accurate on
your camera, especially if you're using a

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.830
timer to start the time-lapse.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.240
Since I don't have a timer set right now,
I would simply go here and hit the OK button

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.330
and it would start.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.820
There are a few things to check before you
start your time-lapse though.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.530
First of all, make sure that you are run not
in Self-Timer mode or Mirror Up mode; both

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.940
of those are going to mess up your time-lapse
as soon as it tries to trigger the Shutter

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.690
button.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.810
Because my face is not going to be behind
the Viewfinder here during the whole process,

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.070
it's going to be possible for light to get
in there and bounce around inside the camera

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.880
and that might create flare, so I'm going
to flip this closed so that closes off my

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.569
viewfinder to be certain that no light gets
in.

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:25.699
Finally, I want to be sure that I've got enough
storage, so I need to do a little bit of calculation

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.820
about whether 333 frames are going to fit
on my card.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.240
I see up here that I do have enough space
remaining.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.270
If I was shooting raw, obviously that would
go down.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.610
Since I've got two card slots, I can put in
a second card, and if I've configured for

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.910
overflow, then I will very easily have enough
space.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.180
My Release mode does impact interval timer
shooting.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.330
If I've chosen to shoot multiple frames at
each interval, if I go here to the low continuous

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.580
rate, then they're going to shoot at that
speed.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.620
If I go here to the high continuous rate,
they will shoot at my high continuous speed.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.430
If I'm on single shot, then they're going
to go at the speed that is defined in one

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.900
of my custom functions.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:19.240
If I come down here to the d category and
go to d2 CL mode shooting speed, that's my

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.850
low speed, which is currently set to 2.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.030
So if I have to find multiple frames in my
interval timer, they're going to shoot at

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.100
2 frames per second.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.330
Once I have started a time-lapse, I can go
back to the Time Lapse menu item to either

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.780
pause the time-lapse or stop it, if I need
to stop it early, or I can just turn the camera

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.780
off.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.440
Obviously, for best results you're going to
want to be locked down on a tripod.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.530
If you're going to be shooting through a length
of time that's long enough that your lighting

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.281
is going to change because the sun is coming
up or going down, or moving around, then you're

00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:51.949
going to need to give some thought to your
exposure.

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.600
Do a little research into time-lapse to learn
more about what mode you should choose and

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:08.940
what you should expect in the way of exposure
changes over time.
