00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.630
Hi.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.150
Welcome back to the Arcade Repair Tips Video
Series.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.160
We're doing a cap kit right now on this monitor
chassis and we've already found a couple of

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.160
bad caps.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.440
How did we know they were bad?

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.270
Michael: Well, we checked them with an ESR
meter from Mat Electronics.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.480
Tim: Mat Electronics, matelectronics.com.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.610
This was about $50, so it's not a real high
dollar tool.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.900
There are better ones.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.170
Michael: This one will do the job just fine.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.790
You can check it in circuit, which comes in
very handy.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.470
It's a lot faster.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.350
Like you said, we found two caps that were
bad from the heat.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.100
What they do is they dry up and they change
value and go bad.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.730
Tim: Alright, so we took the old caps.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.660
We desoldered them using some desoldering
braid and we pulled the old caps out.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.070
We tested them in circuit, then we took them
out and also tested them out of circuit.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.829
These guys are bad so we're ready to put in.

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.930
Now there are some numbers and letters and
stuff on here.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.380
What do those mean?

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.479
Michael: Well, when you're replacing a cap
the first number is usually the voltage.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.479
It could be backwards.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.159
It will have a V after the number and that's
your voltage.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.049
You always want to replace with the same voltage.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.750
You can go up in voltage but you can never
go down in voltage.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.609
The next number is going to have a uF and
that's going to be your microfarad.

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:34.890
That needs to be exactly whatever came out.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.960
You can't substitute anything for that.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.969
Tim: So what came out of here says 10 uF,
so that's 10 microfarads at 100 volts.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.039
What do you have?

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.359
Michael: I have a 10 uF at 160 volts.

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.320
Tim: They have to be 10 uF, but it's ok that
we went up in voltage.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.320
Michael: That's correct.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.490
You can always go up but never go down.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.880
Tim: Ok, so I'm looking at this and one of
the legs is longer than the other one.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.009
Why is that?

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.909
Michael: Well, there is polarity on these.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.439
There's a negative and a positive.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.650
On your board, you'll either have a plus for
positive or a lot of times I'll have a black

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.460
mark for negative.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.030
You need to make sure you have that correct.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.440
Tim: There are a couple arcade boards that
come from overseas and different places that

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.470
do not have it on there, so by all means keep
in mind which way is the negative side.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.460
You can tell the negative side on a cap because
it will have a stripe on the side.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.720
Remember which way the stripe was when you
pull it out so when you put it back in and

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.550
sometimes you can't read on the board.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.620
It's had so many repairs or it's kind of been
scraped off, so keep in mind which way it

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.620
goes.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.620
Because it matters, right?

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.620
Michael: It matters greatly.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.360
Tim: If I replaced 50 caps on a monitor chassis
and put one on backwards...

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.510
Michael: You're going to do more damage than
what you had when you started.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.510
Tim: Exactly.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.990
So take your time and make sure you know which
way is the polarity.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.600
I'm sure there's going to be more in the article
about this, so please read that part very

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.240
carefully and take your time.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.800
Don't rush.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.230
Ok, so now we're ready to put it in.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.730
Lets see, on the board here it has a plus
towards me so that is going to be the shorter

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.730
end, right?

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.730
No, the longer end.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.730
Michael: The longer end.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.080
Tim: Ok, want to make sure.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.900
Michael: The black stripe away from you.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:35.740
Tim: The black stripe is away from me so we're
just going to stick it through the holes here.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.260
Ok, now what?

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.540
Michael: When you stick it through the holes,
you'll have the leads.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.100
Just pull them up a little bit and bend them
out.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.840
That will give tension and give you time to
solder without the cap falling back off the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840
board.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.390
Tim: So even if you're by yourself, you do
this all the time without any help.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.440
You're by yourself.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.020
Just bend the legs a little so it will stay
in place, right?

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.020
Michael: Correct.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.020
Tim: Ok.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.830
Michael, you want to do the honors?

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.790
There's our solder and our soldering iron.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.350
Michael: On these older boards, because of
the heat from the board itself, the traces

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.959
get real brittle and you'll need to make sure
you don't let the heat stay on there a long

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.579
time or it will peel the thin copper trace
off the board.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:29.020
But you want to make sure you get enough heat
so you don't have a cold solder joint also.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:36.389
Just place your iron there and use your solder
and that's all there is to it.

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.240
Tim: That fast, huh?

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.080
Michael: Then you take your pair of snippy
cutters.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.130
Always make sure you cut your leads off.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.010
You don't want them touching metal or grounding
out to the rest of the board.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.620
Just snip them even with the solder connection
and you're done.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.650
Tim: So we have now replaced one cap.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.780
Your cap kit may come with 10 or 11, but you
just keep doing the same thing over and over,

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.780
right?

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.780
Michael: Correct.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.980
Like Tim said, just make sure you keep your
polarities right or that will cause you major

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.980
problems.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.710
Tim: You can ruin a whole cap job by one cap.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.000
Take your time and if you don't feel comfortable,
by all means email us or send it in to us

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
for repair.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.270
We have reasonable rates.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.990
But thank you guys for watching and stay tuned
for more videos.
