00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.480
If you′re one of those tech-heads anxiously
awaiting the release of Samsung′s new Galaxy

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.620
S-series smartphones... we have good news.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.230
The Korean tech giant unveiled its latest
in Barcelona on Sunday... ahead of the Mobile

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.610
World Congress.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.100
Shin Se-min has the story.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.000
This is Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.090
"These are the best and fastest smartphones
in the world, with capabilities nobody else

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.480
can match.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.880
But that is not all.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.020
To use a technical and engineering tone: It
is cool."

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.610
Could this be a game changer for Samsung Electronics?

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.160
The specifications certainly do seem to make
a strong case for that.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.920
Introduced Sunday at the Samsung Unpacked
event ahead of the Mobile World Congress in

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.160
Barcelona,... the brand new Samsung Galaxy
handsets have a better grip on both design

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.910
and composition.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.219
The Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, which comes with
a curved display,... sport a dazzling glass

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:08.060
and lightweight metal architecture.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.390
Both have a faster processor, a better camera
and, most importantly,... a fast-charging

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.520
battery.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.380
Samsung ditched the replaceable battery from
the S5,... and added a wireless feature.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.990
"We′re the first brand ever to introduce
wireless charging that is built in."

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.499
It′s also much faster.

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:34.840
The new Galaxy phones only need a 10-minute
charge... to offer four hours of battery life.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.639
Totaling it up,... Samsung says it′ll take
the S6 roughly HALF the time to charge as

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:41.490
the iPhone 6.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.680
The phones are also loaded with a mobile payments
system called Samsung Pay.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.560
Like its Apple counterpart, Samsung Pay uses
NFC technology.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.079
But unlike Apple it also has magnetic secure
transmission technology developed by LoopPay,

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.340
which allows users to make mobile payments
at most places where plastic cards are already

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.340
accepted.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.450
With the flashy new handset duo, the company
is hoping to lift its flagging sales and climb

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.969
back to the top of the global smartphone market,...
after having lost out to Apple last year.

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.040
