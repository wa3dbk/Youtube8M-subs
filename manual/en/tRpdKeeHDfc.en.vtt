00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.770
TRISH SUHR: Hi, I'm
Trish Suhr.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.230
And one thing I love more than
helping people transform their

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.400
homes and lives is making
them laugh.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.200
So today we've rigged this house
with hidden cameras on

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.930
the inside, but an open
house sign out front.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.210
In this next prank, our real
estate agent really takes

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.210
getting it sold to a
whole new level.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.790
JANETTE: I'm sorry.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.770
MALE SPEAKER: It's not even
yours, and you're just getting

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.428
a hold of it.

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:21.678
Right.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.950
MALE SPEAKER: And, 3, 2.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.800
TRISH SUHR: Hi, everybody.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.430
I'm Trish Suhr, and today we're
in Manhattan Beach,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.000
California at this gorgeous
4,000 square foot, five

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.730
bedroom, six bath Mediterranean
style home to

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.620
answer the question, would
you buy this house?

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.920
Hi guys, come on in.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.010
LYNDSAY: Hi, Nice to meet you.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.230
TRISH SUHR: How are you?

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.470
What's your name?

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.850
LYNDSAY: Lyndsay.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.530
TRISH SUHR: Lyndsay hi.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.780
DAVID: Hey, David.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.140
TRISH SUHR: David and Lyndsay,
nice to meet you guys.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.560
DAVID: Nice to meet you.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.800
LYNDSAY: Nice to meet you.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.020
TRISH SUHR: Well, I'd like
to ask you guys, on first

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.260
appearances, would you
buy this house?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.450
DAVID: Yes.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.074
LYNDSAY: Based on first
appearances, yes.

00:01:03.074 --> 00:01:04.390
DAVID: It's a great
looking home.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.160
TRISH SUHR: OK, will then let's
get inside to show you

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.990
the rest of it, shall we?

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.540
LYNDSAY: Sounds good.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.000
DAVID: Great, thank you.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.380
LYNDSAY: Thanks.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.075
MALE SPEAKER: I already
mentioned about the--

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:12.190
TRISH SUHR: About Janette?

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.950
Yeah, I let them know.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.480
MALE SPEAKER: So
do you wanna--

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.750
TRISH SUHR: Yeah.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.480
MALE SPEAKER: I'll just
introduce them.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.370
TRISH SUHR: Yeah, to Janette.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.490
I want to introduce you to
Jannete, the realtor inside.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.930
Come on in.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.600
Right in here.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.960
JANETTE: Hi guys.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.210
If you could just make sure
your shoes are clean.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.405
I'm sorry, we already had a
spill on there earlier.

00:01:27.405 --> 00:01:28.340
TRISH SUHR: Sorry, Janette.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.930
I apologize.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:29.800
LYNDSAY: That's nice.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.250
You could open it up and really
kind of, it gives it a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.960
little more space feeling.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.685
It's very serene.

00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:35.300
I like it.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.965
DAVID: Yeah.

00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:36.710
LYNDSAY: It's peaceful.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.340
DAVID: Well I definitely--

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.040
LYNDSAY: We would have the
doors open all the time.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.580
TRISH SUHR: Why don't
you guys sit down

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.130
and try out the furniture?

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.700
Because all the furniture, by
the way, comes with the home.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.560
JANETTE: The furniture doesn't
come with the home, I'm sorry.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.650
TRISH SUHR: I thought
the patio furniture

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.965
came with the home.

00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:45.280
JANETTE: No.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.790
TRISH SUHR: OK, I'm so sorry.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.610
So this, I hope, will help
you buy this house.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.940
This is the open plan concept
of the kitchen

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.080
and the family room.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.360
We'll go right into
the kitchen.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.070
So this was actually
redone, the kitchen

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.620
was redone in 2008.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.140
JANETTE: It was actually 2005.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.660
TRISH SUHR: Sorry.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.120
The kitchen.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.190
JANETTE: I just don't
want to, you know--

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.322
TRISH SUHR: Sure.

00:02:06.322 --> 00:02:06.455
No, no, no.

00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:08.230
JANETTE: Get in trouble for
false advertising, so.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.389
MALE SPEAKER: No problem,
no problem.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.310
TRISH SUHR: Pick that up?

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.300
Before you say something out
loud because we're recording,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.680
just wave to me and let me
know, and I'll stop it.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.320
JANETTE: As long as she's
accurate, we'll be fine.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.855
MALE SPEAKER: No, it's fine.

00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:19.740
TRISH SUHR: Can we-- is it,
OK, Janette, if we--

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.920
JANETTE: If you?

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.760
I'm sorry, if you what?

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.530
TRISH SUHR: Turn on the stove?

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.740
JANETTE: Yeah, you could
turn on the stove.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.390
That's fine.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.640
DAVID: You get to show this?

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.770
This looks pretty high speed.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.525
TRISH SUHR: You smell gas?

00:02:26.525 --> 00:02:27.530
DAVID: Nope, we're good.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.870
TRISH SUHR: Uh-oh.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.690
Oh, lord.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.260
OK.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.500
JANETTE: Hold on,
I'll take it.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.180
Hold on, I'll fix it up.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.530
TRISH SUHR: OK.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.150
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.180
I'm so sorry.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.350
Sorry, Ed.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.600
I'm sorry.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.570
JANETTE: They touched the
stove, right, Trish?

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.890
And then--

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.205
TRISH SUHR: Yep.

00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:41.520
They touched the stove.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.020
They did.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.560
JANETTE: And then--

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.000
what else was it?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.240
TRISH SUHR: We pretty much
touched everything.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.090
And what I love about this is
right when you get to the top

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.760
of the stairs, right away, four
bedrooms, four en suite

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.900
bathrooms upstairs.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.740
LYNDSAY: Exactly.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.695
JANETTE: I'm just gonna come
through here and make sure

00:02:56.695 --> 00:02:57.340
it's clean.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.040
Sorry.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.780
TRISH SUHR: Go again?

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.380
Because that was--

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.950
MALE SPEAKER: That's, yeah.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.910
Let's just pick it up
with the laundry.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.640
I can cover it with B roll.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.890
TRISH SUHR: Master bedroom, Miss
Lyndsay, you want, master

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.630
bedroom you get.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.240
LYNDSAY: Let's see it.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.790
Oh.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.676
TRISH SUHR: Here we are.

00:03:11.676 --> 00:03:12.550
DAVID: Wow.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.925
LYNDSAY: All right.

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:13.540
DAVID: This is--

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.320
LYNDSAY: I could do with this.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.205
TRISH SUHR: You've got
the balcony off--

00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:15.885
DAVID: What the view
out there?

00:03:15.885 --> 00:03:16.330
TRISH SUHR: Yeah, you
can go check it out.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.690
Absolutely.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.510
And it's nice for you--

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.200
JANETTE: Trish, if you could
just, could I just speak to

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.880
you for a second?

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.330
I'm sorry, it's just the time.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.830
The time is going so quickly.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.735
I don't know if they want to try
the bed out or something.

00:03:26.735 --> 00:03:28.405
MALE SPEAKER: Every time you
interrupt us, it takes us

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:29.006
longer to reshoot.

00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:30.880
JANETTE: Well I'm just, you
know, I'm on a time crunch.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.220
TRISH SUHR: Thank goodness.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.060
MALE SPEAKER: We'll be done
in less than 5 minutes.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.760
JANETTE: OK.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.720
I'm sorry, go ahead.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.670
Do your thing.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.240
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.650
I'm sorry, let's just take
that over again.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.120
TRISH SUHR: The bed--

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.550
DAVID: Does the bed
come with this?

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.710
TRISH SUHR: The bed
does come with it.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.850
I know I'm right about that.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.740
JANETTE: The bed does
come with it.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.200
TRISH SUHR: Thank you.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.580
Yes, let me say that again.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.042
Yes, the bed does
come with it.

00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:49.860
DAVID: Nothing.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.820
TRISH SUHR: You cleaned
the whole house, and

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.950
you didn't see that?

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:52.885
JANETTE: What is it?

00:03:52.885 --> 00:03:54.050
TRISH SUHR: You cleaned the--

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.190
I'm sorry.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.020
Ed, I'm sorry.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.270
JANETTE: Oh my god.

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:00.340
TRISH SUHR: I just,
I think it's--

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.330
You're honest.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.430
I'm sorry, hand sanitizer?

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.810
Are we gonna stand
down for this?

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.280
JANETTE: I just really don't
think that this--

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.230
TRISH SUHR: Is there any-- do
you want to look at the

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.460
bathroom before we do in?

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.160
DAVID: What the heck?

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.675
JANETTE: I'm sorry.

00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:09.406
DAVID: It's not even yours,
and you're just

00:04:09.406 --> 00:04:09.875
getting a hold of it.

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:10.350
Right.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.420
TRISH SUHR: I know, she
just touched it.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.650
I guess it's very
sanitary people.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.700
JANETTE: Do you guys have that
hand sanitizer still?

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.190
MALE SPEAKER: OK, you ready?

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.430
TRISH SUHR: Yep.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.640
MALE SPEAKER: OK, clear
your thoughts.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.829
And, action.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.813
TRISH SUHR: OK, so after seeing
the master bedroom, I'm

00:04:22.813 --> 00:04:27.100
going to ask you guys, would
you buy this house?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.210
LYNDSAY: I think with the
proximity to the beach, the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.540
condition of the house, to
beauty of the house, I think

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.590
it's worth the $2 million.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.466
TRISH SUHR: Really?

00:04:33.466 --> 00:04:33.904
LYNDSAY: Mm-hm.

00:04:33.904 --> 00:04:34.342
TRISH SUHR: Oh!

00:04:34.342 --> 00:04:35.400
JANETTE: So that's an offer?

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.650
That's an offer?

00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:39.770
TRISH SUHR: No, it's the show.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.830
It's the tagline of the show.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.690
DAVID: I'll be the one
making the final--

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.320
JANETTE: We're in escrow,
actually, because you guys--

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.340
TRISH SUHR: With
somebody else?

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.170
JANETTE: No, with you guys,
because you signed the

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.020
documents that said if you
said it out loud--

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.950
TRISH SUHR: No, that's
a release.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.790
JANETTE: No, it said,
did you read?

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.050
TRISH SUHR: Oh my gosh.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.870
JANETTE: Did you read it?

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.330
It's a verbal agreement anyway,
but it was, if you

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.170
said it out loud.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.480
LYNDSAY: I said it was
worth $2 million.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.930
I didn't say I would buy it.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.580
JANETTE: No, and we
have the picture.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.290
It's right here.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.390
MALE SPEAKER: What picture?

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.240
JANETTE: I mean I can get it
down to $1.8 million, but

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.980
because you have verbally
said that you'd buy it.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:05.940
TRISH SUHR: No, that's the
title of the show.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.120
Would You Buy This House?

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.760
JANETTE: Did you read it?

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.170
We altered it.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.670
TRISH SUHR: It's a show title.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.670
JANETTE: You guys,
I handed you the

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.550
new one that we altered.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.100
MALE SPEAKER: You can't
alter this.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.090
JANETTE: And it said right
there, it's a verbal agreement

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.750
if you say out loud.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.170
TRISH SUHR: Ed.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.600
MALE SPEAKER: Out loud?

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.960
JANETTE: You guys just let
people sign things without

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.580
telling them?

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.030
TRISH SUHR: But it's a--

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.480
DAVID: We didn't say--

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.740
MALE SPEAKER: Listen.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.930
Listen.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.880
DAVID: We didn't--

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.680
First of all, all she--

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.450
MALE SPEAKER: Let's finish.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.200
Let's finish.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.775
Let's finish.

00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:29.800
JANETTE: It doesn't matter.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.930
It's still a verbal contract.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.750
DAVID: I said it's worth it.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.030
LYNDSAY: I think it's worth
the $2 million.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.990
JANETTE: No, it's done.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.750
TRISH SUHR: No, I can't--

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.930
MALE SPEAKER: We know
what they said.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:36.390
Don't worry.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.810
TRISH SUHR: I know, but can you
get her to calm down so we

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.790
can finish?

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.310
JANETTE: Can I--

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.220
You can't lock me out.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.480
DAVID: I've gotta get
in touch, you know.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.978
JANETTE: I mean, I don't wanna
push the door down, because

00:05:42.978 --> 00:05:45.770
you guys are gonna have
to pay for that, too.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.500
It doesn't matter.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.890
I have it on camera,
so it's valid.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.520
Open the goddamn door, please.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.570
DAVID: Wow, you know what?

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.320
We'll just--

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.730
TRISH SUHR: Yeah.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.980
DAVID: We should
probably just--

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.425
JANETTE: Are you-- are
you seriously locking

00:05:56.425 --> 00:05:57.130
me out right now?

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.060
TRISH SUHR: OK, so that's
all I have to do.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.020
We're going to say, and tell
me when you're set.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.790
So we'll just say that would
you buy this house?

So would you buy this house
after all that you've seen?

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.720
LYNDSAY: I think with the
proximity to the beach, and

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.890
the house is beautiful, it's
something I would consider.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.600
JANETTE: Just one more thing.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.140
I wanted to let you know that
we have the iPhone picture

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.530
that they took.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.920
TRISH SUHR: Why are you
back in the room?

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.100
TRISH SUHR: It doesn't matter.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.820
JANETTE: It does.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.800
It does matter.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.920

finish what we're doing.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.690
JANETTE: Look, it's
the pictures.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:20.770
You guys, can you see this?

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.210
It's the pictures
that they took.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.650
DAVID: Yeah.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.650
JANETTE: You guys see that?

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.620
So just to confirm, this
is you, right?

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.800
Holding this?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.720
DAVID: Absolutely.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.350
That doesn't matter, we
didn't say anything.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.390
She didn't say anything
about that.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.970
LYNDSAY: I never said I
would buy the house.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.770
JANETTE: You guys signed
the documents, and

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:33.770
you said it out loud.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.840

contact with you guys, thank

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.030
you for your business.

a Realtor, I'll

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.570
get yours sold, too.

right on that.

LYNDSAY: Thank you.

00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:42.600
DAVID: Are you fucking
kidding me?

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.420
MALE SPEAKER: We got it covered
for legal purposes,

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.475
it's not a problem.

00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:46.710
But let's just finish the show.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.960
In 3, 2.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.950
TRISH SUHR: So after the master
bedroom and seeing your

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.170
amazing closet, Lyndsay, I'm
going to ask you, would you

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.930
buy this house?

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.850
LYNDSAY: I think with the
proximity to the beach in the

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.130
condition of the house, it's
something to consider.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.740
JANETTE: You can't change
what you already said!

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.606
It was already a valid contract
10 minutes ago when

00:07:04.606 --> 00:07:06.880
you said it.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.030
TRISH SUHR: I like it.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.390
Well, if you'd buy that,.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.340
Then you'll buy the fact that
this was all on a hidden

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.485
camera show.

00:07:12.485 --> 00:07:13.330
LYNDSAY: I was gonna say!

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.820
TRISH SUHR: This is
for SpacesTV.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.290
This is all a big one, David.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.370
We got you like nobody's
business.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.070
DAVID: So.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.983
TRISH SUHR: All of it.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:22.730
DAVID: Are you fucking
kidding me?

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:23.005
JANETTE: Hi.

00:07:23.005 --> 00:07:24.681

I want you to be--

00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:27.033

you batshit crazy.

JANETTE: It's a great picture
of you, by the way.
