00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:04.910
You're really going to need to warm up.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.401
Wow.

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:05.901
Wow.

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:06.874
Wow.

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:07.856
Am I doing it right?

00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:10.449
You can't do it wrong.

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:11.240
What's up, Mudders?

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.520
Coach here.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.650
A big part in training
for the Tough Mudder

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.040
is teamwork and trusting that team.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.880
It also has a lot to do with trusting
the other individuals out on course.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.240
Now, I'm going to put my trust
into some complete strangers.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.905
I'm stepping outside the comfort
zone a little bit, facing some fears.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:30.880
So let's see what happens.

Hi, ho, whatever, Tough Mudders.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.820
Just step outside of your comfort zone.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.390
We're just going to go
to the trapeze school.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.270
Let's go to the trapeze school.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.210
It'll be fine.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.000
Come on, coach.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.800
Just go to the trapeze school.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.470
You'll be fine.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.303
You won't be scared.

00:01:02.303 --> 00:01:03.813
I won't be scared.

We're going to be
learning a new trick now.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.230
And this one is going to require
you to trust us even more.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.530

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.180

complete strangers,

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.110
and now we're leaving teammates.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.690
What a fantastic place,
Trapeze School New York.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.150

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.300
Thank you so much.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.980
But this is the real trapeze handshake.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.550
Oh.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.410
