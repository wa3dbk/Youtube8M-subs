00:00:00.564 --> 00:00:02.004
- Hi, it's Parris from Epic Review Guys

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:03.536
and for the past year, we've been using

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:04.883
the Squirrel Buster Mini.

00:00:04.883 --> 00:00:06.323
This has been a great bird feeder

00:00:06.323 --> 00:00:07.780
that keeps the squirrels out

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.388
but it's become so popular with the birds,

00:00:09.388 --> 00:00:11.361
they empty it now in about four hours

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:14.635
so we're moving up to the
Squirrel Buster Classic.

00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:19.511
♫ Epic Review Guys ♫

00:00:19.511 --> 00:00:20.997
Let me show you here a little bit of video

00:00:20.997 --> 00:00:23.528
of squirrels trying to get
to the Squirrel Buster Mini.

00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:25.618
They were never able to get
in and get the food here

00:00:25.618 --> 00:00:27.862
but they did find,
depending where we put it,

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:29.379
that they would shake it real good,

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:30.563
they could get the seed to fall out

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.069
and get it down below.

00:01:01.468 --> 00:01:03.209
The Squirrel Buster
Classic has about twice

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:05.949
the seed capacity of the
Squirrel Buster Mini.

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:07.667
We had thought of just
getting another Mini

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.989
and hanging it out in a different place

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:11.754
but they've discontinued those.

00:01:11.754 --> 00:01:13.263
Now, this is also more expensive.

00:01:13.263 --> 00:01:15.825
This was around 25-30
dollars when we got it.

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.936
Squirrel Buster Classic
is almost 50 dollars.

00:01:18.936 --> 00:01:20.135
I'll put a link down below this video

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:21.436
if you'd like to check it out.

00:01:21.436 --> 00:01:23.921
Little on the pricey
side but if you're into

00:01:23.921 --> 00:01:25.383
having birds in your backyard

00:01:25.383 --> 00:01:26.591
and being able to watch them

00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:28.332
that's the price of admission.

00:01:28.332 --> 00:01:30.492
In the box, you also get
the instruction cards,

00:01:30.492 --> 00:01:32.883
some other information,
other bird related things

00:01:32.883 --> 00:01:34.346
you can sign up for.

00:01:34.346 --> 00:01:36.296
This does come all the way apart

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.464
if you need to disassemble it to wash it

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:40.220
or something gets jammed up in there.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.799
But, on a day to day basis,

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.493
it's very easy, just like
this one, that's what we like.

00:01:44.493 --> 00:01:46.141
You could just fill it up
and have it back out there

00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:47.256
in almost no time.

00:01:47.256 --> 00:01:50.274
With this, let me show you first

00:01:50.274 --> 00:01:51.758
about the squirrel busting feature.

00:01:51.758 --> 00:01:54.105
Right now, if you can see the birds

00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:55.777
or whatever animal can get in there

00:01:55.777 --> 00:01:58.912
to get to the seed but
once the weight on this,

00:01:58.912 --> 00:02:01.210
whether the weight is
here or here or here,

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.382
once it exceeds about
the weight of a squirrel,

00:02:04.382 --> 00:02:08.617
pulls it down, the feed ports
are now behind the grill,

00:02:08.617 --> 00:02:10.010
and they can't get to it.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.311
Okay, now about filling it up.

00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:12.131
I'll show you that.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:13.911
The way you take it off is real easy.

00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:18.183
You twist the top, push
it down, twist the top.

00:02:18.183 --> 00:02:19.507
You're ready to fill it up.

00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:20.737
In anticipation of having this

00:02:20.737 --> 00:02:22.502
and because I'm tired
of always running out

00:02:22.502 --> 00:02:24.336
and having to run over the supermarket,

00:02:24.336 --> 00:02:27.541
the last time we were in Home Depot,

00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:30.397
I said let's just buy it by the ton,

00:02:30.397 --> 00:02:32.370
40 pound bag of seeds.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.601
Actually the biggest one that they had

00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:36.480
but it's much cheaper per
pounds to buy it this way.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.711
The Squirrel Buster Mini would take about

00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:39.684
one and a half glasses of feed.

00:02:39.684 --> 00:02:41.353
Let's see how much fits in here.

00:02:44.212 --> 00:02:46.507
Oh yeah, some always
does bounce out at first.

00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:53.426
Looks like we're gonna get
about three glasses in there.

00:02:58.863 --> 00:03:01.370
Actually a little bit more.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.946
I'll clean this up later.

00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:11.053
Let's go see what kind
of birds come to visit.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.001
There are a pair of
finches eating right across

00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:18.467
from one another.

00:04:02.824 --> 00:04:04.785
With the weight of the pigeon on it,

00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:08.629
the grill has come down in
front of all the feeding ports.

00:04:23.872 --> 00:04:25.521
And there, as soon as he flies off,

00:04:25.521 --> 00:04:28.052
the weight released,
the ports open back up.

00:04:28.052 --> 00:04:30.931
