00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.480
SEGA

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.260
Well Well, It seems I have an infestation of pests

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.680
You are about to have bigger problems than that! Uh!

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.840
He's got an invisible forcefield trapping us in!

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.300
Never trust a man with a big mustache!

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.320
Or a woman with a big mustache!

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.060
What do you want with us egg-head?

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.980
What do I want!? Funny, weren't you the ones that came looking for me!?

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.760
We know you're helping Lryc

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.420
Just tell us where to find him and we'll be out of your hair

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.940
Or lack there off (burn)

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.000
You want to know about Lyric. Well, I know a lyric or two! *snaps fingers*

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.940
*hiss*

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.820
Never trust a dancing man with a moustache!

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.820
I don't follow

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.920
Shouldn't it be, harder to get to?

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.540
But then I cant reach it!

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.480
Look, your all missing the point!

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.340
Wich is?

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.300
Seriously?

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.400
No. That plate requires a HEX wrench to take off!

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.940
Or a fist

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.640
But toxic bombs are nothing compared to my TRUE master plan!

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.900
Do tell. *Sticks growls*

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.400
This things a peice of junk

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.100
Hey!

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.640
*Sniffing* And it also smells like an evil armpit...

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.120
See! The jungle badger finds it intimidating!

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.700
Oh, I forgot to mention, I deactivated your weapons systems earlier.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.440
Huh!

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.280
I also found a copy of you death egg schematics and uploaded them to Spintrest

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.280
You what!

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.220
Yeah, your wifi is completely unprotected. *ding* Oh hey, three re-spins!

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.880
No way, I cant believe this!

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.840
Yeah, also this thing is about twenty-thousand miles overdue for an oil change

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.520
Never trust auto mechanics!

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.620
What did you do with my robot?

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.080
I don't know, what does he look like?

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.800
Blue, Metal, YOUR height?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.340
OH! And dashingly attractive, yeah I bumped into him!

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.140
And where is he now?

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.340
Well, part of him went out the window. And the other part got caught in a trash compactor

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.480
*blaring alarm sirens*

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.460
Gah! What now!

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.140
Foghorns!

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.860
Huh, sounds like you got an engine problem

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.760
Oil changes man!

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.920
NO NO NO NO

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.240
*whispering* He's braking it apart

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.880
Tough luck Egg-noodle

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.520
Maybe if you let us out, Tails can fix your engine

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.600
I can do that from in here actually!

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.500
Shhhh!

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.400
I suppose I have no choice but to set you free

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.700
Then again...

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.300
Please, do NOT punch me in the face

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.460
Eh, I'll shake on that

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.320
*punch* Uh!

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.520
Mustache's don't count a faces right?

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.140
Never trust an Echidna with beefy mucles

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.260
