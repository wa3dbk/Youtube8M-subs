00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:08.010
Let's learn about Calcitonin and Parathyroid
hormone.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.759
Calcitonin is secreted by the thyroid gland.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.030
Parathyroid hormone is secreted by small masses
of tissue located on the posterior side of

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.410
the thyroid gland called the parathyroids.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.519
Both hormones work to control blood calcium
levels.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.500
Parathyroid hormone increases blood calcium
levels

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:48.630
While calcitonin decreases blood calcium.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:55.790
Parathyroid works by stimulating bone cells
called osteoclasts.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.120
These cells move calcium from the bones to
the blood.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.950
Parathyroid hormone also increases calcium
reabsorption in the kidney tubules.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.399
And..it increases calcium absorption in the
intestine by facilitating VIT D production

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:20.270
vit D is need for calcium absorption.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.530
Calcitonin stimulates bone cells called osteoblasts.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:35.880
These cells move calcium from blood to bones.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.869
Calcitonin also inhibits calcium reabsorption
in the kidneys.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.020
And it inhibits calcium absorption by the
intestine.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:56.909
Both parathyroid hormone and calcitonin work
to regulate blood calcium levels.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.479
WE hope you have learned something about calcitonin
and PTH and See you next time.
