00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.000
And most importantly, you need to learn some good manners

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.800
And without good manners , such as I am now

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.000
you don't need me, don't you?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Nobody needs you such as you are now.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.600
Stop the car!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.900
(the car door is slamming loudly ,
the sound of high heels walking on the pavement)

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.600
Sofia ! Where are you going ?

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.600
Come here ! Come here !
(shouting over: - You make me sick!)

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.600
Let's go!
(shouting over: - I hate you!)

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
All those four years have passed by

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
All those four years were about nothing

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Lazy talking, idle silence

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.800
And again on the left side

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.000
I will read your lips and will find out the truth

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
In the phone

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I will seal and post it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Following you

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Stop any smoking
Stop any shooting

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Stop any tantrum 
and spying on me

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Stop your recording!
No more yelling

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
No more righteous words behind my back

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Stop any persuading
Stop any heated debate

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Sun never will be warmer in the winter

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Stop it!
Pack all your bags and have a go!

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.000
All four years - next

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.000
All four years - by heart

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.000
No calls, no tears, I don't need this all

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.000
Say "Bye-Bye" and have a go

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.000
I will not forgive you any more

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.000
Do not look for me , do not think about me

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.000
Shut up the door tightly

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.000
While you go away

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.600
Stop any smoking
Stop any shooting

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.400
Stop any tantrum 
and spying on me

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.400
Stop your recording!
No more yelling

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.000
No more righteous words behind my back

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Stop any persuading
Stop any heated debate

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.800
Sun never will be warmer in the winter

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.200
Say "Bye-Bye" and have a go

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.600
 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.600
 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.000
 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.200
 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.000
 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.600
 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.400
 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.200
 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.000
 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.600
 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.600
