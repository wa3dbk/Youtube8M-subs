00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.490
Kimi Räikkönen is having fun quite often
but the Finn has every reason to, he is second in the world championship,

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.490
10 points behind Vettel. Kimi was on a visit in Zillertal at Heinz Kinigadner's Fullgas Day. Did he thaw there in Tyrol?

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.310
Yes, we had a lot of fun because Kimi for
me is atm the only blur of colour in F1 and

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.310
the way he enjoys and completes everything
is like F1 from earlier days which I know

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.330
from Gerhard Berger and so. Really cool.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.620
Fullgas Day is a motor sport event for charity wings for life.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.660
What Kimi did there exactly you don't want to tell us today?

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.660
No, he was my guest, it's better when I don't
tell everything but it was very funny and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.210
he is simply a really great guy.
And you also work together more or less on

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.210
business matters. What maybe not all know,
Kimi Räikkönen runs a motocross team in

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.940
MX1 championship, Ice One Racing it's named
and he is extremely ambitious.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.810
Absolutely, he has based the team at the best
place for motocross in Lommel, Belgium, he

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.810
has build a hall there and does this all very
professional. At the moment he pays it almost

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.680
all by himself so he has a lot of fun and
he also drives motocross every week. So he

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.280
is really a daredevil but he says that if
he drives mountain bike or motocross, you

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.740
can hurt yourself always therefore motocross
is his passion and we hopefully will keep

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.090
on having him with us.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.830
And he drives quite well on the bike. Alex, Kimi Räikkönen on a motocross bike,

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.119
that would be unthinkable during McLaren times,at least officially.

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:59.119
You just said official, unofficial we still always drove.. I could tell you many stories.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.110
But with Kimi there is not only a fullgas day but also fullgas at night, no?
Absolutely yes.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.810
And you?
Me? No not anymore but still like to be here

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.030
and watch the guys putting the foot down.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.819
At least now also in Zillertal they know that Kimi Räikkönen is a cool guy

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:19.300
but also one you can observe exactly when something leaves him cold.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.140
but also one you can observe exactly when something leaves him cold.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.140
Kimi Räikkönen fits in F1 like a square
peg in a round hole that is to say actually not at all. The Iceman is only a Niceman

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.209
when he can disappear from the paddock, talking with journalists is at best an annoying obligation.
Team briefings, sponsor events and PR he finds

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.900
deeply unpleasant but exactly that unadapted
attitude in fun ridded F1 is what makes the Finn so likeable.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.900
He has fun at some rather different events, for example when Heinz Kinigadner invites to Tyrol each year.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.080
I know him for quite some time and I have
good contacts to KTM, I love motocross and

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.500
here I can expand contacts for my team that's
all why I'm here.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.120
And then there are the hated sponsor events.
Here at Barcelona were they cart him to the harbour on Thursday just that he presses two times on a spray can.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.980
After two minutes it's all done and Kimi disappears
quicker than he came. What he really thought

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.720
it's not possible to express as it would go
below public law minimum level.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.820
Kimi is hardly compatible, he enjoys however
or maybe because of it, a high reputation

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:50.240
in the paddock. That he could be the team
mate of Sebastian Vettel next year doesn't

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.030
bother the 3 times world champion. On the
contrary.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.120
I think we get along well. Of course we would
like to meet more often, but our schedules

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.120
do not allow more. But when we meet and do
something together we have quite a good time

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.710
and it's always very uncomplicated. And I
think we both appreciate that.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.710
Even if for us journalist the dealing with
Kimi is not always easy, F1 is living from

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.750
such types. That's good like that and actually
we would wish there are many more Kimis in

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.460
the paddock.
