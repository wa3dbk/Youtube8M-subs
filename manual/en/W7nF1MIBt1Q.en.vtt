00:00:10.607 --> 00:00:11.882
Any luck, sir?

00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:16.884
I don’t know about luck – but
I’m about to try my hand at poker.

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:20.615
Please hail the Solonai.

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:23.138
Careful, RT. You’re a terrible bluffer.

00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:25.889
On speakers, sir.

00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:28.652
Are you making progress, Commander?

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:31.559
We are. But we have another problem.

00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:34.017
I don’t understand.

00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:36.707
Batarus disappeared during transport.

00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:39.795
Why didn’t you contact us immediately?

00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:43.793
No. It is not your fault.

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:47.248
I should have known he would
try something like this.

00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:49.458
Then this was not intentional?

00:00:49.776 --> 00:00:50.875
Not on my part.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.027
Batarus?

00:00:52.257 --> 00:00:54.824
He is the chief architect
of the Protellus Device

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:56.864
and one of our greatest scientists.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.969
Apparently, he has
overstepped his authority.

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:02.907
What exactly is going on, sir?

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.083
The Protellus Device is capable
of more than images and sounds.

00:01:07.294 --> 00:01:08.973
A doorway is opened.

00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:12.661
Batarus theorized that one
could step through that doorway.

00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:16.163
We lacked the materials
to make this possible.

00:01:16.913 --> 00:01:18.289
So he needed us.

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:22.794
Commander, I am most sincerely sorry
that we have created this situation.

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:25.292
We will need to investigate this,

00:01:25.334 --> 00:01:28.758
and see if he left behind
any indication of his plan.

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:30.795
May I?

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.860
How did he know about our transporter?

00:01:35.612 --> 00:01:38.800
The Protellus Device allows us
to observe any time and place.

00:01:39.927 --> 00:01:43.617
We have studied many civilizations,
including those of Earth.

00:01:44.428 --> 00:01:46.187
In preparation for your arrival,

00:01:46.228 --> 00:01:49.554
we have researched each of
you and your recent activities.

00:01:50.304 --> 00:01:54.714
I assume that Batarus found out where
and when your transporter was invented

00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:58.037
and simply watched it from
inception to construction.

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:59.225
But he couldn’t build one.

00:01:59.507 --> 00:02:02.458
No. He is more than
capable of designing one,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.740
but Solon Prime does not have the raw
materials needed to make the components.

00:02:07.353 --> 00:02:09.911
Because we do not interact
with other space-faring races,

00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:11.999
he would have no way of obtaining them.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.525
We also lack a compatible power source.

00:02:14.877 --> 00:02:16.661
How is your Device powered?

00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:18.477
From Solon itself.

00:02:18.526 --> 00:02:20.295
We have used it’s gravity to induce

00:02:20.337 --> 00:02:22.680
nuclear fusion with
the element Solonite.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.103
That explains the radiation.

00:02:25.313 --> 00:02:27.597
Can you give us more information
on this fusion process?

00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:28.588
Of course.

00:02:28.628 --> 00:02:31.007
I will set up an access
portal to our data banks

00:02:31.048 --> 00:02:32.953
and let you know when it is ready.

00:02:33.092 --> 00:02:36.373
We must hurry. The doorway
I spoke of is not stable.

00:02:36.935 --> 00:02:38.805
I will contact you shortly.

00:02:46.663 --> 00:02:47.663
How is he, Doc?

00:02:48.044 --> 00:02:52.126
Well he’ll have to avoid spicy food
for a few weeks, but he’ll live.

00:02:52.877 --> 00:02:55.314
That is, if we can get him back
to the ship before too long.

00:02:56.002 --> 00:02:59.691
This isn’t a very sanitary environment,
and he’s still in danger of infection.

00:03:00.443 --> 00:03:01.695
I’ll see what I can do.

00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:09.649
Oh my God.

00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:22.534
What are they doing here?

00:03:22.948 --> 00:03:27.033
My apologies, Excellency. Colonel Glover
did not know where else to put them.

00:03:27.448 --> 00:03:29.672
He thought it wiser to
keep them separate from -

00:03:29.714 --> 00:03:31.212
Fine. Fine.

00:03:31.548 --> 00:03:34.468
I suppose it was too much
to ask for a moment’s peace.

00:03:35.553 --> 00:03:36.725
You speak English?

00:03:36.932 --> 00:03:38.102
I do, sir.

00:03:38.682 --> 00:03:40.400
But not the King’s English.

00:03:42.528 --> 00:03:44.104
I can’t say I like your tailor.

00:03:46.832 --> 00:03:47.790
He’s alive?

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.225
For the time being.

00:03:50.165 --> 00:03:51.548
My compliments.

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:56.235
Forgive me, but I must sit
down before I fall down.

00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:57.581
By all means.

00:04:01.357 --> 00:04:02.524
That’s better.

00:04:07.524 --> 00:04:10.197
Now then, who are you?

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.975
I expected that a few Europeans might

00:04:13.017 --> 00:04:15.683
take an interest in
our little insurrection,

00:04:16.363 --> 00:04:20.078
but I must say I am at a loss
as to where you might be from.

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:23.213
Franistan, mon Generale.

00:04:23.503 --> 00:04:26.204
It's a small, er, kingdom near –

00:04:26.247 --> 00:04:28.095
- Russia.
- Russia!

00:04:28.572 --> 00:04:31.267
I see. And you are?

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:34.172
Captain Carter
- er, Cartier.

00:04:35.097 --> 00:04:40.795
May I present Corporal Prescott

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.086
and my physician, Doctor Holley.

00:04:44.088 --> 00:04:46.259
May I say what an
honor it is to meet you.

00:04:46.478 --> 00:04:47.993
I cannot think why.

00:04:49.135 --> 00:04:51.785
General Howe does not
think us worth pursuing,

00:04:52.398 --> 00:04:53.716
and I must say I agree with him.

00:04:53.758 --> 00:04:54.844
Sir!

00:04:54.988 --> 00:04:56.884
It is common knowledge, James.

00:04:57.262 --> 00:05:00.549
Besides, I don’t plan to
allow our European guests

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.732
to go traipsing about the
countryside anytime soon.

00:05:04.202 --> 00:05:07.218
That is, until I see a letter
of introduction from their king.

00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:11.119
I’m afraid we got separated
from our group a few days ago.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.363
I don’t even know where we are.

00:05:14.418 --> 00:05:16.774
We found them on the other
bank of the river, Excellency.

00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.648
Where we had skirmished last week.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.935
Then welcome to Pennsylvania, Captain.

00:05:24.153 --> 00:05:27.001
I am sorry about the
misunderstanding with your man.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.022
Your physician does good work.

00:05:32.518 --> 00:05:37.095
Now then. If you will excuse me, I have
what’s left of an army to attend to.

00:05:39.743 --> 00:05:41.430
See that our guests are fed.

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:46.745
General? May we speak again later?

00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:51.122
Certainly. This is the
warmest room for miles.

00:05:56.396 --> 00:06:00.024
Well, I would call that
a person of significance.

00:06:01.397 --> 00:06:03.778
Well, now we know where we are.

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:39.330
Corporal!
