Hi everyone! Blesbey here! And what
I'm going to show you is how to make a

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.389
water vegetable glycerin mix that you
can use in your hair on a daily basis.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.049
and I know there's been a lot of these
videos out there, and this is probably

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.490
going to be another one of those water
vegetable glycerin mix videos ,but I'm

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.660
I'm actually making this because i had a
new friend of mine request that I make

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.490
it. I couldn't show her in person so I'm
like hey I'll just make a video for you.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.680
you can watch it later! So that's the
reason I'm making it. so, uh... but it could

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.710
be helpful for anyone else who maybe
just recently big chopped, or you're... i

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.910
guess if you recently big chopped and
you're newly natural,... or just someone

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.150
who wants to try some other natural
product in their hair.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:54.220
I use this on a daily... well I won't say on a
daily basis.Probably every other day.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.630
But, I kinda use it if my hair feels kind of
dry. Vegetable glycerin is a humectant and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.740
it draws moisture from the air... so... I mean if it's a nice day outside and you're

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.670
going to be out enjoying the nice
weather, you might want to use the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.910
vegetable glycerin mix in your hair to just..I don't know

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.150
draw in some extra moisture. ok, guys! So
what you'll need to make the vegetable

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.960
glycerin water mix is vegetable glycerin
right here,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.610
water. This right here is bottled water. I
like to use bottled water because the

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.680
water my tap is just not well. it's not
filtered. I don't have like a filter

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.420
thing attached to the bottom,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.690
so I'm just trying to keep it pure. So,
bottled water,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.640
an essential oil of your choice. Right
here i have rosemary oil, but you can by

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.180
all means use peppermint oil, lavender
oil, whatever you choose to use. Like

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.420
i said, this is just what i have at the
moment rosemary oil. And actually,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.790
rosemary oil and peppermint oil are my
two favorite scents to use in mixtures

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.100
that I make.And lastly, you will need a
spray bottle right here. And this is one

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.350
that I got at Walmart. Probably for like...
probably a dollar.So, i don't remember.It

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.290
was a long time ago, but I like this one.
It's a little bit bigger and it

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.799
has a nice little spray handle so it makes
it easy to spray.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.980
So, um, the vegetable glycerin if you're
wondering where i got it, i actually sell

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.829
it at my website frogirls.com.

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.280
No this is not a plug for me to sell
stuff for my website,

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.409
it's just, you know, where I happen to
sell vegetable glycerin and it's only

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.260
four dollars in case you do want to buy
it.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.000
so, we're going to start the mixture by
taking the vegetable glycerin... and I have

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.500
this bottle here just because this is one
that I've been using for my personal use.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.859
So you open up the bottle or get out
your vegetable glycerin. Eww look! There's

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.480
hair on the side.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.989
Ok, anyway! There's always hair everywhere in

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.299
my life. Ok, no my hair is not falling out!
It just happens to shed

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:13.349
normally I guess.So, you're going to
take your spray bottle... and when I do

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.000
this I don't measure anything at all
because it's just for me... it's just put a

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.120
little vegetable glycerin, put a little water
in the other thing and then it's done.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.989
So, i just add some vegetable glycerin.
Vegetable glycerin is like syrupy

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.989
for those of you who haven't, who haven't tried it yet.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.470
And... i'm going to say that's enough.A
little goes a long way.You know, I could

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.310
have used too much, but it's what i'm using at the moment. so, okay so i put the vegetable

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.340
glycerin in and this is about how much is
in it.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.730
I don't know how much or how well you
can see that.Then next I'm going to

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:00.470
take my water, my filtered water,... so i'm
going to put the water in there and

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:08.300
you're going to just fill the whole
thing up with water.I love this

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.200
stuff guys! It's all natural, there's
nothing that's going to harm my hair in

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.200
it.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.379
Vegetable glycerin a vegetable derived,
no mineral oil, no other chemicals.

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:26.699
Nothing that's going to harm your hair
if you're against using lots of unatural

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:27.930
products in your hair.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.050
Ok, and then lastly you're going to add
your essential oil.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:39.719
Remember, I chose rosemary oil..... And this is purely for scent, but i don't know,... if

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.860
you read about rosemary oil and other or
essential oils they have some properties

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.240
that can help your hair.I'm not going
to go into that. You can research it for

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.020
yourself.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.310
i'm going to put put about 10 drops in
here.It may be excessive for some but I

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.620
really like my stuff to smell strong.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:04.319
So, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Okay, it's going
kind of fast so it may be more than 10

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.580
in there

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:13.830
Ok, so now that all my ingredients are
added I'm just going to take the top, put it

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.830
on my bottle here.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.050
Look at my old lady hands! My hands just
look so rough! I feel like I have

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.050
like old lady hands already and I'm only
27.

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:38.729
Ok, so you're just going to take it and shake it ...and that's it! There you have it!

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.680
It's all done! So there's your vegetable
glycerin water mix. Like I said I

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.910
use it every other day.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.510
Some people use it every day. The reason
I use it every other day is because I

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.850
don't...I mean my hair stays soft. I mean
honestly, I could probably go three days

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.010
without using it again but I just do it
every other day.Also what I do

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.360
in the morning is I spray, on those days
that I don't use this, I spray more

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.710
water, but I do use water every day in my
hair.On those days, like I said, on

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.199
those days that I don't use this,I
spray even more water in my hair.

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:18.180
Ok, guys! I hope this is helpful for those
of you out there who didn't

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.660
know how to make a vegetable glycerin
water mix.This is just my way of making

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.590
it and i've been using it since I've
been natural. So, yeah!

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.660
Alright! Thanks for watching guys! Love
you!
