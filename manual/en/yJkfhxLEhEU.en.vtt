00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:11.957
Welcome to WildStar.

00:00:11.957 --> 00:00:13.792
This is DevSpeak.

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:15.693
Disclaimer... and... 

00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:18.792
This series is about taking a closer look at WildStar's gameplay,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.040
so let's jump head first into one of our biggest features...

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.462
Paths.

00:00:23.462 --> 00:00:24.780
So everyone picks a Path

00:00:24.782 --> 00:00:26.200
when they create their character.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.360
It's part of you.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.170
But unlike your race and class

00:00:29.198 --> 00:00:32.495
this choice is about how you like to play MMOs

00:00:32.495 --> 00:00:33.627
Now don't get me wrong.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.132
The game itself has a huge amount of variety.

00:00:36.132 --> 00:00:37.231
No matter what your Path,

00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:40.033
you'll be getting into all kinds of situations, like

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:42.792
going kamikaze rhino on some dastardly pirates,

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:45.726
or finding underwater robots in a frozen lake.

00:00:45.726 --> 00:00:49.561
But Paths will consistently give you more of your favorite content.

00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:50.891
Take my buddy Fedora here.

00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:52.429
She likes to explore.

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:53.033
In other games,

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:54.792
she's always trying to scale up mountains,

00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:56.033
find secret locations,

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:59.132
or race me from some farmhouse to some satellite dish.

00:00:59.132 --> 00:01:02.231
Hell, she turns MMOs into scavenger hunts.

00:01:02.231 --> 00:01:04.561
In WildStar, because she picked the Explorer Path,

00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:07.561
she has access to that content everywhere.

00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:09.726
Like placing a beacon on top of this tree.

00:01:09.726 --> 00:01:12.363
Discovering a secret underground tunnel system.

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:16.858
Or running a time challenge from way up here to way over there.

00:01:16.858 --> 00:01:19.825
She'll even get actual scavenger hunts.

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:22.627
Now Franko here, he likes to know things.

00:01:22.627 --> 00:01:24.858
Like what's the deal with these giant flowers?

00:01:24.858 --> 00:01:26.924
And why does their pollen make me float?

00:01:26.924 --> 00:01:29.033
This is why Franko plays Scientist.

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:32.462
He's got a little scanbot that can unlock all the answers he seeks.

00:01:32.462 --> 00:01:34.957
Like what's the secret purpose of this facility?

00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:39.495
And.. how can he arrange these things in just the right way so—

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:41.825
Aw $%!&amp;, hidden room!

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:42.240
Now me?

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.759
I just like killing things.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.264
And not just everyday things.

00:01:47.264 --> 00:01:49.297
Big ol' waves of things.

00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:51.561
Freaking huge, weird things.

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:54.627
Yeah ha ha ha, get some!

00:01:54.627 --> 00:01:56.297
That's why I play Soldier.

00:01:56.297 --> 00:01:59.231
Soldier gives me experimental weaponry to play with,

00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:00.165
huge holdouts,

00:02:00.165 --> 00:02:02.132
and super-hard boss fights.

00:02:02.132 --> 00:02:05.693
And then you have Settlers, like JPHiggenbottom.

00:02:05.693 --> 00:02:09.561
He can literally build buildings... all over the place.

00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:11.033
Things like buff stations,

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:11.858
vendors,

00:02:11.858 --> 00:02:14.231
secret quest givers with rare loot—

00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:16.363
even shared infrastructure projects.

00:02:16.363 --> 00:02:19.231
And JPHiggenbottom loves the attention.

00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:21.891
You may see him trying to attract you to his campfire.

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:23.264
Don't feel special.

00:02:23.264 --> 00:02:25.363
He gets Path XP when you use it.

00:02:25.363 --> 00:02:27.924
Now when all of us group together, it gets pretty awesome.

00:02:27.924 --> 00:02:30.429
It's like an old pen and paper adventuring party.

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.033
Fedora drags us up deadly jump puzzles,

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:35.561
Franko tells us the secret backstory,

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:37.594
I get the group into huge fights,

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:42.099
and JPHiggenbottom builds us speeder bikes to ride back into town.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.462
Even playing the same Path is fun.

00:02:44.462 --> 00:02:48.033
Explorers can, like, race each other to the top of the mountain,

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:51.495
Soldiers make each other's holdouts bigger and more rewarding—

00:02:51.495 --> 00:02:54.495
even settlers get payoffs for teamwork.

00:02:54.495 --> 00:02:57.858
I could go on forever about Paths, but I gotta run.

00:02:57.858 --> 00:03:00.297
JPHiggenbottom built a bar

00:03:00.297 --> 00:03:01.759
and drinks are half off.

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.462
If you wanna know more about anything, give a shout.

00:03:04.462 --> 00:03:06.858
As always, the devs are listening.
