Hello and welcome to Cupcake Addiction's Spring
Flowers Pull-apart Cupcake Cake Tutorial where

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.710
I'll be showing you how to make this gorgeous
and very versatile spring flowers pull-apart

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.720
cupcake cake.
Tools and equipment that we will be using

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.340
today:
I've got just a disposable piping bag and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.641
I've paired that with a round tip piping nozzle.
I think I'm using a Loyal number 17 but you

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:30.800
can use any round piping nozzle you like.
I've filled that with some of our perfectly

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.190
pipeable buttercream frosting which I've tinted
a lovely rich pink color.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.920
I've also got a little bit more of that frosting
over here. That's a lighter pink color. I

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.570
will leave a link in the description box below
to that great recipe and tutorial if you don't

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.739
have a frosting that you love.
I've got a zip lock bag.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.989
I've got a pair of scissors.
I've got just some regular white marshmallows.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.760
I've got some spearmint leaf candies.
I've got a green twizzler. If you're in the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.350
US, you'll be able to find green twizzlers.
If you're not, if you're in Australia like

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.199
I am, you can also substitute these for the
green fruit sticks. They look a little bit

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.640
like [musk] stick available in our (Inaudible
01:05) here. But they're actually called fruit

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.469
sticks and they come in green in those packets.
I've got a teaspoon and a toothpick.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.579
Alright, so let's get started.
I'm doing mine today on a board. So I'm actually

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.880
not using a cake board. I'm using a place
mat, so something to think about. I got these

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.439
ones on sale. I love the pattern on them.
And you don't always have to get a cake board.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.020
If you find something like a place mat that
you find in a good price, why not use that?

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.430
I've got mini cupcakes today. So I'm using
10 mini cupcakes. I mentioned this is versatile.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.701
You can go as many flowers as you like. You
can use large cupcakes, small cupcakes. The

00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:43.740
concept is exactly the same.
So what I've done is I've just positioned

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.829
them to look like flowers on my board, just
sort of move them around. And I've pre-stuck

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.110
down these ones with a little bit of buttercream
frosting.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.679
So what you want to do is you want to take
a little bit of that buttercream frosting

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.429
and just pop it on the bottom of your cupcake
and pop it back on the board. I always position

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.560
them first and then I sort of frosting-stick
them down just so that I can make sure they're

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.669
exactly where I want before I go marking the
board with any of that frosting.

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:11.490
Just before you pop the last one in, take
a little bit of that frosting and just pop

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.250
it on the bottom of the marshmallow. You're
going to put 1 marshmallow in the middle.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.010
Now I've got quite a nice round top on one
side and the other side's a bit smaller so

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.800
I'm going to go with the nice little flat
round top. The smaller side is going to get

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.780
another little blob of that frosting and stuck
it on top of that marshmallow in the inside.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.890
You can use an extra cupcake for the inside
but I like the look of the inside piece being

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.880
a little bit smaller.
A little bit more frosting on that one. And

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.440
those ones are ready to go. That's just going
to stop them from moving around.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.590
With my twizzlers down here. I actually tore
my twizzler in half so I got 2 stems from

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.690
each twizzler. They do tear quite easily and
you can also cut them if you like. But basically

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.840
I just tore the twizzler in half and gave
it a little twist.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.070
The spearmint leaves speak for themselves.
So to attach the twizzlers, it's really just

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.370
as simple as a little bit more frosting, just
a really little bit on the back. And you can

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.340
also use white chocolate if you want them
to be really really firmly stuck. I find the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.190
frosting's perfect for what I need. And I've
just made quite a small one today with a 10-minute

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.020
to cupcake because it's just going to be me
and my mom and my sister so we don't want

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.810
that to be too many cupcakes, if there is
such a thing.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:29.390
A little bit of frosting on the back of those
spearmint leaves and stick them down. Lovely!

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:42.720
Now, we're going to start by frosting our
lovely swirl. So you want to make sure that

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.050
you're coming right into meet up with the
center. And you want to go around sort of

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.880
the outsides of the cupcake. So just balancing
the cupcake. They should be stuck to the board

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.580
but you don't want them moving anywhere. Come
around in a nice big, low, smooth swirl. So

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.300
you can see there, I'm starting really in
the center, come all the way into that marshmallow,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.320
going out and around. You can see the lovely
petal shapes that we're getting. And you're

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.640
actually joining them all together by making
sure that you come out over the edges with

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.120
those swirls.
Alright, now have a look at that! They're

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.880
already looking absolutely fantastic and you
can certainly leave them at that point if

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.699
you wish. You can go with different colors.
You can go with different styles, absolutely

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.379
whatever you like. We're going to take it
to the next level here at My Cupcake Addiction

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.900
because that's what we like to do and we're
just going to do a little bit of outlining

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.330
and a bit of detail work.
Alright, now with that lighter colored frosting.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.289
You want to take your zip lock bag and that
spoon. We're just going to spoon some of that

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.240
lighter pink frosting into the zip lock bag.
I can find some room down here with my large

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:56.681
cake. Beautiful.
Now, just zip it up most of the way. Then

00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:02.439
let any excess air out of the bag before sealing
it up all the way. And we're just going to

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:07.509
cut just a little nick off the end, so not
too much, just a little corner. This is going

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.680
to act like a little bit of a fine piping
bag for us. And we're just going to add a

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.199
little bit of detail to these flowers.
So starting at the center so that you're not

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:20.870
going to have any gaps in between your marshmallow
and the rest of your beautiful petals. We're

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:32.439
just going to come out and we're just going
to trace around the edges of those petals.

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:45.590
Once you've traced around the outside of your
petals, just around your flower center.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.460
And there you have your gorgeous spring flower
pull-apart cupcake cake, perfect for Mother's

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.900
Day, Valentine's or any spring time occasion.
Hope you've enjoyed watching this tutorial

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.130
as much as I've enjoyed making it for you.
Thanks very much for watching.
