Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.250
Today we’re going to show you how to change
the drain pump &amp; motor on your washer.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.430
It’s a really easy job; all you’re going
to need is a Phillips screwdriver &amp; a putty

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.700
knife, a pair of slip-joint pliers, and a
5/16ths nut driver.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.490
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.150
Now before we begin this repair the first
thing we’ll need to do is to disconnect

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.880
the power to the washer; simply pull the plug
from the receptacle.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.630
Now to do this repair we do need to remove
the front panel.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.619
The easiest way to do that is, to first of
all, release the two spring catches along

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.530
the top of the front panel that engage the
main top; just take a putty knife and slide

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:51.490
them in, oh about three inches in from either
side, depress the spring clip, and just allow

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.960
the top to float.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.300
Now with the Phillips screwdriver we will
remove two screws at the bottom of the front

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:08.049
panel; one on either side.

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.200
Once you have removed both of the screws just
grasp the front panel on either side and push

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.590
straight down on it; that will disengage it
from the cabinet, then you can tilt it out

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.700
and remove it to gain access.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.500
Now for this repair I suggest that you use
some protective gloves as the metal edges

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.170
on this machine are fairly sharp.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.189
So the first thing that we will do is remove
two 5/16ths screws that secure the pump to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:46.240
the base; then we can pull it forward enough
to remove both hoses: the inlet and outlet

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.909
hoses; because there will be some water in
them we’ll need to put a little drain pan

00:01:49.909 --> 00:02:04.880
in there and collect that excess water.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.110
Now once we’ve removed the two screws I
would suggest lifting the pump up and sitting

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.080
a drain pan underneath of it; then we will
remove the two hoses.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:35.510
With a pair of slip-joint pliers, just squeeze
that clamp together and pull it away.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:53.190
Then twist the hose completely off of 
the pump.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.130
Now we can remove the clamp on the inlet tube
pump.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:17.560
The same thing we’ll just depress the clamp,
then slide the hose off the end, and then

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:25.680
catch any of the remaining water in that hose
that remains in the bottom of the tub.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.840
Now at this point we can disconnect the wire
connector to the pump.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:47.900
Then we’ll also depress that plastic wire
clip, then we’ll remove it from the shroud

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.230
to be reused on the new pump.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.440
You can discard the old pump.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.740
Now we’ll make sure that we’ve gotten
all the water out of those hoses.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:09.140
Now we can position the tub-to-pump hose on
the new pump.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.900
Just make sure we have it lined up correctly.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:40.790
Depress the clamp, pull that into position,
and we’ll do the same for the outlet.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:05:05.420
Slide it over the end of the pump, and then
we’ll position the clamp properly.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:28.470
Next we’ll insert that wire retaining clip,
snap it into the hole in the side of that

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.220
cover.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:42.090
Then we can reinstall the 5/16ths screws that
secure the pump to the base.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:06:01.960
Then we’ll reconnect the power, make sure
the locking tab engages, and now we’re ready

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.730
to put the front panel on.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.470
Now that we’ve completed our repair we’re
ready to put the front panel back on; so we’ll

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:17.110
line it up on both sides, engage the two hooks
on either side with the two slotted openings

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:26.419
in the cabinet, then we’ll pull up on that
front panel until it’s flush on either side

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:49.639
with the top; once you have it flush we’ll
replace the two Phillips screws on the bottom,

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:54.990
next we’ll make sure that the top lines
up with the locating pins on either side of

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.970
the cabinet, and they will fit on corresponding
holes on the bottom of the main top, once

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:09.220
they’re lined up just snap the front of
it into place, and our repair is complete.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.920
Told you it was an easy job.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.259
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
