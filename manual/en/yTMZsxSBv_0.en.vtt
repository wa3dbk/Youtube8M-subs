00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:03.423
- [Voiceover] If you've had a stroke,

00:00:03.423 --> 00:00:05.829
or have had any warning signs of stroke,

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:09.630
such as a sudden numbness
on one side of your body,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.586
you'd need to seek
immediate medical attention

00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:16.340
so that a physician could
diagnose a few things.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.004
First, whether or not
a stroke has occurred,

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:23.591
Second, how bad the stroke likely is,

00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:24.509
and third,

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.806
what the underlying cause
of that stroke could be.

00:00:27.806 --> 00:00:30.104
And again, a stroke is
a medical emergency,

00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:33.579
so you'd be seeking medical
attention immediately.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.804
So how is a stroke diagnosed?

00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:37.941
Well it's kind of done in a few steps.

00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:39.845
The first step is for the doctor to get

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:41.910
a detailed medical history.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.941
So this means that you,
or maybe a family member

00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:48.122
if you're disoriented or unable to speak,

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:49.887
you or your family member would be able

00:00:49.887 --> 00:00:52.963
to explain to the doctor what
happened to make you worried

00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:55.366
that a stroke might have occurred.

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.723
After that, the doctor would go on to ask

00:00:57.723 --> 00:00:59.789
about the symptoms that you experienced.

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.109
So, whether you had an extreme headache,

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.768
which may indicate a hemorrhagic stroke.

00:01:05.768 --> 00:01:07.016
Or maybe you might have had

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:09.158
some sudden weakness in your limbs,

00:01:09.158 --> 00:01:11.062
or in the muscles of your face.

00:01:11.062 --> 00:01:12.223
Or maybe you might have had problems

00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:14.719
with your vision or your balance.

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:15.903
You'd also be asked questions

00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:18.806
to check your memory, and your speech,

00:01:18.806 --> 00:01:21.164
and even your thinking,

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:24.262
because any or all of these
could be affected in a stroke,

00:01:24.262 --> 00:01:27.501
depending on which part of
your brain has been injured.

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:29.625
And on top of all these symptom questions,

00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:32.621
you'd be asked about any risk
factors that you might have

00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:34.327
for developing a stroke.

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.243
So you'd be asked about any hypertension

00:01:36.243 --> 00:01:37.764
that you might have been diagnosed with.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.421
Because we know that
chronically high blood pressure,

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:44.559
hypertension, that predisposes you

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:48.665
to particular types of strokes,
like hemorrhagic strokes.

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:49.920
And you'd also be asked about

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.602
any heart conditions you might have,

00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:55.399
like atrial fibrillation or
maybe a previous heart attack,

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.102
because those are both risk
factors for stroke as well.

00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:02.643
Or you'd be asked about high
cholesterol or if you smoke,

00:02:02.643 --> 00:02:05.139
because both of those are
some of the major risk factors

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:06.984
for stroke as well.

00:02:06.984 --> 00:02:09.071
So just keep in mind that the first step

00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:11.803
in diagnosing a stroke is
getting a really good picture

00:02:11.803 --> 00:02:13.742
of what's going on with the patient.

00:02:13.742 --> 00:02:15.936
And that's done through
this medical history,

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.316
this interview, if you will.

00:02:18.316 --> 00:02:20.463
The second step is for
the physician to perform

00:02:20.463 --> 00:02:23.203
a full neurological exam on the patient.

00:02:23.203 --> 00:02:24.620
So what in the world is that?

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.618
What does that involve?

00:02:25.618 --> 00:02:28.682
Well, it's not really
as scary as it sounds.

00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:30.900
It's basically just a
physical examination of

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.397
a variety of your neurological functions.

00:02:33.397 --> 00:02:36.798
And that's to look for any signs
that a stroke has occurred.

00:02:36.798 --> 00:02:40.594
So your motor skills, which
is your movement ability,

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:43.542
and your sensation of both
your upper and your lower limbs

00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:46.051
would be tested in a few different ways.

00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:47.839
And then some of your special senses,

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:49.499
like your hearing and your vision,

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:51.344
would be tested as well.

00:02:51.344 --> 00:02:53.098
You'd probably be asked to perform

00:02:53.098 --> 00:02:55.082
some fine motor tasks as well,

00:02:55.082 --> 00:02:58.020
like writing down a
sentence with a pencil.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.737
So a nice, full checkup
of your movement ability

00:03:00.737 --> 00:03:03.500
and your sensation of your
upper and lower limbs.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.936
And based on your symptoms,
the doctor can often identify

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.258
what part of the brain has been injured.

00:03:09.258 --> 00:03:11.616
So, for example, you might remember that

00:03:11.616 --> 00:03:13.356
symptoms on one side of the body

00:03:13.356 --> 00:03:16.583
suggest damage in the opposite
hemisphere of the brain.

00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:20.557
So if you had problems with
your left arm, for example,

00:03:20.557 --> 00:03:22.714
that might suggest that
something's going on

00:03:22.714 --> 00:03:24.919
in the right half of your brain.

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:25.986
And as another example,

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:28.366
problems with your
balance and your walking

00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:30.931
might suggest damage to your cerebellum.

00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:33.287
So depending on your
symptoms and where they are,

00:03:33.287 --> 00:03:35.668
it paints a pretty good picture
of what part of your brain

00:03:35.668 --> 00:03:38.524
might have been injured in a stroke.

00:03:38.524 --> 00:03:41.309
Now, as part of the exam,
the doctor will also check

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:43.342
your pulse and your blood pressure.

00:03:43.342 --> 00:03:44.607
And this is partly to look for

00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:46.082
any underlying heart conditions

00:03:46.082 --> 00:03:48.089
that might have caused the stroke.

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:50.667
So, for example, an irregular pulse

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:53.361
might indicate atrial fibrillation,

00:03:53.361 --> 00:03:54.649
which is one of those heart conditions

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:56.901
where your heart doesn't
keep a proper rhythm,

00:03:56.901 --> 00:03:59.130
and that's a major stroke risk factor.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.370
Besides your pulse and
your blood pressure,

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.091
your reflexes might be checked as well

00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:05.969
to see if they were
affected by the stroke.

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.441
Depending on what's going
on with your reflexes,

00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:11.042
particularly whether they're
more responsive than usual

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:14.281
or even absent, just non-responsive,

00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:16.010
that gives the doctor
even more information

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.203
about where in the brain your
stroke might have affected.

00:04:19.203 --> 00:04:21.408
So by gathering all this information

00:04:21.408 --> 00:04:24.392
by talking to you or your family member,

00:04:24.392 --> 00:04:28.012
and by doing this
neurological physical exam,

00:04:28.012 --> 00:04:30.101
the doctor will be able
to get a pretty good idea

00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:32.923
of what type of stroke
might have happened,

00:04:32.923 --> 00:04:35.233
where in the brain it might be,

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:37.160
and how severe it might be.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.503
Then after that, further tests
to confirm would be ordered.

00:04:41.503 --> 00:04:44.313
So lab tests such as blood work,

00:04:44.313 --> 00:04:47.156
and imaging tests such as brain scanning

00:04:47.156 --> 00:04:49.838
would be ordered to further evaluate

00:04:49.838 --> 00:04:52.223
and diagnose the possible stroke.
