STAN: BARRY, THANK YOU.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.700
ART IS VERY PERSONAL, AND OFTEN,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.360
LOCAL AND WORLD EVENTS INSPIRE

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.100
THEM TO CREATE, AND THERE IS

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.800
SOMETHING THAT IS CREATING A LOT

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.500
OF US AROUND BALTIMORE, BUT A

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.200
WARNING THAT SOME OF THE IMAGES

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.600
YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE COULD BE

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.280
DISTURBING.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.610
REPORTER: IN

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.400
THE 27 HUNDRED

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.130
BLOCK, THERE IS A WORK OF ART

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.810
THAT PEOPLE CANNOT WALK OR DRIVE

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.550
BY WITHOUT STOPPING TO TAKE A

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.490
PICTURE OR SPEAK TO THE ARTIST.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.820
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.650
THIS.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.020
I PERSONALLY THINK IT IS A

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.680
BIT LOUD.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.590
I EVEN MENTIONED IT TO HIM.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.760
I

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.130
THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD WAKE

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.920
UP TO IT.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.300
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT IS

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.800
HAPPENING.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.700
IT IS HAPPENING EVERYWHERE, BUT

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.390
THE THING ABOUT IT IS IT HAS

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.110
BEEN GOING ON, IT IS JUST NOW

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.040
COMING TO TV

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.400
I CANNOT LET IT GO.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.130
I CANNOT.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.010
REPORTER: HE SAYS HE HAS BEEN IN

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.850
MORNING SINCE AN UNARMED WALTER

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.550
SCOTT WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY A

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.520
POLICE OFFICER, AND HE WAS SO

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.120
DISTURBED, HE CLOSED HIS GALLERY

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.620
TO WORK OUTSIDE HIS WEST

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.290
BALTIMORE STUDIO.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.790
I AM IN MOURNING FOR ALL OF

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.230
THE BLACK MEN WHO ARE DYING

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.860
NEEDLESSLY, AND THE UNITED

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.390
STATES OF AMERICA IS DOING

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.100
NOTHING ABOUT IT, AND IT SEEMS

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.470
WE CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT POLICE

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.070
BRUTALITY.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.000
REPORTER: HE SAID HE PAINTED

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.300
THESE AND HUNG THEM FROM THIS

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.980
TREE.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.240
I WANTED

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.930
TO MAKE A STATEMENT,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.820
TO SHOW PEOPLE EXACTLY WHAT IS

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.990
GOING ON, AND IT IS PRETTY

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.290
MUCH

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.760
DEATH.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.790
WE ARE BEING KILLED LIKE

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.420
INNOCENT BABIES.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.420
GETTING SHOT EIGHT TIMES.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.200
REPORTER: HE STARTED THE

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.700
EXHIBITION WITH SIGNS BEFORE

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.390
HANGING THE DOLLS.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.540
I HUNG THEM FROM THE TREES

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.270
TO

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.570
LET PEOPLE VISUALLY SEE WHAT WE

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.310
FEEL.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.610
WE ARE FEELING THIS.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.010
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE SHOULD

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.400
GLOSS OVER.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.840
WE ARE ACTUALLY FEELING DEATH IN

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.550
OUR COMMUNITY.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.550
WE ARE BEING MURDERED, KILLED,

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.550
LEGALLY IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.910
THIS IS A QUESTION OF WHAT IS

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.850
GOING ON.
