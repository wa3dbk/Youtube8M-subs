JORGE BENLLOCH: Let me first tell you what
is that. That's the--it's going to be the

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:13.831
final display of the fish. We are going to
put the clay fish in here like this. But for

00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:27.140
now, this is like $5 shelf that--$4.50 that
I bought at Home Depot, I guess. We are going

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:37.760
to use the other side in order to put the
clay in there. Then we are going to put it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:54.789
in here with this. Then, you guys, you will
see what I am doing. Now, we are going to

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:04.220
put the thicker part of the head. And you
would see that we need material here and there.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:16.330
Then of course, well--then we cut more and
we add more. We add the material for the fin

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:30.080
in here. We add some kind of material here.
We are going to add some material in there

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:41.200
for these little fins. Then we're going to
put this fish there. Then we are going to

00:01:41.200 --> 00:02:26.540
draw the fish. I forget to cut this, then
we mark with that whatever we need. And this

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:40.850
is the eye, that's important. MAN: Okay. JORGE
BENLLOCH: And that's, more or less, the design

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.530
of the fish.
