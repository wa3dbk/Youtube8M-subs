00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:09.786
Let's go!Tamagotchi!

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:11.116
Yah-tchi!

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:17.586
Goodbye, Ms. Perfect!

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:20.846
Goodbye, class, I'll cya later!  Haha!

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:26.046
So can you guys all meet up at the 
Tamagotchi department store later?

00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:29.386
There's a really popular band playing tonight!

00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:31.016
Sure, that sounds like fun.

00:00:31.246 --> 00:00:33.486
Well, if Mametchi is going, then so are we.

00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:38.016
We're going too, oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:39.186
Huh?

00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:41.986
Hey, Kuromametchi,
would you like to go with us?

00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:43.716
No, thanks, I'll pass.

00:00:45.886 --> 00:00:47.216
He's such a loner.

00:00:47.716 --> 00:00:50.686
But the fact that he's a loner makes him so cool

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.486
Not to mention how smart he is.

00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:54.616
And he's really good at sports.

00:00:54.786 --> 00:00:57.786
Ah! What if he thinks we're not cool enough 
to hang out with him?!

00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:02.386
Mametchi's cool enough.. 
In fact, he's like your number one rival, right?

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:06.886
Well not really a rival. 
I think of Kuromametchi as more than a friend. 

00:01:14.746 --> 00:01:16.286
Yo, Ciaotchi.

00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:18.246
What do you want this time, Bikertchi?

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:21.716
I've got something really important 
I've been wanting to talk to you about.

00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:25.246
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm in a rush.

00:01:25.346 --> 00:01:26.116
Ciao. 

00:01:27.916 --> 00:01:30.246
Hey, there's no need to hurry.

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:32.486
Oh? What're you trying to say, huh?

00:01:32.816 --> 00:01:34.986
Well.. You see, the thing is.. 

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:38.546
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:41.286
What do you think you're doing, Kuromametchi?

00:01:41.916 --> 00:01:43.046
Thanks for your help.

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:46.886
Wait, Ciaotchi, come back...

00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:50.386
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:02.686
It's from him. 

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:09.446
Hey, sorry about the misunderstanding, Bikertchi

00:02:13.586 --> 00:02:15.116
My love letter!

00:02:15.916 --> 00:02:21.816
She's reading it, she's finally reading it,
thank you so much, Kuromamet- Huh? Kuromametchi?

00:02:22.216 --> 00:02:24.586
Wait a minute, where did you go,
kuromametchi?

00:02:27.816 --> 00:02:28.946
I owe you one!

00:02:29.946 --> 00:02:33.516
Anytime you need anything you, let me know, ok?

00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:36.846
It looks to me like he got himself a new groupie

00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:40.846
Kuromametchi's so cool, even the boys will 
do anything to hang out with him.
