00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:04.966
Today I'll talk about a Logitech K400 keyboard

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.332
and in particular using it with a

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.799
Cubieboard 2 device which is a small system on a chip.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.133
Someone left me a comment asking, "If you can use it with a Cubieboard 2?" and the answer 

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:23.033
is yes with a particular distribution you can called Cubian

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:27.966
which that will get buried away in the comments and I figured that you may as well make a video

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:32.932
dedicated to the keyboard.  First I'll talk about did the pluses of the keyboard

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:41.833
you have an integrated keyboard and touch pad mouse in one device.  It has a left mouse button that you can click on

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:49.066
and right mouse button you can click on. You can also double tap on the touchpad and move the mouse around with the touchpad and if you 

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:53.932
double click on the touchpad it would simulate a left

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.466
mouse button click.

00:00:55.466 --> 00:01:05.232
Now the nice thing about it and in particular using it with Cubian is that you also have this device which is a...

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:13.033
It is a special proprietary receiver made by Logitech that just works of this keyboard

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:21.266
and that's it.  It's a USB dongle or adapter and all you need to do is take it

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:24.699
and plug it into your Cubieboard

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.466
and automatically pick up of the keyboard assuming that you've turned it on which the ON switch

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:33.632
is on the side.  Currently it's OFF

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:39.833
on the underside of the board there is a battery compartment which takes two AA batteries

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:43.933
To get this open you need to wedge your fingernail

00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:47.733
You kind of push up and wedge your fingernail in there and you can take it off

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:50.366
It comes with two AA batteries.

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:55.199
which they have pieces of paper and you pull out the pieces of paper

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.766
and you're good to go

00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:00.399
and turn it ON

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.100
I would just flip this switch on

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.800
I would just flip this switch on

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.966
With the Logitech reciever plugged into the Cubieboard 2

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:12.232
with the Cubian distribution right out of the box I don't have to do anything

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:16.099
as you can see with the touchpad

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.466
if I move my mouse [finger] the mouse cursor

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:24.632
does move around screen and I can login as

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:28.766
the login is cubie and the password is cubie

00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:41.666
and this just me using the Logitech K400 keyboard and I can just to go and open up of a web browser

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:46.466
and this is all using the keyboard

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:52.566
now this doesn't work with Cubiuntu distribution because I tried it out with that.  I definitely know 

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:56.632
for sure that this works with Cubian

00:02:56.633 --> 00:03:00.966
For the minuses of the keyboard, going back to

00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:10.766
the USB receiver is that this is not a Bluetooth adapter.  It's a special USB receiver this meant

00:03:10.766 --> 00:03:17.332
only for Logitech keyboards.  So if I'm thinking about using this with Cubieboard 3 which has a built in

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:25.666
Bluetooth receiver on it.  This keyboard won't work with it without this adapter plugged in

00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:28.266
another minus is that

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:32.366
compared to my regular desktop keyboard

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:32.466
 

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:36.066
the K400 as it is significantly smaller

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:38.599
The keys are smaller.  They are closer together.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.933
I don't have that spacious keyboard.  The size of the space bar is also reduced

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:50.066
and also I have this extra function key which makes a spacebar even smaller so I am not really fond 

00:03:50.066 --> 00:03:55.232
of the keyboard size compared to my regular desktop

00:03:55.233 --> 00:03:59.633
keyboard

00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:05.666
now this is not from the experience of using the Cubieboard 2, but using a different device... 

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:11.699
If this is the far enough away from the USB dongle [receiver] it will have problems

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.300
picking up keyboard and mouse movements

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.366
and what I have found.  For example, if you have this on your lap

00:04:17.366 --> 00:04:19.232
I have to angle it up

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:24.166
I'm assuming that there is a

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:27.399
transmitter built-in and on the underside here

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.900
so I would have to actually pick this up off my lap so it would actually recognize mouse movements

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.200
I think that's true with the keyboard, but it's harder with the keyboard because you have to lift it up

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.200
and trying to type on it.  It's easier using the mouse

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.800
so you can pick this up for about $30 at retail stores if you're interested in getting one

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.966
That's it for this video

00:04:55.966 --> 00:04:56.932
Thanks for watching
