00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.770
OLBERMANN: If voting is the bare minimum of
participating in our democracy, it can be

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.609
doubled by persuading somebody else to vote,
and in our No. 1 story on the Countdown, if

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.620
you fly all the way to Florida to do it, you're
either a great patriot or you are the comedian

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.100
Sarah Silverman, who will join us presently.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.690
Even with an electoral map that is leaning
heavily in Senator Obama's favor, Florida's

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.910
27 electoral votes cannot ever be taken for
granted, even if after they have counted,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.980
as you know.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.949
So a political action committee called the
Jewish Council for Education and Research

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.160
came up with a plan - a video.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.189
The PAC's co-founder is saying, quote, "It's
not a think tank white paper.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.840
It's meant to be a conversation starter."

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.590
And that is an understatement, considering
the video has been viewed on the Web more

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.780
than seven million times in just two weeks.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.940
Sarah Silverman and "The Great Schlep."

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.940
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.070
SARAH SILVERMAN, COMEDIAN: If you knew that
visiting your grandparents could change the

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.570
world, would you do it?

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.170
Of course you would.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.870
You'd have to be a douche nozzle not to.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.910
If Barack Obama doesn't become the next president
of the United States, I'm going to blame the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.910
Jews.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.910
I am.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.149
And I know you're saying, like, "Oh my God,
Sarah, I can't believe you're saying this.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.360
Jews are the most liberal, scrappy, civil
rights-y people there are."

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.380
Yes, that's true.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.920
But you're forgetting a large group of Jews
that are not that way.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:21.710
They go by several aliases: Nana, Papa, Zadie,
Bubbie, plain old Grandma and Grandpa.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.090
These are the people who vote in Florida.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.869
The Florida vote can make or break an election.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.430
If you don't think that's true, why don't
you think back to two elections ago when a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.969
little man named Al Gore got (EXPLETIVE DELETED)
by Florida.

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:43.390
I'm making this video to urge you, all of
you, to schlep over to Florida and convince

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.969
your grandparents to vote Obama.

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:45.969
(END VIDEOTAPE)

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.079
OLBERMANN: The full four-minute pitch is,
of course, online along with talking points

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.079
for conversations with your grandparents or
anybody else, for that matter.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.280
Right here, right now, as promised, deep thinker
Sarah Silverman.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.140
The second season of her show, "The Sarah
Silverman Program," airs tonight on Comedy

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.140
Central.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.140
Welcome.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.140
SILVERMAN: Hello.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.329
OLBERMANN: So how did this - how did "The
Great Schlep" come about?

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.550
SILVERMAN: Well, the guys from "The Great
Schlep" Web site came to me, and they explained

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.780
that the people that vote in Florida, it's
such an important state, right?

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.780
OLBERMANN: Indeed.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.930
SILVERMAN: They - the people that vote there
are the old Jews.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.660
They make up, really, just a small percentage
of Florida, but they vote.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.709
OLBERMANN: But 97 percent of them vote.

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.709
SILVERMAN: Yes.

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.340
And - and they're not going to vote for Obama,
because his name is scary to them, old fears

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.290
that may not be relevant anymore.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.620
And they think he's, you know, not pro-Israel
and all this crap.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.459
So there's a lot of misinformation going on
around there.

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.459
OLBERMANN: Yeah.

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.459
I would think.

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.430
SILVERMAN: But the good news is probably 100
percent, if you round up, of their grandkids

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.580
love Obama.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.580
OLBERMANN: All right.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.090
SILVERMAN: And who's more influential over
grandparents than their own grandkids?

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.740
So it's just about getting - you know, and
I - by the way, I think this is a gift to

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.030
the grandkids, to the kids today.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.280
Because I can't believe I'm saying kids today.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.930
But, they're fat and they're lazy and they're
apathetic.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.510
And here's - this election is such a chance
to really make a difference at any age.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.360
And I think it's kind of a gift to everybody.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.440
OLBERMANN: It will only affect them for the
rest of their lifetimes.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.440
SILVERMAN: Yes.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.090
OLBERMANN: That's the change election of their
lifetimes, we presume.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.950
It probably is with ours, as well.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.590
SILVERMAN: That was a good point I made, though,
right?

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.590
OLBERMANN: That was an excellent point.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.709
But now, you also mentioned that just the
name is scary.

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.030
The name - his name is scary.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.799
SILVERMAN: Barack Hussein Obama.

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:38.709
But you would think that, you know, a people
whose common name is, you know, Moishe Lipschitz

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.709
or whatever would have a little compassion
for a crappy name.

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:43.709
OLBERMANN: Yes.

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.239
For - for a name that isn't just the average
one you pull out of the phone book.

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.239
SILVERMAN: Yes.

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.510
And by the way, the name John, plenty of bad
people have been named John.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.510
OLBERMANN: Yes.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.030
SILVERMAN: Serial killers are named John.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.349
OLBERMANN: That's true.

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.420
Very few serial killers out there named Barack.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.420
SILVERMAN: Yes.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.760
Maybe one or two.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.760
Or none.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.069
OLBERMANN: Now, speaking of names, I've been
meaning to - and I don't know a lot of Sarahs,

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:10.090
but you qualify, and we have suddenly have
a political figure on the national scene named

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.090
Sarah.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.090
Yes.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.299
Do you have a - is it a mixture of pride and
shame or just shame?

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.320
SILVERMAN: Just shame.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:27.970
Sarah Palin, she is the worst combination
of - she is as off-putting and gross as a

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.320
pageant contestant but without the desire
for world peace.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.320
OLBERMANN: That's true.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.110
SILVERMAN: And you know what?

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.880
She cannot even think for herself or just
come up with - when you talk to me, I just

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.740
think of an answer and then I say an answer.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.020
Ask me what magazines I read.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.780
I mean, I'll show you how easy this is.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.720
OLBERMANN: Can I - can I just throw you off
here and say what magazines do you read?

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.170
SILVERMAN: Let's see.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.000
"In Style," "Domino," "Lucky," "Cat Fancy,"
"Big Naturals," and the "Wasilla Gazette."

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
How about that?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.870
That's the top of my head.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.050
How hard could it be?

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.350
OLBERMANN: Apparently, very.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.660
Yes, I wouldn't...

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.970
SILVERMAN: "Tap Water."

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.130
OLBERMANN: I would stick, to like, Red Bull
or something.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.130
You were -

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.130
I was at the Democratic convention.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.400
I got to see Danny Glover.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.200
Did you see anybody when you were out there,
have a big time at the Democratic convention?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.640
SILVERMAN: I saw so many people out there.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.950
I had a great time.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:20.950
I just went.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.950
OLBERMANN: Yeah.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.840
SILVERMAN: And - well, I have a picture.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.880
I don't know if they're going to show it.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.880
I met Al Gore.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.630
OLBERMANN: Man in the white suit here.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.940
Taking off his jacket.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.940
I get it.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.920
SILVERMAN: I - yes, he does the over-the-shoulder
thing.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.970
OLBERMANN: "Nice to meet you."

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.970
Yes.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:37.970
SILVERMAN: It's very every man.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:38.970
OLBERMANN: Yes.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.780
SILVERMAN: I love Al Gore, so at the Democratic
National Convention, I decided it would be

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.660
a good idea to eat half a pot cookie.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.280
I didn't want to go crazy.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.580
And just as it hit me, somebody called me
over to meet Al Gore.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.560
And if you see - show the picture one more
time.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.590
It had just hit me, and I think, right there,
I'm saying - I don't know what I'm saying,

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.810
but it looks maybe like, "Rah!

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.880
I'm a monster" or something.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.430
"I'm going to eat you."

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.430
OLBERMANN: Oh.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.430
Great.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.940
And he - and he is not - he's not backing
away or anything from you.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.950
SILVERMAN: He was really nice, the way I remember
it.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.950
OLBERMANN: All right.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.820
So now you've gone into - you've been an instant
political hit on the Intertube.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:18.890
SILVERMAN: Yes, I'm political now.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.860
OLBERMANN: Are you going to do more?

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.720
SILVERMAN: I think I'm going to go back to
doody jokes.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.740
OLBERMANN: Which is safer material these days?

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:30.740
Or are they the same?

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.740
They're the same!

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.740
SILVERMAN: I don't know.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.740
I do pretty cerebral doody jokes.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.740
OLBERMANN: It's the same.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.140
SILVERMAN: I don't like that the "Post" is
going to be mean to you tomorrow.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.140
OLBERMANN: Please.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.140
I'm so used to it.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.520
It's like without - if it doesn't happen once
a month, I get twitchy.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.720
SILVERMAN: What happened to the liberal Jew
media?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.801
OLBERMANN: I have no idea.

00:06:44.801 --> 00:06:46.960
I have no idea.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.020
The comedian Sarah Silverman, also mastermind
of "The Great Schlep," pleasure to have you

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.020
here.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.020
SILVERMAN: Thank you.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.020
Nice to be here.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.020
Do you shake hands?

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.020
OLBERMANN: Absolutely.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.020
Always.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.020
Not...

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.020
(SILVERMAN SHAKES OLBERMANN'S HAND THEN SMELLS
HER HAND)

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.020
OLBERMANN: Uh-oh.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.020
All right.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.020
That's Countdown for this, the 1,989th day
since the declaration of "Mission Accomplished"

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.020
in Iraq.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.020
Sarah will be joining me in "The New York
Post" now.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.020
I'm Keith Olbermann.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.440
Good night and good luck.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.930
Oh, thank you.
