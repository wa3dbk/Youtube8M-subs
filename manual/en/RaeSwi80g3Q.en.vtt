00:00:00.097 --> 00:00:03.395
(soft music)

00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:06.547
- Behind me you see a collection of

00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:10.225
spectacular blown-glass vases

00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:12.494
by the New York decorator designer

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:15.822
stain glass artist Louis Comfort Tiffany.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.061
I want to focus in particular

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:23.590
on the most spectacular of
this group in the center,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.590
this blue iridescent glass of 1913.

00:00:29.231 --> 00:00:32.289
That really marks the high point

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.569
of what was an intensive expression

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:38.728
of modern materials and forms.

00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:43.182
The glass is called favrile.

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:46.701
It exploits the iridescent, natural,

00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:51.000
and accidental beauties of blown-glass

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.369
in this form which drew its inspiration

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:56.976
from a "Jack In The Pulpit" flower.

00:00:56.976 --> 00:00:59.426
I mean it scares me every time

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:00.650
I look at this object.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.650
It's so fragile and
attenuated. It's (form).

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:09.423
What I love about this glass

00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:13.629
is the way it combines ancient and modern.

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:18.629
Tiffany was inspired by ancient,
Roman, and (terrain) glass,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.493
which has this iridescent
finish when it was dug up.

00:01:22.493 --> 00:01:24.726
At the same time, he wanted to create

00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:27.802
these startling modern objects.

00:01:27.802 --> 00:01:30.368
People were blown away when they were

00:01:30.368 --> 00:01:33.399
exhibited at the Colombian Worlds Fair

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.649
and in the Paris 1900 exhibition.

00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:42.597
What you see in this blue vase of 1913

00:01:42.597 --> 00:01:45.996
is almost like the last gasp,

00:01:45.996 --> 00:01:49.456
and the combination of this intensive

00:01:49.456 --> 00:01:53.062
expiration of form and technique

00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:57.349
for which Tiffany became
internationally famed.
