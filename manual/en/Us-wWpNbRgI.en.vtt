00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.979
This pictorial illustration so to help

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.980
most of the people to understand this simplicity of our DIY innovation......

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.700
Our DIY Innovation only means a roll of black pipe?

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.100
And they're only two joints

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.620
One for the cold inlet  of the pipe

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.320
at the lower end

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.059
and...One at the top to eject hot water to the storage

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.700
Here we have a module of 5 by 5 feet

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.600
of the absorber  panel stand

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.520
along with the pipe

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.259
the Following pictorial illustration

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.440
should help

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.530
to understand the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.290
simplicity of our innovation

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.360
We're doing a comparison of our innovation with flat plate collectors

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.300
usual plate Solar three panels

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:29.599
Uses around 54 square feet ...where as our four panel measures 100 square feer

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.700
Flat plate collector is around

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.169
50 1 meter half inch and one-inch pipe

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.790
Where as our

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.150
four modules hundred Square feet uses

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.790
100 meter

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.899
black pipe one inch diameter

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.919
These illustration should give very good insight for

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.429
Everyone to start one

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.959
DIY

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.400
innovative

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.319
passive Solar heater

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.319
in the yard

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.639
Bye for now... till we  meet again...!
