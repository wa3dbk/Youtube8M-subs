00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.760
one, two, three, four!

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.880
Rev up your engines!

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.860
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.480
today I'm going to talk a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.080
little about why you might think about
getting an electric arc welder, to fix

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.670
things on your car, now electric arc
welders are really simple devices, they're

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.750
basically just a giant transformer, to
put on a lot of electricity so you can

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.010
weld with electricity,
they're very rugged machines, I bought

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.720
this one on sale for about 200 bucks at
harbor freight tools, and when your looking

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.210
for a good welder, pick it up,
if it's heavy like this one, you know

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.059
it's solidly built, and if you're working
on cars, this 225 amp welder is strong

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.270
enough, and they're very simple devices, you
just turn the on switch, turns it on, then

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.420
you crank the crank, to change the
current readings, whether you want to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.790
higher or lower, in this case we're
setting it at about 125 amps, because I'm

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.460
using a 1/8 inch welding rod, and welding
heavy steel, that's a pretty good setting,

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.259
now admittedly, welding is sort of an art,
but you get very good basic books to tell

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.679
you what kind of rods to use, what kind
of settings to use, for what kind of

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:23.030
welding, we're just going to show you how
basic weld works now, the ground clamp is

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.600
just ground to the metal piece that
you're welding on, then the welding rod

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.369
just goes into the positive wire, to do
the welding with, and of course I'm going to

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.259
be wearing a welding helmet, so I don't
get blind, and I'm using a special helmet,

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.729
it's autodarkening, so you can see a
little, but once the flash comes up, that

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.630
activates the solar panel, which turns
it's super dark, so you can see the weld,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.270
if you don't get one of these in just a
real dark one,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.509
you're always lifting it up and down
looking at the work, this way you can

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.380
keep the helmet on the whole time, and of
course you want to wear good old leather

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.280
gloves to keep the sparks from getting
your hands and burning you, and anything

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.420
long-sleeve to keep it from getting on
your skin, now in welding, you have to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.670
have bare metal surface, so you got to
get all the paint off,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.130
that way when the clamps are on, you get
full electrical power, now when you

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.500
start, you have to start an arc, so you
scratch it a little, then it starts arching, then you start to apply a bead and stay about an 1/8 inch away from the arch,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.130
you want to get little swirls

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.220
like this in a line, you'll get good with
practice, just practice for a while, I

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.520
found that the best thing to do is to
get different pieces of metal, practice

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.240
on them, get a book that shows what kind
of rods to use and what kind of metals, and

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.810
how much thickness metal to use what
kind of amperage on your welder, and

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.070
you'll be able to weld things together
really well, after a few days of practice,

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.690
and here's a tip, the welding rods are
covered with this flux, if you store it

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.550
where it's humid and wet, the flux will come
off, so do what I do,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.270
store them in the refrigerator, because there's no
place dryer than the inside of a fridge,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.430
it's really dry, keeps them from going out, I
store my gunpowder in there too, so the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.640
next time something big breaks on your
car, don't buy an expensive part, weld it

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.590
back together, because if you buy it on
sale like me, a good welder is the best

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.540
200 bucks you'll ever spend on tools, and
remember if you have any car questions visit

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.780
the scotty kilmer channel,
and I'll answer them as soon as I get

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.709
back from paradise, assuming I come back!
