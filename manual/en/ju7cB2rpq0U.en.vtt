00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.900
Nokia 6700 Slide.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.140
Capitalising on the name of the very popular
6700 Classic, the Nokia 6700 Slide is a midmarket

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.349
slider phone that comes in a variety of vivid
colour schemes.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.210
Despite the similar name, the 6700 Slide is
actually an S60 smartphone where the Classic

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.840
version is not.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.200
This means that the Slide is much more capable
and expandable than the Classic, although

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.680
it is questionable if many customers in this
market segment will actually care.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.530
On the back is a 5 megapixel camera with autofocus,
dual LED flash and Carl Zeiss optics.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.800
Video recording is up to 640 x 480 pixels
at 15 frames per second.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.150
On the front is a 2.2" 240 x 320 pixel display
in 16 million colours, which we think is a

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.570
bit small for a phone of this type.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.720
This is a 3.5G device with both HSDPA and
HSUPA high-speed data, giving a maximum download

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.330
speed of 10.2 Mbps and uploads of up to 2
Mbps.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.490
There are two tri-band WCDMA variants depending
on region, and the 6700 Slide also supports

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.490
quad-band GSM.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.400
In other words, the 6700 Slide should be able
to deliver high-speed data in most markets

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.980
worldwide.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:43.130
The 6700 Slide supports microSD expandable
memory (with a 2GB card in the standard sales

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.940
package) and comes with Bluetooth 2.1 and
USB 2.0 connectivity.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.979
Audio output is through a 2.5mm connector,
which is a bit surprising seeing as most new

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.060
media phones seem to have a 3.5mm one.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.710
The 6700 Slide also comes with an FM radio
and of course a very decent multimedia player.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.590
The battery is a surprisingly small 860mAh
BL-4C cell, Nokia say that this can power

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.400
the 6700 Slide for up to 3 hours talktime
on 3G and 10 days standby time.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.650
Switching from 3G to GSM can eke out a little
more battery life, but hardly anyone bothers

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.650
doing that.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.380
Frankly, the battery life is probably too
short to appeal to most business users.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.310
It's a fairly smart looking device, but hardly
drop-dead gorgeous.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.720
Nokia say that the available colour schemes
include purple, pink, red, petrol blue, raw

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.110
aluminium and lime.. some of these colours
won't be to everyone's taste, so check carefully

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.880
before buying.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.590
The keypad is a flat design, similar to that
on the Classic.. and the keypad on that seems

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.980
to be a love-it-or-hate-it proposition.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.500
Priced at about â‚¬160 before tax and subsidy,
the 6700 Slide offers good value for a 3.5G

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.280
smartphone with a 5 megapixel camera.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.129
It's a good looking device with a wide range
of colours, but we do think that the battery

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.430
life and screen size are two areas where it
is somewhat compromised.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.469
Nokia say that the 6700 Slide should be available
sometime during Q1 2010.
