00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.379
republican controlled legislator and the
republican governor in pennsylvania

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:10.359
are looking into

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.180
changing that their winner take all
system

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.630
in pennsylvania these twenty electoral
votes

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.550
to make it somewhat more like maine

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.019
and nebraska which at that time of
electoral votes

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.060
so that

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.679
it's based upon what congressional
districts you win

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:36.140
peach condensed rower

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.290
they would base it upon it

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.920
which uh... candidate carried which
congressional district

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.870
and then uh...

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.270
plus two boats for the statewide then
were winner

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.740
so in other words

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.960
it would put up

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.170
for grabs

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.400
eighteen eighties electoral votes

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.990
based upon which congressional districts

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.650
president obama

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.520
in two thousand eight

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.540
one pennsylvania by eleven percentage
votes

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.340
in modern times

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.600
and maybe in all times

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.850
that's considered a landslide victory

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.360
norm its victory

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.380
for a president to have

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.310
statewide

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.110
or frankly national

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.210
pennsylvania has voted democratic in
every election since nineteen ninety-two

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.840
for president

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.190
and the only times it is both the g_o_p_

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.890
have been when they're being

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.630
presidential landslides for the
republicans

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.830
the republicans are uh... attempting to
implement this plan

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.460
because they know

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.430
that the heavily concentrated

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.310
congressional districts

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.010
in urban areas will go for the president

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.180
some rural districts

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.010
will go for the republican candidate

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.430
and on top of that

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.379
they are redistricting

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:18.219
so they now have the ability to
essentially hand

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.540
the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.769
republicans

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.139
close to nine

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:31.459
icid say ten electoral votes

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.979
how does propose system been in place in
two thousand eight one oh baba won the

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.009
state

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.419
by a a a mere eleven percent margin

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:44.419
he would only take an eleven other
states twenty one electoral votes at the

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:50.089
time

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.930
obama's votes are especially
concentrated in urban areas

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.659
where

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:02.239
democrats tend to make

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.900
the only way do sorted it uh... fight
this is on a local level maybe

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.010
perhaps uh... legally and i don't know
if there's any legal grounds on which

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.089
you can fight this states have the right

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:16.589
to proportion these in the way that they
want

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:21.149
but there's also a another movement
happening across the country

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:24.829
skull the uh... national popular vote
act

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.889
and it allows

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.989
for centrally uh...

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.549
it allows for the national vote

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.039
it basically says each state

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:39.699
will give all the reluctant votes

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.989
to the winner of the national vote

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.369
in other words

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:47.040
if this had been in existence in two
thousand

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.049
al gore would've been president two
thousand

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.729
regardless of what the supreme court
wanted to do

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.639
thing and the but uh... the victory to
bush because he won by five hundred

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.449
thousand votes in the country

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.779
half a million votes

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:05.659
four of the national um...

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.349
popular vote

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:08.549
act

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.699
to be implemented

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:17.069
annul states equalling two hundred and
seventy electoral votes

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.759
need essentially to adopt

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.509
at this point i think it's around a
hundred and seventy california was the

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:24.779
last day to do it

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:30.499
so there's not a lot of other states
that need to do this

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:36.090
for the national popular vote to kick in

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.910
uh...

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.860
but imagine here

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.620
republicans continue to push this

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.180
and it's quite possible they will

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.009
it's quite possible the outcome could
beat president obama

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.999
winning the national vote

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.270
by half a million

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.689
two million

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:01.159
and losing

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:05.090
the election

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.860
do you remember all those protesters in
washington who the cameras didn't cover

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.680
who were throwing things at president
george bush in two thousand so much of

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.400
the president uh... uh bush couldn't do
it every other president had done before

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.250
him but had to sort of essentially stay
in his car and couldn't walk down

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.259
to the united nation

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.479
one can only imagine

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.360
what would happen uh... if this is the
case

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.039
and uh...

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.529
david atkins ever hola ballooned

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:38.159
is suggesting the republicans are having
to adopt more and more of these things

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.969
we talked ari berman about

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.489
the republican plan to disenfranchise
uh... democratic voters the systemic

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:47.030
plan

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.689
uh...

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:51.389
because

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.560
demographically they know they're in big
trouble

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.649
in the future

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:59.250
so they must disenfranchise as many

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.519
people

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:01.400
as they can

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.430
and this is just one of the ways in
which they do it

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.199
dance
