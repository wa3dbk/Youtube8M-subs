00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.500
The way stars live and die makes a lot of sense if you consider what a star really is.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.000
Simply put, a star is a large amount of gas and dust that is collapsing under the force of gravity.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
At first, this crush of gravity makes the inside of the star hot enough to ignite a nuclear explosion.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This explosion supports the star against gravity and makes it shine.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In our Sun's case, this stage will last for about ten billion years.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But eventually, all the nuclear fuel inside the star (mostly hydrogen and helium) gets used up.

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:55.367
After that, there's nothing to support gravity .   So once again, the star starts collapsing.

00:00:55.367 --> 00:01:04.000
What happens next depends on how much mass the star had in the beginning and which forces of nature can finally hold up to the crush of gravity.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.500
With stars about the size of our Sun, gravity will crush everything tightly together.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.000
But eventually the structure of the star's atoms will hold up gravity.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Those stars like our Sun will become white dwarf stars.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.500
A white dwarf is basically a big, dying cinder about the size of the Earth

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.000
and with a density of an 18-wheel truck crushed into the volume of a sugar cube.

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:33.834
If a star is just a bit more massive than the Sun, not even the structure of the star's atoms can hold up against gravity

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:37.300
and everything gets crushed into one giant atomic nucleus.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.300
This forms a "neutron star" which is about ten miles across and has a density of a Mount Everest per sugar cube.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.000
If the star is much more massive than the Sun - say about three times more massive - then nothing can hold up to the force of gravity.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.800
The star collapses right out of existence, and becomes a bottomless pit that we call a "black hole."

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.300
Nothing can escape the gravity of a black hole.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.834
In fact, the reason we call them "black" is that the gravity is so intense it can actually pull in light itself.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:18.000
So, the final death of a star depends on its mass, and what, if anything, can stand up to that final crush of gravity that began even before the star started to shine.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.500
