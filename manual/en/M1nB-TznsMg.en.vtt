Hi, I'm Sophie and welcome to my world. I'm gonna teach you today how to make

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:12.230
a simple piece of wax paper into a
ghouly,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.740
ghostly sight. It's really simple,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.210
really easy and really inexpensive and
you can make a whole bunch of these

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.960
hang them from the trees and create
spooky spooky effect next Halloween

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.240
watch what I mean.  So, for this craft

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.509
you're really not gonna need too much. You're gonna need a piece of wax paper

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.590
and this wax paper is about 18 inches
long. You're gonna need a piece of string

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.090
you can make this as long as you like
here but I've made mine about two feet

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.470
long

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.870
maybe a little bit longer and then you
are going to need

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.120
a sharpie marker or indelible marker. One that can write

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.880
and stay on something like wax paper.
And you need a pair of scissors.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.880
that's all you need so what I'm gonna do here is I'm going to take my wax paper and I'm gonna

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.660
cut off about six inches here

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.479
just like that.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.549
Now don't worry you don't have to get
tense about measuring anything this is

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.100
really

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.170
very very very free-form and the more
of these that you make

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.709
the more free-form you'll get with them. So, I'm just going to take this little piece here

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:22.909
and I'm going to squish it up make it into a little ball

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.789
then I take this little ball and stick it
right dead center

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.229
of my wax paper fold up the edges

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.380
like I'm wrapping a piece of candy

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.780
give this a little twist.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.940
So I put in the center

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.990
gave it a little twist now I have the start

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.710
of my little ghosty I'm gonna take my
string gonna wrap it around its neck

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.030
and just give it a little tie. Now if
you want to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.119
you can use monofilament or fishing line

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.490
and you won't even see this when you
hang it up it will really make it look

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.200
ghostly.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.479
I'm going to just put that string around
there and tie it twice

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.959
just a little knot and I'm gonna cut off all the little extra there.

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.510
so that's the back of the head I'm gonna
flip him over and now

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.950
I'm going to open him up there

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.550
looks a little bit like Batman see
that v-shape. I'm gonna take the arms

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.190
and give them a little twist so all I've
done here

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.330
here's your "V" squeeze that in

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:42.920
and twist. You can shape this any way you
want to make its hands

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.630
he can be like a hook hand monster. Go
to the other side

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.640
same thing squeeze

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.019
twist and

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:01.480
if you want to see I'm going to roll this
hand down gives it more of a hand-like a

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.829
look

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.930
this one he's got the hook hand here he's
got the little hand just a regular hand

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.140
and now I have to give him a face. I'm just
gonna take my

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.860
Sharpie marker here and I'm going to give him a very

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.299
ghouly face.  I'm going to give him some eyes, a screaming mouth

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.820
he's going to be a, he's going to be a moaning

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.230
ghostie.  Like Moaning Myrtle from Harry Potter

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.700
Here, since it's Moaning Myrtle I'll give her some eyelashes

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.090
and glasses.  Doesn't she have glasses?

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.459
I'll give her some glasses.

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.900
Really that's all there is to it

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.019
you can see you can make them in all
different sizes and shapes like here is a

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:51.849
little friend

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.140
who has a tiny little

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.360
head and there you have it it's as
simple as that

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.480
so you see you can make a whole bunch and hang them in front of your house from your

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.870
porch from the trees

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:13.790
the best thing is when the wind gets
them they float around like real ghosts

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.370
it's a really neat terrifying effect
late at night

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.019
for more really fun really simple and
recycled crafts
