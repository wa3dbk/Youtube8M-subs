Hi! My name is Elizabeth and on behalf of
Expert Village, we’re going to begin a series

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.059
now talking about embossing in card making.
In this series, we will talk about the different

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.420
ways to emboss, the different tools that are
used, and generally how embossing can enhance

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.140
the cards that you are making. I’m going
to show a few examples of cards that have

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.800
had embossing done to them to give you an
idea of what you can do when using embossing.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.910
This card here, you may not even be able to
tell, but what they did with this card was

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.050
a clear embossing on black cardstock. It just
adds a little shine to this stamp that they

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:53.980
were putting on the card here. This card here,
using the metallic papers, they used a silver

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.370
embossing powder. Embossing, if you don’t
know, adds not only shine but it raises. So

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.680
it adds a little texture to the card that
you are making. This card here is a fun use

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.259
of using white embossing powder. This was
a lined stamp that they used. They used white

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.659
embossing powder, and then on the other side
of the vellum, they went in with chalk and

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:27.280
colored it in. So, the embossing was actually
the lines for the coloring book if you will.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.149
This one here is similar; it’s silver embossing.
The words have silver embossing and then the

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:39.249
flowers were actually aligned stamp, so the
outside lining of the flowers is embossed

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:46.399
and then they took a marker and colored in
the stamp itself. This one again is embossing

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.929
on vellum. Embossing on vellum takes a little
practice, and we’ll talk about that in a

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.969
later segment, but they used a solid stamp
gold embossing powder right on the vellum.

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:04.270
Then this one’s fun one, they took a silver
metallic cardstock, and then took silver embossing

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.360
powder and embossed the image of the chapel
right there on the silver cardstock, as well

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.470
as the embossed word stamp on the side. Many
fun uses for embossing to add a real layer

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.070
of class, of shine, of texture to your cards.
