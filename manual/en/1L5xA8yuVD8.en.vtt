00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.600
A Bermuda Triangle in Space sounds so ridiculous
it’s like a bad sci fi movie.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.930
Of course there isn’t one.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:06.930
In Bermuda.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.900
It’s over South America.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.600
Hey there everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.190
You’ve likely heard of Bermuda Triangle
in Space by this point but in case you haven’t,

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.360
it’s an area spanning from Bermuda to Florida
and Puerto Rico.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.940
It’s an area where supposedly ships and
airplanes disappear for no obvious reason,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.650
and the culprits are said to be aliens or
a “vile vortex” or “Devil’s Graveyard”

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.750
or something equally ridiculous.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.620
The truth is the reports of lost ships and
planes in this region are often greatly exaggerated

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.290
and can usually be attributed to mundane reasons.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.030
Sometimes storms sink ships, guys, nothing
super spooky going on here.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.649
But there is a place in space where space
station computers crash, optical telescopes

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.140
can’t function, and satellites shut down.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.219
Because of the eery similarities, the region
has been dubbed by some the “Bermuda Triangle

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.629
of Space,” but there are a few key differences.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.590
As stated, its edge starts about three thousand
kilometers south of Bermuda, so a more accurate

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.909
but less snappy name is the “South Atlantic
Anomaly.”

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.549
Then there’s the fact that all the incidents
are well documented and have a scientific

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.549
explanation.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.300
The South Atlantic Anomaly was first discovered
in 1958, and is tied to the existence of the

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.450
Van Allen Radiation Belts that were discovered
the same year.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.959
These belts are ring shaped areas of charged
particles from the solar wind or cosmic rays

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:22.599
that the magnetosphere has trapped.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:26.409
The outer ring is mostly high energy electrons,
while the inner belt is electrons and high

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.810
energy protons.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.569
These protons would strip electrons from atoms
so they’re harmful to humans in high enough

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:32.569
doses.

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.719
They also can mess with electronics that aren’t
properly shielded.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.079
Luckily the closest the inner belt usually
gets to earth is about 1,000 kilometers, so

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.289
if you stay inside that, you’re good.

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.270
But over Brazil, the inner lip of that belt
gets much closer to earth, as low as 200 kilometers.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.229
A ground-dweller would never know the difference,
but space stations and satellites fly right

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.000
through it and are exposed to all those charged
particles.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.639
At low inclination orbits they’d go through
it up to seven times a day.

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:58.990
When it was first discovered, the radiation
levels weren’t enough to endanger humans

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.020
or equipment.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.739
Since then technology has gotten smaller and
more sensitive, and the Anomaly has become

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:05.529
an unsafe place for electronics.

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:09.310
Even though the ISS has extra shielding because
it has to pass through the Van Allen Belt,

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.670
laptops on board are still prone to crashing.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.590
The Hubble Space Telescope will not take observations
when passing through it to avoid damaging

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.099
its delicate sensors.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.299
And in 2010 the radiation disabled most of
an Air Force satellite, rendering it an $833

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.670
million piece of space junk until it could
be fixed with a software patch...

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.170
Almost two years later.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.319
Apparently who ever patched that was then
hired to fix Assassin’s Creed Unity for

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.640
the PC, BOOM!

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.590
Yes I’m still mad about that, Ubisoft.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.060
Anyway, the reason the Van Allen Belt’s
edge is so close to Earth there is because

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.030
they have Earth’s magnetic poles as their
axis, but Earth rotates around another axis,

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.900
which is why your compass’ north is not
technically pointing to true north.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.819
That difference in axes means the Earth is
leaning towards the belt and South America

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.430
has a bunch of radiation hanging out right
above it.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.370
But it moves 34 kilometers east every year,
so in a century it’ll be a problem whenever

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.170
satellites pass over Namibia.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.829
And then both titles of “Space Bermuda Triangle”
and “South American Anomaly” won’t make

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:04.829
sense.

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.010
So these Van Allen Belts are spinning around
and are caused by magnetic fields which are

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.400
caused by our spinning iron core, but why
is everything in space spinning all the time?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:25.409
Trace talks about that here.

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.170
Space is a crazy place and there’s always
more to discover there.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.129
