00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:06.401
Namaskar

00:00:06.426 --> 00:00:08.426
Welcome to Nishamadhulika.com

00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:11.830
Today we'll make Rose Water
(Gulab Jal)

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.890
Rose water is easily available

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:16.915
in the markets,

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:18.917
is cheap as well,

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:23.137
but in some places, it isn't available.

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.788
In such places, you'll have
to make your own.

00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:30.934
So let us begin.

00:00:31.768 --> 00:00:33.197
The ingredients are:

00:00:34.053 --> 00:00:34.801
Rose Petals

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:36.805
and water.

00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:39.696
You'll need this cauldron

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.167
in which we'll place a net,

00:00:42.853 --> 00:00:44.758
and place rose petals on it;

00:00:45.488 --> 00:00:47.053
then a smaller utensil,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.325
in which we'll collect
the rose water

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.200
and we'll place the lid upside down,

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:57.366
so that the steam 
condenses into the utensil.

00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:00.991
This is the cauldron

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.059
we'll place the net in it;

00:01:04.346 --> 00:01:07.135
and we've placed 
the rose petals on it.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.483
For making One Cup Rose Water,

00:01:17.923 --> 00:01:19.556
we'll add Two Cup water.

00:01:34.264 --> 00:01:36.645
We'll place the utensil on the net;

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:41.077
and now we'll place the lid;

00:01:41.516 --> 00:01:43.693
and now we'll turn on the flame.

00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:53.880
The set-up is being heated  by the flame;

00:01:54.288 --> 00:01:56.193
the water has begun boiling;

00:01:57.475 --> 00:02:00.332
now we'll place some ice cubes
on the lid

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:04.010
So that the steam gets condensed quickly,

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:05.709
and gets collected.

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:11.003
So within about 20 minutes

00:02:11.758 --> 00:02:13.731
our Rose Water will be ready.

00:02:14.573 --> 00:02:18.791
So after 20 minutes, we'll be able to
collect the rose water.

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:22.628
It is almost ready;

00:02:23.262 --> 00:02:26.527
we can see that the steam
is getting condensed.

00:02:27.812 --> 00:02:30.465
So we'll turn off the flame is a while;

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:32.586
and once it cools down,

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.781
we'll store it in a bottle.

00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:40.480
The rose water has cooled down,

00:02:41.854 --> 00:02:43.555
we'll keep the lid aside;

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.941
and will carefully take out the utensil.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.909
and will collect the rose water 
in a bottle.

00:03:18.123 --> 00:03:20.096
You may use it in any recipe,

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.403
or for medicinal purpose;

00:03:23.043 --> 00:03:24.540
