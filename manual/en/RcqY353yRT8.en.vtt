great people and well-known researchers worldwide.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:43.900
GONZALO: Curtin is nice, it's very friendly,
the atmosphere is not like a typical university.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.320
SILVIA: Over here I have found amazing
people and the students, my fellowships are

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.280

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.210
LAURA: Our discussions is like having international
discussions, you know like, with all the students,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.000
the professors, the research fellows.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.739
GONZALO: As a student we are always in contact with the teachers. I can talk with

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:11.700
them during the lectures and tutorials. Also
I can email them, they give me feedback really fast.

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.679
LAURA: We do research for the oil and gas industry,

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:22.539
and we know, most of the operators and oil and gas companies are based in Perth.

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.719
So we have a lot of industry support, industry funding.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:34.600
GONZALO: I can interact with students from other countries. And they are professionals,

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.900
some of them working in oil upstream industries.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.350
LAURA: So, the facilities here are unbelievable.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.350
We're talking about twenty- thirty million
dollar facilities, like equipment that you

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:58.600
haven't seen before and that you never expect to be able to use on a daily basis.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.950
SILVIA: Yeah, I definitely believe that making overseas studies will definitely help me.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.670
In my own place, to get new facilities,
new jobs, new opportunities.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.670
LAURA: My PhD was not only grown in term
of you know, science and knowledge but also

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:26.500
like interacting with other people on an international
level. Like going to conferences around the world.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.930
GONZALO: The amount of students that arrive

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:39.300
here to study a Master of Petroleum Engineering is high. And that's good because, it makes

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:46.600
me more comfortable because I can see that
the university is well-recognised internationally.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.600
LAURA: I realised what a big opportunity
to grow and at this point I just see for the

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.100
past five years how different I am.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.500
