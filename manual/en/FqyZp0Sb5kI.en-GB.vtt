00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:02.230
Automatically translated by machine. Good
morning!

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.900
And welcome to another edition of Morning
Make Up where I do my make up and we chat.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:33.890
Today's look is a little bit vintage.
Starting with foundation first as usual.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.370
Next a generous coating of mascara.
When James and I used to go to a lot of Rockabilly

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.481
gigs I did my make up like this a lot.
It was pretty much my go to look.

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:49.100
Coat the whole lid all the way up to the brow
with white shimmer shadow.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.519
It's quite simple to do as long as you have
the hang of liquid liner and lip liner.

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.620
A lot of people are scared of red lipstick
but once you know how to handle it, it's not

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:08.150
that scary.
Take a shimmery dark brown shadow and draw

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.050
on a wing. Continue the line around the eye
so it forms a pointed "C" shape over the top

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:21.150
of the eye.
Just draw the line, don't fill it in.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.310
This line creates depth and the higher you
put it, the deeper your eyes will look.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:42.600
Just make sure both sides match.
Take a fluffing brush and lightly blend it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.030
all.
Don't blend too much because you don't want

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.480
to completely blur the line.
I miss going to see Rockabilly bands, we used

00:01:50.480 --> 00:02:00.310
to dance all the time!
Draw a thick line of liquid liner and wing

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.320
it out.
I find liquid liner easiest to use when it's

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.480
got a felt tip.
Rather than drawing it on you can just dot

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.969
it in place until it forms a line.
The line should start thin in the inner corner

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:25.069
and get thicker at the outside.
The felt tip is useful for making a perfect

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.810
wing too because you can just press it in
place to make the flick.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:42.760
Then just fill in any gaps.
Easy done and much easier than trying to control

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.560
a proper brush.
Make sure to lean on something solid like

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.030
a table so your hand isn't wobbly!
If you need to, you can also pull the eyelid

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:05.510
skin tight while you do this to keep it steady.
Taadaa, easy!

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.290
Add some feathery false lashes.
My favorite part of going to rockabilly gigs

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:20.129
was watching the older couples dance, so cute!
Line your lips with a bright red lip liner.

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:30.189
I always start in the middle top and bottom
and work my way out to the edge.

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.329
Rather than big lines, use small feathery
strokes and go slowly.

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.549
We used to go dancing almost every weekend.
Rockabilly gigs are great for dancing because

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.379
everyone is so friendly!
A lot of the 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.790
people who attended in our area had been listening
to the music since they were kids too.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:04:01.249
Fill in the lips with liner.
This is much easier than doing the edges.

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:08.180
I think most of the bands we used to see are
broken up now, so sad.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.799
The best top I have for lips is to smile while
you apply liner.

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.470
You can see the finished shape as you go and
it's easier to draw with the lips pulled tight

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.610
like this.
Apply a thin coat of red lipstick.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.580
The lip liner base will make the lipstick
last much longer.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.050
Add a tiny bit of blush.
This is definitely a look you need to wear

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.050
out dancing!

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.860
I love shiny lips so I added a little lip
gloss too.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.360
Matte red lips are very beautiful with this
style though.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.510
All done.
A look like this isn't completely without

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.410
the matching hair.
Link to the hair tutorial in the description!

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.230
Definitely goes with it a little better than
my bathrobe does.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.380
I hope this was a useful video. Please check
out the blog post linked in the description

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.880

Thanks so much for watching!

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.350
Bye!
