00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.980
In 
a previous video I used a modified Microwave
Oven Transformer as an electrical metal melter.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.620
In this video you'll learn step by step how
it was made, and what I'm using it for now.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.960
In a previous project, I found an old microwave
in a dumpster and hacked it open to see what

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.690
components I could salvage. This power transformer
was one of my favorites, and got used in many

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.050
other projects, like high voltage electrical
arcs, making a homemade stick welder, and

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.850
melting metal. In it's current condition,
the transformer produces a deadly high voltage

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.350
that's enough to kill a person on contact.
But it won't melt metal. To do that, we have

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.199
to modify the transformer by rewinding the
coils. Looking at the sides of this transformer,

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.829
you can see that these shallow welds are the
only thing holding this together. I'm gonna

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.189
use my bench vice to secure this in place
with one end of the welded sides facing up,

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.990
and try using a hacksaw to cut it open. This
is a fairly weak weld, and a hacksaw will

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.409
work, but a quick buzz with an angle grinder
works a lot better. Now that that's ground

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.909
off, a hammer and chisel can be used to crack
the gap and pry the pieces apart. The rest

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.479
can be removed by hand. With the bottom off,
I've got access to the 3 coils of wire wrapped

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.759
around the core. The top coil is the primary
winding and I want to take very good care

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.359
of that, so I've wrapped a cloth over my chisel
to protect it as I pry up on the winding.

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.189
It's in there pretty snug, but prying it slowly
and gently from both sides gets it to the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.380
point where I can put the chisels down and
pull it off by hand. These metal shunts can

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.520
get knocked out now, and amazingly, this is
the only form of current limiting this transformer

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.390
has. The middle coil is junk, and it all comes
out. Then to get the secondary coil off, I'm

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.280
setting it with the coil resting on the jaws
of my vise, and then hitting the middle of

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.789
the core with a rubber hammer until the winding
is free. This got pretty beat up, but that's

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.659
ok because luckily I don't need it. A chisel
works great for scraping off any excess paper

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.400
and glue stuck on the sides, and now we've
got ourselves a naked transformer core. You're

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.700
looking at the "E" and "I" sections of the
core, and at this point we're ready to reinstall

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.480
our primary coil. This coil has about 100
turns of insulated copper wire, and needs

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.590
to be replaced gently to avoid damaging it,
or scraping the wires. That's why I'm using

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.980
a rubber hammer so I can still get it in nice
and tight. OK, it's looking like it's supposed

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.150
to, so now we can add a secondary winding
made from this thick 2 gauge copper cable.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.800
I was lucky and got this from a scrap pile
my brother had at work. Looking inside, you

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.300
can see it's made of stranded copper wire,
insulated by a thick rubber coating. My brother

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.680
got me a heavy duty copper lug, and crimped
it in place on the end of the cable. Next,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.220
he added a little shrink-wrap to protect the
connection, and hit it with a heat gun to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.660
shrink it down and finish it off. Alright,
so with the cable bent in half, I can move

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.250
it up next to the transformer and tuck it
down into the gaps. The wire's so thick it's

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.510
a pretty tight fit and probably couldn't be
any bigger. I'm pulling one end of the cable

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.370
back around the transformer, and I decided
to switch the positions of these two so that

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.150
it forms more of an ascending coil. Now I
can press the other side into place, and the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.640
secondary coil is wrapped, as easy as that.
The last step is to put this back together.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.870
I don't have anything to re-weld the seems
I broke apart, so I'm going to try using this

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.800
2 part epoxy glue to see if I can make it
work. Both the components get mixed equally,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.200
then I'll add the glue to all the exposed
surfaces at the top here, and find a way to

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.150
clamp this down. It turns out my bench vise
has a gap wide enough to fit the entire assembly,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.660
and after double checking the alignment on
the connection, I'll synch it up tight. I'm

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.550
adding the leftover glue to the gaps on the
edges and everything is looking as expected,

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.110
so that can be left to set. Ok, it's 2 hours
later, and our modification is complete! There's

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.820
actually no physical connection between the
two coils, yet this will pump out around 800

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.070
amps! To bench-test the device, I'm carefully
hooking clips to both leads of the primary

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.680
winding, and then adding power. Using my multimeter
I'm showing just over 2 volts now, which is

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.110
a lot lower than the 1000 volts this used
to throw out. But instead of putting out 1

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.210
amp, now I'm getting closer 800!! What can
you do with that many amps? I thought it would

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.930
be fun to try melting some metal, which you
can see this does easily. The metal melts

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.560
because its not as conductive as copper wire.
It acts like a resistor, and heats up from

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.600
the electrical friction until it reaches its
melting point. Or until the insulation on

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.010
the lead wires melt and the system shorts
out. Well not only was this a fun modification,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.770
but I found a practical application for it
in making a spot welder like this one. The

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.150
high current can be directed to fuse sheets
of metal together at one precise location.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.580
Look for how to make that in another project.
Well now you know how to build the metal melter.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.240
