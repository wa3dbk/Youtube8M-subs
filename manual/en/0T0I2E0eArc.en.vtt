[Background chatter]

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.410
CHARACTER: This place is my father's legacy 
that he left to me...

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.600
...I'm doing my best to keep us afloat.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.900
NARRATOR: Enlighten...

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.800
CHARACTER: There's like a long period of time 
where I felt so young...

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.610
...I was like stuck being young.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.600
NARRATOR: Enrage...

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.000
NARRATOR: They can be participatory...

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.100
...performative..

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.800
...poetic.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.710
Documentaries change the way
we view the world around us...

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.149
CHARACTER: It was a way of connecting

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.900
me and my sister 
with the family that she had lost...

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
her mother, her father, her sisters, her brother...

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200
...nearly everyone that she loved in the world.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.300
NARRATOR:
...and transform the way we see ourselves.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.590
CHARACTER: Don't let one moment...

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.900
not even one breath go by...

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.600
without some sort of appreciation of it.

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.020

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.940
 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.380
NARRATOR:
Since 2004, Docs In Progress has been providing

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.790
opportunities for documentary filmmakers

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.350
to be immersed in an environment
where they can explore the art

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.610
of cinematic storytelling,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.860
and have the freedom to make films

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.880
that reflect a diverse range

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.130
of topics and viewpoints.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.870
Operating out of the iconic "Doc House"
nestled in the heart of Silver Spring, Maryland,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.650
Docs In Progress creates and fosters

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.010
a supportive environment for documentary filmmakers,

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.300
and offers a rich array of programs to help

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.600
develop, encourage, and 
celebrate fresh and seasoned

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.800
voices in the art of documentary film.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.600
Docs In Progress cultivates a collaborative community

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.600
that encourages and inspires new levels of creativity.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.700
At the core of the organization's mission

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.400
is education, mentoring, and sharing knowledge.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.400
There is something for everyone here.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.600
Signature programs and community events 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.000
support filmmakers throughout the various stages of their creative and production process.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.500
The Peer Pitch, 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.900
The Roundtable, the Fellows,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.400
and Work-in-Progress Screenings

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.580
offer valuable feedback 
from audience members and other filmmakers

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.360
in a nurturing, constructive, and moderated setting.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.300
And Community Stories is a multi-day film experience.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.800
It gives filmmakers a way

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.200
to connect to their local community

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.100
through telling short stories spotlighting 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.200
local people, places, and events

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.000
in and around their communities.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.600
This all started when Erica Ginsberg and Adele Schmidt wanted a place where local filmmakers

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.000
could get and give feedback on each other's documentary works-in-progress.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.400
 So, over a dinner in 2004

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.100
-- and in true Hollywood fashion --

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.000
the two filmmakers wrote down the seeds of their idea

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.600
on a napkin.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.100
"Docs In Progress"

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.300
By the end of the year, they were
providing Works-in-Progress Screenings

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.400
at The Documentary Center

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.900
and one-on-one story consultations.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
In 2007, 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.200
Sam Hampton contacted 
Adele and Erica for a film consultation.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.200
Eager to move Docs In Progress to the next level,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.600
they ended up trading their advice on filmmaking

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.800
for Sam's guidance on setting up a nonprofit.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.000
And the rest, as they say, is history.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.200
Over the past decade, literally thousands
in the filmmaking community

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.400
have been influenced by Docs In Progress.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.200
Docs In Progress has been changing the
landscape of documentary film

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.300
in the DC area and beyond

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.400
with many more stories to come.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.800
And their story is just beginning.
