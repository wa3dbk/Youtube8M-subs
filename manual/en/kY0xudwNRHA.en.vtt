00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.570
Hello, and welcome to "Is it a Good Idea 
 to Microwave This?" I'm your host, Jory Caron.

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:20.544
We know water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. And we know 
 balloons pop- that's common sense. This is a water balloon.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:28.756
So, what happens when you put it in the microwave? Water-boiling steam explosions?!

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:30.996
*theme song plays*

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.796
Jory: Let's go roast some nuts!

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.929
Jory: And, as always, our Sharp microwave!

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.399
Jory: It's never a good idea, unless you want an explosion!

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.401
Jory: Stopping, stopping!

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.769
Jory: Safety is our number-one concern.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.137
Jon: Wow! That's a lotta smoke!

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:40.684
Jory: The masks- they do nothing!

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.440
Jory: We also hide behind this big tin foil shield. Nobody likes roasted nuts!

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.177
Ezra: Is it a good idea?

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:46.945
Jory: (laughs) Absolutely!

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.780
Jory: Is it a good idea to microwave this?

00:00:50.062 --> 00:01:01.062
Let's find out! I'm curious, too! Safety is one of the concerns that we 
have. That's why we have this tin foil shield... Which is falling apart...

00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:05.716
Cut it- I'll just...

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:28.041
Okay! Let's enter the laboratory, shall we? It's okay! It's double-sided, 
 to REALLY protect our nuts, because nobody likes roasted nuts!

00:01:29.443 --> 00:01:36.443
We also have this fan here, to circulate the air, and, 
 as always... (pauses in quiet reflection) Our Sharp carousel microwave...

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.630
Did you see what I did there? I kind of gave it a 
moment of silence. I wasn't really thinking of Sandra right there...

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.400
Jon: You were thinking of Diane!

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:48.240
No, I was thinking of Helga, actually! It was 
 just a special moment that we shared!

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.870
Jon: She's so big and powerful!

00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:53.300
Jory: She's captured MY heart, that's for sure! So, in goes the balloon.

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:56.510
Jon: Of water!

00:01:55.515 --> 00:02:00.520
Jory: It's, like, sticking to the glass plate, probably 
 from the shaving cream that we did.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:03.820
Jory: So, I wonder how long it should go in there for?

00:02:04.877 --> 00:02:06.880
Jon: I would... Just do five, just in case!

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:08.530
Jory: Okay! Five minutes!

00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:11.030
Jon: Five minutes! Now, look- we're not lying! The display works!

00:02:11.518 --> 00:02:22.520
Jory: It actually says "5:00" and not "Hey! Hey!" How long is it in there for? "Hey!" And 
 then, when it dropped past a minute, it didn't even tell us what time it was!

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:25.580
[Beep]in' bitch! You're gonna have to edit that out!

00:02:28.236 --> 00:02:30.240
Jory: Okay! Let's get outta there!

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:37.450
Jory: Notice how I'm ducking right now. I'm trying to avoid the beams of death! Although, 
it comes through... Shut up, viewers! I hate you, I hate all of you!

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.640
Jon: We put our face right where there's no shielding!

00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:42.910
Jon: But it's not about protecting our eyes!

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.830
It's about protecting our nuts!

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:49.500
Jon: That's right! Okay, it is spinning, and it hasn't exploded.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.270
Jory: I'm guessing three minutes would boil something this size, 
three-and-a-half minutes would make it explode. That's my prediction.

00:02:57.447 --> 00:03:07.450
Jory: See? I'm doin' this new thing now where I predict what you guys are gonna say! I'm guessing one 
of you is thinking: "Why a green balloon? Why not a red balloon that I pictured in my head?"

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:18.020
In this country, balloons are created equally! I have a dream that a green
 balloon and a red balloon will explode at the same exact time!

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:22.330
Jon: Here's the irony, though- the water comes from separate water fountains!

00:03:23.825 --> 00:03:28.820
That's brutal! My prediction passed, I'm sorry, folks. I failed miserably...

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:30.540
Jon: It looks bigger than it did before!

00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:32.810
Jory: Oh, yeah! The top part is definitely...

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.080
Jon: Oh! Here it comes! Here it comes, dude!

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:37.950
Jory: Aw! If only we had put it in there for, like, another minute!

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:40.020
Jon: It's almost there!

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.920
Jory: Come on! Oh, it's a race against time!

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.060
Jon: 14 seconds left...

00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:46.350
*balloon pops*

00:03:45.187 --> 00:03:47.190
Jory: Oh! It did! It did it!

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.790
Jon: Awesome!

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:52.260
Jon: With only five seconds left on the clock!

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:54.160
Jory: I'm gonna kill it.

00:03:53.546 --> 00:03:55.550
Okay, let's open this bad boy up!

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.070
Jon: Yup, that's a lotta steam! But it's just water! That's okay to inhale!

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:08.000
Jory: I'm so dumb right now! I know that, in order for that balloon to expand, this water would 
have had to have been boiling. Now, I'm just reaching in there with pretty much my bare hands!

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:14.280
Jory: Look at all this steam coming out right now! 'Cause that's what 
 we do here at "Is it a Good Idea to Microwave This?"

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:16.390
Jon: We turn water into a gas!

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.860
Jory: That is a LOT of water! 

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:21.360
Jon: You filled the balloon up! What do you expect?! 
Did you think it was just gonna go somewhere?!

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:23.460
Jory: Aaugh! That's BOILING water!

00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:25.180
Jon: You didn't think this one through, did ya?

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:27.300
Listen, my PRODUCERS didn't think this one through, okay?

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.440
Jon: Hey! YOU suggested it!

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.570
I'm just talent! Talent's dumb! I'm dumb!

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:34.400
Jon: You folks at home- you're the ones who suggested this!

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:43.840
Well, you may be wondering, is it a good idea to 
 microwave water balloons? I'm gonna say "yes." This is why!
70
00:04:43,95 --&gt; 00:04:40,95
Jon: I was gonna say... 'Cause, to me, it seemed like it created a 
big pool of boiling-hot water, but if that's a good idea to you...

00:04:50.342 --> 00:05:01.340
Yeah, but you know, like, where there's smoke, there's fire? Where there's 
boiling-hot water, there's steam. What cleans a microwave? A steambath! Duh!

00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:11.740
I mean, Helga was never that dirty, but look at her 
 walls right now! Cleaner than Sandra, cleaner than Diane? Absolutely!

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:16.680
That's about it for "Is it a Good Idea 
to Microwave This?" I'm your host, Jory Caron.

00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:22.820
