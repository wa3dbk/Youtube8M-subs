00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.719
Hello, and welcome to Wireless Emporium's
informational Series. Today I'm going to talk

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.980
all about batteries. They say that at about
a year after using the same battery in your

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.930
phone you will start to notice that your battery
doesn't hold a charge as well and will slowly

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.710
get worse and worse, so you are going to need
a new battery. But a lot of people don't know

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.810
how to choose the right battery for your phone,
so I am going to give you some tips on how

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.489
to pick the right one
When shopping for a new battery you will notice

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.469
that there are some batteries that are labeled
"OEM" and some that are not. You will also

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.670
notice the significant price difference between
the two. Most people assume that since the

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.149
OEM batteries are more expensive, they are
much higher quality batteries, but this isn't

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.550
necessarily the case. OEM stands for Original
Equipment Manufacturer, so when looking at

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.210
batteries, you will see the specific brand
name like "Motorola" or "Samsung" or "Blackberry".

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.610
These are the batteries your phone originally
comes with and Just like any other product

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.330
you buy, you have to decide whether you want
to pay for the slightly overpriced quality

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.920
brand name item, or the much cheaper but slightly
lesser quality generic item.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.850
Milliamps an hour is the unit for measuring
the total amount of energy a battery can store

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.560
at a time, or more simply, how long your battery
will last you. When you are looking at batteries,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.420
you will probably see a bunch of confusing
numbers, but this is the rating that really

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.640
matters. Keep in mind that this isn't a measurement
of time, it really depends on how often you

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.340
are using your phone and how you are using
it. But you can compare this rating with one

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.710
of your original batteries, so that you can
get a better feel of how much battery life

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.880
you are going to get . For example, if your
original battery is 800 mAh and the replacement

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.310
battery you choose is 900 mAh, you can expect
that this battery will give you more battery

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.230
life than the original one.
Extended batteries are batteries that have

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.550
a much higher mAh rating so they will give
you significantly more battery life for your

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.890
cell phone, sometimes it's even double. But
remember that the physical size of the battery

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.920
is going to be slightly larger than your original
battery, so you will need an extended door

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.950
in order for the extended battery to fit.
Some extended batteries come with this door,

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.610
but some of them do not so it' s something
to take into consideration when purchasing

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.790
an extended battery.
If you receive your battery and the charge

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.120
is not holding as well as it should be, you
might need to cycle the battery. This is a

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.050
technique used on many types of batteries
in order to prolong the life of the battery.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.260
The process is simple, all you have to do
is use your phone until it is completely dead

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.940
and turns off, then charge the battery overnight
or until the power is at 100%. Then repeat

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.709
this about 3 or 4 times. If you do not cycle
the battery sometimes the lithium battery

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.410
might lose its ability fully recharge.
So that's all you need to know when you go

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.610
to purchase a replacement or extended battery
for your phone. If you have any questions
