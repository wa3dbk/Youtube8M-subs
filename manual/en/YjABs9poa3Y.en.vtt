ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the Bert
and Ernie Christmas special,

00:00:04.385 --> 00:00:09.676
starring Tony Sirico as Bert,
and Steve Schirripa as Ernie.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.780
TONY SIRICO: Uh,
uh, oh, Ernie.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.620
What the heck is sticking out
of your ear, over there?

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.280
BERT: Cut!

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.790
Cut, cut, cut, cut.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.266
TONY SIRICO: What?

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:17.742
What?

00:00:17.742 --> 00:00:21.830
BERT: Mr. Sirico, that
was all wrong.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.960
You're supposed to say, hey,
Ernie, do you know that you

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.820
have a gingerbread
man in your ear?

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.800
TONY SIRICO: I am?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.166
BERT: That's what
the script says.

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.630
TONY SIRICO: Not to worry.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.960
My good friend, I
can handle this.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.290
BERT: Great.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.730
Let's take it from the top.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.314
Gingerbread man!

00:00:38.314 --> 00:00:40.370
PRAIRIE DAWN:: Gingerbread
man!

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.150
STEVE SCHIRRIPA: Thanks,
Prairie.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.400
PRAIRIE DAWN:: No problem.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.533
BERT: And action.

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.886
TONY SIRICO: Hey Ernie.

00:00:49.886 --> 00:00:52.030
You know that you have a
gingerbread man in your ear.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.110
STEVE SCHIRRIPA: Yeah, I know.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.220
Want a bite?

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.390
TONY SIRICO: Want a bite?

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.790
Do I look like I want a taste
of your wax frosting to you?

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.220
ERNIE: [GASP]

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.902
Cut!

00:01:00.902 --> 00:01:02.870
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut,
cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.215
cut, cut, cut.

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:03.670
TONY SIRICO: What now?

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.870
ERNIE: Cut, cut, cut.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.400
Cut, cut, cut. cut, cut, cut.
cut, cut, cut. cut, cut, cut.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.000
cut, cut, cut.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.400
TONY SIRICO: Steve.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.085
STEVE SCHIRRIPA: Yeah, what's
up, Ernie, what's up?

00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:09.330
ERNIE: Um, you see, you're not
actually supposed to hear Bert

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.420
when he says you have a
gingerbread man in your ear.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.050
STEVE SCHIRRIPA: I'm not?

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.820
ERNIE: No.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.438
Gingerbread man!

00:01:14.438 --> 00:01:15.752
PRAIRIE DAWN:: Gingerbread
man.

00:01:15.752 --> 00:01:17.790
STEVE SCHIRRIPA: Oh, she gonna'
keep on doing that?

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.300
ERNIE: Uh, Prairie?

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.930
May I?

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.340
Could I just--

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.740
STEVE SCHIRRIPA: Sure.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.350
ERNIE: Yeah, watch this.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.740
STEVE SCHIRRIPA: Let me see.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.250
ERNIE: Hey Bert.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.140
Give me that line, will you?

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.560
BERT: Oh, right, right,
right, right.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.750
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.070
Hey, Ernie.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.200
Do you know you have a
gingerbread man in your ear?

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.110
ERNIE: What's that, Bert?

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.760
BERT: I said you have
a gingerbread man

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.870
in your ear, Ernie.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.970
ERNIE: What do you say, Bert?

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.490
BERT: There's a gingerbread
man in your ear!

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.400
ERNIE: I'm sorry, Bert
I can't hear you.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.075
There's a gingerbread
man in my ear.

00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:45.070
STEVE SCHIRRIPA: Oh, I get it.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.160
I get it now, Ernie.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.160
ERNIE: What?

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.850
STEVE SCHIRRIPA: I said
I get it now, Ernie.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.650
BERT: He gets it.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.330
ERNIE: Right, right.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.204
Gingerbread man!

00:01:52.204 --> 00:01:54.550
PRAIRIE DAWN:: Gingerbread
man.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.940
STEVE SCHIRRIPA: Oy.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.190
Again with the gingerbread
man.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.350
ERNIE: And action.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.720
STEVE SCHIRRIPA: I can't
hear you, Bert.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.865
I got a gingerbread man
stuck in my ear.

00:02:03.865 --> 00:02:05.715
Ha ha ha.

00:02:05.715 --> 00:02:08.169
ERNIE: Cut!

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.030
Steve, the Ernie laugh is
a bit more like this.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.480
[ERNIE LAUGH]

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.270
STEVE SCHIRRIPA:
Oh, like this.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.530
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.750
TONY SIRICO: No, what
are you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.770
It's like this.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.554
[ERNIE LAUGH]

00:02:20.554 --> 00:02:21.780
BERT: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.035
Please do not laugh like
Ernie, Mr. Sirico.

00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:25.410
TONY SIRICO: Well,
why not, Bert?

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.450
BERT: Because you're
playing me.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.210
The patented Bert laugh
goes like this.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.515
[BERT LAUGH]

00:02:31.515 --> 00:02:32.770
TONY SIRICO: What,
are you kidding?

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.525
I can do that.

00:02:33.525 --> 00:02:34.860
Ha ha ha ha.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.855
BERT: No, no, no, no.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:36.520
[BERT LAUGH]

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.026
STEVE SCHIRRIPA: [BERT LAUGH]

00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:39.610
ERNIE: Oh, no, no, no,
Steve, Steve, Steve.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.890
You have to stick with
[ERNIE LAUGH].

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.710
BERT: Yeah, and you do this.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.880
[BERT LAUGH]

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.155
ERNIE: And then you
go [ERNIE LAUGH]

00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:46.680
BERT: Yeah, don't
listen to him.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.680
[BERT LAUGH]

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.560
STEVE SCHIRRIPA: Tony, we got
to get ourselves out of this

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.270
gig, I'm telling you.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.210
I mean, what do we got to do?

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.420
TONY SIRICO: Well,
what do I know.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.122
Do I look like a writer?

00:02:54.122 --> 00:02:56.336
PRAIRIE DAWN:: Why don't
we just fade to black?

00:02:56.336 --> 00:02:58.380
STEVE SCHIRRIPA: That's
a good idea, Prairie.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.770
Fade to black!

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.750
TONY SIRICO: [BERT LAUGH]

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.325
Hey?

00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:03.460
Who turned out the lights?

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.710
ERNIE: [ERNIE LAUGH].

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.220
ANNOUNCER: We take you now to
Kermit the Frog for another

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.710
fast breaking news story.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.360
KERMIT: Oh, hi, hello, there.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.000
This is Kermit The Frog, and
today we've got some very

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.740
exciting news, because we're
about to have a chat with a

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.610
man who is one of the world's
most famous people.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.580
He is a man who travels
in a sleigh pulled

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.150
by eight tiny reindeer.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.700
Anybody out there know
who that is?

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.950
Hmm?
