00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:10.889
Hello everyone,

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.409
Here's a fun and entertaining pick up
and play game.

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:19.310
It's called ClayJam and basically, you
are a giant ball of clay,

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.339
in a world  that has now been taken over
by the Beardy Bluff.

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.529
The Beardy Bluff is a big creature who
doesn't like clay

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.139
basically, so the idea is we have to collect
up clay on the playing field to 

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:33.720
 build the biggest ball we can, to then
throw the clay at the Beardy

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.170
monstery ClayJam thing. 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.390
So, you trace on the screen, as you see
everything is done in claymation.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.860
It's really, really cool. You have to run over
these various clay creatures which you 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.960
actually unlock as you're going along and 
each ClayJam

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.140
creature

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.240
get the words out... each clay creature has
a particular weight to it, as it were, so

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.030
the bigger the creature the more clay I
collect up.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.820
You have to avoid certain objects or
you lose clay.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.250
Like those.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.840
And when we get to the end of this level
we'll get to fire

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.860
our large ball of clay at the Beardy
monster thing.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.620
Again, we have to avoid those, we'll just keep
going in a straight line at this point.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.270
The touch controls work really nicely and
the graphics are awesome, really, really fun.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.960
Right, here we go, now we have to build up
as fast as we can and try and

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.780
launch the Beardy monster thing as far
as possible. Ninety four metres.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.570
All the clay that I've actually picked up, I can
then use to make new monsters that appear

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.759
on the battlefield for me to roll over ClayJam.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.720
So if I come on to make I can then see
some new creatures. Let's have that one.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.950
Oops, hit his red nose to make one.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.330
Here we go, and this now joins the world field
and we play again.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.780
It's a sort of endless runner kind of game, so
it keeps going and you keep building up 
bigger and bigger balls

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.740
adding more creatures and so on

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.930
and hopefully. let's drop

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.740
power play in here.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.460
There are power-ups as well called power
plays and they do various things like

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.460
speed you up, slow things down, make your
ball bigger etcetera.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.459
There's one, let's grab that ClayJam.

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.899
As you can see, as I move on the screen,

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:19.399
a big ball of clay fire,

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:23.289
the clay actually goes in that direction 
and speeds up and slows down as

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:26.999
well depending on how fast you're moving
things. So you do have some quite good

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.249
control over it.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.569
Get the play boost.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.680
Boom! ClayJam

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.029
But just a really great little pick up
and play title, an original as well, really 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.899
love the art style they've come up with
the graphics are fantastic.

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:45.419
Just, what a cracker!

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:50.129
Up on the Play Store now.
