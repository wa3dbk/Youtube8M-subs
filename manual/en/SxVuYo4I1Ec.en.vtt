00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
As we were walking around FinCon in New Orleans

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.169
as we were walking around been kinda New
Orleans we got asked more than a handful

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.669
We got asked more than a handful of times

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:04.359
of times

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:07.259
what we recommend to get started with
video I told them there's three things

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:07.759
What we recommend to get started with video

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:09.440
that they need to take in consideration

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.570
the content of the videos the audio
quality of their videos

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.540
and the video quality of their videos
the order in which I rank those are

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.880
actually a little counterintuitive

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.939
I think content is the most important
but a close second is actually audio

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.400
quality believe it or not I think audio
quality and videos is more important

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.499
than video quality so

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.710
if pressed I would actually put more
money into a better microphone

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.690
then the camera itself to show why I say
that I have a couple examples so let's

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.100
go to the clips and then we'll talk
about it afterward

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.460
to this is an example love iPhone
quality video but with

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.840
a really high and audio this is a rode
nt1-a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.450
microphone running to the toft audio
design sound board which is about four

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.350
thousand dollars

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.960
the really nice leveling amp is the name of that compressor

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.020
and the whole computer setup so this is
an example of

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.120
really nice audio but with just okay
video quality

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.980
now here's the other extreme so this is
awesome video quality with really crappy

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.520
audio quality

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.689
we were recording the video with a Canon
C-one hundred which is a five thousand

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:05.179
dollar

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:09.179
body the lens on it is the L glass
1.2

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:14.079
f/stop: Canon 50mm so you're talking
about a sixty five hundred dollar camera

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:14.549
setup

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.679
but we're recording our audio through
the iPhone

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.710
you can be the judge yourself would you
rather watch really good video quality

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.280
but

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.659
poor audio or would you rather see okay
video

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.030
with good audio but we don't have spend
five thousand dollars on a camera or ten

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.829
thousand dollars on an audio studio to
get good quality YouTube videos in fact

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.179
it can be done for much less

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.719
the microphone I'm using for this clip is
two hundred dollars and the camera I'm using

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.359
is about a thousand dollars you can
actually get away with much cheaper

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:40.119
camera than that

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.520
since there is so much interest in this
from all these bloggers coming up to us we

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.030
actually decided we're gonna put
together a little video series

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.340
about how to make better YouTube videos so
that's something you're interested in

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.700
please be sure to subscribe

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.999
if you're not interested that's okay we still have a lot of other videos coming up on

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:57.130
Tuesdays Fridays and Sundays moving
forward thanks for watching and we'll

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.569
see you next time
