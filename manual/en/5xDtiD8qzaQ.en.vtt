Whatsup Guys,

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.200
We all heard about the iPhone 6 having NFC
which is gonna enable mobile payment. In this

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.020
video I'm gonna explain everything there is
to know about iPay, the new payment solution from Apple.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.680
First, let's start with the basics. What is
NFC?

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.560
NFC stands for Near Field Communication.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.080
It's a protocol that allows you to wireless
transfer data between devices. NFC has been

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.480
made standard by the NFC-Forum. This is a
company where Nokia, Sony and Philips are

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.730
part from.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.460
The NFC chip is also included in most of the
new smartphones from Samsung and HTC. It is

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.200
mostly used with NFC Tags. This tag can be
hidden inside a sticker, a card or a even

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.340
a key to open doors for example.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.829
So why is Apple so late to the party?

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.309
Well, in the first place. Apple chose to go
ahead with Bluetooth 4.0. It has a similar

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.899
functionality like NFC and can connect with
other Bluetooth enabled to iOS devices that

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.070
are close together. If the iPhone would be
near a payment device with bluetooth 4.0,

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.500
a payment could be done.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.420
This bluetooth solution between iOS devices
is called iBeacon. With iBeacon Apple has

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.240
a lot more options like locating the exact
position of the iOS device. Watch my video

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.950
about iBeacons if you want to learn more.
I'll put a link in the description below.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.979
So why is Apple so late to the party? I guess
it's because the market wasn't ready yet.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.900
A lot of banks, stores and restaurants were
only experimenting with this technology. But

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.330
people are now getting used to the idea of
connecting their iPhone to other devices or

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.180
the use of NFC.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.720
Lot's of big companies have to adapt NFC for
it to be useful. But big companies like Best-Buy

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.820
or 7-Eleven stopped supporting NFC because
it was to expensive and customers didn't have

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.600
a NFC supported device. Probably because the
iPhone 5 and 5S where not compatible.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.759
So here is what iPay will look like?

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.579
Apple will update the Passbook App, enabling
stores to create a Pass that can be used for

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.500
payment. Much like the Passbook is already
doing for tickets or coupons.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.419
Companies like Mc'Donalds and Sturbucks already
shown their interests in supporting a mobile

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:13.599
payment solution from Apple. Also American
Express, Visa and Mastercard are working with

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.180
Apple to have their cards in the Passbook.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.599
With all this adoption, the iPhone is soon
to become not just your phone, but also your

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.139
wallet.

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:28.760
Security? Will this be safe? Apple will use
Touch-ID probably for big transactions. Also

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.309
check out my video about Touch-ID in the description
below to learn more.

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:37.579
So that was my video for today. If you have
any more questions about this, let me know

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:38.579
