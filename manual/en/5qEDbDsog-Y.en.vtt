00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:02.787
(upbeat music)

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.960
(acoustic music)

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.390
- [Narrator] Better Place
is the biggest sloop

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.740
made of carbon that is ever been built.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.330
50 meters long, it's
mast is 67 meters tall.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.270
The hull has being designed by Bill Tripp

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.180
and built by Wally in both their Fano

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.838
and Anchono boat yards.

00:00:22.838 --> 00:00:25.588
(acoustic music)

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.480
Nothing out of the ordinary for Wally.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.000
Their essence has already
broken every record.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.830
A very fast boat, again with
a hull designed by Bill Tripp.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.170
This time though, the inside
of the boat is innovative too.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.880
For example, with its
hybrid diesel-electric motor

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.840
propulsion, which is something
that submarines already used

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.650
just long ago as the Second
World War, but it's only now

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.692
that we're starting to see
this technology in sailboats.

00:00:52.692 --> 00:00:55.525
(classical music)

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.520
- Better Place (speaks Italian)

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.080
- [Narrator] Better Place
has a big deckhouse,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.550
which is very impressive,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.426
but also in that it
creates big spaces below.

00:01:05.426 --> 00:01:08.259
(classical music)

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:17.822
- (Speaks Italian)

00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:19.620
- [Narrator] There aren't
any rails here on this boat,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.840
thought to usually ruin the aesthetics,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.178
but here you can see the
lines are very clean.

00:01:24.178 --> 00:01:26.678
(plays piano)

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.980
Better Place is a boat that
has been designed and built

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.740
with the idea of going anywhere
and to navigate on any sea.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.570
As usual of course, with
any Wally yacht, performance

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.064
and speed are important points.

00:01:40.064 --> 00:01:42.564
(plays piano)

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.980
The sail area, size aside, is simple.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.440
It has a mainsail boom that's
wrapped in a self-tacking jib

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.772
and it uses a code-zero Angelica.

00:01:51.772 --> 00:01:54.272
(piano music)

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.760
It's a boat that can navigate anywhere,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.010
as it is RINA certified, which means

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.470
that under their strict
environmental standards,

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.490
the current regulations, Wally
have done everything possible

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.622
to avoid polluting.

00:02:06.622 --> 00:02:09.122
(piano music)

00:02:12.975 --> 00:02:15.558
(upbeat music)
