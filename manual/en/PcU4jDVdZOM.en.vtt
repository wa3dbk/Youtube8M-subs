The Truth About Wasabi -- What is Real Wasabi
Welcome back to another cooking video, I'm

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.290
Chef Devaux and today I'm here to tell you,
you've all been lied to.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.940
This stuff, the dry green powder which you
add water to and it becomes this blob of spicy

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.449
stuff which you add to your sushi, or this
tube of paste that says Wasabi on it don't

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:20.960
actually contain Wasabi.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:28.089
Over 90% of all the stuff you buy in supermarkets
and grocery stores say Wasabi on it don't

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.980
actually contain Wasabi.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:38.190
And over 95% of sushi restaurants which serve
you Wasabi don't actually serve you Wasabi.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.460
Why have they deceived you?

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.420
Well it's very simple.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.750
It's cheaper to mass produce this stuff which
is just horseradish, mustard seed, and a bunch

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.940
of colorants or otherwise E-numbers that make
green than it is to actually make the real

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.230
stuff which is this here, Wasabi Root.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.460
It takes about two to three years to grow
these like this and it's very-very acclimated

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.150
to growing conditions, it needs to be in a
root bed casing and with a canopy of trees

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.880
which you can make, but essentially it's very
difficult and a long time period to grow,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.440
so it costs a lot of money, not many people
do it so it's very rare to large quantities

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.560
of stuff, and thus it's expensive and this
is cheap.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.580
So, when you're talking about profit margins,
they'll give you the cheap stuff instead of

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.040
giving you the expensive stuff.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.460
Alright so what's the difference between this
the fake Wasabi and the real Wasabi?

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.150
Well the fake one I don't need to tell you,
when you take a bit too much suddenly you

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.180
feel like your nose is on fire and your mouth
is burning up and you get cold sweats from

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.600
the heat.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.640
That's normal to happen, real Wasabi is a
much more delicate, it's made to go with fish,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.080
like it's natural to pair the two together,
and it's got slight aromas, it's un-describable,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.420
or if the Wasabi -- I can't say exactly how
it is, you've got to try it, but it's great

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.179
and I highly recommend it.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.209
So how do you make Wasabi out of the root?

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.930
Well you use one of these wood sharkskin grater,
now you can use ceramic graters or metal graters,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.129
but you're going out and getting this, you're
going through all the effort of finding this

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:28.000
and buying it and getting it shipped to you,
you might as well also ship one of these and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.980
then just do it the traditional way.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.819
Alright so this is how you grate a Wasabi.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:38.120
First you want to just clean off the edges
so there is no excess dirt on the sides, and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.689
on this side.

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:46.681
And then once you've done that you just simply
take your paddleboard of sharkskin and you

00:02:46.681 --> 00:02:54.250
just grind it softly in small circles.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.020
You want to take your time with this, you
want to create a very silky smooth paste,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:15.920
you don't want to rush it, so just continue
to grind this.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.430
After a while you want to just scoop some
of this up, just keep it all in one place.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.060
Once you have grated it, you want to leave
it for about four to six minutes just to sort

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.060
of mature.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.310
You want the aromas to volatile inside the
Wasabi to break up and just do their thing

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.639
and don't leave it too long because after
15/20 minutes Wasabi starts to deteriorate

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:45.760
and it's no longer got that pungent aroma
which you're looking for.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.359
Alright, so where to get the real Wasabi?

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:54.099
Now this Wasabi specifically was given to
me by Kazari.co.uk and they are also a supplier

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.819
for great fish and Wasabi throughout the entire
year, they can send it anywhere in the world.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.950
Now if you are outside of Europe or you want
to know what the latest cheapest supplier

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.739
is, go check out the link on the top left
hand corner of the screen and there you'll

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:14.249
be able to get the cheapest supplier for Wasabi
in Europe and in the U.S. and also where to

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:16.130
get a sharkskin grater.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.220
Just check out the link above.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.840
Now, how to store this stuff.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.320
Now you just keep it inside a muslin cloth
like this, which it comes with, and you wrap

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.950
it around and you keep it down inside a bowl
of water in the fridge, and you keep it for

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.730
about a month and you have to clean out the
water about every three to four days.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.640
Now if you come towards the end of the month
and you realize you haven't eaten all the

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.040
Wasabi, that's fine, don't worry, just grate
it all down, put it in little pouches and

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.450
keep it in the freezer.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.941
And then whenever you want any sushi and you
have Wasabi then you just take out one pouch

00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:51.410
and defrost that and you're good to go.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:58.550
Now it's not as good obviously as fresh, but
it's better to store it than to just let go

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.190
on because that would be a waste.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.680
