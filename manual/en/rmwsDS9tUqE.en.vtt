00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.540
In 2007, Crackdown delighted Xbox 360 players
by casting them as a futuristic supercop who,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.360
through vigorous jumping, driving, and shooting,
could actively enhance his abilities and extend

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.300
his influence over a large urban landscape.
Now it's 2010 and Crackdown 2 is hoping to

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.660
delight Xbox 360 players with... pretty much
the same thing. You are once again cast as

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.350
a powerful law enforcement agent charged with
cleaning up Pacific City. Your powers increase

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.390
as you use them, and striving to jump higher
and punch harder can be addictively satisfying.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.390
You can cause a lot of mayhem across the city,
and there are no shortage of new objectives

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.270
to keep you busy. Yet despite the abundance
of things to do, Crackdown 2 often feels like

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.250
a shallow experience. There is no proper story
to spur you onward, and you spend the majority

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.580
of the campaign with the same handful of mission
types. Bringing a friend or three into the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.750
action livens things up, but all of the different
kinds of fun you can have in the game are

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.649
tainted by one issue or another, and the more
you play, the more these problems become evident.

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.619
Nevertheless, even though Crackdown 2 is flawed
and doesn't do much in the way of innovation,

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.090
there is still plenty of entertaining action
here for those interested in leaping tall

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.119
buildings in a single bound.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.560
Crackdown 2 takes place in Pacific City. Geographically
speaking, it's the same Pacific City that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.040
players explored in the first Crackdown, though
time has not been kind to it. Buildings are

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.130
crumbling, roadways are disrupted, and it
generally feels like a more conflict-torn

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.810
enviroment. The visuals are improved, and
once again the cel-shaded outlines mix well

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.539
with more realistic textures, creating a distinctive
look. Yet Crackdown 2 isn't exactly pretty.

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.090
Environmental details don't stand up well
to close inspection, and explosions, of which

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.260
there are many, don't look very good at all.
Still, it is fun to explore the city and it

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.810
is fun to blow stuff up, and the absence of
loading times make doing both much easier.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.140
In fact, exploring the city is one of the
most entertaining parts of Crackdown 2, thanks

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.200
largely to the liberal placements of attribute-boosting
orbs throughout the city. Green agility orbs

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.489
perch on rooftops, encouraging you to climb
to new heights, while white hidden orbs reward

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.700
curious and thorough explorers. Most orbs
are stationary, but two types of renegade

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.390
orbs will flee from you, baiting you to give
chase on foot or in a car. Every orb glows

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.290
brightly and once you've spotted one, it's
very difficult to resist grabbing it. Collecting

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.700
orbs is oh-so-satisfying, and with hundreds
of them scattered around the city, it's easy

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.260
to get caught up in an addictive orb-snatching
binge.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.469
The downside of this binging is that while
leaping high into the air can be exhilarating,

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.820
climbing structures can be aggravating. It
can be tough to tell what parts of a building

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.969
you will be able to grab on to and what parts
you won't. After a while you develop a good

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:17.799
eye for the environment, but there is still
the looming problem of ledge detection. Crackdown

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.890
2 is inconsistent in this respect, so you
may jump at the side of a building to grab

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.439
what you know to be a ledge, only to fall
impotently to the ground many stories below.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:31.349
Sometimes your leaping skills allow you to
regain your position easily, but the higher

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.870
you climb, the more time and effort you stand
to lose as a result of this flaw. This makes

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.150
climbing tall buildings nerve-wracking; not
just because it's tricky, but because at any

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.890
moment you could fall victim to Crackdown
2's inconsistency and plummet to the earth.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.790
Fortunately, though it is aggravating, this
problem isn't bad enough to ruin the fun of

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.239
exploration and orb collection. The other
collectibles to be found in Pacific City are

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.920
audio logs. They come in a number of varieties,
and shed light on your enemy's agenda and

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:07.920
other threats to public safety. These voiced
snippets are the only substantial form of

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.510
plot development in Crackdown 2, but they
are few and far between. You get the feeling

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.820
that there is some mildly interesting stuff
going on, but unless you scour the city, the

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.370
opening cutscene is all the plot you're gonna
get for the majority of the game. There is

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.200
a disembodied narrator who accompanies you
wherever you go, and he is initially helpful

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.430
and somewhat amusing. But after a while his
shtick gets old, he starts repeating himself,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.970
and you'll want to turn him off. The Options
screen allows this, but in doing so you also

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.330
shut out the Audio Log voiceovers, which you
actually do want to hear. It's not a great

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.060
system.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.780
Fortunately, there are plenty of bad guys
to help you vent your frustration. The enemies

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.340
arrayed against you come in two varieties,
human and not-so-human. Your human enemies

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.970
are The Cell, a group dedicated to fighting
you and your Agency. You other enemies are

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.740
the freaks, zombie-like creatures that overrun
the city at night, killing anyone they can

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.090
get their claws on. At the outset of the game
you are told about both factions, assigned

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.290
a few different combat-based objective types,
and set loose in the city.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.960
Fighting men and monsters can be fun, and
increasing your arsenal and melee strength

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.250
is rewarding. The deadly accuracy of the harpoon
gun and the Jedi-like power of the UV shotgun

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.060
are highlights, and the weapons you find in
the environment can be just as fun. Bashing

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.340
enemies with lampposts, bus stations, and
cars is an enjoyable way to flex your power,

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.690
but combat in Crackdown 2 is pretty simplistic.
In the early going you can shoot and punch

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.620
your way through enemies fairly easily, and
when things get tough, the tough jump around

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.770
with a rocket launcher and duck behind buildings
to regenerate health. Laying waste to lots

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.840
of enemies is inherently satisfying, as long
as you don't get caught by knockdown attacks

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.979
or explosions. Both with cause you to ragdoll
and roll around limply for an annoying amount

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:57.099
of time, leaving you powerless to defend yourself
against repeated attacks. It has its moments,

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:01.819
but eventually combat loses its luster because
your enemy encounters don't vary greatly and

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:05.770
become repetitive.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.550
You can mix things up by driving around the
city in any car you choose to get into or

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.419
by summoning an Agency car at a drop point.
The Agency cars handle the best and have special

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.610
abilities, making them the most fun, though
other cars have radios installed so you can

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.770
hear actual music while you drive. The cracked
pavement can give you some trouble, but races,

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.259
stunt rings, and renegade orbs provide good
incentive to get behind the wheel. Just be

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:32.789
ready for some trouble if you drive during
the day. Pacific City's civilians think nothing

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:37.650
of gathering en masse and wandering into the
street in an effort to become roadkill, and

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.430
god help you if you ever hop a corner. It's
very difficult not to massacre civilians while

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.169
driving, and violent police retaliation against
you is the annoying result.

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:53.120
The Crackdown 2 campaign can be played cooperatively
over Xbox Live, with up to four players romping

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.800
around one city at a time. Each player keeps
their attribute and orb-grabbing progress,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.430
and there are some orbs that can only be collected
with at least two players present. More company

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.300
makes things more enjoyable, and though only
the host gets to keep combat-related progress,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.300
there's more than enough opportunity for cooperative
(or not so cooperative) fun to make teaming

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.490
up worthwhile. The competitive multiplayer
is not so worthwhile, offering a paltry three

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.740
modes that cover the basics but don't offer
a particularly enjoyable or deep experience.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.900
Yet Crackdown 2 is an enjoyable game. Exploring
the vast city, grabbing orbs, pulling off

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.430
stunts and flexing your abilities can keep
you entertained for hours, and its even more

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.740
fun with a friend in tow. The lack of a narrative
makes the campaign feel directionless and

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.520
repetitive, and the different flavors of action
are all tainted in one way or another. Those

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.819
with high hopes for a stellar sequel will
be disappointed, but Crackdown 2's core action

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:50.199
and appeal remains strong, making it a fun
stop on your summer videogame tour.
