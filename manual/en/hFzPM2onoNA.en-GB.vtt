00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.121
I came to Birmingham to do Pharmacy mainly
because it's a new course and they've had

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:25.730
a chance to create a whole new course on the
needs of the future pharmacists so we are

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.810
able to produce the best pharmacists possible.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.199
We've got a good balance between practical
lab based sessions, e-labs and face to face

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.720
communication in SGTs and lectures.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.750
My personal highlights in starting is probably
the pharmacy lab because you get to make things

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.760
like solutions, creams, suppositories, all
those sorts of things. I think it's really

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.690
interesting and really fun at the same time.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.629
I came to Birmingham to study Pharmacy because
I really liked the way their course was arranged.

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.579
I liked the integration with other healthcare
professionals and early patient contact.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.230
We get a lot of opportunity to go out into
hospital, community and primary care, more

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.920
so than other universities get. Personally
I've found it really good because I can apply

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.490
clinical knowledge I've learnt in my Professional
Pharmacist module into the actual workplace.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:17.030
In hospital for example we got the opportunity
to shadow doctors and pharmacists and also

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.860
to work side by side with medical students.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.329
Recently I went to the QE just over the road
and was able to view what a pharmacist does

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.159
in the clinical decisions unit, which is something
we've not been taught about but I learnt on

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.200
placement, which I found really useful.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:44.500
The campus is absolutely beautiful. When I
first saw it I fell in love with it straight

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.500
away.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.409
We've got really good computer facilities
in the Medical School and brand new labs here

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.180
in the Robert Aitken building.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.869
We have our own library in the Medical School.
There's also a main library on the main campus

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.070
which is so useful, it's amazing.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.700
It's got that compromise between a city location
and the security of a campus uni.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.080
I find living in Birmingham really interesting.
I do come from here originally so it's living

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.530
close to home but the city centre is vibrant
and it's full of life.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.680
Birmingham is a really friendly environment
and there's a lot of places where you can

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.620
go shopping like the Bull Ring and we also
have a lot of social areas so it's a good

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.000
for everyone.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.870
Once I finish my degree I'll hopefully be
doing a pre-reg in hospital. After that I'll

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.480
go into hospital and after a few years hopefully
specialise in cardiology or oncology.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.310
I'm hoping by the end of the four years I
know the direction I want to go in and throughout

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.530
my yeas as a pharmacy student I'll learn about
the different pharmacists there are and what

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.530
their jobs are.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.250
Don't be daunted by it all and the prospect
of not getting enough experience because you

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.410
get plenty on the course in the first year
alone and it's actually not as hard as it

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.410
seems.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.350
Pharmacy is a great course and I think anyone
who wants to study it should definitely go

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.769
for it.
