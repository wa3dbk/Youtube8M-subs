00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.330
On this last clip what we are going to do
is we are going to explain the importance

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.300
of the last ten seconds for each round. That
last ten seconds is what is going to stick

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.210
out most in the judges' mind. As they are
keeping score, as they are keeping track,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.000
as they are trying to figure out a winner
to this match. They may not remember that

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.410
first punch, they may not remember what happened
in the middle of the fight, but what they

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.699
are usually going to remember is the last
ten seconds before the round ends each time.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.150
And especially the last ten seconds of the
third round. So what we have done was I as

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.950
the assistant coach am going to let the head
coach know when there is approximately ten

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.790
seconds left and hopefully he will let that
boxer know and then that boxer hears that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.620
and that boxer fights very hard for that last
ten seconds. We are going to show you that

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:55.960
now. And it looks like we got about fifteen
seconds left. You are up buddy, you are up.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:08.810
Ten seconds, Nick! Stay busy, stay busy! Ten
seconds left, Nick! Okay, time! Ten, nine,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.740
eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two,
one. Go ahead and sit down, Nick. Good job,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.010
Buddy. I want you to stay busy for me the
last ten seconds, okay? Those last ten seconds

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:32.079
are crucial. Hands off the rope! Okay. Kick
your legs out, lean back for me. Get a deep

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:38.929
breath through your nose. Remember when you
hear me say ten seconds I want you to stay

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:46.700
busy, okay? Okay. Don't stop punching him.
Take a drink. This is the last round. You

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.390
got to stay busy on the last ten seconds,
okay? Yeah. Good job. You are doing good out

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.649
there, okay? Okay. Alright. And the last thing
you want to tell him is the ten seconds. Okay,

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:07.009
Seconds out! You ready to go? You ready? Yeah.
Remind him. Remember the last ten seconds

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.739
stay busy, okay? Okay. Nick is going to go
back out there and you can bet when Shane

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.121
yells that there is only ten seconds left
hopefully Nick is going to work like he has

00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:18.059
never worked before. Thank you.
