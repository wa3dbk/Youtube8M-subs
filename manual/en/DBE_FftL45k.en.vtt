00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:06.064
In this tent, you work for 5 days

00:00:06.664 --> 00:00:09.724
Down there somewhere to stay, for 5 days

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:14.407
To this little Renault 5 is all about, for 5 days.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:27.120
Christian Benz from Hockenheim and his brother Stefan want to overcome the Green Hell.
You go for the first time the 24 races.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:55.100
Since I'm used to drive kart race, I thought I build a car to drive on the Nordschleife Sunday. Eventually, my brother asked why I do it and I told him come and go by car to your wife and if you drive a certain time, we will drive 24 races.
He is already gone in the third round and I had to keep my promise, since we screw and drive.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.220
Be supported by some friends

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.880
To be able to ride at the 24h race, the brothers have saved money until made ​​no vacation and asked Mama about money.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.880
Cheap is not this fun.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:26.380
Overall, if we will drive through cost 40,000 DM, with tires that are very expensive, costing 350, - DM a tire for our race car. Currently we have only used tires, because in the warm temperatures, the used tires are just as good as new.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:45.820
On Friday it was first really serious. You need at least 2 fast laps complete to qualify for the race. Christian made ​​the beginning, but soon returned to the box.

00:01:47.156 --> 00:02:12.296
A cylinder was broken and had a spark plug misfire. After a short while repairing it went back out on the track, but after only 20 minutes, came back in the box. This time the Tempartur the engine was risen too high, which was a driving at the limit impossible. After a second short trip to the Nordschleife, the team had to stop training and so slowly the Desparation made ​​wide.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:25.940
My mechanic and I have now disassembled the engine and found that the piston is gone in the fourth cylinder broken.
This means that we had probably broken our ignition module in the upper rpm range and destroyed the engine.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:51.040
Without knowing whether the brothers was qualified for the race the night into day. They work to 5 clock in the morning. At 11 clock finally the good news, despite all the problems the lap times of the brothers had been good. Now just stay cool and hope for a little luck and keep up somehow.
Because with only 2 pilots a break 2:30 min is possible.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:03:05.260
So the best spell was of a technical inspector who said, this is only for tough men, and if we do that, then we are hard men!
I think the risk is very great that the driver is not able, but we want to go only for two and if we do that, we are the biggest.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:30.680
Somehow you have managed, with a little luck, perseverance and a good team spirit. Although Stefan had an accident in the night, in which the Renault 5 was damaged, but the race went for you anyway. Early on Sunday morning you were to rank 171, and so slowly returned despite fatigue back the good mood.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:52.100
We were well prepared and had to overcome very many obstacles, but are now rewarded take over 12 hours. After the chaos in training and engine repair and replace engine. I'm perfectly happy, even if we fail now I do not care.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:01.860
One of the small team has also committed to next year they are back again, for 5 days and then you will be even better.
