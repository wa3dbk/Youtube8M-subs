Hi, my name is Jenny Jaffe, I struggle with
mental illness, and I want to live in a world

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.610
where that is not a scary thing to admit,
and that's why I started Project UROK. What's

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.000
Project UROK you ask? You ask the tough questions,
and I like that about you. Project UROK is

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.200
a nonprofit organization officially launching
in March of 2015, who's mission is to create

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.320
a catalog of accessible, funny, meaningful
videos for teens struggling with mental health

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.060
issues made by adults and peers who have been
there before. In doing so, we hope to provide

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.620
a sense of comfort, a sense of belonging,
and a sense of hope. Now you may be asking,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.550
"but what is Project UROK when you're not
talking like a robot?" You're a straight shooter,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.570
and I admire that about you. Basically, Project
UROK is the resource that I wish I'd had as

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.960
a teenager. I'd always struggled with severe
anxiety, OCD, and depression, and throughout

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.670
middle and high school one of the very hardest
things to deal with was the deep isolation

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.110
I felt. I was sure I was the only teenager
on the planet more worried about panic attacks

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.890
than prom, and I was way too embarrassed to
talk about them with my peers. All I wanted

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.800
was proof that there was light at the end
of the tunnel. I'm making this video on my

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.870
webcam in my bedroom to show you how easily
you can become apart of Project UROK on your

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.850
webcam in your bedroom or your school or your
office or in your friend's bedroom or my bedroom,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.710
I guess, if you know me, maybe. If you're
interested in learning more, here's what you're

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.490
going to do. You're going to find out more
information by following Project UROK on Twitter

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.490
and Instagram, you're going to like us on
Facebook, and you're going to look in the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.890
info box below to find out how to make your
very own Project UROK video. And, if you're

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:49.670
in New York City, you might even be able to
do it in our super cool, real life film studio.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.270
These aren't just web videos. This is a mental
illness de-stigmitation revolution. That's

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.979
too many words. It's a revolution, just like
Les Mis, except with more neurotic people

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:10.659
and less singing. And I can't do it alone.
You're okay, and I can't wait to hear from you.
