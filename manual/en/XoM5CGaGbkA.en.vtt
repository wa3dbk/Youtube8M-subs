00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.740
Now, when recent PS3 official firmware versions
have been jailbroken, the

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.560
natural question arises: if you update to
latest CFW, can you login to

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.769
Playstation network and be safe? The short
answer is yes you can, but that is not

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.769
safe.
First, you don't really have to update to

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:26.140
get PSN access. You may just use
a spoofer, which changes the 3.55 firmware

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.739
number to a higher one without
actual update. In fact, it is very useful

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.980
to use spoofer at all times to
better protect yourself from accidental firmware

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.050
upgrades.
But Sony can detect you're jailbroken and

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.680
ban you for playing online.
Generally, ban for online play usually refers

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.500
to Xbox Live, but it's even
worse with PSN. As for Xbox 360, it is impossible

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.680
to install homebrew ,
that is software

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.260
not approved by the console manufacturer,
Microsoft, unless you're on a

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.940
JTAG console. Microsoft disabled JTAG pretty
fast, and the recent slim

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.680
version hack that enabled freeboot came almost
at the end of Xbox 360 life cycle.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.640
So, the majority of hacked Xbox 360 out there
are not jailbroken and their

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.390
firmware is untouched, except for several
bytes of the optical drive

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.940
firmware, which is actually a separate device.
That change enabled backups

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.550
to run, and the devs do their best to mask
the change. Despite that,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.550
console bans are not uncommon on Xbox Live.
With Playstation 3, it's much worse that that.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.810
All hacked consoles are
jailbroken and have homebrew software installed,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.750
that is not approved by Sony.
Nothing is done by devs to hide that, and

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.170
the majority of CFW users have
at least a backup manager installed. So you

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.260
only have to open the GAME
folder, and existence of a directory with

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.940
a certain number gives a 100%
guarantee the console is jailbroken. As all

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.520
modifications are explicitly
forbidden by PSN terms of service, Sony has

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.240
the authority to ban your PS3.
So, accessing Playstation Network from a jailbroken

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.049
console is always a risk
of getting ban.

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.289
But what to do if got one? On Xbox 360, that's
a life-long sentence, without

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.810
parole, even if you get everything back to
factory default.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.130
There's no parole with Sony either, however,
there is a way to address the issue.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.830
The problem is, it's a question of dignity
and moral. No, not towards Sony -

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.750
in fact, it would be even honorable to go
Robin Hood on the corporation for

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.430
treating their customers as a piece of shit.
No, it's immoral towards those customers -

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.489
gamers, other PS3 owners like yourself. Later
on that.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.620
So, to unban your console you'll need a special
utility. I only could find it

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.400
for the very first CFW, which is 3.41. Perhaps
you would be luckier than me.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.810
Anyway, if you've been following the advice
I keep repeating like a freaking

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.770
parrot - QA flag you console while you're
still on 3.55 - good for you, and

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.989
you shouldn't have any trouble downgrading
to 3.41. If you didn't, well,

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.360
downgrade we'll be harder for you, since first
you have to install a hybrid

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.160
CFW which tells it's a higher version, but
is 3.55 in essence, and then

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.010
downgrade. Then you could install the utility.
And here comes the moral

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.270
dilemma.
Each Playstation 3 has a network card - in

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.280
fact, two of them, Ethernet and
WiFi, which, like all other network devices,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.030
has a unique MAC-address. This
is exactly the address PSN uses to pick out

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.870
and ban you device. The utility
allows to change the address to any other,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.540
the problem is, it has to be in
the PS3 range. Where you can get one? Well,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.140
I leave this up to you, just bear
in mind, that if two consoles with the same

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.849
MAC-address get online simultaneously -
both users will get banned, that is you and

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.590
the innocent other gamer whose
MAC address you are using.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.060
So, having two consoles - one with OFW, which
you use for online play,

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.620
and the other with CFW for backups is the
best option for both XBOX Live

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.569
and Playstation Network.
