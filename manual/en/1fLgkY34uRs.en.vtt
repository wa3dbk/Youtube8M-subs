00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.809
This is not your average PSA, this is a PSNA,
please Spay Neuter and Adopt.

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:11.280
Each day 10,000 humans are born in America.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.280
Each day more than 70,000 puppies and kittens
are born.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.350
Now if that birthright keeps up, honey, we
are never going to have enough homes for those

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.350
cats and dogs.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.330
We're going to have to put those humans somewhere.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.960
More than six million animals wind up in shelters
every year and more than half will be euthanized.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.530
The cost for the state of California to house
and euthanize all these unwanted dogs and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.609
cats is over 250 million dollars a year.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:39.039
That's Oprah money.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.320
It's time for us humans to step up and set
it right.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.839
Bob Barker had it right, we have got to spay
and neuter our pets.

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.600
Did you know that one female cat can begin
breeding at as young as four months old and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.769
if left unaltered, she and her offspring can
produce as much as four hundred and twenty

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.539
thousand cats in just seven years.

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:08.530
One unaltered female dog and her offspring
can produce sixty seven thousand dogs in just

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.210
six years.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.020
Don't think that's cool thing, it is not a
cool thing.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.140
Stopping pet overpopulation starts with you.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.270
Many, an I mean men, argue that removing the
testicles of male dog will make them less

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.270
tough.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.950
That is completely false.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.049
Neutering a male will reduce the chance of
prostate enlargement and cancer.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.869
It will actually make your pet much less likely
to roam and nicer, you might even get flowers.

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.789
It also eliminates the possibility of uterine
and ovarian cancer as well as greatly reduces

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.250
the chance of breast cancer.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.189
Which is great because they have seventeen
breasts.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.060
Female dogs can get impregnated by several
different males when they're in heat.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.990
Which makes it virtually impossible to go
after spousal support.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:11.770
*Baby talk to animals*
There are two things we need to do.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.270
First, spay and neuter.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.880
Why are you letting your kiddie get frisky
with the neighbors?

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.480
With a quick snip your dog or cat can lead
a longer and happier life.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.900
The second thing we need to do is adopt from
local shelters and support them.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.610
Adopt because animals are so much more grateful
than humans.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:42.970
Just think, how excited they'll ben when they
find out they're adopted.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:50.090
Sammie I have something important to tell
you... you're adopted.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.830
That wasn't hard at all!

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.739
A rescued pet is a dear friend for life.

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.129
It's time to smarten up, step up, spay and
neuter.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:09.120
They give us unconditional love, let's give
them a chance at life.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:20.690
