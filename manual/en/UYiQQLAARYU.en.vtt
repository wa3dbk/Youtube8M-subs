00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.230
until 20 decided to make this album I
was wanted to

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.390
create a Angeles affordable an
affordable

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.309
into a sample a really I wanted a volume
that we could sell for under 100 dollars

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.920
Angeles is so convenient for the
collector

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.260
and collectors love them but they're so
expensive

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.190
we saw in German album for over two
hundred dollars in so we were able to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.100
produce this

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.860
The price is now $94.95.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.020
I what are some key features well

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.590
first and most important is that the
mounts are are ready thanks to the page

brand-new premium

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.320
album which is binder which is much
thicker

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.950
feels and looks like leather
hand-stitched as is cool to Paul saying

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.420
and this binder last for years

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.400
very nice close in his arms are very
expensive

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.320

because we do it all here in Camden

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.600
that we design the album ourselves we
write all the copy

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.460
