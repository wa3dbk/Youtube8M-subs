00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.620
 Hello, to begin we will use black construction paper and 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.738
 officiated size sheet (legal) color you prefer 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:19.960
 Colbon or glue, a business card, plus 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.839
 needle and thread, let's start 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.289
 We take our business card base 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.760
 we place the edge of our sheet in the position that you are 

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:34.530
 seeing 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.560
 leaving 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.719
 a space at the top 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.969
 then mark the fold or 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:44.710
 leave a sheet guide 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.820
 We mark it for refernce 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.649
 and with reference 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.659
 the fold 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.109
 we turned the sheet (Part One) 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.619
 the idea is to get three pockets 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:59.729
 which we are the ones we use to introduce cards and other 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:01.750
 documents within the 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.250
 wallet, as time 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.280
 business card use only as a reference to 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.290
 mark each pocket 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.380
 I mention we will develop three pockets 

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:13.799
 3 on each side 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.810
 to have our wallet 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.790
 we have our first pocket, now let's turn to the 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.090
 bottom to look like a wallet 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.380
 you can take as a reference your own wallet and every 

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:30.439
 pocket 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:31.799
 card 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.479
 Look, we place the card again 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.420
 and mark the fold 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:44.199
 It is not complicated, but you just have to mark the fold 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.140
 for 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.439
 after doing so (equal) 

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.979
 by size 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.219
 we are doing 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.939
 the other pocket 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.519
 and just as you're watching 

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:06.530
 you must repeat the process until three (3) pockets 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.538
 to continue the process and make it back 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.729
 better 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.289
 Here we mark this fold 

00:02:17.288 --> 00:02:23.238
 I remember you must get three pockets in total 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.528
 on our 

00:02:24.528 --> 00:02:26.498
 follow the steps 

00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:30.438
 for your wallet 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.949
 here we marking each of the pockets 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:20.159
 Repeat the same steps until you get three (3) pockets 

00:03:24.158 --> 00:03:28.168
 we have finished look on our pockets 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:33.279
 You should stay somewhat similar to what you're watching, not exactly 

00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:33.859
 same 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.959
 just like you can use as a guide and a wallet that already have 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.989
 six (6) or similar pockets 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.878
 produced every pocket based on the card 

00:03:45.878 --> 00:03:48.079
 and in the last part we make a small 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.140
 fold towards the inside to prevent damage to the 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.288
 documents 

00:03:54.288 --> 00:03:58.358
 Now, we folded in half, as seen in the video and single 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.308
 follow the steps below to get the wallet 

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:06.248
 as time passes 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:20.528
 Now we take the black construction paper and are located above 

00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:25.269
 the first sheet with all the folds finished 

00:04:25.269 --> 00:04:26.430
 the focus 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.449
 and cut around the edge 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.259
 with reference to the first sheet 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.550
 with folds 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.050
 after cutting the cardboard you should have something like this 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.759
 They must be the same size to the first sheet, ie 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.650
 the red 

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:50.839
 with glue we unite the two pieces very well 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:54.310
 be careful not to damage them as they have the same size 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.040
 both 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.680
 in this way, we can obtain the 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.588
 wallet 

00:05:01.588 --> 00:05:05.259
 look and join the two pieces 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.629
 Now with needle and thread let's start 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:13.559
 sewing around the edge of the wallet 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.319
 for better result 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.949
 and better finished 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.699
 and you're seeing unite 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.419
 around the edge of the wallet 

00:05:24.418 --> 00:05:28.149
 and almost finished the wallet 

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:54.579
 ready, and finished sewing the whole wallet 

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:58.589
 we just need to finish sewing center 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:00.519
 our wallet 

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:03.038
 ready and finished our wallet 

00:06:03.038 --> 00:06:06.618
 We introduce cards you see it finished 

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:10.669
 and we sewed in the center for a better finish 

00:06:10.668 --> 00:06:11.859
 by last 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.309
