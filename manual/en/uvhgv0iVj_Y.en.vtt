00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.029
this is a O So simple beaded ring is a
wire wrap tutorial by Rachel

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:06.480
Murgatroyd

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.160
and

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.119
this is my o so simple ring

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:12.069
which is very simple to make

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:15.379
tools we're gonna need a ring mandrel, of course it's a ring

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.829
you are going to need some snipe or chain nose pliers, some snips and a ruler to measure your wire 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:22.619
with

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.279
Urm  Materials

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.619
fairly simple in this case approximately twelve
inches

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:28.819
30 centimeters

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.499
of nought point eight millimeter or twenty gauge round wire

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.120
I've used silver but you could use craft wire

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.230
and I've used an eight 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.780
millimeter bead

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.429
So I've got my wire, and I've already measured that out, and I'm just gonna 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:45.280
straighten that

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.730
makes it a little easier to use

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.760
if you find it's easier use a cloth

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.320
it does keep your fingers cleaner

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.590
I tend to use my fingers I'm very bad

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.429
uh... so I have my wire, 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:01.020
I've got my snipe nose pliers, which I'll need in a little bit so I'll put them there

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.600
and I've got my 8mm bead, really nice pretty bead, Its sugulite I don't get it often

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.220
but I do really like it.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.630
I'm going to put my bead into the middle of
the wire, If you find it easier

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.820
measure your wire to the central point put a mark on it with a sharpie or a felt pen

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.740
so that you know where to put your bead

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.750
once you bead is in the middle

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.850
you could try and put it on your mandrel

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.090
However this is not an easy thing to do,  when you do that 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.360
it slips and it wobbles and it's not good so this is a little tip to make life 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.650
a bit easier for you

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.090
if you bend the wire

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.330
either side of the bead

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.290
just like that

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.460
Now I'm going to show you a close up so that you can see a little bit better what

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.320
I have done with the wire

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.310
there we go

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.610
the bead can't move

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.530
It can't wobble around it can't

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.649
slip and fall off and end up on the floor

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:54.640
like things do

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.030
makes life a bit easier.  I'm going to pop that onto my mandrel. Now I am 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.660
having to work slightly sideways this is
because I have a camera two inches under 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.500
my nose

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.920
Obviously you don't have a camera

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.980
So life is a lot easier

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.890
so i'm just going to wrap

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.589
my wires around

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:16.089
and then I'm gonna show you in photographs so that you haven't got this

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.689
slightly strange angle where you can't see so...

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.280
hold the wire on with your thumb

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.359
on the bead, it's the easiest way and then wrap 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.409
the wires around....Like a 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.409
uh... coil or a spring we're not crossing the wires over

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.379
so when you get to the top I'm going to wrap around the bead

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.609
so

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.879
grabbing both wires, we go around

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.119
so I've gone round once

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:43.969
round again, twice

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.779
it really depends on how much wire
you've got I've gone round like three times

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:48.889
there

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.919
so close up show you that's how the first time round looks

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:53.870
and then I have

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.489
the second and you can see how the wires

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.500
building up

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.180
sort of

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.969
underneath the bead and then that's the third time

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.489
Now that's about enough, obviously if you have loads of wire you can do more

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.609
Less wire, go round less

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.169
the only thing I don't like is this, can you see this little hole we have here?

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.529
it tends to happen because your wires go around 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:20.019
around the wire that's coming out of the bead and not the bead it's self

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.560
so I'm going to slip my ring 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.649
off the mandrel

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:27.289
and i'm just going to take my piece of wire

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:32.259
and instead of going over the other wires, following that same line as before, 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:35.789
I'm actually going around the bead

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:37.559
so I've pulled it up

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:38.479
and tucked it 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:42.899
against the bead

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:44.889
and the wrapped around there

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.719
this gives you a much more professional
look instead of having very visible

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:51.719
wire going through the bead

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.619
it looks like it bead is nestled in and amongst.

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:59.509
so I have taken that end and just tucked it inside the shank of the ring

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:03.069
I'm just pulling that round with my pliers. So to show you in close ups

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.299
This is me pulling the wire around the edge of the bead

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.819
now can you see it's filled that gap in

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.039
so we had that little gap where we could
see the wire going through the bead and now

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.779
it's gone

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:17.049
which is great

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.549
gives you a more professional finish

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.099
and of course that's what everybody wants

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.540
so I'm going to take my end of wire

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.620
tuck it through, the middle

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.050
and i'm going to go around

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.209
I don't know two or three times

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:34.259
again it depends how much wire you've got

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.520
So I've gone round there and I'm going to get my snips 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.620
and I'm just going to trim that off

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.949
so that the cut end is on the outside

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.830
It's not on the inside you don't want that sharp against your finger

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.500
and then take your pliers and press it down, make it nice and neat

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.610
once you have done that you can slide the ring

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.990
back onto the mandrel

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.259
and then

00:04:58.259 --> 00:04:59.699
just slide

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.660
your finger nail around

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.699
what this does, it pushes it down onto the mandrel reshapes the ring into a circle

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.990
but makes sure that the two wire are together

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.399
that's it

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:14.199
Oh So Simple beaded ring

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:15.739
they look totally different

00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:17.629
with different beads

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:19.370
and

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.360
The wires

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.870
always going around slightly differently

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.889
and it's great

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.309
so

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:28.289
That was the tutorial for the simple one

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.999
the one you can see on the left is a bit of a jazzier one

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.169
and the tutorial for that

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.529
is on my website

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.389
and i hope that you enjoyed it

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.669
I know I do, I love this ring

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.019
it's been a favorite for many
years

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:46.830
