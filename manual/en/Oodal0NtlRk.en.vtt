00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.800
We all fly.

00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.200
Once you leave the ground, you fly!

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.633
It’s just that some people fly longer than others…

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:14.267
This is Follow the Leader with Luke and Billy.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.733
First, let’s see take a look at the results of the previous challenge.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:31.633
Today’s gold prizes were distributed in the following way:

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:42.667
The pilots who made the last seconds of their flights look really spectacular also receive a well-deserved 1000 gold to their accounts.

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:50.133
The new flight plan was sent to us by Zheleznodorozhnik, so he gets 6000 gold.

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:54.267
And we get in the Focke Wulf 57 and head to the skies above the Hidden Airbase.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:43.267
Be attentive and remember to complete the task as accurately as possible.

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:45.800
You can check the list that will be in the description to the video.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.100
Good luck!

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.500
That’s all for now.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.533
Our e-mail is still: tryrepeat@wargaming.net.

00:01:53.633 --> 00:02:00.100
In the e-mail subject, you should put the number of the Follow the Leader episode, your nickname, your region – North America or Europe,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.133
as well as the time it took to complete the route or mark it as a “Fail”.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.167
We’re waiting for your replays and comments!

00:02:06.267 --> 00:02:07.633
See you soon!
