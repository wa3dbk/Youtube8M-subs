Hi. It's Mr. Andersen. And in
this podcast I'm going to talk about r and

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.049
K selection. Or r selected and K selected
species. Right here we've got a chameleon

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.770
female that's just laid two eggs. Right here
we have a frog that's just laid thousands

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.570
of eggs. One of these is an r selected. One
is a K selected. If you know exactly which

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.390
is which right now then you probably don't
need to watch the rest of the video. But for

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.110
those of you that are now left, let me talk
about r and K selection. Basically we have

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.110
to talk about population growth. And so any
population where you have a positive r. And

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.300
r stands for growth rate. If you ever have
a positive r, you're going to follow a curve

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.839
that looks kind of like this. You'll first
of all have exponential growth. And then eventually

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.109
you'll run out of space or food. There's going
to be competition. And eventually you're going

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.010
to hit what's called logistic growth. And
so we call this the j shaped curve. The exponential.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.290
Of the sigmoidal or S shaped curve which is
logistic. And so what is N? N is going to

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.920
be the number of individuals in the population.
And so right here, if we put N on this side

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.890
and we put time on the X axis. As time goes
on, the numbers are going to increase. So

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.979
this would be a low N value right here. And
this would be a higher N value. And this would

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.289
be a really high N value. And so it's important
that you know what N is. That's the number

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.399
in the population. r is the growth rate. Remember
if it's ever positive, and how do we calculate

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.039
growth rate? It's basically the number of
people being born minus the number of people

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.810
who die. If we ever have a positive one, then
we're going to get this curve. Now it's not

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.500
always radical like this. Sometimes it's going
to be really gradual like this. Sometimes

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.880
it's going to be incredibly quick. Depending
on what the r value is. And then the last

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.880
thing is K. K stands for carrying, let's try
to spell that right, capacity. And so basically

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:00.770
that means in an area for a certain population,
there's like a maximum amount that they can

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.119
support. And so we call that the carrying
capacity. And that's where the limit is. It's

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.399
eventually going to level out on that. And
so if I were to talk about, in the real world,

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.489
because this is just a math formula. Basically
in the real world we put wolves back in Yellowstone

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.980
Park. And so there was tons of food there.
Not a lot of competition. And so basically

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.540
their growth rate went up. And then it's dropped.
And then it's gone up. And it's dropped. And

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.680
it's kind of reached this carrying capacity,
a maximum number of wolves that you can have

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.150
in Yellowstone Park. And so it's not as smooth
as that. But it certainly has an r value.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.920
The N value has increased and then it's reached
kind of a K. So it's important that you know

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.230
what N r and K are. Another thing that's important
is that you understand the way life exists.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.860
This is the story of life and death. It's
going to vary. And we really have three different

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.920
types. So you happen to be a type 1 survivorship
curve. And what that means is think about

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.319
all of the kids in your class or all the kids
who were born on the same day that you were.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.530
Basically most of you are going to survive
that first day. And most of you are going

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.340
to survive. Now a few people will die right
away, but most of you are going to survive.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.930
You're going to make it through your teenage
years. And your middle ages. And eventually

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.819
you're going to drop off. And all of you are
going to die in these last 10, 15, 20 years.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.400
That's because we're type 1. We're humans.
And we give a lot of, you can see this right

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.780
here, parental care to our offspring. Now
if we look at a frog. Here's some frog eggs

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.920
down here. They show what's called a type
3 survivorship curve. On day one, thousands

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.970
of little frogs, almost all of them die. But
a few of them survive. And then they're going

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.739
to level off. And then they're eventually
all going to die. Now we also have something

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.489
in the middle. Type 2 we call that. Song birds
are an example of that. And so they're going

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.310
to die off at a linear rate throughout their
whole life cycle. And so robins are an example

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.439
of that. Robins on average live about a year.
But some live a few months and some live three

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.030
years. But on average they're just going to
drop off until they're all dead. The ones,

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.049
the cohort, the ones that are born on that
one specific day. Remember, our environments

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.689
are going to differ. Sometimes we're going
to live in environments that are relatively

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.310
stable, like a desert. And sometimes not so
much. Like a rain forest or even a coral reef.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.239
Especially right now. They're changing radically.
Almost everyday. And so basically let's get

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:19.109
to what an r selected species is. r selected
are going to be those that base their life

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.560
on r. And remember r is growth rate. And so
these are species that want to quickly grow

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.759
and exploit a niche as fast as they can. And
so these are things that normally live in

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:36.440
an unstable environment. They have high fecundity.
What does that mean? Fecundity basically means

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.440
that they can make a lot of babies really
really quickly. In general these things are

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.310
small. They don't live that long. And their
offspring just kind of are spread to the ends

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.910
of the earth. And so an example of this would
be a dandelion. They show up really early

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.729
in the spring. They reproduce quickly. If
you've ever seen a dandelion when it goes

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.139
to seed, those seeds are just spread out.
Given very little parental care. Bacteria,

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:02.740
insects, diatoms, which are algae are a type
of this. Squid babies are essentially laid

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.810
by the females. Males put sperm all over that.
You have these packets and then the parents

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.069
just head away. They just leave. And then
eventually all of the squid are born. Most

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:16.750
of them are food for fish, but some of them
are able to survive. And so that's the r selected

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.030
species. You're putting your life in growth
rate. So what's K selected species? Well these

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.080
things are going to put their lives basically
around carrying capacity. They're in it for

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.380
the long haul. They're in it for exponential
and then that logistic growth. They want to

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.340
live a long time. Generally they live in a
more stable environment. They're larger as

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.440
far as body size. They're going to live a
lot longer. There's a lot of parental care.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.110
So you as a human are going to be a K selected
species. If we look at plants. Compare this

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.240
to the dandelion. A tree like this. Some trees
will live hundreds if not thousands of years.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.979
Whales are an example of K selected species.
But you don't necessarily have to be big.

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.889
This is an arctic tern that lives decades.
And they have a lot of parental care. And

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:08.110
so they're K selected species. Know this.
That in life it's not always one or the other.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.190
There are some species that actually show
a continuum. And so a sea turtle, you might

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.370
look at a sea turtle. It's big. It lives a
really long time. You might say maybe that's

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.139
a K selected species. But then if you remember
how they're born, they're just going to lay

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:27.039
a bunch of eggs. Cover them up in a hole.
And then just kind of swim away. And all of

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.849
these eggs are going to hatch. These little
baby sea turtles are kind of on their own.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.960
And so that would be more of an r selected.
And so even within a lifetime you can be r

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.830
and K selected. And even by gender. So if
you think about it, not humans per se, but

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.660
in animals, males tend to live more of an
r selected species. Produce as many as they

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.479
can. Spread as much of their sperm as far
as they can. Whereas females are more K selected.

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:56.360
Investing a lot in those offspring in that
long haul. So let's go back and look at that

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:02.330
first slide. The chameleon, is it r or K selected?
Well, it's investing is just these two eggs.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.440
And so it's in it for the long haul. Where
this would be an r selected species. And I

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.800
hope that's helpful.
