00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.290
Hip-hop has changed
It didn't used to be about the guns and bitches

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.290
It used to be all about the Disney Princesses

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.680
Cinderella, she could be miss right
And that dress she's wearin's disappearin'

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.900
at midnight
Call me prince charming, cos my game is bitch-tight

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.900
I've seen more vagina than the average midwife

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.670
If Belle brings the Beauty, I've got a Beast
I'd lock her in a dungeon, and keep her on

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.870
a leash
De-flower her rose, all the petals will fall

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.870
I'd be her animal lover, she'd be the Belle
of my balls

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.030
I feel like a new man, so does Mulan
We'll breed a new dynasty, and call it the

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.610
poon-T'ang
She wants to get honour, I want to get on

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.469
'er
Explode in her pussy, like a suicide bomber

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:16.469
Princess Jasmine, needs to get a lad in
Rub my lamp an', her wishes will be granted

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:24.759
I can show HER the world, no hiding my love
I'll throw off my shirt while I'm riding her

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:25.109
rug

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:32.109
I wanna take Ariel, back to her SEA-bed
Get her wet and salty, Under The Semen

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:44.149
I'm not a leg man, I wanna get HER tail
come in her blow-hole, until she's a sperm-whale

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.249
She is kinda quiet, but I don't like speeches
Don't blame the playa, blame the beaches

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:55.700
She's got no legs, so I can't find her coochie
I won't give her head, cause I don't like

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.270
sushi
