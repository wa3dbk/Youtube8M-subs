00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.900
Always getting questions
on the best way

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.533
to carve a standing rib roast,

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.533
and today I just wanna show
you how simple it can be.

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.133
This is a semi-boneless
rib roast.

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.633
Semi-boneless
meaning it's just got

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:12.067
the rib bones
on the bottom.

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:15.467
We roasted it whole
on those bones.

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:17.000
And we did this in
our high/low method.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.233
We started at 450 degrees.

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:20.700
That's why we got
that nice crust.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.100
And then we finished it at 350.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.400
So I just wanna show you quickly
the best way to carve this.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.633
I have a carving knife.

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:30.667
It's a long, sort of
flexible knife.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:33.600
But you wanna use a
knife when you're carving

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.933
that is slightly bigger

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.100
than the piece of meat
that you're carving.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.933
That just makes
your life easier.

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.000
Obviously, whatever knife
you're comfortable with

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.867
makes the most sense,

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:42.933
but the longer is
better in this case

00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.867
just so we're making nice,
clean cuts all the way through.

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:48.167
So the first thing I wanna
do is just take my knife

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:51.467
and I'm gonna go right along
where these bones are,

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:54.100
and I'm just gonna
make a straight cut.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.433
And you can actually feel--
I can feel the bones

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:58.500
on the back
of the knife.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.700
And you wanna just
think of the knife

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.467
as an extension
of your hand.

00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:04.900
And you can sort of
just feel those bones.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.900
And then they sort of end right
here at the bottom.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.700
So you can tip your
meat up a little bit,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.167
and let me show you inside,
okay, where we're at.

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:16.867
And then, just with a
couple of clean strokes,

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:20.067
you can kind of see
where those bones are.

00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:24.900
Boom, just take it
right off, okay?

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.667
Now these are things
that I hide in the kitchen

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:28.033
and keep for myself.

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:29.433
I just cut right
in between those

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:30.867
and you have
beautiful beef ribs.

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:32.600
And that's what I eat in the
kitchen while everybody else

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.000
is eating the
other stuff, okay?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.167
So now I've got just a
beautiful boneless roast.

00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:42.067
And at this point
it's kind of up to you

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:43.067
how you wanna slice it.

00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:44.800
But at this point,
it's very simple.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.133
All the bones
are removed.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.267
You're just gonna go as
thick or as thin as you want.

00:01:48.267 --> 00:01:49.900
Again, we always talk
about with prime rib

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.633
somebody wanting the end cut.

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.600
So probably what I would do

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.600
is make that a little
bit of a thicker cut

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.667
just to start,
okay?

00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:59.833
And again, straight down.

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:01.133
Beautiful end cut.

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:03.367
And then at this
point you can go

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:06.333
nice and thin
slices if you want.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.433
Okay, and then
you've got your

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:10.100
sort of classic
roast beef dinner.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.333
My favorite part about
this prime rib of beef

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.633
is all these little crispy parts

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.033
that fall off when
you're carving.

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:16.933
That's a good thing.

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:17.967
That's supposed to happen.

00:02:17.967 --> 00:02:19.133
You put that in
the pile of bones

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:21.300
and that's what the
chef gets to eat.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.933
So again, just straight down.

00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:24.533
And you can see the
length of the knife

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:26.167
is really important here.

00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:28.700
It gives us less of
a sawing motion,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.100
and I can just kind of make
a cleaner cut all the way down.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.567
So perfectly roasted prime rib.

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:37.633
Thick or thin, you know?

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:40.133
You got your future
father-in-law coming over.

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:41.467
You can go right
down the center,

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:43.033
give him that nice
two inch cut,

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:44.367
put that on his plate,

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:45.733
all your problems go away.

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:48.500
Perfectly roasted
holiday prime rib.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.667
It's a great thing to do.

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:51.533
Celebratory, try it at home.

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:52.633
Invite a bunch
of friends over

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:53.967
and have a blast.
