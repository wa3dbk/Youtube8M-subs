00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:10.800
[narrator] Mya is more than just
a pet to Chicago's Jacob Hyde,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.266
a veteran at the age of 26.

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.066
[Jacob Hyde] In the Marine
Corps you have what's called a

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:18.867
battle buddy and you're never
without another person.

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:20.467
You never do anything alone.

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:22.600
Since I've gotten Mya,
she's my battle buddy.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.867
I've constantly got
someone watching my back.

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:27.900
[narrator] Jacob struggles
to function in civilian life,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.667
diagnosed with PTSD...
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:33.734
[Jacob] It's hard, it's an
everyday struggle,

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:36.533
sitting on the floor thinking
about cutting myself

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.767
or wondering how I
can kill myself.

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:41.734
[narrator] Mya was trained by
an inmate thru a ground-breaking

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:44.266
program called
Puppies Behind Bars.

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:47.333
Jacob found the program
online, applied,

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.500
and was chosen to receive a dog.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.433
[Jacob] It was the happiest
I've ever felt in my life.

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:53.567
That night when I found out
she was going to be my dog.

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:56.100
[narrator] Mya learned to do
everything from opening and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.834
closing doors to putting
groceries in a basket,

00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:01.333
even putting laundry
in the washer.

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.533
[Jacob] If I feel really bad
and I'm having one of those

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:07.200
bad panic attacks on the floor ,
Mya goes to the bathroom and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.300
gets my pills that are in
a bag and she drags them
in here on the floor.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.433
She lays there, puts her paw in
my face and licks me and just

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:16.867
licks me until I come out
of it and stop shaking.

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:20.266
There's no limit to what
she can do for me,

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.834
[Jacob] Over one million
people have served in Iraq or

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:24.633
Afghanistan by the
end of this war.

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:27.800
Organizations like Puppies
Behind Bars support our troops

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.367
by putting service dogs in their
hands and allowing veterans

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:34.033
to get thru their lives

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:36.367
and allowing veterans to
want to stay alive.

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:38.900
[narrator] Donations
help cover the $30,000

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.667
cost to train the dogs.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.266
One strong supporter has been
the Rocky Mountain Conference

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:47.400
of The United Methodist Church.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.266
Now, with Mya's help, Jacob
is pursuing a doctorate in

00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:54.166
psychology, aiming to
help others like him.

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.367
[Jacob] She's the only way I
can get around in public now,

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:57.734
because of her.

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:02.233
And if I didn't have
her, I wouldn't survive.
