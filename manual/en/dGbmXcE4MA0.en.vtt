00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.140
Captain's Log, Stardate 9684.6

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:05.520
The Potemkin has been in orbit above Dolena for a week. Initially here to make second contact with this warp capable species, our mission has become one of search and rescue.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.120
Strike that.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.400
Search is the key word. The entire race has simply...disappeared.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.480
No sign of them or their civilization.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.200
We continue wide sensor scans, and every available crewman is engaged in ground-based searches.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.360
Nothing....  There is simply no trace of intelligent life to be found.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.800
We get stuck with the cadidiots.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.400
Cadets, Lieutenant Landon.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.880
Don't tell me you weren't overly eager to impress your senior officers.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.720
First time we met, you were quite the Cygnian puckerfish.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.560
I suppose, sir.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.720
These Dolendans are probably still fussing over who gets to meet us first.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.360
Word has it that they get their feelings hurt faster than Klingons.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.560
Sir, I'm getting life form readings, thirty meters out. There...and there...

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.760
Gather in. Ready your phasers.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.000
Dolendan?

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.520
Non-humanoid.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.960
Potemkin, are you reading these life signs?

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.280
Potemkin?

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.200
We're **STATIC** chroni **STATIC** ation.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.320
Auuuugggh!

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.520
Did you see anything?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.280
No, not a thing.

00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:48.807
Follow me.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.640
Form a circle!

00:02:54.722 --> 00:02:55.722
Face out!

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.440
Delaney to Potemkin!

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.840
Delaney to Potemkin!

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.600
MacKenzie to Potemkin!

00:03:07.861 --> 00:03:08.861
MacKenzie to Potemkin!

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.040
Please come in!   PLEASE!!

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.040
Nothing, sir.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.800
Sir! We can't just sit here waiting for.... whatever...  They're going to kill us!

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.280
Raptors.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.320
They didn't brief us on raptors.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.120
Raptors?

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.800
Earth dinosaurs, Drell.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.520
Jurassic period, I believe.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.880
Actually, the word raptor also refers to the predatory birds on your planet.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.760
They do not exist on Dolenda.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.560
Though the Dolendans do descend from--

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.200
Can you please stop with the science lesson?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.920
That's enough, Mister Burroughs.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.160
Yes, sir.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.880
It's okay.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.520
Class is dismissed.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.080
Spaval, check your tricorder.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.920
Aye, sir.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.560
There's interference from an unusual radiation.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.600
I'm unable to get an accurate scan of the area.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.640
Keep trying.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.040
Spaval!

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.560
No, we can't lose you, too.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.560
Commander Delaney, I suggest we go on the offensive.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.720
We don't have the time to wait for these raptors to--

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.074
Wait!

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.880
What did you just say?

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.120
Raptors?

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.320
No, no, no, no...

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.640
Time.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.880
What did Captain Grigory say?

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.520
Chrono...

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.760
Chronological?

00:04:40.673 --> 00:04:41.673
Chroniton.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.520
Radiation.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360
Chroniton radiation.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.720
You don't think that--

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.680
Drell!

00:05:17.554 --> 00:05:18.554
Ohhhh boyyyy....

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.000
Potemkin?

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.480
Beam us out.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.960
Now!

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.960
Thank you, Cadet.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.320
We found our observation probe on their first moon.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.160
It was definitely a chroniton bomb.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.480
Set off on the Northern continent, apparently by the Southern continent government.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.960
They sent their entire world back in time.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.000
Or... rather, just erased time.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.600
I'm still trying to wrap my head around it.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.360
So they're gone...forever?

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.480
The cadets performed well, sir.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.200
Young Mister Burroughs is a bit...impetuous.

00:06:16.328 --> 00:06:17.328
Brash...

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.560
Somewhat...impatiently arrogant at times.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.360
Sounds like a Xartheb.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.440
Fools and their toys...

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.480
All the time in the universe...

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.080
But not for them...

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.960
Not for them...
