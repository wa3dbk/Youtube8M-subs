00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:08.600
Greetings!

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.300
My name is Khadijat Rashid.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.166
I am a member

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:17.200
of the Presidential
Search Advisory Committee,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.133
the PSAC2014.

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:24.400
After an extensive
national search,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.200
the Gallaudet Presidential
Search Advisory Committee

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.567
and the Board
of Trustees are pleased

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:33.734
to announce three
presidential finalists.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:36.967
These finalists rose
to the top

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:42.066
during a very competitive
search process.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:45.467
The finalists are given
in alphabetical order:

00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:03.033
Their biographies and
resumes may be viewed at:

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.700
Each presidential finalist
will visit the campus

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.066
for one-and-a-half
days in September.

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:23.300
They will meet with
administrators, faculty,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.667
staff, students, alumni,

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:30.700
and other members
of the campus community.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.467
A community
forum will be held

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:37.633
during each of their visits.

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:38.767
Everyone is
invited and encouraged

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:44.734
to attend
the open public forums.

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:48.900
The Open Public Forums
will take place at 12:30pm

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.133
in Elstad Auditorium.

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:56.300
The schedule
is as follows:

00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:12.233
All Public Forums
will be live streamed.

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:14.934
Further details

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:20.333
will be announced.

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:23.367
After the campus visits
are completed,

00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:27.834
the Board of Trustees will
interview the candidates

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:32.266
at their October board meeting.

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:33.800
The final selection
will be announced

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.100

of the fall semester.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.300
