00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.933
The Alhambra in Granada is one of the most
spectacular sights we can see today.

00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.767
Its oldest part is the Alcazaba.

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:14.100
It's a military enclosure,
so it has several towers, 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.200
like those of the Vela and the Tribute,
among others.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.500
The Alcazaba, called qa'lat al-Hamra,
meaning Red Castle,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.367
will give its name later to
the whole monument,

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:30.367
That will be known as Madina al-Hamra,
the city of Alhambra.

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:34.667
Next to the Alcazaba arises
to the rear a city palace.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:38.433
The complex of Palaces Nazari,
which could be seven,

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:43.133
begins with the Mexuar,
which operated the Royal Court.

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.400
Annexed to this one, 
stood the Palace of Comares, 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.900
organized around the Grand Courtyard
of the Myrtles.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.633
The Courtyard of the Myrtles
was the center of the diplomatic

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:56.100
and political activity
of the Alhambra. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.833
It held great receptions and was the site 

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:03.433
where the personalities waited
to be received by the sultan.

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:06.200
In the Courtyard, 
the pool water managed 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.300
to amaze visitors with
a spectacular mirror effect,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.833
reflecting the arches 
and the Tower of Comares,

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:17.067
and made the building a floating palace. 

00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:21.400
All the NazarÃ­es Palaces are completed
with the complex of buildings

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.667
located around the Patio de los Leones,

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:28.600
perhaps the most emblematic
place of the Alhambra.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.200
This was the core of the sultan's
private residence,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.700
which also had a few units for women.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.367
Along with the buildings cited, other
minor buildings completed the Alhambra. 

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:45.100
Among them we can cite, as an example, 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.200
the Puerta del Vino, 
the sparrow gardens

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.133
or the more than 30 towers that made up
the wall, of which today there remain only 22.

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:56.000
The Christian conquest of Granada 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.700
was the beginning of major
changes on the compound of the Alhambra.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.267
Above all, stands the Palace of Charles V, 

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:10.733
who tried to build a high political
and residential center of the Empire.

00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:14.633
The Christian building was also
the church of Santa Maria,

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:20.033
built on the ruins of what it was
the great real mosque.

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:24.267
Built for the enjoyment of the senses.

00:02:24.267 --> 00:02:27.133
the Alhambra that we view today is
very different from its original being

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:30.800
although it remains amazing to the visitor
for its splendor and grandeur.
