00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.970
Hi. Misty Owen here with MicroChunk.tv.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.240
Wanted to show you  how I use my iPhone.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.700
So I turn it on, 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.500
and one thing I do is send my husband text messages.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:39.300
Lets see: Dear Owen, I love you. Send.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.470
Ok so I send text messages, I make phone calls,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.130
and talk. 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.400
I check voice mail. 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.730
I even check my email. Lets see.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.500
I have 2 emails in here. 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.270
Sometimes I take pictures... 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.700
And sometimes I view those pictures.  Lets see, here are some pictures.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.540
Pictures, pictures. 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.200
I put appointments on my calendar. Lets see the appointments today...

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.980
Appointments Saturday. 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.630
I don't use iTunes, and I don't use Stocks.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.160
Sometimes I watch YouTube videos. Lets see what we can find:

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.540
Search. 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.860
Oh like here; Here we go, YouTube video.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.770
My husband is texting me: I love you.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.460
So there you can search YouTube videos. 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.200
The only thing I don't like is you can't rate the videos,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.470
and you can't comment on  here with this feature.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:04.560
Sometimes I surf the internet. And pull up long pages,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.400
you know, it's nice on your own. 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.160
Here's one. 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.860
Sometimes I use the iPod and listen to music.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.970
Lets see we can go this way. And flip through album

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.240
if we want. 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.170
Then play it. 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.470
Yeah, that one is pretty cool. 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:41.160
I love the Maps feature. The other day we were out,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.800
looking for a restaurant. We clicked this up and

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.370
found the closest restaurant. It was really nice.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.490
So now you can search. Lets do driving directions.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.870
Here I search for two different addresses. I can go List,

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.740
and it tells you every turn to take. You can scroll up,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.700
or you can go to map, and if you push this next button,

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.540
it takes you to each different  step on the map.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.800
And tells you exactly how many miles and were to turn.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.470
Pretty cool. 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.930
So that's how I use my iPhone. 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.430
