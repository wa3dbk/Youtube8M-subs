00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.810
Hey youtubers it’s Charlie and recently
some Book 4 footage aired during a tv trailer

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.810
for book 3.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.870
There are a couple of reasons why I think
it’s legit.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.519
Mostly because a similar thing happened before
book 3 where an international trailer for

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.999
book 2 feature book 3 footage.

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.370
So same drill and it gives us a good idea
for who the villain might be.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.760
We also got a release date and details on
the extras for the book 3 dvd.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.600
If you’re just finding me for the first
time yes Korra book 3 is over, but I’ll

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.860
be doing bonus videos until book 4 gets here
and I’ll also be doing videos for star wars

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.140
rebels in october when it gets here.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.850
So subscribe to get everything.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.160
So important stuff first, Kuvira and the Book
4 footage.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.390
We all knew something was up with her.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.179
Nobody gets that much screen time in the finale
without being important.

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.700
The trailer the footage appeared in wasn’t
an official book 4 trailer.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.600
It was a book 3 trailer for nicktoons.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.929
Weird, I know.

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:55.050
But it included scenes of Kuvira with a very
evil look on her face addressing what looks

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.679
to be a Red Lotus council.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:04.589
This suggests a lot about what the time frame
and plot of Book 4 is going to be.

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.939
A continuation of Zaheer’s plot to throw
the world into chaos.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:19.760
We don’t have any confirmation on what Kuvira’s
backstory is but there are some interesting

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.760
theories.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.850
She resembles Zaheer and Suyin Beifong so
the best theory I’ve seen so far was that

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.990
she’s their love child and was raised in
the doctrine of the red lotus.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.670
The timelines are a little fuzzy but here’s
what we know.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.990
The Red Lotus was formed after the 100 year
war by Xai Bau after he got pissed that they

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.560
White Lotus was turned into what he saw as
glorified servants of the Avatar.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.850
Xai Bau grove in the spirit world is the place
where Korra confronted Zaheer.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.710
So I’m guessing the grove was a place where
Xai Bau would communicate with his fellow

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.859
red lotus members or meditate by himself and
Zaheer just continued the tradition.

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.170
Using the spirit realm to skype each other
is pretty badass.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.799
Eventually, Team Zaheer and Unalaq are brought
in to the order.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.710
Probably around the time they were Korra’s
age.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.190
Cut to 13 years ago, Zaheer and company are
captured trying to kidnap korra.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.390
Now that we know what Zaheer’s plan was,
doesn’t it sound so much more sinister.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.510
They would have probably done that same thing
with her when she was a little girl.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.420
That’s just dark, even for Legend of Korra.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.200
It seems like Korra and Kuvira aren’t too
far apart in age, so it’s possible that

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.750
shortly after becoming part of the Red Lotus,
Zaheer and Suyin met and eventually had a

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.750
child.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.030
Or Kuvira could be the child of other red
lotus members.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.159
Either way, if she’s part of it.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:56.250
It means they’ve recruited a lot of other
people too in the last 13 years.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.870
There’s a lot of contradictory evidence
for the Suyin Zaheer Red Lotus Love Child

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.349
theory, but since Suyin shares a lot of the
anti-establishment beliefs zaheer talked about

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.610
it’s possible she was at one time associated
with him but she didn’t become part of the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.630
red lotus.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.370
If she were a full on red lotus member she
probably would have let korra die.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.689
There’s also the possibility that Kuvira
has absolutely no ties to anyone on Team Korra

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:26.260
or the Red Lotus, she’s a completely new
character who’s not trying to avenge some

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.260
old family wound.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.920
It also doesn’t guarantee that she’s the
big villain either.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.769
She could just be working with someone greater.

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.250
A more classic villain.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.440
There’s still a lot we don’t know about
Book 4’s story.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.989
I’m hoping that Bryke reveals some new details
at New York Comic Con in october.

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.750
They’re doing a korra panel, so if you’re
going I recommend you sit in on the panel.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.620
They’ll probably reveal some key art animation
and they might reveal the official book 4

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.260
premiere date.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.470
Right now the Australian book 4 premiere is
listed as January.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.230
That doesn’t guarantee it will be January
in North America or anywhere else in the world.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.140
Book 3 is only just starting to air in Australia
in October.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.250
And during a recent interview, Bryke revealed
that the whole summer korra premiere this

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.409
year was totally unplanned.

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.170
But until we hear otherwise, plan for a January
Book 4 premiere.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.620
Regardless of when, they’ll be posting episodes
digitally in all the same places, on nick

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.800
dot com, amazon, the google play store.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.660
Everywhere but itunes for some strange reason.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.120
Book 4 will not air on television.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.960
The next big thing is the book 3 dvd.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.570
It’s out December 2nd in the United States.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.440
Not sure for an international date.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.900
But probably not super long after that.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.060
The bonus features are pretty similar to the
book 2 dvd.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.190
There’s audio commentaries for all 13 episodes
and 13 animatics on the Blu Ray.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.919
The DVD version only has 4 commentaries and
all the animatics.

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.250
So the difference in the Blu Ray and the DVD
is you get fewer commentaries.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.020
I’ll probably give a few copies away so
be sure to subscribe to get all my korra videos

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.020
this fall.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.600
And just to explain the Rebels stuff.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.330
Rebels will be the new animated show I do
videos for.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.729
I’ll be posting another big video for that
in the next week or two.

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:18.870
So look out for it.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:26.410
But that show is airing on Disney XD monday
nights.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.160
The premiere isn’t till October 13th, but
on the 3rd they’re doing a one hour special.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.180
I’ll explain more in a rebels bonus video.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.850
But Disney is creating a Star Wars Cinematic
Universe just like Marvel has, so the tv shows

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.990
and the books and the comics will all influence
what happens in the movies.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:52.419
So 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.950
watching Rebels will help you understand what’s
going on in Episode 7.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.790
Dave Filoni is in charge of everything on
the show.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.389
He did Clone Wars and he used to be an animation
director for Mike and Bryan during the Avatar

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:27.669
Last Airbender days.

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:33.009
Right now click here for my Korra Book 4 predictions
and click here to learn more about Star Wars

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:34.009
Rebels.

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:35.780
Thanks for watching, see you guys tomorrow.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.470
High Fives!
