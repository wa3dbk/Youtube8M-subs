00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.940
MUST HAVE

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.440
Ski is a sport of coordination, meaning that we need to coordinate different actions

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.620
and movements on different axis and directions.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:01:04.580
Looking at the skier’s motion we can realize that there are three actions that must be coordinated:

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:13.020
the skier’s inclination, the edging, the dosing of the muscular contraction.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.220
These are 3 must-to-have conditions.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.100
Without one of these there is no way to properly ski.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.700
 Inclination,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.860
edging,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.540
structure, that is able to resist

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.500
and to produce the needed loads.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.900
So the ability to lean is necessary. We set the inclination entering in the turn.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.020
The second condition is the ability to master the foot so to carve the ground.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.700
When we arrive at the moment of attacking the turn and we have to develop the turn

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:23.800
it is needed that the muscles are activate to give strength to the edging,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.460
so that the energy of the moving body is conveyed to the ground.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.760
In this way we obtain the reaction from the ground itself,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.740
which represents our banking and let us turn.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.520
A series of turn is like a beautiful game

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.680
of passing from one banking to the next one.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.240
Between these two leanings there is a capsizing to get ready for the following one.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.260
The phase of getting ready to this leaning is the entrance of the turn when the skier performs

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.600
the first two actions: inclination of the body and inclination of the skis,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.120
to get ready to face the "strong" part of the turn.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.260
The skier here gets out from a turn, capsizes, changes inclination and gets the new inclination

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:24.740
for both body and skis. The position is pretty compact, crossing the axis of the ski which is going ahead.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:34.360
These actions of body and ski inclination are preparatory to the phase of the second third of the turn,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.040
 when the muscular contraction allows to convey energy to the ground and to receive the ground’s reaction 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.120
which is what let us change direction and close the turn.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.580
Closing the turn, capsizing again,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.760
next turn, capsizing again.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.420
So the three actions: body’s inclination 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.140
entering in the turn, foot’s inclination and then

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.860
muscular contraction produce the turn

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.180
and the correct movement of the skier.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.840
Here we can see a soft action with long turns

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.480
on easy snow,

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.020
Here the slope is steeper

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.660
and the skiing is more agonistic.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.960
The inclination is chosen

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.660
with a certain degree of courage 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.740
and the muscular contraction is expressed with a good intensity.
