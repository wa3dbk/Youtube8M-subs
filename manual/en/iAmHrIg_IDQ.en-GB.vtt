00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.440
Sony SmartWatch 3 and SmartBand Talk.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.360
Expected Autumn 2014.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.450
Two new wearable devices, the Sony SmartWatch
3 and Sony SmartBand Talk serve similar markets

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.340
in very different ways.
While the SmartWatch 3 is an Android Wear

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.550
device, much like many rivals that seem to
be appearing, the SmartBand is a

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.670
much simpler device which actually makes it
rather more interesting.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.960
Sony SmartWatch 3.
There's no doubt that smartwatches

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.670
are the current in-thing (at least with
manufacturers), but Sony have been

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.160
at this for a while (as you can tell
from the name). This is the first Sony

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.820
smartwatch to run Android Wear, a
platform specifically designed for

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.100
wearable devices such as this.
The Smartwatch 3 features a 1.6"

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.449
transflective 320 x 320 pixel display,
has a quad-core 1.2GHz ARM A7 CPU

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.080
with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of flash
memory, is IP68 rated against dust

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.190
and water, supports both NFC and Bluetooth
4.0 and it comes with a bunch of sensors including

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.160
GPS, a compass and
accelerometer. Inside is a 420 mAh battery

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.710
(quoted as giving 2 days normal use), and
the Smartwatch 3 weighs 45 grams. It

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.840
should work with any phone running Android
4.3 or above.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.390
It isn't a bad looking device, but the physical
design does look a bit out of date compared

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.650
to smartwatches such as the LG G
Watch R, Samsung Gear S and Motorola Moto

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.360
360.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.200
Sony SmartBand Talk.
The SmartBand Talk is a classified as a lifelogger

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.520
rather
than a smartwatch, but unlike some other similar

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.170
bands
this one can make voice calls (via your mobile),

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.970
it also
displays notifications and comes with an alarm

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.970
clock. Both
this and the Smartwatch 3 support Sony Lifelog,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.720
an Android
application that records where you are and

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.170
to an extent
what you were doing.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.980
The display is a 1.4" 296 x 128 pixel e-ink
panel that is

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.021
nicely curved, rather than the flat screen
on the

00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:16.810
Smartwatch. The low power requirements of
this device

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.170
means that it can function for three days
on a tiny 65 mAh

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.190
battery, and the whole thing weighs a mere
24 grams, half

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.480
that of the SmartWatch. This is also an IP68
rated device

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.360
with Bluetooth 4.0, but in this case you will
need an Android 4.4 device to go with it.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.020
Unless you need the full functionality of
a smartwatch, then the SmartBand Talk looks

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.819
like a more lightweight (and probably
cheaper) alternative. Sony say that both devices

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.180
should be available during the Autumn although
no guidance was given on

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.590
price.
