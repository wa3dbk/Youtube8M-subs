00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.930
Hi this is Julie with beadaholique.com and today I show you how to make

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.600
a memory wire bracelet using czech glass
Pastella beads. I thought 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.900
I'd take this opportunity to show you the
lovely colors in these Pastella beads

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.060
I just love the different hues that are
available. To me they have a very vintage

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.130
retro look

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.560
which I adore. If you see my other videos you'd know that

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.800
and here's eight millimeter size and
then it also comes in a

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.100
six and a four

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.269
So 8, 6 and 4 and for this particular
project

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.710
I wanna go ahead and use 8 because
they take up a lot of nice space when

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.460
you're doing a memory wire bracelet

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.720
and there's a lot of different color
combos you can do

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.430
I'm going to do these three colors right
here

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.960
but it would have been equally as pretty
with that color combo there

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.260
or I could have even done this one. It's fun
to play with the colors

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.520
right now though I wanna work with
these three colors

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.789
and what you're going to need is

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.979
your memory wire. I actually have a half of

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.570
a 12 coil memory wire piece right here, so
6 coils. I'm actually not going to use all

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.159
of this

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.549
that's what's great about memory wire.
Sometimes you can get two or three

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.409
bracelets

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.840
out of a larger coil. I have my beads and I need a pair

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.630
round nose pliers, memory wire
cutters. You're not going to want to use

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.100
your regular flush cutters, this is super
strong, it will hurt them

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.439
but you'd can easily cut with memory
wire cutters and then I'm not going to use

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.929
tape but I'll show you a little trick you can
do with

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.380
tape. Now I'm going to finish the end by
creating a simple wire loop

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.689
you can also use memory wire end caps
which we have another video on 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.159
Beadaholique.com but I wanted to really show you how to make a memory wire bracelet

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.400
really needing to buy a lot of extra
stuff. So I'm just gonna take

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.569
my round nose pliers. I'm going to grip that

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.569
end of the memory wire between the two
noses

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.840
and I'm just going to rotate around. You
can see I'm creating a little loop right

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.500
there

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.019
and I going to finish it. You can either
leave it like that or if you want it to be

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.140
a little bit straighter you can just bend
it back

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.069
like so. That is gonna stop my beads and that's all I really need to do

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.959
so I'm going to go ahead. I am

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.989
going to cut open my beads. I'm going to start these beads here

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.129
take them off the strand. I did forget to show you the little tip

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.840
with the tape. So if I had not already done this. So

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.319
I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to do a stripe of this, stripe of this, stripe of that

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.049
but perhaps you're creating a project
where you don't really know

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.500
what order of the beads you on a string on your memory wire. You could start by making a

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.819
little simple wire loop

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.420
and then what would happen is you would string on some beads

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.250
if you don't like them, you would take them all off and then restring them on

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.700
repeat that process until you're happy
with your design but

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.019
what I like to do if I'm not sure is take

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.000
the end, now let's pretend I don't have
that there and this was

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.360
what was going to be my end and just put a little piece

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.819
of tape over it as a stopper

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.049
so now what would happen is let's say I've strung my beads and I've got maybe 3 or 4

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:21.720
coils but

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.900
I don't really like the first couple
beads that I strung but instead of

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.239
having to unwind all your beads and take
them all off

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.420
to get to these end ones, you just take
your piece a tape of

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.870
and then slip them off this end and then
replace whatever you want to replace

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.629
them with

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.400
it's a lot easier and a nice time saver but
in this instance I do know what I'm

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:42.890
going to do

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.540
so I'm just going to pull my beads

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.719
off of string that they came on. Again
these are

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:53.269
czech glass Pastella beads. They've got a wonderful shine to them

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.560
very uniform in shape. I thought they'd
be perfect for this type of project

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.909
memory wire sometimes

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.269
like you can see I kinda unwound it
right there but it will always go back

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.200
to it's shape

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.659
which is wonderful and I'm just going to
place

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:16.659
the beads onto the memory wire

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.520
and what I like to do is after I've got a couple on here

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.250
I like to make sure they scoot down to
the bottom, so I just hold my memory wire

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.590
and I kinda twirl them down

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.440
and then that loop we made in the beginning asks as it should

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.970
it stops the beads and I'm just gonna
continue stringing my beads

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.440
that color is done

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.520
It's actually pretty fun to do that

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.380
go and I'm ready to start my next color

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.380
cut this strand

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.600
and I'm going to get this one ready. Now just follow the exact same process

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.800
okay I have strung all my beads

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.100
and slip them down to the end

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.760
so now to finish it you're going to make
sure that your beads are tight. That

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.320
there's no

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.860
big gaps in there, you're gonna wanna go
ahead

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.010
and cut your memory wire about an

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.380
1/4th of an inch maybe a tad bit more

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.420
from your last bead

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.630
Do the same technique we did before. We're going to grab that end

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.110
and we're gonna twist it just making

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.650
a simple wire loop and kink it back
like I did with the other one

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.900
here we go

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.050
we are set. Now you could add a
decorative dangle

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.470
you could have left maybe one of these
beads off on each end

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.700
put it onto a head pin and made a simple wire loop

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.300
hung one from each. That's definitely an
option or you could finish it

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.610
like this and to put a memory wire
bracelet on

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.020
just going to

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.800
slip it onto your wrist

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.750
You've got a really fun fashionable
bracelet that did not take very much

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:34.440
time

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.770
required very few tools and very few
ingredients

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.180
and again this how to make memory wire
bracelet

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.790
using Pastella beads which you can
