Hi! This is Dave for expertvillage.com. We’re
making jambalaya today. I like to get everything

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:24.180
done ahead of time, so I can put every layer
everything in the pan one at a time as I go.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.340
I simply like to do it concurrently; we have
already done the meat. So, we have done the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.710
ham and the sausage: those are all ready go
to. Next, we are going to be doing celery,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.260
bell pepper and onion, again the trinity,
and then the green onions will go in later.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.399
So let’s start out with a couple of celery
stalks, this is going to be about 10 cups

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:55.109
but again this is for a 100 people. I usually
like to split the celery length wise, so again

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:12.680
I get about a medium dice, just cut them across
and again for this amount of people, you probably

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:22.009
have about 10 cups but let me show the bell
pepper, this one I would like to split first,

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:39.430
and we’ll take out the insides like this,
and back in your pan, and we will be washing

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.130
these shortly, but again I would like to go
through the length wise from the inside out.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.281
It seems to be able to give you a better retraction
on your knife, so you do not get cut. So you

00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:59.060
cut it in this direction, and then you got
it ready again, to make into a small pieces

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:32.080
again, medium dice,
show you that one again… then will show

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.769
you the onion. These are just yellow onions,
you can use sweet onions if you would like,

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.959
but I don’t find it necessary, since the
whole dish will have plenty of flavors in

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.310
it. I would like to cut the onion down to
size like this, and whatever size dice you

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:56.409
like, and I again like the medium dice, so
lets go across like this and again may be

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:14.280
this way, once or twice and then you can then
dice to whatever slice you would like here.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.670
So, then here you have the trinity.
