00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.380
In this video I would like to show you my...

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:08.800
Pistol Crossbow.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.500
I made this pistol Crossbow because

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.760
I was trying to test out

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.920
a new trigger mechanism

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.190
which I am going to show you now.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.900
You can see, over here, there is a notch.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.170
The string will be held behind this notch.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.950
So when you pull the trigger...

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.279
You can see the little part of the trigger
there,

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.060
That part of the trigger pushes the string,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.380
out of the notch,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.099
which shoots the... bolt.

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.970
That's it.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.009
I am using the same bolts as before,

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.890
but in this one I have actually...

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.790
slightly cut down the flights

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.469
because it has to fit through this front sight.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.649
So... Let's shoot with it.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.800
So to cock the weapon, all you have to do

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.550
is pull this back.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.429
And the weapon is cocked.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:56.010
Then you take the bolt and just load it as
usual,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.010
And then fire away!

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.600
[-------]

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.600
Okay!

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.600
uh...

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.300
Okay! Even though the weapon is not accurate

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.009
it's actually quite strong.

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.070
So I can actually shoot from a farther distance.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.109
Like... 10 to 15 feet.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.799
But when I shoot from such a long distance,

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.079
the bolt is most likely to go far off

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.909
from the target I am aiming at.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.929
So... But the weapon is strong.

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:11.929
So I can shoot from here.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.470
So I hope you have enjoyed this video.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.280
Thanks for watching.
