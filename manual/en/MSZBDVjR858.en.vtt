00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:08.500
We wanted to talk with Kim about taking care
of Midnight's teeth in the future, and so

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.280
we're going to talk a little bit about dental
care as well as things that can happen if

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.150
you don't have good dental care. Do you know
much about dental care? No. Okay. Well, I

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.560
wanted to show you this little model that
we have about what happens if you don't do

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.730
some dental work with your kitty cats. Now,
on this side over here, you see what the normal

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.900
adult teeth look like, and on this side, you
can see what happens with the tartar build

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.700
up here, and all of the gum disease. See how
red it is here? And then you can actually

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.820
have broken teeth and this is a broken tooth
over here. So, there are lots of things that

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.440
really need to be specially taken care of.
Now, we actually recommend that you at least

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.390
attempt to learn how to brush your cat's teeth.
We have a special brush that kind of fits

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.180
on the end of your finger and some very special
tooth paste that's designed for kitty cats

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.230
so they like the taste of it. And my feeling
is that if you take your cat when it's young

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.280
like this, and you start teaching your cat
how to enjoy having the teeth brushed, then

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.170
it's not very much of a problem for you to
get it done. And the idea again, is a training

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.320
process. It might even take you a whole month
to do it, but you try and make it fun. You

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.280
tell your kitty cat every day, let's brush
and you come over and let him taste it the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.950
first day. Touch a tooth the next day. Maybe
do a tiny bit of work on the tooth on the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.189
next day, and then ultimately after thirty
days, your kitty cat should let you brush.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.230
Your cat's a little bit too young, but we
have a special diet when your cat's about

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.090
a year age, we're going to recommend that
you switch to this diet. It's called TD and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.160
it's a prescription diet from Hills, and this
is one of my favorite products that's been

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.590
invented since I've been a veterinarian because
super good nutrition for your cat. As your

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.720
cat eats it, it cleans the teeth, and most
cats, which is a pretty rare instance, love

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.579
this food. It's really hard to find a cat
food that all the cats like and this is one

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.979
of them. Also the good news is that Hill's
backs this a hundred percent, if your cat

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.340
doesn't like it or you don't like it for any
reason, you come back and get your money back,

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.040
so we're not going to send it today, but I
want you to be aware of it so when your cat

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.480
gets to be about a year of age, you can avoid
the dental disease like we've seen here, cause

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.340
when you're, when the teeth start to look
like this, you actually have to put your cat

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.980
under anesthesia to clean them and get rid
of all the tartar and get the teeth healthy

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.290
again. So do you have any questions about
dental care today? No, that's perfect. Great.
