Hi! I'm Matthew Christian from Tampa, Florida
and on behalf of Expert Village, today we

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.870
are going to talk about the proper use of
a high speed polishing machine. For demonstration

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.330
purposes, I went ahead and removed the screws
ahead of time. What I want to show you is

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.060
how to repack the grease into the gear box
of your high speed buffer. On a brand new

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.180
machine, this isn't necessary. But after extended
use of maybe ten hours, you may want to at

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.530
least open it up and check it but the grease
will be pushed out of the gear box. Just simply

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:46.470
remove all of the screws and gently one more
screw.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:54.790
Okay so I will expose the gear box carefully
taking it apart. If you notice you look inside,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.100
normally this gear box area here would be
packed full of grease. Of course, the gears

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.790
do take up some of the space but a lot of
the grease has been pushed out. What we want

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:11.270
to do is replace that grease into the gear
box. If you want to go the extra mile, you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:19.290
could remove this dirty grease and repack
it with the appropriate new grease. But for

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.960
all practical purposes, we are just going
to push some of this grease back into the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:44.409
gear box and replace the cover.
Again, gently replace the case, make sure

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:52.920
the gears line up
and then we will replace our screws.
