00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.669
Hi this is Megan with Beadaholique.com and today I want to show you
just want to see

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.699
real quick

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.679
how to use a snap on bail and there
are

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:21.529
a couple of different types of snap on bails.
There's ones that are

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:22.539
just

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.640
from the side, they're just a round

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.529
loop of metal. It's just a tension thing
you just push it in but I wanted to show you

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.990
specifically

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.150
this kind of snap on bail which is
actually hinged with a little snap

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.700
and this is perfect for using if you
want to be able to change

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.500
your pendant from one necklace to
another really easily

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.410
so if you have a charm that already
has a jump ring or if you

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.910
have pendant

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.640
with a loop, all you're going to do is
open the loop

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.230
stick it on the little ring at the
bottom of the bail

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.120
and then as long as your

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.650
necklace will fit through

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.910
the opening at the top of the bail

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.490
you can switch this on and off to any
finished a necklace that you have that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.960
you want. So it's a really great way to
interchange and decide

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.070
either what pending you one on your
favorite necklace that day or which

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.280
necklace you want to wear your favorite
pendant on

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.130
so all you do is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.690
open that up

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.430
and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.890
put the necklace in

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.470
and snap it back closed

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.660
and you don't see any of that from the
front

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.090
so from the front

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.840
it's just a pretty bail

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.930
and we have a few different styles of
these too so you can pick the one that

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.050
you like best and

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.020
you would have a hard time normally getting
the clasp on a finished necklace

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.540
through a pendant bail

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.850
so it can be a really great
solution if you wanna switch those out
