Who’s afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Once upon a time, there were three little brother pigs who lived happily in the forest.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Although they were brothers, they had very different characteristics from one another.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The oldest one was considered as being a very reasonable pig, a hard worker and he was called Technician.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The middle brother, wearing a yellow shirt, was used to do many physical activities, and so he was known as Athletic.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The youngest one, wearing a strip shirt, was called Playful, as his thoughts were just about having fun.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Despite their differences, they got along very well.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:19.000
One day, at a family meeting, they came to the conclusion that it was time to have their own home, since they were already well grown.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Playful rapidly built a straw house, and so he had plenty of time for his games.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Athletic decided to build a wooden house, where unload tree trunks was a considerable physical effort.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Athletic, Let’s play? Stop working, the house is already finished. Let’s go to swim on the lake. I think it is going to be very fun. We can play of jump into the water. Quickly, I am dying to play.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Calm down, I am going.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Technician, in turn, decided to build a brick house, because he believed that his house should be strong and resistant to anything.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Hey, Technician, Athletic and I are going to play at the lake. Come with us, it will be a great fun. We will play a lot.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
No, I can’t go now. They say that the Big Bad Wolf is close by. I need to finish building my house. I need to work, there is still a lot to be done.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Music: Who’s afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, who’s afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, la la la

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You can keep jumping and singing, but when the Wolf comes, it’s me who will sing.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But the Wolf didn’t come, instead, a heavy rain that lasted several days.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Technician failed finishing his house and still got a huge cold. He had to ask for shelter in his brother’s house, which was already finished.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:02.000
After all, my friends, not always things happen as technicians imagine.
