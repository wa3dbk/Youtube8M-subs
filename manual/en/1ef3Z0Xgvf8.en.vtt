00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.500
Now the one thing about champagne (and I don't
want to lie to you), in the end if you want

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.410
to go for a prestige Cuvee, and you feel like
you've got people you'd like to impress, it

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.809
is absolutely worth doing. It's a lot of fun;
you get (sometimes) these wonderful boxes.

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.950
You can get wines that are in larger bottles;
you've got a magnum here, and then you've

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.010
got a double mag here or a gere boum. There
are all sorts of these fun, different names

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.060
for all the different types of bottles. Sometimes
you get this nice packaging. This is Cristal,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.390
which you all know about and it's so expensive,
I didn't actually even get the wine. But,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.269
this is made in crystal bottle and legend
was that something along the lines that this

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.109
was Napoleon's favorite champagne. He was
afraid that someone was going to poison him,

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.680
so he had it made in a crystal bottle so that
it would be easier to see if there were any

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.729
impurities in the bottles. But I think the
true story is that he was having it shipped

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:58.420
all they way from Russia, or shipped into
Russia when he was trying to conquer them

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.001
and falling back and still drinking a lot
of champagne, I think to celebrate in the

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:05.030
beginning and to drown his sorrows as they
were pushed farther and farther back. But,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.549
Cristal has become a champagne, much like
Dom Perionon, that people see a lot. You see

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.920
it in a lot of videos and in the prestige
clubs and the areas, the VIP areas. And I

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.439
have to tell you, that although Cristal is
very expensive and it's gotten a lot of exposure,

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.009
it's still a magnificent champagne. And what
you need to do with champagne is to find out

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.880
which house you like the most. And there are
some that are lighter, there are some that

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.789
are heavier, there are some that are more
toasty in that they really do taste like or

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:40.509
smell like toasted oat, or toasted bread (pardon
me). And what you are really looking for is

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.340
to find the house that you like the most.
Once you've found that house style, know once

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.829
again, we've got Louis Roederer in California,
and we've got Louis Roederer in France and

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.009
they both try to maintain a certain house
style. You will find that house style goes

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.540
all the way from the non-prestigious Brut,
all the way up to the prestige Cuvee. We've

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.700
got a number of different producers that you
may or may not have heard of. We've got Deutz

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.929
here, and we've also got Charles Heidsieck.
There's another thing on the menu...on the

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.590
label here, is it says "monopole." "Monopole"
means that it comes from a single, enclosed

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.260
vineyard. And, one of the things about champagne
that's very important (like all wines), is

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.819
where the grapes come from and who's tending
them. And when you have a vineyard that is

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.379
enclosed, you tend to have a very, very clear
sense of how you are growing; a clear sense

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.560
of the climate that grows best, and the type
of pruning techniques and the type of vitrifying

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.560
techniques in terms of how they make the wine
later on. So, they tend to have a bit more

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.280
prestige. As you can see, along with this
rose, you've got a slightly different color.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.180
And that has to do with house style again,
and it's about what style they like to use.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.659
So, the one thing that I really want to make
sure that you walk away with is: up and down

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.379
the line, there are different uses, but you
can find great sparkling and/or champagne

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:11.709
wines for a reasonable price and you should
think about using it in more than just a celebratory

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:11.859
manner.
