00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.799
This is an example for a single condensable
component of vapor-liquid equilibrium. In

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.430
this case we have liquid water in equilibrium
with water vapor and air. This is in a piston

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.500
cylinder type of system. So we start with
a drawing. The idea is that we have a piston

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:29.980
with a weight, and liquid water in equilibrium
with water vapor and air. The total pressure

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.450
defined in the problem statement is 1.2 atm.
Since it is a piston, and a cylinder and we

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.300
don't change the weight, that means we keep
that pressure constant. We are also going

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.490
to keep the temperature constant as specified
in the problem. The question is if we were

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.250
to attach some kind of syringe and remove
some of the air, but no water vapor. What

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.329
would happen in this system? So let's look at
this from the view point of using the ideal

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.510
gas law, and assuming vapor-liquid equilibrium.
If we keep the temperature constant, then

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.720
that means that the saturation pressure for
water would not change, since it is just a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.539
function of temperature. We can calculate
that using the Antoine equations. So we start

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:18.700
out with pressure of the water must be at
Psat because we are at vapor-liquid equilibrium,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.560
and there is no air in the water. When we
remove some of the air we decrease the gas

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.819
phase volume, but we are keeping the total
pressure constant, and the total pressure

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.670
is the pressure of the air and the pressure
of the water. Now we know that the total pressure

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.920
is 1.2 atm, but we don't really know the values of these other numbers, but we can pick reasonable

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.689
amounts based on their temperatures. Since
we know the partial pressure of water is

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.740
just the saturation pressure. We will choose
0.1 atm. Since that is pretty reasonable.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.479
This won't change so that means that the partial
pressure of air won't change. So if we start

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.709
at 1.1 atm then we will finish at 1.1 atm.
So what does this mean if remove the water?

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:08.179
Well we can take a look at the ideal gas law
for air. The ideal gas law for air is

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.060
just going to be the pressure of the air times
the volume, and that is going to be equal

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.260
to the moles the gas constant R, and temperature,
and we now that the temperature and gas constant

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.420
are constant in this case, and the pressure
is 1.1 atm. So if we are decreasing the moles

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.320
of air. Since we are removing them. That means
that the volume must also decrease. We removed

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.989
half the air, which means that we will have
half the initial volume that we did in the

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.769
container. We also write partial pressure
of water in terms of the ideal gas law. So

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.510
we can say that the partial pressure of water
times the volume of the container is going

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.990
to be moles of water times the gas constant
times the temperature, and again we know that

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.219
the temperature and gas constant are constant
in this case, and we know that the pressure

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:03.189
of water is just the saturation pressure,
which is constant as a function of the temperature.

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:08.510
So as the volume decreases. We are also going
to decrease the moles of water in the vapor

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.200
phase. So moles of water is just going to
be half of the initial moles. That we had

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.140
to start with. So we are going to conclude
that if we just remove air from the gas phase.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.849
Then the water must condense, because we can't
have a pressure in the system higher than

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.069
the saturation pressure of water. Since we halve
the volume available for the water, we must

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.629
also halve the number of moles to have
the same saturation pressure of water, and

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.739
of course if this were a non-ideal gas, the
same ideas would apply.
