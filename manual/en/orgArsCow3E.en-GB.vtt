00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.360
What's this ? The needle's tip is blunt..

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.120
It's not stitching properly.. Hey, Idiot..

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.720
Mmm..

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.640
Come here.. Go and buy a good needle from the shop..

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.180
I'm playing here, Guru.. Tell this Stupid to go..

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.780
I am the leader of the game.. how can I go, Guru?

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.500
Okay. why the competition between you ?

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.920
Needle is an important thing in life..

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.180
It brings together what's been separated..

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.820
So, you all go together and buy it..

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.140
All right. Come on everyone..

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.680
Shopkeeper.. Give us a needle..

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.620
What do you want that for ?

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.060
Our Guru's clothes are torn.. Need to sew it..

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.520
Here's the needle.. Give me 1/4 rupees..

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.740
It's so small.. We don't want..

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.760
Give us a needle.. A good one..

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.700
If our Guru's sent all the five of us..

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.360
how big that needle should be.. Give us a big one..

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.760
Hey.. look here.. This is the stitching needle..

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.660
Our Guru is not a fool..

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.920
There's always a meaning for whatever he says..

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.420
Give us a needle big enough for the five of us to carry together..

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.240
Mmm.. looks like they don't have anything inside their skull..

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.860
I'll sell them the useless cut out palm tree..

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.300
Oh.. You're asking for a big needle.. Why didn't you say that earlier..

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.940
Give me 20 rupees and take the big needle that's out there..

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.760
Did you guys see that.. Did you ?

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.520
You can't buy good stuff if you're not smart enough.. Lift up the needle..

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.460
What is this.. what are you guys carrying..?

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.640
It's a needle that we bought for our Guru..

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.860
A needle ? I've never seen a needle like this..

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.680
Mhumm.. Known is a drop, unknown is an ocean..

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.620
Come take lessons from our Guru..

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.620
And then you'll know about this..

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.940
Huh?! They're carrying a palm tree?
What is this ?

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.980
Needle to sew your clothes, Guru..

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.560
Perhaps a needle this big has been launched now..

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.320
Never show what we do not know to people..

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.900
Only then I could be a great man..

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.180
That's what my Guru said.. I'll follow that..

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.120
What's your doubt, Guru

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.500
The man who's had the shop at that place for years..

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.540
even he believed it to be a needle and had given it..

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.380
Hey.. Could we be fooled ?

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.220
Ah... Yes.. yes.. this is a huge needle indeed..

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.340
Guru, what does a needle mean ?

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.160
I think my disciples are getting knowledge..

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.100
Have begun to ask questions..

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.500
Tell us, Guru.. what's a needle..

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.600
Ah.. Ah.. That is.. That.. A needle is a needle..

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.160
We don't understand...

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.620
Are they going to listen If I say that I do not know how to explain it to them..

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.980
Err... That is.. 'Oo' stands for a town

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.540
and 'C' stands for speciality..

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.520
The speciality of a town is the presence of a well learned Guru like me..

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.620
Hah ... hah ... hah ... ha ... hah ... ha ...

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.400
Disciples, You should be laughing like this everyday..

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.040
Those who see Paramartha Guru and the disciples, should also be  laughing ...

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.960
That's the pride of our monastery..

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.720
Wow.. what an explanation.. what description!

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.580
Paramartha Guru.. Long Live..

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.280
Paramartha Guru.. Long Live..

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.760
Paramartha Guru.. Long Live..

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.140
Paramartha Guru.. Long Live..
