00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.899
"Superfood Bargains"

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:05.119
Here we go—

00:00:05.119 --> 00:00:06.980
pecans.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.919
More than 8,000 
antioxidant units per dollar.

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:17.379
Great bargain, but 
apples are even better.

00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:22.179
Goji berries—packed with 
antioxidants, but so expensive.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.789
For the same price, we can get 
more antioxidants in cranberries,

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.020
or artichokes.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.259
Here’s where açai comes in.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.259
So, you’re staring at that $5 package 
of frozen açai pulp at the store,

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:41.690
and thinking about all the great 
smoothies you can make with it.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.319
But should you choose something 
a little more economical?

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:49.988
Well, dollar for dollar, 
açai is worth it.

00:00:49.988 --> 00:00:54.938
If you’re willing to buy an apple a 
day to keep doctors like me away,

00:00:54.938 --> 00:00:59.939
it’s even a better bargain 
to go with superfood #1.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:02.759
Five to ten times more 
expensive per pound than apple,

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:08.887
but with 20 times more antioxidants, 
so it makes sense in the end.

00:01:08.887 --> 00:01:13.160
But three even better bargains to go.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.628
Winning the bronze for best bargain:

00:01:16.628 --> 00:01:18.418
cloves.

00:01:18.418 --> 00:01:20.998
And the silver to cinnamon.

00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:27.888
The gold busts off the charts as the 
#1 antioxidant bargain in the world:

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:31.148
purple cabbage—red cabbage.

00:01:31.148 --> 00:01:34.809
As cheap as you can get, 
and packed with antioxidants;

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:36.419
look at that beautiful color.

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:39.978
And, it lasts forever.

00:01:39.978 --> 00:01:43.018
Next time you go shopping, 
buy a red cabbage,

00:01:43.018 --> 00:01:45.167
put it in the crisper,

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:50.369
and slice off shreds to put in as 
many things as you can think of—

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.000
great crunch for salad, 
soups, stir fries, whatever.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.178
In terms of eating healthy on a budget,

00:01:59.178 --> 00:02:05.167
purple cabbage cannot be 
beat by any food, anywhere.
