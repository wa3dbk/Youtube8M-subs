00:00:57.237 --> 00:01:04.064
Even in the midst of flowing time, oppression spins round and round.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:11.262
I can't even see the heart that's leaving me, didn't you know?

00:01:11.262 --> 00:01:18.000
I can't even get myself to move, slipping through the cracks of time.

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:24.915
I don't know anything about what's around me,
I'm just me and no more.

00:01:24.915 --> 00:01:27.980
Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing?

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.417
Are my words useless even if I speak?

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:38.383
I'm just tired of being sad
I should go on without feeling anything

00:01:38.383 --> 00:01:45.400
Even if you give me the words; I'm at 
 a loss for
My heart just won't pay attention

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:52.320
If I can move, if everything changes, it will go dark.

00:01:52.338 --> 00:01:55.730
Is there a future for someone like me?

00:01:56.146 --> 00:01:59.350
Will I still exist in a world like this?

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:06.210
Is this painful? Is it sad?
Not even knowing myself.

00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm just tired even of walking, I don't even understand people.

00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:20.060
If someone like me can change, if I change, will it turn white?

00:02:48.693 --> 00:02:55.750
Even in the midst of flowing time, oppression spins round and round.

00:02:55.752 --> 00:03:02.350
I can't even see the heart that's leaving me, didn't you know?

00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:09.360
I can't even get myself to move slipping through the cracks of time.

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:16.320
I don't know anything about what's around me, I'm just me and no more.

00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:22.730
Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing? Are my words useless even if I speak?

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:29.620
I'm just tired of being sad;
I should go on without feeling anything.

00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:36.900
Even if you give me the words; I'm at 
 a loss for
My heart just won't pay attention.

00:03:36.898 --> 00:03:43.460
If I can move, if everything changes, it will go dark.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.580
Is there a future to come out of this useless 
 time?
Will I exist in a place like this?

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:57.630
If I wanted to tell you what kind of person I 
 am, the words I'd use would be "good for nothing".

00:03:57.633 --> 00:04:04.510
Will I exist in a place like this?
Will 
 I exist in a time like this?

00:04:04.506 --> 00:04:11.520
If someone like me can change, if I change, will it turn white?

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:18.340
Am I dreaming now? Or seeing nothing?
Are my words useless even if I speak?

00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:25.250
I'm just tired of being sad;
I should go on without feeling anything.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.420
Even if you give me the words I'm at a 
 loss for, my heart just won't pay attention.

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:39.430
If I can move, if everything changes, it will all go dark.

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:46.350
If I move, If I move,
everything will break, everything will break.

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:53.120
If I'm sad, if I'm sad, will my heart be able to turn white?

00:04:53.125 --> 00:05:00.100
I still know nothing about you, about me, about anything.

00:05:00.095 --> 00:05:07.460
If I can open my heavy eyelids, if I break everything, turn black!

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:18.290
