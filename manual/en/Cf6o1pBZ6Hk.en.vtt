You're going to see how easy, how fast and
It lasts a long time and I hope you like it.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:13.490

10cc. of linseed oil for wood, wax

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:22.840
wood, which is used to clean
furniture, and a little wood stain.

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.509
This product is fantastic.

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.000
Now that is melting what I do is add
a tablespoon of turpentine.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.590
This, being a small amount, it will
damaging if you have any varnish or a nail,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.009
but it will raise some remains
that may remain.

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.479
Here I'm getting a little dye
wood.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:17.010

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.010
varnish or other techniques. To pretend

a product to be returned to furniture

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.010
a very large brightness also nourishes. Yes
You have exterior doors, furniture

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.010
outside, the waterproof, protects
rain, sun ... in short, is a product

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.010
great. We will do in two versions:
for dark furniture and soft furnishings.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.010
You're going to see how easy, how fast and
It lasts a long time and I hope you like it.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.010
We will need 10 cc of olive oil,
10cc. of linseed oil for wood, wax

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.010
wood, which is used to clean
furniture, and a little wood stain.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.010
We connect the two oils, put two tablespoons
furniture polishing wax and let

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.010
to carry water bath for everything
sheath. This product is fantastic. Now

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.010
that is melting what I do is add
a tablespoon of turpentine. This, being a

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.010
small amount, it will not hurt if you have
a varnish or a nail, but will

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.010
to raise some debris that might remain.
Here I'm getting a little dye

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.010
wood. I put just a little bit because
so will the great mix for us

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.010
light wood furniture. Now what
half do is take a boat and the other

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.010
half will get more dye and so have differentiated
the light wood and dark wood.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:46.370
What also happened to a boat and leave
cool. I'm using these boats are

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.120
tempts cans of hair. I tell you
so that to profit. Now you are going to see:

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.660
on the surface clean (we cleaned
While the table) do you see the texture that is?

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:06.409
What we do is extend the product and already
see just start noticing how it will

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:14.349
the brightness and how nourishes wood. We're going
to extend the whole, we let it dry

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:24.730
well, it is completely absorbed by
wood, and then we pass a cloth

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.780
and would clean. Look at this door so
Spoiled. This doorframe so spoiled

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:43.959
by scratch my dog. You see? we take
the dark wood And look how it goes disguising

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.723
all scratches and blows all
carries lumber. It is a product that I recommend

00:03:49.723 --> 00:03:53.670
because it works really great.
