00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
Kreia? Oh... that is not her name.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.480
I know you

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.500
not even the markings of the dark side can hide it.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.800
She was a teacher once,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.200
and every student that she trained...

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.900
has been a failure,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.400
and brought death to the galaxy.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.800
That is why Atris and the others blamed me,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
sentenced me.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.000
They believed me responsible for Revan's fall.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.280
As a Padawan,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.300
Revan was trained by Master Kae,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.400
before she was exiled.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.750
At one time, Revan was my Padawan.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.900
In times past, long ago.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.200
And it is said

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.500
that he went to his first - and final - master

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.200
to learn how to leave the order entirely,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.550
as she had.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.100
In the end, he turned back to me.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.600
When he realized there was nothing more

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.000
to be learned from the Jedi

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.200
except how one could leave them forever.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.800
Why have you done this?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.400
I? Do you think I seek the death

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.000
of all living things?

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.000
There is no victory in such things.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.700
I do not want to win our war like this,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.850
little Jedi.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
When I win,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.200
I wish it to be because I was right,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.200
my teachings true.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.200
One quickly learns

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.350
that the Jedi code

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.400
does not give all the answers.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.150
If you are to truly understand,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.100
then you will need the contrast,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.400
not adherence to a single idea.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.500
It is to surrender yourself,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.300
to make yourself a slave to a teaching or belief,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.750
that makes it so that belief

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.000
will always rule you.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.100
I do not understand why

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.000
she displays such disobedience.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.300
You know why.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.200
She bears the face of her mother.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.750
The Jedi separate children from their parents

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.900
as they did you.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.900
It is because family exerts

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.200
a powerful influence on one's development.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.600
I never saw her face,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.800
and she did not return from the final battle of the war.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.400
She died in the battle that shattered Malachor V,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.800
and her body was never recovered.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.700
I knew her mother. She was a Jedi Knight

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.900
a master, named Arren Kae.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.600
Jedi are forbidden to have children,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.900
and when the crime finally came to light

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.900
almost a decade later, Kae was exiled.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.700
She joined the Mandalorian Wars

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.900
after the shame of her birth was revealed.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.200
I thought you had died in the Mandalorian Wars...

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.350
Die? No

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.200
became stronger, yes.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.800
By whose judgment

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.800
should such truths be revealed?

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.000
I do not have such arrogant presumptions.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.800
My father was Yusanis, an Echani general.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.200
He left our family to serve in the Mandalorian Wars.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.000
He went to join my mother,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.080
one whose movements and spirit matched his.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.700
And she was... said to be... a skilled warrior.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.600
Beautiful. And strong in the Force.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.200
The fact that our father chose battle is not shameful,

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.400
but that is not the reason he went to war.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.000
He went to war to be with the one he loved,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.500
but not the one he had pledged himself to.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.600
He was disloyal.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.100
I am the mark of that disloyalty.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.200
It is said that such things run in the blood,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.000
and I have fought long to prove

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.200
that this is not so.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.800
If I were to follow a Jedi against Atris' wishes,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.900
then I would be betraying her. For you.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.500
Do you think to turn her from Atris' will?

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.100
If so, I hope your arrogance

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.500
will prove true in time.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.800
As I followed Atris,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.800
perhaps what I wished to follow

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.800
was the call of my bloodline,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.000
of my mother.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.700
I have felt incomplete, hollow,

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.900
since her loss at Malachor V...

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.600
and with your help,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.000
perhaps this wound might be healed.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.000
And so it ends.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.500
I want you to teach me the ways of the Force.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.300
To become a Jedi Knight like my mother.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.000
Betrayal

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.900
(Telepathically) Kreia: Betrayal

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Betrayal

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.100
Mistress?

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.900
She has betrayed me...

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the last of your sisters has betrayed me.

00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:34.950
Betrayed us.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.800
She is your sister no more.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.000
She has chosen to walk

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.400
the path of the Jedi.
