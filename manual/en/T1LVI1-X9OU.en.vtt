Hi Guys - Welcome to GoKids video

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.249
Today we’re looking at a Disney Cars surprise egg

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:09.680
This is our 4th Disney Cars surprise egg video.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.599
You can see the others in our Disney Cars
Surprise Egg playlist in the description below.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.740
Let’s open it up and see what’s inside!

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:34.160
It’s a bright red egg with Lightning McQueen and Snot Rod on the wrapper.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.379
Let’s see what surprises we find!

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.400
First are some Lightning McQueen candies.
Yum!

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.680
Next is a sticker of Luigi. We got this same
sticker in our last surprise egg.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.460
Oooo - this looks cool. We got a button with the car Boost on it.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.200
Do you remember Boost from the Disney Cars movie? 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.120
He’s part of the Turner Cars Group that causes problems for Lightning McQueen.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.330
Finally, is a sheet with all of the Cars surprises we can find. We’ve still got lots to collect.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.280
Here’s everything we found today. Lots of
fun things! For more surprise egg videos please
