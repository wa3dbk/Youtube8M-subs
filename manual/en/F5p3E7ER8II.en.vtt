Did you know that all five letter or under
English names or English words now have a

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.660
dot com associated with them. Hi, I'm Dan
Afonso of Afonso Consulting and in full IT.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.290
This is how to create a website. In this tutorial
what I'm going to do is just cover broad topics

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.350
and the different ways to create a website.
The specifics require a lot of patience and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.870
effort on your part. You must make your website
able to work for you and you have to know

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.730
the technology that is required in order to
get what you need. Now, there's three basic

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.320
way's to handle a website. The first one and
the oldest one, is to hand code HTML. Now

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.120
HTML is a mark up language that drives the
Internet. It defines more or less what a website

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.110
will look like. It defines elements like text,
where pictures go, how they should relate

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.000
to each other, how they should be positioned,
sizes relative to each other. HTML is often

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.570
thought of as a way to create the entire website
and make it look exactly. That's not quite

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.680
true. Different browsers render different
websites differently because they interpret

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.170
what's on the page differently. Now while
I find this to be a great academic exercise

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.390
and useful if you want to tweak your website
to its fullest, it's really not very practical

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.400
if you have to put up more than a few pages.
For that, we're going to go to our next option.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.659
Our next option is to have a program that
creates the website for you. Now what you

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.950
get out of this is the fact that your website
gets created a lot faster. You can see your

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:38.580
results as your typing and you can create
visually. The downside to this is they still

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.560
produce web code that is not quite as perfect
as it could be. Sometimes it's bloated an

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.770
especially in the case of a program like Microsoft
Word, it's really not standard compliance

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.700
at all, but it will render most of the time.
If you want to use this, this is a great way

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.689
to create a template. From this template you
could use option three which is a content

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.990
management system. Now a CMS, as their called,
will manage content. You take a template or

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.200
some sort of framework for it to work in and
you define the basic look of it. but in the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.489
back end, you'll use something to define what
goes where. So you'll have your template that

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.809
shoes your header, your footer, your side
bars and what not. The content management

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:28.629
system handles menus, it will handle article
creation, it will handle creating the RSS

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:35.090
feed if you need that. It will create a lot
of the ancillary stuff for you. So go out

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.659
pick one that is best for you and go for it.
If you are looking for some links, there is

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.629
some accompanying this article that I feel
are really good products for this sort of

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.209
thing. I'm Dan Afonso and this is a bit short
guide on how to start you website.
