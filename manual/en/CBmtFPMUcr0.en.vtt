00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.340
Liability Coverage?
Collision Coverage?

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.819
Uninsured Motorist?
Medical Payments?

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.329
But, I just need car insurance...
Purchasing car insurance seems simple enough,

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.480
but when you really start shopping, it can
feel overwhelming.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.880
Let's break down the four basic coverages
of the standard personal auto policy:

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.910
Liability coverage.
Liability Coverage provides you with the coverage

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.700
you need in the event that you're at-fault
in an automobile accident. This coverage offers

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.430
two types of protection: coverage
for injuries to other people and coverage

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.900
for damage to someone else's property while
you or a family member are operating any automobile.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.579
So, if you accidentally hit someone else's
car and injure the other driver, your Liability

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.700
Coverage would pay for not only the covered
damages to their vehicle, but also for the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.280
medical expenses related to their injuries...
And yes, I said "their" injuries, not

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.860
your own, which leads us to our second coverage...
Medical Payments Coverage.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.820
Because Liability Coverage only provides coverage

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.280
for injuries caused to the other people involved you'll need Medical Payments Coverage to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.150
help pay medical expenses related to injuries
sustained by you or your passengers in an

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.780
accident. This coverage comes into play no
matter who is at fault.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.610
The third part of personal auto insurance
is Uninsured Motorists Coverage, or UM Coverage.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.200
UM Coverage protects you if you're involved
in an accident with someone who breaks the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.900
law by not carrying their own auto liability
insurance.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.390
It does this by helping pay for any medical
expenses you incur as a result of getting

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.450
hit by an uninsured driver. And although it
may not sound fair, these types of accidents

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.180
do happen. According to statistics, nearly
one in seven drivers on the road is uninsured,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.080
which makes protecting yourself an absolute
necessity!

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.759
In many states, you can also purchase additional
protection called Underinsured Motorists Coverage.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.250
Underinsured Motorist Coverage provides you
with additional protection, for when the other

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.409
driver has insurance coverage, but just not
enough to fully cover all of your medical

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.200
expenses.
By now, you may be wondering how you're

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.260
going to pay for damages to your own car.
That's where the fourth and final part of

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.819
your auto policy comes into play... Coverage
for Damage to your Car.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.310
Also known as Physical Damage coverage. It
pays for direct and accidental loss to your

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.040
vehicle, there are two parts to Physical Damage
coverage: Collision - for when your car impacts

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.810
another vehicle or object, or is upset, and
Other Than Collision, which covers almost

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.620
any other type of direct, accidental loss
not excluded by your policy.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.620
As I said, the details of insurance can be
confusing...This video is just a short overview

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.190
of the four main parts of the standard auto
insurance policy. To ask questions and learn

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.930

that may apply, be sure to contact your local independent
