00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:05.800
Hi. My name is Melissa Powell and I'm with
Expert Village. In discussing how to play

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.000
Blackjack, we're going to talk about when
it's wise to hit and when it's wise to stand.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.600
So let's go ahead and reenact a game as if
we're really playing. I will call out, "place

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.689
your bets" and each player will place their
bet. I say three times, I say, "place your

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.449
bet, final bets, and no more bets", so everybody
knows exactly what to do. When I say, "place

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:36.280
your bets", everyone is going to put out some
money. So each person has now made their bet

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.360
and we go ahead and start the dealing process.
Once again, each player gets one card first,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.790
face up and my first card is down. They get
their second card and I deal my second card

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.710
face up. Now, I have a two. Players will be
looking at the card that I have to determine

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.540
whether or not they should hit. Now, you always
assume that I have a ten. The highest value

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.470
of what I have is a twelve. We don't know,
but that's the easiest assumption to make.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:20.439
This Player has a fifteen. Now, if I have
a twelve, I must hit. Dealer must hit until

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:28.500
she reaches seventeen at least. So, on a fifteen
with a two showing, I would probably stand.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.060
The chances of my busting are great. So I
think it's wise for this player to stand.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.720
We'll move on to the five. Obviously, you
can't win with just five. So you'll definitely

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.909
want to hit. Now you have eight. You want
to keep going until you're at least in the

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:56.189
double digits. Now you have twelve. That's
a tough one since I do have a two showing.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:03.670
But I would actually go ahead and take another
hit. Bad idea, busted. Clean up the cards

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.749
and take the bet.
