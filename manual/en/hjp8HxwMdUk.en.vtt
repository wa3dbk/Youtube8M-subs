00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.140
Hello again.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.300
We're so happy you
made it this far.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.130
Congrats.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.180
You're well on your way to a
once-in-a-lifetime experience

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.680
at the University of Illinois.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.300
In an earlier
episode, we covered

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.830
some of the basic information
about the university,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.040
including the academic
calendar and the role

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.790
that the academic advisors play
in guiding you as a student.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.480
Now we're going to
take a look at what

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.930
it takes to be a successful
student at the U of I.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.850
Class structure, format,
and grading systems

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.290
are not consistent and can
vary from class to class.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.500
Some classes are taught
by a professor, some

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.990
by teaching assistants, and
some use a combination of both.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.010
Instructors will provide you
with general instructions

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.450
on how to do well in
class, and they will also

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.890
give you a detailed syllabus
outlining class policies, work,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.460
and deadlines.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.940
Refer to this syllabus often
to make sure you're on track.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.230
And remember, no
one is going to make

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.730
sure you're going to be
studying or doing your homework.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.170
It's entirely up to you.

00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:11.900
Oh.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.880
Hey.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.760
Your course grade
is usually based

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.340
on some combinations of
homework assignments turned in,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.270
exams, class attendance,
and other class projects.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.690
Some class materials,
including the syllabus,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.010
may be presented and expected
to be submitted online.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.260
Grades are earned
throughout the semester

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.380
after the work is done.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.420
You're expected to
actively participate

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.860
in class by contributing
to discussions

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.440
and asking questions.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.790
Remember, it's OK to be wrong
or disagree with your professor.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.250
Just be sure to keep in touch
with your professor, TAs,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.510
and advisors, and be sure to
make good use of their office

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.390
hours and any
other opportunities

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.740
for additional help.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.730
Remember, talk to
these people if there

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.930
is any problem
that is keeping you

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.760
from being the
best that you can.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.260
All right.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.980
I'll be seeing you around.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.830
Bye.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.180
Go to all of your
classes and allot time

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.590
to study outside of class.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.720
For every one hour
spent in class,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.820
a good student should do
about two to three hours

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.650
of preparation and homework.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.890
Thus, a 15-hour schedule equals,
minimally, a 45-hour work week.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.480
By now, you may have
noticed some differences

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.410
between the academic
system at the U of I

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.170
and what you're
used to back home.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.620
Some differences might
not be readily apparent

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.650
but can cause real
trouble for students.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.680
Such is the case when
a student violates

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.020
a rule about academic integrity.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.110
Academic integrity is based on
the values of honesty, trust,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.090
fairness, respect,
and responsibility.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.150
At the core of
academic integrity

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.270
is the expectation that
the work you do is yours.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.940
Some common violations
of academic integrity

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.230
include cheating, falsification,
plagiarism, or assisting others

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.040
in committing an infraction.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.790
The student code outlines
academic integrity violations

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.130
and the penalties.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.510
Penalties are
significant and can

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.410
include a reduced or failing
grade for an assignment

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.750
or for the entire course,
conduct probation, and even

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.780
dismissal from the university.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.020
It's expected that you'll
follow the rules here,

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.230
even if they are very different
from your home country.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.030
You can learn more
about academic integrity

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.920
by reading the student code.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.430
Don't hesitate to use
additional campus resources

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.800
such as the writer's workshop,
rhetoric classes, and web

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.750
materials for further guidance.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.600
Preparing to come to university
is not all about academics.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.050
Every new student wonders, will
I fit in and make new friends?

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.730
How do I prepare for my career?

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.360
Will I meet other
people like me?

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.950
How do I make friends
with American students?

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.730
How will I make the adjustments
to all the new expectations

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.240
and experiences?

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.430
Getting involved in
cocurricular activities

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.370
can help you answer
those questions.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.960
What exactly is
cocurricular involvement?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.310
Generally speaking,
cocurricular activities

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.090
happen outside a
classroom but enhance

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.730
your academic
experience at Illinois.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.570
Some examples of these are
joining a club or organization,

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.399
volunteering on campus
or in a community,

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.829
participating in the
leadership programs,

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:25.760
or engaging in club sports.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.720
You can also engage in
cocurricular programs that

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.310
don't ask you to join a group,
such as concerts, weekend

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.060
activities, or programs offered
through a campus office.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.930
Being involved in
cocurricular activities

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.590
helps you in many ways.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.450
You will meet other
people and build

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.510
a network that can assist
you in your future job

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.110
search and career.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.000
Your academic
achievements and grades

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.300
alone will not get you a job.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.180
Employers in the US are
looking for students

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.370
who can show that they are
well-rounded by being involved.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.120
Cocurricular
involvement will also

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.030
help you to develop
transferable skills that

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.390
are important to
employers in any career,

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.090
such as leadership
skills and capacity,

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.880
communication skills-- both
written and oral-- teamwork,

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.730
organization, and
analytical abilities.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.500
Although involvement
experiences help

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.180
you develop while having fun,
it's important to prioritize.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.200
Many students get
stressed out because they

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.720
become over-involved.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.480
Maintain a balance between
all of the important events

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.060
in your life.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.240
So that's it.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.040
Oh, before we send you on
your way, just a quick recap.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.460
The structure and expectation
of the academic system

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.325
at the University
of Illinois may

00:05:33.325 --> 00:05:35.740
be quite different from what
you're used to back home.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.800
You're considered an
adult and expected

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.650
to take responsibility
for yourself

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.370
within the academic environment.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.790
This includes becoming
familiar with the rules

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.970
about academic integrity,
plagiarism, and the student

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.040
code.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.020
It's important to use
your time on campus

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.890
to develop interests
and cultivate

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.540
skills outside the classroom.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.790
Well-rounded students
are more attractive

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.990
to potential internships and
permanent employers in the US.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.410
That's all from us.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.630
Remember, all of these videos
will be available for review

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.880
if you need a reminder.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.690
Not only that, but you've
got so many great resources

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.160
at your disposal that
if you've got questions,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.210
it's easy to find
someone to help you out.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.050
Congratulations on joining
the U of I community.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.070
We know you'll find
your place in no time.
