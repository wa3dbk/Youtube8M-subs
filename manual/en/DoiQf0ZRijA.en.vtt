00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:04.167
(mysterious instrumental music)

00:00:05.915 --> 00:00:08.594
- Hi, I'm Whitney and welcome to Egypt.

00:00:08.594 --> 00:00:11.159
We are here in front
of the Great Pyramids.

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.821
Today we are going to learn
how to do front walkovers.

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:17.671
Me Sphinx it's time to get started.

00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:21.314
(mysterious instrumental music)

00:00:21.314 --> 00:00:24.559
A front walkover is a
skill of flexibility,

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:28.318
so you might want to do some
stretches before you start.

00:00:28.318 --> 00:00:30.485
A good stretch is a split.

00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:38.392
The most important stretch

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:41.204
of a front walkover is the bridge.

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:45.508
(mysterious instrumental music)

00:00:45.508 --> 00:00:47.905
You might want to lift your leg up,

00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:51.896
'cause that is the position
of a front walkover.

00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:55.696
(mysterious instrumental music)

00:00:55.696 --> 00:00:58.529
Another stretch is your shoulders.

00:01:01.137 --> 00:01:04.500
You need shoulder flexibility
to open your shoulders

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.398
to get your foot on the
ground and to stand up.

00:01:08.398 --> 00:01:12.398
(mysterious instrumental music)

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.978
This is what a front
walkover should look like.

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:21.978
(mysterious instrumental music)

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:32.916
The things that you will
need to do a front walkover

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:35.833
is to reach down at least two feet.

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:42.193
Secondly, you must be able to kick over

00:01:42.193 --> 00:01:44.776
and onto a bridge with one leg.

00:01:45.744 --> 00:01:49.913
You must be able to go from
a bridge up to a stand.

00:01:49.913 --> 00:01:53.913
(mysterious instrumental music)

00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:58.188
A front walkover is a
very fun skill to do.

00:01:58.188 --> 00:02:01.482
You can do a front walkover
at school, in the grass,

00:02:01.482 --> 00:02:04.047
even on the beach, or at home,

00:02:04.047 --> 00:02:06.690
but before doing gymnastics in the house,

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.403
make sure to ask
permission from your mummy.

00:02:10.403 --> 00:02:13.941
(mysterious instrumental music)

00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:16.047
So let's get started.

00:02:16.047 --> 00:02:19.507
First you want to start
with your good leg in front.

00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:21.435
Now, reach down to the floor.

00:02:21.435 --> 00:02:25.602
You want to bend your leg
and go up to a handstand.

00:02:26.494 --> 00:02:29.860
Then you go down to a
bridge and immediately,

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.898
when your foot touches the ground,

00:02:31.898 --> 00:02:36.065
you use your flexibility in
your hips to push yourself up.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.730
A good tip is for when
you put your foot down

00:02:45.812 --> 00:02:49.062
to lean your shoulders back, like that.

00:02:50.693 --> 00:02:55.031
That will take most of the
stress off of your back.

00:02:55.031 --> 00:02:59.198
Another good tip is for when
you're in the handstand,

00:03:02.622 --> 00:03:05.955
or the bridge, to push your hips forward

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:10.016
when you're coming up

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:14.136
and always keep your head
back in a front walkover.

00:03:14.136 --> 00:03:16.631
(mysterious instrumental music)

00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:19.014
Here's some fun facts about the Pyramids.

00:03:19.014 --> 00:03:21.495
Did you know that the Great Pyramid has

00:03:21.495 --> 00:03:25.679
over 2.3 million stones,
some weighing up to 70 tons?

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:29.679
(mysterious instrumental music)

00:03:30.663 --> 00:03:34.955
This is Houston, as you
know, but when he's in Egypt,

00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:37.622
he likes to be called King Mutt.

00:03:37.622 --> 00:03:39.789
(kissing)

00:03:41.983 --> 00:03:45.408
Also remember to be careful
while doing a front walkover

00:03:45.408 --> 00:03:47.868
as you can injure yourself.

00:03:47.868 --> 00:03:52.035
Houston, we have a problem.
(laughing)

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:56.814
- It was the camel.

00:03:56.814 --> 00:03:59.517
- Join us next week, when we do

00:03:59.517 --> 00:04:00.949
(groaning)

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:07.935
back walkovers in front of
the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:16.955
(mysterious instrumental music)
