Hello Sebastian, Kai and Thorsten Wingenfelder here from the band Fury In The Slaughterhouse.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.300
We would like to congratulate you on your exceptional and wonderful career.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.620
It’s our honour to present a Sebastian Kehl remix of our popular tune "Won't Forget These Days".

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.880
We wish you all the best for the future and hope to hear from you in the future.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.520
So long, take care and see you soon!

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.040
A long and successful career is coming to an end. I’m glad I was able to be a part of it and to have got to know you.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.640
Thank you Kehli!

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.640
You always used to kiss my head before every game. I’ll never forget that.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.362
Thank you Kehli!

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.000
It was always great fun going into battle with you, celebrating on the pitch together and coping with defeats.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.560
A great captain of the team and you helped write a big part of BVB’s history.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.480
You can be proud of a fantastic career.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.560
Thank you Kehli!

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:42.460
I hope you can say farewell with a trophy in Berlin after 13 years at Borussia Dortmund.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.860
Thank you Kehli!

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.780
We were able to write an extraordinary story together and you played a massive, massive role.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.300
You were my captain ...

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.400
... and that was the perfect casting.
