00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.009
Put the baby to sleep with a Mario Mobile
and label that little monster with a Kaiju

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.319
Warning sign.

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:13.319
I'm Jake and this is episode number 21 of Game LUT

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.020
Start the day by taking a shower behind this
Enderman shower curtain, and rid yourself

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.680
of moisture with a personalized Minecraft
towel. Once you're all clean throw on a Mega

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.250
man tee shirt and Pokemon sweater.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.300
Secure your pants with a Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles Krang belt buckle, which might be

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.980
the coolest thing ever, and finish the look
with these awesome jackets by musterbrand.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.370
You can stay dry with an Edward coat from
the Assassin's Creed black flag collection

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.749
or for something a little more formal try
a STARS military jacket from the Resident

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:46.050
Evil Collection.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.050
Then admire some awesome illustrations by
Adam Rufino

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.550
The art will go great with a 3d printed LoL
yordle snap trap and Miyazaki figurine.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.550
Maybe you can put them in your $38,000 video
gaming trailer. It has 5 TVs, 3 Xboxes, 2

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.360
PlayStations, 2 Wiis, and surround sound.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.750
Make the trailer a little more comfortable
with Mass Effect pillows and a Doom Cacodemon

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.970
plush. Keep decorating it with color changing
space invader lamps, Vault Boy Bobble heads,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.970
that come in a handy 7 pack and an Uncharted
Drake action figure. Now that your game trailer

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.770
is ready for some multiplayer battles, get
yourself ready with video game inspired armor

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.770
from Imperial Armories.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.770
Or for the female warrior there is a chainmail
zelda bikini top because...why wouldn't there

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.450
be...

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.540
But why spend all the money in your Attack
on Titan Wallet on a video gaming trailer,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.120
when you can play classic games at home with
OpenEmu. OpenEmu is a really great video game

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.170
emulator for mac that lets you play ROMs of
classic games from consoles like gameboy,

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.989
sega genesis and turbo grafx.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.530
Once you finish playing some Mario, open up
your catbug backpack, push aside that iPad

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.209
with custom Skyrim leather cover and give
your special someone a Arc Reactor friendship

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.530
necklace and Final Fantasy Accessory Case.
Which would be a great place to store video

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.230
game themed makeup like the Legend of Zelda
collection so you can pair Nayru's love with

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.409
Majora's Mask.

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:39.389
If they don't like those things don't punisher...hat.
Instead try Super Hero emo leggings, a Battleship

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.230
bay pullover, and Kingdom Hearts Beanie.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.249
Or live life in the fast line with a Grand
Turismo hoodie and mix fandoms by wearing

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:49.120
a Pokeball Death Star shirt.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.709
And then blend genres with Mario Yakuza prints
from Eduardo Vieira.

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.709
Be a 
Firefly with this Last of Us leather bracelet
and glow in the dark wearing a portal party

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.480
associate work shirt. Then grab your game boy...
journal because you're going to want to write

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.760
this next part down...vsauce3

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.049
It's the discount code on Musterbrand, the
people who made those awesome blizzard shirts

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.499
last episode and the Assassin's Creed and
Resident Evil jackets from this one. They

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:25.519
were so thankful for being featured that they
wanted to send me some clothes but instead

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.980
I asked if we could get 10% off their entire
site for the rest of February and they awesomely

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.239
said yes. So use code vsauce3 if you wanna
buy some LUT and, as always, thanks for watching.
