00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.960
The field of strength and conditioning is a
booming industry.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.450
We feel that potentially there is a real
need within the sector

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.900
for a conditioner that has a specialist
knowledge of

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.880
not only strength and conditioning but also
sports injury and late-stage

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.470
rehabilitation. To almost be able to come
in within a multi-disciplinary team

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.270
and help shepherd the player from the treatment camps back onto the

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.020
field of play.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.600
Other courses generally train

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.070
a medical practitioner, a sports therapist, a sports rehabilitator

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.190
and then give them extra training in

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.260
strength and conditioning. We come at it from
the other end, in the fact that

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.540
our practitioners will be strength and
conditioning coaches

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.910
and they just have a specialist
knowledge of

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.230
that late stage rehabilitation, which should only help inform their programming for

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.420
reconditioning athletes.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.780
We know from having spoken to people who work in sport, and ourselves,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.810
that within a multi-disciplinary team, or a small

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.320
working team for sports team, having
additional skills

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.580
is really important. I believe that Hartpury is a very aspirational and an inspirational

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.150
place

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.210
for any student. I know, having taken part in designing this programme,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.799
as a member of the department, Hartpury's a great place to come and do it. As a conditioner,

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.070
the gym facilities here are outstanding.  You've got access to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.439
kit that professional clubs have
got access to.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.590
There's no lack there. And then

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.600
the lab stuff. So all the testing and 
monitoring stuff you can do now.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.799
Blood lactate, VO2, and all that stuff.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.220
It's a massive benefit to have access to that
equipment

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.520
and to see it first hand is invaluable.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.940
Injuries dictate how you can train and

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.490
have a massive impact on programming that
you do and and any

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.520
knowledge you have of injuries, in terms of the rehab and the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.640
post-injury training is invaluable if you want to continue to make

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.420
players better.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.340
My three years here were incredible. I
really enjoyed it

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.340
and I'd definitely recommend it to any aspiring conditioning coach.
