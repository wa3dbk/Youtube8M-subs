00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:10.076
A verification method is one of many optional assessment methods

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:14.614
available in the National Construction Code or NCC.

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:19.719
However, it is not a mandatory requirement. Verification

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:24.023
methods may be used as part of a performance solution to assess

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:27.927
compliance with specific performance requirements.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:32.232
The NCC contains verification methods to assess structural

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:35.835
liability and demonstrate compliance with specific

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:39.639
structural performance requirements for both commercial

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:44.377
and residential buildings. A design is acceptable when it

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:48.948
meets the structural reliability targets. The verification

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:52.852
methods provide the required targets for each action type

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:56.890
affecting a building, permanent and imposed actions or

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.396
environmental actions which are wind, earthquake and snow.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:07.500
These clear targets allow a designer to assess a design

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.304
based on material properties and is particularly useful for

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:17.277
innovative designs and materials which have no Deem to Satisfy provisions.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:21.414
The verification methods are based on probability theory.

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:25.185
For designers this involves assessing the probability

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:29.222
of failure of a building component or connection.

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:32.292
When assessing a component, action effects working against

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:35.795
the building are represented as "Q" and the structural

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:38.765
resistance of the building is represented as "R".

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:42.368
The probability of failure of the building is the

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:46.339
probability that the resistance is less than the action on

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:51.444
the building, or R is less than Q. The verification

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:54.981
methods are satisfied when the resistance of the components is

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:58.685
greater than the actions against the components.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:00.687
To evaluate structure reliability,

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:05.492
the relationship between actions and resistance is assessed.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:10.897
Actions and resistances are represented
by lognormal distributions.

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:14.801
The action distribution has the following variables.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.937
The most frequent value of the action is the peak of

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:22.342
the curve, the nominal design value of the action is usually a

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:27.347
high percentile value, the variation of the action is the

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:32.585
spread of the curve. In order to calculate the target reliability

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:36.789
the coefficient of the action is required. The resistance

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:40.960
distribution has similar variables where the most

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.598
frequent value of the resistance is the peak of the curve, the

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:49.869
nominal design value of the resistance is a five percentile

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:54.240
value, the variation of the resistance is the spread of the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.978
curve. Similarly to the action variables, the coefficient of

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:03.483
the resistance is required. Collectively, these are the

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:06.819
action and resistance variables for the calculation of

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.391
structural reliability. The verification methods constrain

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.861
the action variables by providing the mean action and

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:18.531
variation of the action. The remaining variables for

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:22.835
assessment are related only to resistance, where the resistance

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:27.607
needs to exceed the nominal design value of the action.

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:30.944
These values are determined by the material testing of the

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:35.448
design component or connection. To evaluate the action and

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:39.485
resistance distributions, the structural reliability index,

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:45.892
beta is equal to the inverse of negative capital phi multiplied

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:50.730
by the probability of failure where capital phi is equal to

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.768
the inverse standardised normal distribution. A load factor

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:59.639
provides tolerance for unknown variables in the data and is

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:06.279
represented by gamma. A capacity factor represented by phi allows

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.282
for the difference between the real capacity of the material

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:13.019
and the theoretical capacity to ensure design loads are

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.157
achieved. To determine the ratio of the mean of resistance to the

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:22.195
mean of the action for each design scenario, equate the mean

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:26.532
resistance over the mean action with respect to the nominal

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:30.903
design values and the load and capacity factors. The structural

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:34.574
reliability can then be calculated by taking the natural

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:39.612
log of the mean resistance over the mean action multiplied by

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.448
the square root of the coefficient of the action over

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:45.952
the coefficient of the resistance, all divided by the

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.055
square root of the natural log of the coefficient of the

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:53.226
resistance multiplied by the coefficient of the action.

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:55.695
The structural verification method is an optional

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:58.031
assessment method that can be used to determine

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:01.234
compliance with the performance requirements allowing

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.970
for innovative designs and materials to be used.
