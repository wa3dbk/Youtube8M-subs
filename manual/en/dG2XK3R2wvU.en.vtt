Hey, Nathan! It's Wednesday, February 5th;
Day two of what some in our area are calling

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.309
'Snowpocalypse 2014', caused by the notorious
and widely feared Polar Vortex. I mean, I

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.429
don't know. It's snow. It's wintertime. But,
uh, it's my second day off of work, so I'm

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:21.950
not complaining. Call it whatever you want.
THESNOWMAGGEDON TO END ALL DAYS! WE'RE ALL

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.970
GOING TO DIE, OR AT LEAST be a little cold
and somewhat inconvenienced. Now, of course

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.360
these weather conditions are serious and people
should be extra careful when they're out on

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.039
the roads or outside for an extended period
of time. But, that doesn't mean that you can't

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:39.789
have a little fun and make the best of a situation,
so here fun things to do on a snow day! First

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.829
things first, before you can have any fun,
chores must be done. Which means, making your

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.829
strong and strapping boyfriend shovel the
driveway.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.980
Just kidding!

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.040
AHH! It's the abominable snow man!

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.480
Next, sledding! Even if you're a
wuss like me, you should at least try it out.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.650
We saw some really innovative... uh, "sleds"
out on campus, like plastic containers and

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.640
pieces of cardboard. Some people even got
inside large trash bags, made a hole for their

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.340
heads, and just went for it. Ballsy.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:19.420
AHHH! *a lot of yelling* UH OH, STAIRS! ow.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.440
SNOWBALL FIGHT! Well, the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.780
snow was really fluffy, so it kind of turned
into a snow mist fight. But, uh, hey, it was

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.060
still pretty fun!

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.600
Since the fluffy snow doesn't pack well, it was hard making a snowman, too.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.600
But, hey, it worked! Kind of...

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.319
And you can't forget snow angels! That's actually much easier

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:25.319
to do in the fluffy snow.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.180
Aww, how cute!

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.920
I have to say, i got pretty comfy down there,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:42.900
but I was really bundled up. It's very important
to be well insulated from the cold, especially

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.099
if you're going to be getting down and dirty
in the snow. So don't forget to wear lots of layers.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.220
Well, that was a fun day! Rose
really 'SNOWS' how to have fun in the snow!

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:17.140
...Get it? Cause, you know, snow sounds like
knows? ...Who gave me a camera? Nathan, we'll

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.049
see you on Friday.
