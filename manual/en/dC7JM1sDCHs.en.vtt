00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.487
(dance music)

00:00:04.488 --> 00:00:05.838
- Nikki, darling.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.574
What are we making today?

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:10.083
- Today we are making an apple brandy cup.

00:00:10.084 --> 00:00:12.802
- Exactly what it sounds
like is exactly what it is.

00:00:12.803 --> 00:00:14.473
Apple is a cup.

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:17.100
Brandy, cider, tons of stuff on top.

00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:19.031
Good to go! Let's make this drink.

00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:21.586
So cut off the top of
this apple right here.

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:22.606
Alright? Go ahead.

00:00:22.607 --> 00:00:24.980
- Just one nice slice?
- [Skyy] Yeah.

00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:26.197
- [Nikki] Ok.

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:29.572
- [Skyy] Perfect, perfect.

00:00:29.573 --> 00:00:32.071
- So I'm cutting out
the middle of this apple

00:00:32.072 --> 00:00:36.624
to make a cup to pour our alcohol into,

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:39.364
but I don't want to make
it too thin on the edges

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:41.882
because then it'll spill out.

00:00:41.883 --> 00:00:43.786
- [Skyy] Ok, that's nice.

00:00:43.787 --> 00:00:45.595
So obviously you see this can turn brown,

00:00:45.596 --> 00:00:47.439
so what you wanna do is
squeeze some lemon over it.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.497
- Ok, yeah, around the edges.

00:00:49.498 --> 00:00:51.303
- [Skyy] Yes, ma'am, around the edges.

00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:52.575
Hit that with some brandy.

00:00:52.576 --> 00:00:53.846
- Ok.

00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:56.584
It's getting hit.

00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:57.562
- [Skyy] Stop!

00:00:57.587 --> 00:01:02.587
Ok, now top that with that hot apple cider

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:04.969
that I just heated up in the microwave.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.674
- Dang, that's hot.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:07.871
- [Skyy] Is it hot?

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:08.838
Is it steaming?

00:01:08.863 --> 00:01:10.323
- [Nikki] It's very attractive.

00:01:10.324 --> 00:01:11.717
- Obviously that's
gonna be a strong drink.

00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:12.730
You can see that, right?

00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:13.476
- Yeah.
- [Skyy] Ok.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.270
- Now.

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.525
- What is that? (laughs)

00:01:20.232 --> 00:01:22.165
Is that your new style of thinking?

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.531
What is that?

00:01:23.532 --> 00:01:25.518
"Now."

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.210
You got fierce.

00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:29.471
You got real fierce on this show.

00:01:29.472 --> 00:01:33.700
- Now top that with some whipped cream.

00:01:35.117 --> 00:01:36.399
- [Nikki] You want me to
go all the way around?

00:01:36.424 --> 00:01:38.792
- [Skyy] Yeah, cause it's
gonna melt anyway, ok?

00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:41.220
Hit that with some caramel sauce.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.245
- I'm just gonna drizzle
like a light little drizzle.

00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:46.775
- Yeah, it's messy,
and now we can hit that

00:01:46.776 --> 00:01:47.824
with some graham cracker crumbs.

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:50.022
- Ooh, that's pretty!

00:01:50.023 --> 00:01:52.245
You're looking pretty, apple cider.

00:01:52.476 --> 00:01:54.914
- Boys, understand, this'll
be melting as you go,

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:56.633
so this is a quick drink.

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:57.675
Some cinnamon on top.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.719
- [Nikki] Oh yeah, don't forget that.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.453
Bang!

00:02:00.478 --> 00:02:01.427
And there you have it!

00:02:01.452 --> 00:02:02.460
(Skyy laughing)

00:02:02.485 --> 00:02:03.866
Damn it.

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:06.388
Apple brandy cup!

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:07.407
- Why the long pause?

00:02:07.408 --> 00:02:09.191
- Because I wanted to scare you.

00:02:09.192 --> 00:02:11.045
- And there you have it,
the apple brandy cup.

00:02:11.046 --> 00:02:12.418
Nice flow, ok?

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:13.772
Go in.

00:02:13.773 --> 00:02:14.908
- Oh, like that?

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.141
Then you don't get the whipped cream.

00:02:16.142 --> 00:02:17.477
- Ok, never mind, take the straw

00:02:17.478 --> 00:02:19.007
and drink from the apple then.

00:02:19.577 --> 00:02:21.340
- Mmmmmm.

00:02:23.925 --> 00:02:24.708
- Is it good?

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:25.451
- It's very good.

00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:26.156
It's messy.

00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:28.840
Make sure it's on an outdoor
patio or something like that

00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:30.323
or maybe you have mats down or --

00:02:30.324 --> 00:02:31.324
- Everything we do is messy.

00:02:31.325 --> 00:02:32.335
- Maybe you have a carpet like Skyy!

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:33.516
- Ok, well you don't give a damn,

00:02:33.517 --> 00:02:36.286
everything we do is messy so
don't worry about the mess.

00:02:38.794 --> 00:02:39.456
- It's decent?

00:02:39.457 --> 00:02:40.411
- Oh, I love it.

00:02:40.412 --> 00:02:41.309
(laughter)

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.711
- I'm taking this home, this is good.

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:44.704
This is really good.

00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:45.724
- This is a fun one.

00:02:45.725 --> 00:02:47.333
- It tastes like I want my cat right here

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:50.753
and a book and then I'm
just gonna fall asleep

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:52.167
watching Netflix.

00:02:52.168 --> 00:02:54.856
- I was thinking you'd want a
boy next to you or something,

00:02:54.857 --> 00:02:55.829
'cause I'd want a girl.

00:02:55.854 --> 00:02:56.669
- What? Nah, nah.

00:02:56.694 --> 00:02:57.544
- You want a cat?

00:02:57.545 --> 00:02:58.627
- Nah, just a cat.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.518
Merry Christmas.

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.477
- Tipsy Bartender!

00:03:03.478 --> 00:03:04.777
- Tipsy Bartender.

00:03:04.778 --> 00:03:05.631
(laughter)

00:03:05.656 --> 00:03:07.552
- Ok, ok, ok, she wants
me to hold her hand.

00:03:07.577 --> 00:03:08.529
- No.

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:10.171
- Ok, she doesn't want me to hold...

00:03:10.196 --> 00:03:11.321
The hell you want man?

00:03:11.346 --> 00:03:13.122
(mumbling)

00:03:13.147 --> 00:03:15.306
Megan darling, what are we making today?

00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:17.523
Drunken gingerbread man.

00:03:17.548 --> 00:03:18.556
- Go!

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:20.448
- Oh god!

00:03:20.478 --> 00:03:21.849
- Makin'--

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.117
- I don't have stong hands.

00:03:23.142 --> 00:03:24.714
- Ok hold on for a second, ok?

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.665
Ok, how long you been on this show?

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.158
- [Megan] A year.

00:03:27.183 --> 00:03:27.785
- A year!

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.279
Ok, you had a year to develop your arms!
