Hi, I'm Donna Wolfe from naztazia.com Today
I'm going to show you how to make a crochet

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.820
chain and flower statement necklace.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.470
To do this you'll need some embroidery floss.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.500
You'll need 2 skeins for the chain and 1 skein
for each flower.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.550
I'm using a size D crochet hook.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.260
It helps if you can purchase an inexpensive
costume jewelry chain to crochet around.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.000
But if not, you can use chain found in the
jewelry section of craft stores.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.510
First, start by making a slipknot with your
crochet hook.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.649
Then insert your hook into the chain, and
finish your single crochet stitch.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.260
By the way if you need help with the basics
of crochet, please see my beginner crochet

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.410
videos on YouTube.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.580
I'm doing about 10 single crochet stitches
per chain link.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:14.460
Just keep continuing your single crochet stitch
even into the next link.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.380
Once you get to the end of this part of the
row, pivot your chain and work on the other

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.790
side now.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.810
10 single crochet stitches per link.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.680
Cut your yarn, and I like to tie the two ends
together tightly, then properly weave in all

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.759
your ends.

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.060
You can find where I've purchased my supplies
as well as the written pattern on my website,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:50.600
naztazia.com A quick way to connect the two
ends of your necklace is to use necklace extenders,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.829
which you can find in most jewelry or craft
stores.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:01.030
You insert the extender through the ending
links, and just clasp them together.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.990
Or check out some of my other jewelry videos,
where I show you step by step how to add a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.810
permanent clasp.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.879
On to the flowers.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:19.120
I like using two shades of pink for a flower,
but you can use just one shade.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.680
Make a slip knot, then chain 20.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.120
Feel free to chain more or less to make a
larger or smaller flower.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.860
Do 1 double crochet in the fourth chain from
the hook.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.819
Do one more double crochet in that same stitch.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:45.620
From now on, do three double crochet stitches
in each chain across the row.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.650
You will notice your stitches will begin to
curl, this is normal.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.670
On the last double crochet, don't finish it.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:04.040
Instead, grab the new color of pink, and draw
it through.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.790
Chain 1 and turn your work.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.930
Now, just gently slip stitch in each stitch
across.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.930
You are adding a little highlight to the top
of the flower.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:28.140
When you are done, take the opposite end you
were working on, and twist it into a spiral.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:37.140
Then using the loop on your hook, slip stitch
into the side of the flower to hold it.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.670
To attach the flowers to your necklace, you
can use hot glue.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.159
A stronger method is to glue a little circle
of felt to the bottom of the flower first,

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.660
then glue the other side of the felt to the
necklace.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.970
And feel free to add buttons or beads to each
flower.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.930
