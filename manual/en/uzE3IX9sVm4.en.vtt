00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.490
as the president of the united states
betrayed the left in the values of the

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.070
democratic party is they are another
explanation

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.599
what can people be expected to do about
it

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.009
will lead off with the president's press
conference which built on our deficit

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:18.740
dot

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.250
talks and instructions in those talks
all over the last several days

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.900
and the idea of a grand bargain we have
a video clip of a comment the president

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.779
made today

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.320
if we could see that quibble start off
with that

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.900
warm outside

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.930
a thirty days

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.370
sixty-two ninety-day extension that that
is just not unacceptable approach and if

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.000
we think it's going to be hard with with
a yes or no

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.460
imagine how these guys in the third time

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.650
uh... six months from now in the middle
of election season when they're all off

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.660
it's not having any tariff

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.310
so

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.840
we must will do it now

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.320
fall off the bed

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.870
either peace

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.510
will announce this on the doors

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.060
okay so the president was staying there

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.180
that is time to do the top forty in our
p

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.500
using what what he was referring to was
the fact that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.670
he's pushing for a grand bargain as he
calls them

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.850
on deficit reduction and that grand
bargain from all reports uh... the white

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.410
house would like to see our social
security and medicare and medicaid

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.809
cuts included in that

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:31.950
now there are a lot of ways to interpret
that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.650
but one of the ways to interpret that
and one of the things we're hearing

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.400
uh... out of progress is in washington
including those on capitol hill is that

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.729
social security was uh... we're hearing
a lot of talk about what's on the table

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.090
and not on the table in these talks of
course there is no physical table if

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.380
they're worried that would be where you
put your peas i suppose but there's been

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.030
a lot of talk on the left that uh...
social security was in fact off the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.360
table that the republicans felt it was
too explosive in issue for them and

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.300
uh... the president did not directly
answer questions about that today except

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.770
he did say a couple things that were
telling one of the things he said is if

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.030
we're going to have that that tough
discussions and i'm not going to

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.770
birmingham

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.049
but this is what he was saying

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.229
if we're going to have the tough
discussions about

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:19.209
all of the issue

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.139
liston out why don't we have a now anna
reporter are brittle raise the issue of

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.329
social security being separate from the
deficit

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.659
and uh... i he's said why not uh...

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.110
sideways defer that to a later date

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.209
and the president in effect senator for
discussing the tough issues

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.149
why not discuss them all at once

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:43.629
and what has the progressives and many
others across the political spectrum

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.960
scratching their head about that
position

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.340
is that the logical answer is if
someone's holding a gun to your head

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.280
and in this case it's begun

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.799
of not raising the debt ceiling and is
saying now let's talk about what is

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.089
going to take me to put the gunned down

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.529
i want everything in your bank account

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.859
you don't go back and say oh all but you
haven't mentioned my other bank account

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.449
so why don't we put my other bank
account on the table because of we're

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:13.319
going to have a tough discussion let's
talk about on my bank account that's not

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:20.029
negotiation so it has a lot of people
saying for the first time on the left

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:25.050
with people at least public we have
never said about president barack obama

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.049
and has them speculating about whether
economically conservative policies

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.909
aren't just something hellip

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.399
and he will accept there if they are now
asking themselves are those policies

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:41.489
what he wants uh... one of the people
chiming in was paul krugman who knows a

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.249
thing or two about economics uh... and
dot krugman wrote a piece last week

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:52.079
called what obama wants and the premise
of that piece was that uh...

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.630
it's very hard to look at this debate
and not conclude that the president

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.920
does in fact

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.250
think of the biggest problem facing a
country with nine point two percent

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.899
official unemployment

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:07.139
and real unemployment that's much higher
uh... needs to worry about the deficit

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.869
first and foremost so while crumbling
has been an irritant to the white house

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:16.539
the times he's now openly saying he he
doesn't believe the president

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.839
is on the set set in the angels on this
issue and he's not the only one

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.090
announcement

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.129
dare get first time anyway

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:28.680
use feelings

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.650
and has the right

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.949
the analysis for now there is an
entryway cast them out and

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:44.949
mathematically matches the maddie heard
flood office canada i'm apple sorted

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:45.919
that out
