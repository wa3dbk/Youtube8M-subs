The teardrop knot is a nice decorative knot
that's sometimes tied using a jig but you

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:12.400
can also tie it in the hand. Let's have a
go at tying this knot. To tie the teardrop

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:21.839
knot I'm just going to take my paracord and
I'm going to run out probably 80 cm 90 cm and

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:30.539
i"m just going to form an underhand loop like
that and I'll pull my working end through

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.969
and then come over the standing part again
on the other side and again pull my working

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:56.039
end over and now I just want to bring that
over the top again. So it looks like that

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.530
and I want to form my bottom loop now as big
as I want my teardrop so just adjust it to the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:13.360
size you like and now bring the working end
around the back and try and keep this tight

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:24.070
if you can and then over the front. That's
the first part of the knot set. Keep this

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.500
tight now and all the way through the knot.
It's much easier because its hard to tighten

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.570
afterwards and now we just want to take our
working end and follow that bottom loop around

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.620
but make that loop a little bit smaller so
it tucks on the inside of the first one and

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:56.610
then again we can take it around the back
and around the front keeping it nice and tight

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:05.820
and then follow the loop around again. Again
a smaller loop and just keep following that

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:19.530
same pattern around the back, around the front
follow that loop around until you get that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:32.390
center hole is quite small and then you just
want to tuck the working end down through

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:46.210
that center hole and there, once you've worked
the knot a little bit you should find you

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.080
have your finished teardrop knot.
