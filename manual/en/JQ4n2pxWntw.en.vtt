Hey guys, it’s Ro! And welcome to another
Nerdy Nummies!

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.859
And, happy Halloween!

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.269
Halloween is one of my favorite holidays,
so I decided to do something

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:24.220
very special, we are gonna be making candy
apples, because it’s perfect

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.990
for October, and the fall, and we are gonna
make them look like Spiderman!

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.230
Because that’s kinda creepy spiders for
Halloween!

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.940
So let’s get started!

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.370
The things you will need, will be: 2 cups
of regular white sugar, 1/2 a cup

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.609
of oop! Got some sugar on my finger! 1/2 a
cup of light corn syrup,

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:53.609
3/4 cup of water, 3 apples, I’m using Granny
Smith. 1 teaspoon of red food

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.010
coloring dye, a bunch of these wood skewers,
but they kind of look like wooden

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.199
stakes that you’d stake a vampire with!
That’s OK!

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.820
You’ll also need a piece of wax paper to
go over your cookie sheet, and,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.760
a wooden spoon, a spatula, a medium sized
saucepan, and a candy thermometer!

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.380
Let’s get started!

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.560
Now you’re gonna take your little wooden
skewers, put them right in the middle and

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.540
push them in there. These are a little bit
easier than lollipop sticks, you can

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.670
also use lollipop sticks, but because they
have a pointed edge, they go in a little

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.270
bit easier. I don’t have the most upper
body strength, so I’m gonna be using

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.770
a hammer.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.340
You want to put them in about 1/2 way… Nice!

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.870
Once you got your apples assembled, you’re
just gonna stick them off to the side,

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.340
da-dew, da-dew. da-dew!

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.470
And we’re gonna put together our candy apple
mixture.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.880
In your medium sized pot you’re gonna add
all of your ingredients and then stir them

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.840
up before we head over to the stove.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.560
So first you’re going to take your 2 cups of regular
sugar, yeah, yeah, pour him in!

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.120
And your 3/4 cup of water. 1/2 a cup of light
corn syrup, ooooh!

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.920
It’s really goopy, it’s really sticky,
so this is where you’re gonna use your

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.849
mustach-u-ler! To scoop out all the extra
on the inside. Because otherwise

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.069
it won’t be 1/2 a cup.

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.719
Now you’re just gonna take a teaspoon of
red food coloring dye.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.260
Now you’re gonna take your wooden sch-poon,
and mix it all together until

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.579
everything is consistent.

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.499
I feel like this is a witches brew! Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.000
Boil-babble-boil-boil and trouble!

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.230
I just put the pot on the stove, you’re
gonna turn your burner onto a medium

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.909
heat, I like to put it on a 5, and then you’re
gonna stir your candy syrup

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.989
until it starts boiling. Once it start boiling,
leave it alone, don’t touch

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.099
it, just let it boil, and you’re gonna watch
your candy thermometer until the

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:02.689
heat rises to 310 degrees. Once it
reaches 310 degrees, remove it from the

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:07.329
heat. Now you’re gonna wait until all the
bubbles stop popping, and then you’re gonna

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:14.049
take your apple, dip it into the syrup candy,
and slowly spin it around.

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.609
Then you’re gonna pick it up, wait for the
excess candy to drip off,

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:19.999
and put it onto your tray.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:23.269
Now that we've got our apples dipped, we are
going to decorate.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.329
I’m going to be using big marshmallows,
you can also use regular marshmallows,

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.650
these are just the ones I had handy, they
were in my kitchen.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.579
So what you’re gonna do is take baking scissors,
a little bit of Pam spray,

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.060
we’re gonna spray our scissors before we
cut our marhsmallows.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.529
Helps them not stick.

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:42.049
Ready? OK, there we go!

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.639
Take your big marshmallow, or your medium
one, and we’re just gonna cut off the

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:51.329
end to look like a slice. And we’re gonna be
using these marshmallows for Spiderman’s

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.019
eyes! And then what I like to do is cut it
in half,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.359
Then you’re gonna take half of it and cut
kind of the shape of his eye, it’s like

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.319
a diamond or a tear shape. Pew!

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.200
Now you’re just gonna take your 2 marshmallow
eyeballs and stick ‘em on the

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.320
front of your apple!

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.240
Da-nuh-na-nuh-nuh, da-nuh-na-na-na.

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.319
Now that you’ve got all the little marshmallow
eyeballs on our little

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:21.250
Spiderman Candy Apples, you’re gonna take
black icing, and I’ve got a number 3 tip,

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.860
here at the top, and we’re just gonna draw
the design of the web of the Spiderman

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.840
mask. And then I’m gonna take a number 5
tip later on, to outline his eyes!

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.740
Ta-da!

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.220
Here are our Spiderman Candy Apples! They
turned out so cute!

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.690
Thanks for suggesting something Spiderman!
And, Halloween is in a few days, so have a happy

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.050
Halloween! And don’t, try not to get bit
by any radioactive spiders!

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.140
Or any spiders of any kind… Yeah, OK!
