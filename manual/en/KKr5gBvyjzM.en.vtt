00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.700
Take a bow is a really fun behavior to train,
and there's a variety of ways of doing it.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.470
We could capture a bow.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.070
What a bow is essentially is when your dog
gets up and takes a beautiful stretch pulling

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.500
the front of their body down to the ground
and stretching their rear up into the air.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.680
So, it's a natural behavior that all dogs
generally do, some more than others.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.719
We might also see this behavior naturally
in dogs when they are playing with each other.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.180
We often call it a play bow where one dog
will bow down to another one to encourage

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.480
them to play.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.670
So one of the techniques we can use for training
this is called capturing.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.120
The dog simply does it naturally, and we click
or mark it with a verbal marker, and then

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.130
we reward it.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.120
Of course we have to wait for it to happen.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.920
Another way that we can train this behavior
is by luring our dog's head down while keeping

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.500
their rear in the air.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.309
And the third way, which is my favorite and
what I'm going to demonstrate for you, is

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.360
shaping.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.490
Shaping is where you break a behavior down
into small, achievable steps and you slowly

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.800
communicate with your dog along the way as
to what you're looking for as the end result.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.000
Again, you want to be organized.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.860
You want to know what the end result is, but
you want to see any movement that your dog

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.750
makes that's moving in that direction slowly.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.520
So for bow, I would first want to let my dog
know by using my clicker as a marker that

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.510
I want him in a standing position.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.950
So I might click standing just a few times.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.950
I'm going to wait for him to stand.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.520
I can encourage it by moving back a little
bit.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.650
And then he did it for me.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.119
I'm going to look to see if he drops his head
down at all.

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:59.229
To help with that, and there goes the front
of the body, I'm just going to wait for him

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.270
to do it on his own.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.850
Any movement of the front end going down gets
a click and a reward.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.390
If his rear end goes down the saddest thing
that's going to happen to him is he's not

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.000
going to get a click and a treat because that's
not what I'm looking for.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.440
We don't want to say to our dogs when we're
training, "No, you got it wrong."

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.700
There's no need for that.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.280
We just want to focus on what they're getting
right.
