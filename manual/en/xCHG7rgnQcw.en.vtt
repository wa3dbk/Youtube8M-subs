00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.340
So here we have a guy who says religion is
a crock

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.559
It's hateful and belligerent - but Jesus is
his rock!

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.590
Now what's the difference, you might ask,
that sets apart his creed?

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.869
Religion's just hypocrisy, self-righteousness
and greed

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.460
To follow Jesus means you simply give yourself
to God,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.950
Who died for all our sins and stuff - now
doesn't this sound odd?

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.160
He loves his Bible, church, and Lord, he still
believes in sin

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.340
But nope, that's not religion, for the difference
lies within

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.079
He doesn't think he's perfect - oh yes, what
a humble soul

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.510
He's not a fan of rules, just believing is
his role

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.720
So don't be sanctimonious, admit that you're
a sinner,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.130
Believe that Jesus died for you, and God says
you're a winner!

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.420
I've never heard of that before, dear Jefferson
Bethke

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.649
But it sure sounds familiar - oh!

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.350
It's Christianity!

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.640
Now who on earth would fall for this cute
definition trick?

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.620
If you don't think about it, then it does
seem rather slick.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.809
Religion's often seen as being hate-filled
and judgmental

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.380
To have that name hitched to your faith would
be so detrimental

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.630
So let's just find another word - let's call
the whole thing "Jesus"

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.810
And maybe it might actually change how the
world sees us.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.399
Yes, I see what you did there, Jeff, but nobody's
impressed

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.359
When one religious movement claims that only
they are blessed

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.750
It's nothing new when churches paint all others
as a blight,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.490
As sheer demonic heresy - for they alone are
right

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.920
From doctrine, dogma, sin and Hell, you give
us no relief

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.599
It's just a crafty strategy to market your
belief.

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:41.090
So who is Mr. Bethke, and from what was he
inspired?

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.289
He says it's just a home-made film.

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.270
Is that how this transpired?

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.729
We know that he's a member of a church that's
called Mars Hill

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.789
Where thousands gather every week to hear
the holy spiel.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.979
Mark Driscoll is their pastor, a self-styled
rebel cleric

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.299
Whose stances, theologically, are really quite
generic

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.710
This macho, hardcore preacher never hesitates
to tell:

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.929
If you haven't heard of Jesus, then prepare
to burn in Hell!

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.509
To him there's no salvation in benevolent
behavior

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.060
Being nice won't help you - you need Jesus
as your savior.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.530
And no doubt Pastor Driscoll thinks himself
rather volcanic,

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.450
When he tells his parishioners that yoga is
Satanic

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.810
On women in the clergy, we're assured that
he's no advocate

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.890
If they can't bring in manly men, that means
they're inadequate.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.010
Instructing people on how they should live
their married life,

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.200
He tells a tale of how he wished to leave
his pregnant wife

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.470
What would prompt a Godly man to make this
declaration?

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.390
He found out that in high school, she had
sexual relations

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.180
And when he goes on Facebook to mock "effeminate"
preachers,

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.820
There's little to distinguish him from other
Christian teachers.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.030
While Bethke aims to make his faith seem so
much more dimensional,

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.670
We all know that it's nothing but religion
most conventional

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.750
And I don't think you need so many platitudes
to say,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.720
"Religion's old and stuffy - now let's go
to church and pray!"

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.260
Word.
