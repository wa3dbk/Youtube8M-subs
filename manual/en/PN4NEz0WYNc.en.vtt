Hello everyone this is Breanna Rutter author
of one of my most popular books that natural

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.730
hair Bible and founder of howtoblackhair.com
for these videos I answer the questions you

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.320
all send me via email so if any of you have
any questions you will likely answer be sure

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.900
to check out the description box below for
additional information today this video is

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.050
because of an email I received from Amina
Amina emailed me because she says that she's

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.510
looking for a more natural approach to how
to recover from damaged hair she wants some

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.670
help with how to use products that don't have
any chemicals or much at all because she has

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.489
a small child now so what I'm going to do
is suggest some natural things you can do

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.580
to help your hair recover from any damage
that you may have done to it so so the very

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.110
first thing I want to suggest is that coconut
oil would be your number one friend coconut

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.740
oil does so much for the hair and for the
scalp it's just endless for all the benefits

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.689
that it does for you it's a great deep conditioner
it's a great moisturizer it can be a great

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.929
sealant for some it also helps your hair to
not lose as much protein when you're washing

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:23.999
and so much more so that's why for my very
first tip I highly suggest that you have coconut

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:29.060
oil on hand and what I want you to do is make
sure that you are conditioning weekly with

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.679
coconut alone to help you to recover from
your damaged hair whether your hair is damaged

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:42.509
from using too many chemicals from any chemical
treatments from using too much heat or other

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.569
products that may have caused major hair damage
so now the second tip that I'm going to suggest

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.520
is that most times when you have damaged hair
is usually because there is a loss of protein

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.109
in your hair it is very easy to recover from
dry hair by simply incorporating more moisturizing

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:03.469
products but in most cases if it's hard for
you to recover from that is usually because

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.989
you have a loss of protein so my second tip
is that you start to if coconut oil is it

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.330
working for you, you have two start actually
do deep conditioning treatment with eggs or

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.010
hydrolyzed protein now there is a difference
between the protein in the two because with

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.299
eggs the protein molecules are larger which
only bound to the outside of your hair strand

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.569
so it is not very intensive it is just more
of a light protein treatment before an intense

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.900
protein treatment whether protein molecules
are small enough to migrate inside of your

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.950
hair strands you have to use hydrolyzed protein
so you can use keratin or you can use wheat

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.829
protein so I highly suggest that you use hydrolyzed
protein as a treatment to help you recover

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:50.560
from damaged hair now the third to that I'm
going to suggest also is to make sure you

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.459
just limit your use of heat that you're using
or chemicals at this point I wouldn't even

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.370
say limit I would just say eliminate all of
it because you have damaged hair and you have

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.510
a lot of recovering to do so make sure that
you are not using any hot tools until your

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.239
hair gets back healthy you are not doing any
relaxer treatments or any chemical coloring

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.109
treatments to your hair until it gets back
healthy and even evaluate the type of hair

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.599
products you're using because most times the
products you are using could be causing the

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.360
damage to your hair so I hope this is help
you I want to thank you for your email and

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.299
now that you have all this knowledge can incorporate
whatever you need to help you get your hair

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.750
back balanced and healthy thank you and also
