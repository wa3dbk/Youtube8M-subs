00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.650
Like all good DSC1 training the national gamekeepers
association runs 4 day courses, usually over

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.200
two weekends.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.660
The guys today have a lot to learn on the
theory of deer stalking. Why are they nervous?

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.750
Most of them haven't sat an exam for decades.
And this is the crunch weekend. The final

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.960
test.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:45.050
Oh yeah, oh absolutely. Just take everything,
you can't isolate individual bits and focus

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.220
on that, you're just going to trip over so
i'm just taking everything in.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.750
I would reckon it was seasons. You know, when
you're going, you actually know what you're

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.150
going for and you know what you're going to
shoot. You book your holiday and you're going

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.480
to shoot a stag and you book your holiday
in the stag season.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.540
There are five parts to the DSC1. Gun safety,
rifle accuracy, deer habits and the law, a

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.240
quarry identification test and questions about
meat hygiene.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.880
The first two are practical tests. The guys
are tested on the last three in a written

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.400
paper with 120 multiple choice questions.
So, how good are you?

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:45.540
The written questions come form a bank of
284 of them. Here are three 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:02:02.360
for 
you 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:35.780
to sample...

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.370
Alan Barrell is the NGO officer holding the
course today.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.980
The course is designed so that people get
an understanding of the subject.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.201
Thats what we want, we want them to demonstrate
that they have got the knowledge to go out

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:55.510
and start stalking, that they are safe to
stalk. That'll come from the safety test,

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.319
or the safety examination that we are going
to do tomorrow.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.380
And they have an ability with a rifle to put
shots where they need to be.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.020
If they go away with that and the understanding
then I'll be very pleased.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.450
The course and the exam is being held at Calton
Moor range in Derbyshire which is run by Mike

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.099
Dickenson.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.700
The DSC level 1 consists of a shooting test,
a safety , test a visual test and a written

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.700
test.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.580
The written test being 50 multiple choice
questions. A,B,C,D and you tick the answer.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.880
Can I just learn that?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:37.730
They're taken from a bank of 285 questions
that DMQ have put together the candidates

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.250
need to know a broad spectrum of everything
about all the species of deer.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:53.750
The law, basic ballistics, meat hygiene laws,
seasons, legal calibers, legal quarry, a general

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.459
and overall deer knowledge.

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.310
The two practical tests are instant fails
if you get them wrong.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.170
The safety test is a walk with the examiner,
who will ask you whether certain shots are

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.700
safe or unsafe.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.819
In the shooting test you have to put a total
of nine shots into the killing area of a deer

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.819
target.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:21.060
At distances from 100-40 yards and at various
positions, including prone, standing and sitting.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.990
The really tricky bit for most people is the
new part of the test.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.779
Game meat hygiene. Today the students have
a rare chance to visit a truly Rolls Royce

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:34.110
game handling facility on a nearby private
estate.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.900
Food hygiene these days is the most important
part of it, where do people typically fall

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.809
down in the exam?

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:46.650
Not realising how easy it is to contaminate
a carcass. If you burst the rumen, or you

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.680
get it covered in mud. From the second it
is shot, it becomes a food product.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.460
And it wants treating the same as. So, you
wouldn't get your sandwiches for your dinner

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.300
and drag them along the cow pats. And cover
them in offle.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.110
So, treat it as a food product and keep it
as clean as possible.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.150
There's also a lot of words to learn with
food hygiene like maxillary and has-sip and

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.180
rumen. Do people fall down on those at all?

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.199
They do a bit, you don't need to know the
exact wordings for all the glands. As long

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.819
as you can show them where they are. You've
shown knowledge that you know what you're

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.930
looking for.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.300
There are lots of ways of passing your DSC1
but unless you're an actor who is good at

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.919
learning lines then understanding the subject
is key.

00:05:30.919 --> 00:06:19.039
Now, heres another quick quiz taken from more
DSC1 written questions.

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:26.279
