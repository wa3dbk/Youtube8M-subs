00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.460
Today on this 2006 Dodge Grand Caravan we're
going to install part number 118300 from Tow-Ready.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.629
First thing we're going to do is open up the
hatch and then we'll go ahead and remove the

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:25.060
two tail light assemblies. We'll us e a trim
panel tool to remove the rivets then we can

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.730
go ahead and pull the tail light away from
the vehicle. Then we'll go ahead and disconnect

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.040
the wire harness. There's a small red tab
that we have to push in so we can release

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:44.360
the lock. Once it's pushed out of the way
we can go ahead and press down on the tab

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.360
located here and then we can squeeze it and
we can go ahead and pull the wire harness

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.460
away from the light.
We're done with our drivers side let's go

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:08.440
ahead and repeat the same thing on the passengers
side. Now we'll go ahead and start the dis-assembly

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.500
of the interior components. We'll start off
my removing the threshold. We'll go ahead

00:01:13.500 --> 00:02:35.400
and pop it lose using 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:03:14.880
a 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:04:10.280
trim panel tool. We'll go ahead and loosen

00:04:10.280 --> 00:05:23.150
up 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:07:58.350
the carpet 

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.469
as well.
