00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.380
Hello, I'm Joe Ramey and today
is Monday, December 1st. This presentation

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.340
will look back to climate numbers for the
month of November and the fall season; and

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.670
then look ahead to the latest outlook for
the month of December and the winter and spring

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.909
seasons to come.

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:25.449
Here is a November climate summary
for regional airports. In the upper portion

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.099
of this slide are the monthly precipitation
amounts. In parentheses are the departure

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:36.550
from normal. You can see that all airports
were drier than normal. Average monthly temperatures

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.329
in the lower half of the slide were below
normal except at Durango. Generally November

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.899
2014 produced a storm track that was north
and east of this forecast area.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.899
Here is a summary of the meteorological
fall season of September, October, and November

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.640
2014. Overall this fall season started out
wet but ended up generally drier than normal

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.280
except at Durango and Vernal. Average temperatures
in the lower half of the slide came in above

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.610
normal except at Grand Junction.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.200
Here are annual precipitation graphs
for three representative sites in this forecast

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.200
area, Craig in northwest Colorado, Grand Junction
in west central Colorado, and Cortez in the

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.399
southwest. You can see that the upcoming months
of December and January are normally one of

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.579
the driest periods of the year.

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.520
Now let's turn to the forecast
for the upcoming winter and spring seasons.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.039
Out at this time frame, forecasters are no
longer tracking individual storms, but are

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:46.180
looking to the state of the Pacific Ocean
for clues to future storm track and intensity.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.109
In the equatorial eastern Pacific, between
the dateline and the coast of Equador is the

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:56.380
Nino 3.4 region outlined here by the red box.
Warmer than normal temperatures in this region

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.439
are called El Nino, colder than normal temperatures
define La Nina. Together these are the warm

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.329
and cold phases of the El Nino Southern Oscillation,
or ENSO for short.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.470
Here is a chart showing current sea
surface temperature departure from normal

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.390
with the Nino 3.4 region roughly enclosed
in the red box. The ocean temperatures are

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.850
showing signs of warming, though we officially
remain in ENSO neutral conditions.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.830
Here is somewhat technical slide
showing the forecast from numerous models

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.830
of how temperatures within the Nino 3.4 region
will vary into the winter and spring of 2015,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.590
from left to right across the graph. You can
see the majority of the forecast lines rise

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.420
above the 0.5 line indicating an El Nino winter
is on the way. Some of the forecast models

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.250
indicate that we will not quite make El Nino
conditions this cold season. The best forecast

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.880
is for a weak El Nino event.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.880
El Nino winters tend to flatten the
jet stream along the southern tier of states.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.760
One storm pattern that occurs during El Nino
cold seasons are low pressure systems that

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.990
dig to the south of the Four Corners region.
This pattern often brings wet weather to the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.180
Desert Southwest as far north as the Four
Corners.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.950
Here is the outlook for this month
of December from the Climate Prediction Center.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.530
On the left is the temperature probability
chart. The large brown area centered along

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.070
the West Coast indicates a shift of probabilities
towards warmer than normal conditions, stretching

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.200
into eastern Utah and far western Colorado.
On the right, the precipitation probability

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.030
chart indicates an area of increased chances
of wetter than normal conditions for the Four

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.430
Corners region. For the rest this forecast
area, there is less forecast skill, so there

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.840
are equal chances of above, near, and below
normal precipitation.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.080
This brings us to the Climate Prediction
Center's outlook for the winter season of

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.570
December-January-February. On the left chart, you can see our shift towards warmer probabilities

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.680
still extends into eastern Utah and far western Colorado. The right chart of precipitation

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.729
probabilities also still shows an increased
chance of wetter than normal in the southern

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.080
portion of our forecast area. Otherwise much of our forecast area remains in the white

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.979
Equal Chances area showing no forecast skill for temperatures or precipitation.

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.889
Moving on into the spring, here
is the Climate Prediction Center's outlook

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.229
for the February-March-April season. On the left, the warm shift continues for the western

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.069
half of this forecast area. On the right,
you can see that now the odds are for a wetter

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.639
than normal spring across the entire forecast
area.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:56.039
slide 12. If El Nino conditions do emerge
as forecast this winter, here is what has

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:02.050
happened during the four most recent El Ninos.
This subset of El Ninos show a tendency for

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.599
a drier than normal winter, with only one
of the winter months recording above normal

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.810
snowfall each year. In the right column, the
four spring seasons show a tendency towards

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.729
wetter than normal conditions.

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:21.590
This concludes this fall climate
summary and winter to spring seasonal outlook.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:28.590
