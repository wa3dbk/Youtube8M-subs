00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.580
Hi, everyone. I’m Jim Messina, campaign
manager of Obama for America. I've got a quick

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.690
update for you on where the race is right
now -- and our outlook for the next five months.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.520
Over the past few weeks, I’ve had people
asking me about all the polls they’ve been seeing.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.530
I say the same thing to all of them. We knew
this was going to be a

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.880
tough race -- and we knew that once Mitt Romney
locked up the nomination, the Republicans

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.180
would get

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.410
behind him and this race would be tight. Just
like we always knew it would be.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.060
You know what really matters in a close election?

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.029
The unprecedented grassroots
organizing we’re doing every day in states

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.610
across the country. We’re following the
strategy we’ve had since day one, and we

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.010
can’t afford to lose focus on that.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.000
Here’s one more thing you can tell your
friends when they ask you about

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.920
the latest polls:
We’re actually ahead of where we were at

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.440
this point last time around.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.280
Remember summer of 2008?

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.989
Folks don't remember it this way, but in May
and June of 2008, a lot of polls were saying

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.160
we'd never pull it off -- in fact, eight different
national polls had us anywhere from neck-in-neck

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.789
to down a few points.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.269
But you talked to your friends
and neighbors. And voters those polls had

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.479
counted out showed up on Election Day in record
numbers.

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.200
We’re going to do that again this year,
on an even bigger scale -- and this time around,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.250
we’re starting out with an advantage.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.850
If the election were

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.850
held today, we would win 243 of the 270 electoral
votes we need to win. Romney would come in

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.830
at 191, with 104 electoral votes up for grabs
in the battleground states where we’re doing

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.890
some of our best organizing -- opening up
offices,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.509
staffing up, and registering voters. These

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.380
are states where we've already out-organized
what we did in 2008.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.340
Which, to quote the Vice President, is

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.409
a big, um, deal.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.400
A quick example. In North Carolina in 2008,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.329
we won by 14,000 votes, but we registered
more than 160,000 new voters.

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.990
That was a difference. That's how we won.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.299
This time around, we're taking the same approach.
So while polls say it's too close to call

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.909
in
North Carolina, what matters to me is this,

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.130
we've already registered 83,000 voters this
cycle

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.599
in North Carolina - organizing on the ground,
talking to voters, getting you involved, that's

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.069
how we win.

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.879
All of this is just to say one thing: the
only poll

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.269
that really matters is November 6th. Election
Day.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.079
We can’t pay attention to anything else
-- good or bad. We need to keep focusing on

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.379
building our campaign. And that’s exactly
what we’re doing. We’re going to run the

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.510
most sophisticated grassroots campaign this
country has ever seen -- and to do that, we

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.249
need to stay focused, work hard, and ignore
the ups and downs.

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:39.189
When things get tough out there, remember
why we're doing this - to make sure that all

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.849
Americans get a fair shot and a fair
shake in this economy.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.829
To make sure that all of our kids can go
as far as their talents can take them.

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.029
That's what this is about, and it's
worth the fight.

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:55.279
So keep up the great
work out there, hit the doors, send in a contribution,

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:56.599
and let's go win this thing.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.409
Thanks everyone. See you soon.
