00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.010
Slide 1
Hi! I'm Evan. I'm a junior studying biology

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.760
at a small college in Pennsylvania and I'm
getting ready to take the MCAT exam. You know,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.290
the Medical College Admission Test. I really
want to go to medical school to be a pediatrician.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.160
I was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary school
and I'd like to apply for accommodations

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.170
on the MCAT exam.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.600
Slide 2
The first thing I need to do is register for

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.020
the MCAT exam. Now I can go to the MCAT Accommodations
website to review the Application Requirements

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.960
and then follow the link to apply for testing
accommodations.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.670
Slide 3
I'll log in with the AAMC username and password

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.670
that I just used to register for the MCAT
exam. Check out the dates on the right side

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.610
of the homepage -- I'm applying more than
the posted 60 days before the regular registration

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.180
deadline of my desired MCAT exam, as recommended
by the MCAT Office of Accommodated Testing.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.900
This will give me the best chance of receiving
my decision in time for my preferred date."

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.729
Slide 4
Now I'll just put in my email address, phone

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.640
number, and home address. I know this needs
to be an email address I'll check a lot,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.280
so I'll use my personal one and not the
one for my school.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.280
Slide 5
I go to school at Oswin College in Pennsylvania,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.800
so I'll choose that where it says "undergraduate
institution." I haven't taken the MCAT

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.710
before, but I did take the SAT in high school.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.930
Slide 6
I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2000, when I

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.800
was 8 - I was in Mrs. Dobrey's third grade
class.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.800
Now I have some questions to answer about
my testing history. Since I was diagnosed,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.850
I've always been able to get extra time
on tests in school and on the SAT. I do have

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.209
medication that I take every day. I know I
need more time to study than a lot of my friends

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.420
do. And I always study in one of the quiet
rooms at the library, so my roommate doesn't

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.109
distract me.

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:29.670
Ok, these are filled out now, so I just have
the last ones. I would like to have extended

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.189
time and a private room for the MCAT. That's
what I had for the SAT and that worked really

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.609
well for me.
Slide 7

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:45.609
Now I have to get all of my documents ready.
I can mail them in, but it's so much faster

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.670
to just upload them here, and I don't have
to worry about going to the post office. I

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:05.499
already saved all of my documents to my computer
as pdfs with my initials, what they are, and

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.629
this year, so I'll just make all of the
titles the same. That'll make finding them

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.779
really easy if I need to look at them again
later.

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:17.779
Hmm, I haven't gotten my transcript yet.
I'll come back later and add that.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:28.069
Slide 8
Ok, I have my transcript now and I saved it

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.650
to my computer as a pdf. I'm ready to log
back in and finish where I left off.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.030
There we go. Everything looks good, so I'll
review and submit my application now! Oh,

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.500
I completely forgot to upload my cover letter.
I'll do that now.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:58.090
Slide 9
Ok, now all of my documents are there and

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:57.390
I'm ready to submit my application.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.740
Slide 10
There, that all looks right. And...submit!

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.740
I'm done for now.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.740
Slide 11
Right after I submitted my application, I

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.740
got an email from the MCAT Office of Accommodated
Testing. It said that I could log back in

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.740
to check on the status of my application.
So, let's see if anything has changed!

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:12.490
It looks like when I left the application
and came back, it saved it as a Draft. And

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:19.990
now it lists that my application has been
Submitted. I'm glad that everything has

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:29.520
been sent to the MCAT accommodations team
like it's supposed to!

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:37.010
Slide 12
It's been over a month now and I just got

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:45.900
another email from the MCAT Office of Accommodated
Testing. It said that there was a status change

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:53.970
to my application. I really hope that my accommodations
were approved!

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:53.970
Once I've logged in, I see there's a letter
waiting for me in the "Correspondence"

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.340
section. Yes, it looks like a decision was
made on my request!

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:54.590
Overall, the submission process was pretty
simply. I'm happy to have received my decision.
