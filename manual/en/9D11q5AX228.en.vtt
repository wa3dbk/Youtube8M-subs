Hi this is Jamie from POSGuys.com and today
we're discussing Epson's two newest point

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.290
of sale printers the Epson ReadyPrint T20
and the Epson TM-T88V.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.400
The TM-T88V is the latest edition to Epson's
industry leading TM-T88 point of sale printer

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400
series.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.880
Designed for use in food service and retail
environments the TM-T88V offers more speed

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.830
and features and reliability than ever before.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.040
In short this is Epson's fastest and most
reliable printer.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.579
It has

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.960
easy drop in loading.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.809
It has a standard status light, feed button

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.089
on off switch

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.789
interchangeable interface

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.179
power cord

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.600
standard USB interface

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.159
and the cash drawer port.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.270
Epson's cost effective ReadyPrint T20 thermal
printer is the latest edition to Epson's energy

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.370
efficient point of sale printers.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.960
Designed specifically for low volume retailers
it combines basic point of sale printing functionality

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.550
with high reliability and multiple ease of
use features.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.450
In short this is a less expensive version
than the TM-T88V.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:37.110
Like the TM-T88V it has easy drop in loading,

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.110
standard status light

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.530
feed button

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.660
easy on off switch

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.140
the back is a little different in that

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.130
it has a USB interface that is not interchangeable.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:59.040
It has an integrated power supply as opposed
to an external power supply and than the cash

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.040
draw port.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.380
The biggest difference between the TM-T88V
and the T220 is print speed.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.690
The T220 prints out at an average of 6" per
second while the TM-T88V prints out about

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.980
12 inches per second.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.090
And this one also incorporates a data buffer.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.510
I'm going to print out simultaneously the
same restaurant receipt so you guys can see

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:40.030
how much faster is the TM-T88V.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.980
As you can see

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.740
the exact same receipt, this one was just
printed out a lot faster.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.549
In addition to the difference in printing
speed the TM-T88V also comes with a four year

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.540
warranty while the T20 just comes with a two
year warranty.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.180
The TM-T88V is rated at 2 million cuts while
the T20 is rated at 1.5 million.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:10.349
The TM-T88V also has an interchangeable interfaces
and its also, its already integrated with

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.139
USB while this one only has USB

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:19.859
and this one has an external power supply
the T20 only has an internal power supply.

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.469
