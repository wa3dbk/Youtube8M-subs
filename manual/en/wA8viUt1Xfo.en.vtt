00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.700
--So, hi!--

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.420
Hi.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.100
--Alex right?--

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.640
Yep.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.439
--Alex,
tell me, you're a division one athlete

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.130
wrestler--yep--What's it like being an
athlete? When you're a division one

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.160
athlete, what does that mean for you in
a college life?--

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.160
It means my college life is mainly academics and athletics.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.120
I told Mark earlier, there are three points to the triangle in college,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.800
you have
social, athletics, and academics. You're only going to

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.970
succeed at two, so one of them is going to
suffer. Whether you choose athletics,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.300
social, or academics is your choice, but
it's impossible to get all three. You just don't

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.580
have enough time to do it and they
have rollover effects.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.700
--And you're an engineering major?--

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.240
Yeah!

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.680
--So you're a
little insane?--

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.320
Kind of, I enjoy it, it's fun.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.670
--So tell me, behind you we have some
fraternity houses here and there's quite

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.189
a few fraternities on this campus and--oh we know where we are now--so tell me

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.179
what percentage, what's the story that
you hear about the percentage of

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.110
students who are Greek and then what's reality?-- I think the school says like thirty percent,

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.799
but I think they take that before the
new pledge class and after the seniors are

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.289
graduating, so it's about half. So I think
accurately I think it's a round sixty

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.959
percent. I'm making that up, but that's just
from my experience and how many

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.813
fraternities, sororities I know and how
many kids are in them

00:01:43.813 --> 00:01:45.760
and how many kids go to this school.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.020
So I would say around sixty
percent are in some sort of Greek,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.500
whether it's ones that are here, a few of
them have off campus houses but

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.660
are still university sponsored.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.600
--Are you Greek?--

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.560
No.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.600
--What does that mean for you if you've got 60, 50-60 percent

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.180
of the students here are in a house? What does that mean for you?--

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.369
I mean I feel like Greek life fraternities, they

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.180
provide a group of people to hang out
with and do things together and so if

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.840
you don't have that somewhere else it's
kind of tough, but luckily for me the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.239
wrestling team is my fraternity. A lot of
times our time is spent practicing, but we

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.760
also hang out together. I'm living off
campus with wrestlers next year. So

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.849
if you're not in a fraternity or sorority

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.060
you have to have another group of people
to be with.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.080
--So what would you say to someone who really doesn't know,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.269
hasn't,
you know, as a high school student, and

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.840
hasn't thought very long and hard about
this whole fraternity issue, what would

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.290
you tell them to think about as they're
trying to make a decision whether they

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.000
want to go to a campus that's heavily
Greek or to avoid that? What would you say?--

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.260
I don't know. I feel like I've never been to a
different university that isn't

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.010
predominantly Greek, but I feel like
even if you go to those schools, and at

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.620
least the ones, I talk to my friends,
some of them go to bigger state universities

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.410
that aren't Greek, it still
comes down to the same thing: you need a group

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.200
of people to hang out with. The thing a fraternity provides is

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.430
a people that tend to be very similar,
interests exactly like you. Some people

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.440
don't like that. Some people like to have
a diverse group of friends.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.060
It kind of depends on what you want.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.860
But
fraternities just happen to be people

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.610
that a lot of times are carbon copies, or
want to be.
