00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.902
Kevin Love: I'm Kevin Love and
welcome to West Wing Week.

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:04.904
Narrator: Welcome to
the West Wing week,

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:06.873
your guide to everything
that's happening

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:07.874
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:09.876
This week, the president
convened summits on global

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.878
public health and on
the BRAIN Initiative,

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:14.247
hosted the prime ministers
of India and Israel,

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:17.817
welcomed the 2013 MLS Champions
Sporting Kansas City to the

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:20.019
White House, and traveled
to Chicago to speak

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.021
on the resurgence of
the American economy.

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:24.958
It's September 26th
to October 2nd, or --

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:25.658
The President: -- if
the body is strong --

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.327
The Narrator: -- if
the body is strong.

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:28.795
The President: -- if
communities are strong,

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:32.966
if nations are strong, then
their immune systems are

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:33.967
a little bit stronger.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.969
Narrator: On Friday, the
president emphasized the need

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.971
for all nations to prioritize
public health in light

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.973
of the Ebola epidemic
in West Africa.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:40.940
The President: We have to change
out mindsets and start thinking

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.111
about biological threats as
the security threats that they

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.113
are, in addition to being
humanitarian threats

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:48.114
and economic threats.

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.116
We have to bring the same
level of commitment and focus

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.118
to these challenges as we
do when meeting around

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:54.120
more traditional
security issues.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.122
Narrator: Later, the president
sat down with Steve Croft

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:59.325
of 60 Minutes, and spoke on
America's role as the world's

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:00.593
indispensable nation.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:04.264
The President: -- when trouble
comes up anywhere in the world,

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:09.903
they don't call Beijing, they
don't call Moscow, they call us.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.037
That's how we role.

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:12.505
Narrator: Saturday night,
the president and first lady

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.874
donned their formal wear
for the 44th Annual

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.776
Congressional Black
Caucus Foundation's

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:17.877
Phoenix Award
Dinner.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:20.346
The President: Cynicism is very
popular in America sometimes.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.748
It's propagated in
the media.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.750
But cynicism didn't put
anybody on the moon.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.885
Cynicism didn't pass
the Voting Rights Act.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:28.955
Hope is what packed buses
full of freedom riders.

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.957
Hope is what led
thousands of black folks

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:33.226
and white folks to march
from Selma to Montgomery.

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:37.297
Hope is what got John Lewis off
his back after being beaten

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:40.533
within an inch of his life,
and chose to keep on going.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.470
Cynicism is a choice, but
hope is a better choice.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.870
(applause)

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.705
Narrator: On Tuesday, the
president invited Prime Minister

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:47.807
Narendra Modi of India to
the White House for

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:49.108
their first summit.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:52.078
Then they ventured out together
on a lovely fall Tuesday to make

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.214
a pilgrimage to one of the
newest landmarks in our

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:58.084
nation's capital: the memorial
to Dr. Martin Luther King,

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:00.086
Jr. They pledged to push the
bilateral relationship to new

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:02.889
levels, resolve issues blocking
implementation of a civil

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:05.758
nuclear deal and cooperate
in counterterrorism.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:08.294
Both leaders committed to a new
mantra for their relationship:

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.964
Chalein Saath Saath,
forward together we go.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.966
In the afternoon, the White
House announced new investments

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.201
in the BRAIN Initiative, a
critical research effort

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:18.304
that aims to advance our
understanding of the human mind,

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.306
and our ability
to treat, prevent,

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.875
and cure brain disorders.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.143
Wednesday, the president met
with Israeli Prime Minister

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:26.412
Benjamin Netanyahu
in the Oval Office.

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:28.681
Of course there was much
on the docket to discuss,

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.683
including relations
with the Palestinians

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.385
and efforts to combat ISIL.

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:33.720
Later, the
president welcomed

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.789
the 2013 MLS Champions
Sporting Kansas City.

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:40.159
The President: The
Royals advancing,

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.828
blew out the Patriots
the other day --

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:42.462
(laughter)

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.763
The President: -- so
overall, you -- someone's

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:44.631
going onto Kansas City.

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.332
You guys got -- you
got it all started.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.535
Narrator: On Thursday, the
president returned to his roots:

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:51.437
his hometown of Chicago,
to speak to an assembly of

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:54.941
students, staff and faculty at
Northwestern's Kellogg School

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:58.411
of Management, focusing on what
has always fueled America's

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:01.548
leadership, and that's
America's economic greatness.

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.783
He took a step back from the
rush of current events to

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:05.785
explain what we have done
to recover from the great

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:09.122
recession, and what we need to
do to ensure that more middle

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.624
class families feel that
progress in their own lives.

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:15.261
The President: So here's the
bottom line: for all the work

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:18.932
that remains, for all the
citizens that we still need

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:22.535
to reach, what I want people
to know is that there

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:25.538
are some really good things
happening in America.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:29.309
That's because this new
foundation is now in place.

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:31.811
New investments in energy and
technology is to create new jobs

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:34.380
and new industries; new
investments and education that

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.951
will make our workforce more
skilled and competitive;

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:40.486
new reforms to health care that
cut costs for families

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:44.290
and businesses; new reforms
to our federal budget that

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.861
will promote smart investments
and a stronger economy for

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:52.465
future generation; new rules
for our financial system

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:55.435
to protect consumers and
prevent the kinds of crises

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:57.437
that we endured from
happening again.

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:58.805
Narrator: Well, folks,
you've gone and done it.

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.239
You've spent a few
minute with us online.

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.574
We love it, keep doing it.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:03.276
Stay engaged with us, and
thanks again for checking

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:06.079
out this edition of
your West Wing Week.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.383
The President: In one black tie,
I would have worn my tan suit.

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.919
(applause)

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.487
The President: I thought
it would look good.

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:15.488
(laughter)
