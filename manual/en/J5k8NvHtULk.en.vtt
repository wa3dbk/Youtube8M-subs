00:00:00.526 --> 00:00:04.519
- Dark cherries, berries,
even a bit of oak

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:07.436
and some nice smokey notes to boot.

00:00:09.685 --> 00:00:11.878
You know how daddy likes his smoke.

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:13.296
(laughs)

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:16.310
- Oh, just a whisper of banana peel.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.069
- Is there any evidence that
humans can actually taste

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:23.236
the adjectives that they
are throwing around here?

00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:31.325
- [Woman] The 1997 Merlot might
be called liquified Viagra.

00:00:31.325 --> 00:00:35.887
An incredibly sexy nose of
smoke, black fruits, cappuccino,

00:00:35.887 --> 00:00:38.776
and toasty wood is
followed by an expansive,

00:00:38.776 --> 00:00:42.325
terrifically concentrated
wine with a sumptuous texture,

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:45.634
no hard edges, beautifully
integrated acidity

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:49.051
and tannin, and a long, 35 second finish.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.896
- [Man] Is that a description from

00:00:50.896 --> 00:00:52.965
a bodice ripping romance novel?

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:55.779
No, those are the tasting
notes of a 1997 Merlot

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:59.339
from the book Parker's Wine
Buyers Guide by Robert M Parker.

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.708
- [Woman] Swirl and sniff my
friends because wine tasting

00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:05.179
is big business with what
seems like a bottomless bowl

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:07.474
of word salad to go along with it.

00:01:07.474 --> 00:01:10.395
But is there anything to
this palate sensitivity?

00:01:10.395 --> 00:01:13.575
Can we humans really suss
out the particulars of wine

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:16.054
with all the different grape varietals?

00:01:16.054 --> 00:01:19.259
- [Man] Well, in a 2001 study,
researcher Frederic Brochet

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.337
asked 54 wine experts
to give their opinions

00:01:22.337 --> 00:01:24.164
on two different glasses of wine,

00:01:24.164 --> 00:01:25.864
one red, and one white.

00:01:25.864 --> 00:01:28.830
Now here's the rub, both
glasses contained white wine,

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.061
but one had been dyed
with red food coloring

00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:33.929
to appear as though it might
be a Merlot or a Cabernet.

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.350
- [Woman] According to Robert
Gonzalez writing for io9,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.158
"The experts describe
the red wine in language

00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:41.573
typically reserved for
characterizing reds."

00:01:41.573 --> 00:01:44.335
They called it jammy for
example and noted the flavors

00:01:44.335 --> 00:01:47.051
imparted by its crushed red fruit.

00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:49.418
Not one of the 54 experts surveyed noticed

00:01:49.418 --> 00:01:51.797
that it was, in fact, a white wine.

00:01:51.797 --> 00:01:53.520
- [Man] So if we can't
even tell if it's a red

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.096
or white wine we're drinking,
what about all those other

00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:58.824
descriptors like vegetal,
jammy, or even barnyard?

00:01:58.824 --> 00:02:00.446
- [Woman] The Wall
Street Journal's article,

00:02:00.446 --> 00:02:03.246
A Hint of Hype, A Taste of
Illusion by Leonard Mlodinow,

00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:04.816
cites a 1996 study in

00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:06.960
The Journal of Experimental Psychology.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.000
It turns out that even
flavor trained professionals

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.014
can't reliably identify more than

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:13.036
three or four components in the mixture,

00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:16.640
although wine critics regularly
report tasting six or more.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.315
- [Man] In fact, the adjectives
we use subconsciously change

00:02:19.315 --> 00:02:22.114
depending on how expensive
we perceive the wine to be.

00:02:22.114 --> 00:02:25.182
In a follow up to Frederic
Brochet's 2001 study

00:02:25.182 --> 00:02:26.587
testing whether experts could tell

00:02:26.587 --> 00:02:28.259
the difference between red and white wine,

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.357
Brochet presented two bottles
of Berdot to wine experts.

00:02:31.357 --> 00:02:32.967
Both were the same modest brand,

00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:34.821
but they had different labels.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:35.890
- [Woman] Guess what?

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.827
The fancy label earned
heroic descriptors like

00:02:37.827 --> 00:02:40.925
agreeable, woody, complex,
balanced, and rounded,

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:44.350
while the cheap looking label
earned crappy adjectives like

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.275
weak, short, light, flat, and faulty.

00:02:47.275 --> 00:02:48.188
- [Man] What does this tell us?

00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:50.288
Well wine tasting may be the ultimate act

00:02:50.288 --> 00:02:52.493
of creating your own reality.

00:02:52.493 --> 00:02:54.696
- [Woman] Of course, if all
this pretense means that

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:56.897
we might one day have a chance to

00:02:56.897 --> 00:02:59.062
sit down with William Shatner
and compare tasting notes,

00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:01.350
well, then let us unleash all the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.465
florid language we can muster.

00:03:03.465 --> 00:03:06.029
We'd say that the overall
character is that of

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:10.683
a sex loaded scarlet endowed
jaunty and erotically scented

00:03:10.683 --> 00:03:13.163
with every part smelling and tasting

00:03:13.163 --> 00:03:16.226
provocative, flamboyant, and blooming.

00:03:16.226 --> 00:03:18.396
- [Man] And if you really
want to be super pretentious

00:03:18.396 --> 00:03:21.687
about it, ask what kind of
soil the grapes were grown in.

00:03:21.687 --> 00:03:23.570
Smack your lips and then declare that

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.026
you can detect the terroir on your palate.

00:03:26.026 --> 00:03:28.251
- So what's your favorite
obnoxious wine descriptor?

00:03:28.251 --> 00:03:30.897
Me, I've got to go with
either nude or barnyard.

00:03:30.897 --> 00:03:32.647
- For me it's musty.

00:03:32.647 --> 00:03:34.145
