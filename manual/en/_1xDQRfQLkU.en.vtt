00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.600
This did not go well.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.410
I did make glass.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.849
all this stuff is stuck in their because
I didn't have any way to get it out.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.099
I just wasn't very prepared.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.880
I didn't have my tongs to grab the little
crucible to pick it up and pour it out.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.250
So, I'm just going to get my cutting torch
now, and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.480
hit that glass until it melts again
and see whether or not there

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.259
is any gold in there or not
whooo weeeee

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.700
oh yeah, that is way more intense.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.050
Now that is the kind of intensity that will
melt gold

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:59.440
ok, so I cheated and use a cutting torch
I'm hoping the camera will show that bead

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.760
of gold down in there
I can't get to it, the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.460
glass that formed was so thick that it wouldn't
pour out of the crucible.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.359
and uh...
you see there is a little bit of gold right

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:13.319
there on the lip
it is a real thin coat of gold

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.689
that formed there
just where a little bit of the water spilled

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.079
there is a little bit of gold all around the
edges of the crucible too,

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.420
but the main bead...
actually it looks like I have two tiny beads

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.070
down in there.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.619
so um
but, the main bit of the gold is down in there

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:39.029
this glass is so
all the way in the bottom of that hole

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:41.140
i actually used the cutting torch to from
that hole,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.810
the glass was kind of like plastic with the
cutting torch.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.149
It never would completely liquify, but I could
move it around

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.090
with the torch.
and punched a hole in it kind of...

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.369
and uh... i think the solution
to that problem is to add more borax to the

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.189
glass to get the
glass to melt and liquefy better.
