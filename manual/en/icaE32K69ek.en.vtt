00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:04.610
So you know a lot of the time I get dressed
in the mornings and i feel like I have nothing

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:13.280
to wear - which is not true, because I actually
have a LOT of clothes!

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.960
The problem is...I'm a bit of a hoarder, so
I haven't thrown out some of the stuff that

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.669
I SHOULD have thrown out, like for example
*lame attempt at drumroll* the mullet dress!

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:32.219
So, the mullet dress was very 'in' in 2012,
in 2013 some people wore it, in 2014...I think

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.410
it's done.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.530
So this was something else that I loved...you
know, the peplum shape.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.350
So I had peplum tops, peplums dresses...and
I liked it because I think it makes you look

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.269
very feminine, but I think we are done with
this for 2013.

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.450
See, I even have it in leather.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.469
So in 2013 it was okay, in 2014....

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.449
As you clear out more and more stuff, then
you start to wonder - what exactly do I wear?

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.589
See, that's the fun part!

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.399
You get to go shopping to buy new stuff to
fill your wardrobe.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.770
And so today, I'm going to talk about stuff
that you should be buying for 2014, that kind

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.080
of colours, the kind of cuts that will make
you very current for the year ahead!

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.160
So Radiant Orchid is the colour of the season;
now this is kind of a blend of fuchsia pink

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.460
and purple and a certain trend expert says
that it intrigues the mind and sparks the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.460
imagination.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.460
Well, whatever THAT means!

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.190
It is very pretty and it is also appropriate
for Valentine's Day.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.440
So when picking your outfits for this year,
you might want to go with this pink-purple

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.040
kind of hue.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.180
So pointed flats have some and gone, and they
were most memorable in the 50s and 60s as

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.710
popularised by Audrey Hepburn.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.610
So for this seasons, they come in all manner
of designs - there are edgy ones, there are

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.510
very feminine ones and there are some that
are downright luxurious.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:59.150
But the one thing that is in common is that
your feet will be thanking you because FINALLY

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.940
flats are in and heels are out.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.350
If you are colour-shy, you might want to go
with basic black because this is easy and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.080
understated but still very chic, and it was
seen on the runways at Honor; there were iridescent

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.360
sparkles and double barrettes; and at Dolce
and Gabbana there was a more lace-inspired

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.220
style to keep things relevant but still super
pretty.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.310
So for this season, anything goes!

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.910
You can go with a more exciting floral print;
you can even go with a more nude-coloured,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.300
minimalist design.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.480
So when buying your shoes for this season,
just keep in mind your overall style, what

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.280
you wear on a day to day basis.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.530
and try to find a pair of shoes that best
fits in with that!

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.890
