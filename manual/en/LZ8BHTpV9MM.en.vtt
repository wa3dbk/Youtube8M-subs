Hi! This is Dave Smith with Hillcrest Ski
and Sports in Gresham, Oregon on behalf of

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.670
Expert Village. In this tutorial we will cover
beginning skiing. In this clip we're going

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.179
to cover how to get around on your skis when
you're not going downhill. At ski areas there

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.340
are many areas at the bottom of the hill or
the top of the hill where you won't be going

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.880
downhill, but you'll have to get around on
your skis such as in the lift line. There

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.429
are three techniques I'm going to show you
right here, skating, traversing across a hill

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:37.309
and ascending a small hill. First, I'm going
to show you two techniques for skating across

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.690
flat areas while on your skis. The first skating
technique my skis will be moving straight

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.610
forward and straight back as if they were
in parallel tracks. I'll use my poles to help

00:00:47.610 --> 00:01:01.410
me gain forward momentum. The second skating
technique is a little more advanced. It involves

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.630
sending my skis out to the side one at a time
much the way an ice skater would move and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.400
keeping, using my poles to gain forward momentum.
To traverse across a slope, you want to have

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:21.320
your skis perpendicular to the slope facing
across this hill not down the hill. Keep your

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:36.040
weight on your uphill leg and then skate across
the slope using your poles to help you along.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.790
There are two methods to ascend a small hill.
In the first you'll be in the same position

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.159
as when you're traversing a hill with your
skis perpendicular to the slope. First, you'll

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.439
move the uphill leg uphill and follow it with
the downhill leg. You'll continue doing this

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.920
until you've reached the top of the slope.
The second method involves using a wedge shape.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:06.659
You'll be facing uphill with your tails together
and your tips spread apart. Once facing uphill,

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.869
basically you'll waddle like a duck until
you've reached the top of the slope. These

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.430
two methods can be very useful when you're
just beginning. Instead of getting on a chairlift

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.220
you may just ascend a small slope so that
you can come back down at a slower rate of

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.620
speed.
