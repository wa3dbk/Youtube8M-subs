You don't have to go to a ballpark in order to enjoy some garlic fries

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.160
It's the middle of baseball season and I thought it would be really fun to make this

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.380
baseball game favorite. I recently went to a game and posted a picture of the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.120
garlic fries on my instagram.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.180
Many of you thought i should do a video! so here it is!

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.260
just be sure to have some breath mints handy because this dish is really garlicy.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.310
Let's get started. You're going to need

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.380
2-3 medium-sized Russet potatoes

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.370
6 garlic cloves, 2 tablespoons of
parsley

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.399
5 tablespoons vegetable oil divided

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.260
some kosher salt, pepper, and then an
additional tablespoon

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.840
of kosher salt. First preheat your oven to 450
degrees

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.950
next clean and scrub your potatoes well

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.160
then, cut the potatoes into medium-size
matchsticks and place in a large bowl

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.640
if you like them cut into wedges you can
definitely cut them larger

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.890
add 3 tablespoons of the vegetable
oil, some kosher salt

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.500
and pepper into the bowl, and then toss until each potato stick is coated

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.049
next, line a baking sheet with foil

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.110
I like using some foil when I'm roasting things in the oven because it makes cleanup a breeze

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.220
all you have to do is wrap it up and toss it!

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.310
Place a cooling rack on top of the baking sheet and line up the potato sticks

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.040
on top

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.590
Make sure not to crowd the sticks - stagger them so that there is enough room for them to brown.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.040
If you crowd them, they're going to steam and they're not going to have that crispy texture

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.950
you're looking for

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.579
Bake them for 25 minutes until they're golden brown. If you cut them into thicker wedges,

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.710
make sure you bake them a little bit longer

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.979
while your fries are baking, finely minced
garlic

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.390
and parsley and add them to a large bowl

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.990
then add the remaining 2 tablespoons of
oil and mix well

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.220
once your fries are ready

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.630
quickly tossed them into the bowl with your garlic mixture

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.790
then immediately sprinkle the one tablespoon of kosher salt

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.180
and toss it evenly to coat

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.340
put the fries back onto the baking sheet and
let them crisp up again in oven for

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.319
another five minutes

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.140
take it out of the oven and enjoy

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.830
sometimes I like to sprinkle on some
parmesan cheese just to give it some

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.800
extra flavor

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.360
