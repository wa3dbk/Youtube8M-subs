00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:21.099
There is a store on London Road
Where all unwanted treasure goes

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:28.099
For vintage clothes the'll give you old for
new

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.210
Come rain or shine they'll venture out,
To rifle through the lost and found

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.620
Guaranteed to find a gem or two

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And every monday morning there's an old man
at the door

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.400
He always seems to find exactly what he's
looking for

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.879
He blows the dust from off the surface traces
each and every line

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:12.339
And with scarred and weathered fingers
Holds it up towards the light

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.850
He knows exactly what he has to do to bring
it back to life

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.540
Nothing's worthless for the one who sees the
gold

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.900
New for Old

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.250
He takes it home and once again
His skilled and loving hands begin

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:59.550
To strip away the varnish and the glue
He sands it down and though it's late

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:09.360
He gives it one more coat of paint
Till every crack is gone, it's good as new

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.030
And every Monday morning you will find him
at the store

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.860
Cos someone's thrown away something he knows
he can restore

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.140
He blows the dust from off the surface traces
each and every line

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.180
And with scarred and weathered fingers
Holds it up towards the light

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.390
He knows exactly what he has to do to bring
it back to life

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.380
Nothing's worthless for the one who sees the
gold

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:08.380
There is nothing that's beyond repair
There is no one too far gone

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:19.480
Can't your eyes see, what can be done
With a little love

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.980
Just blow the dust from off the surface of
a tired and weary life,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.880
There's a diamond to discover when you hold
it to the light

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:49.060
Cos everyone is someone's treasure when they're
loved and that is why

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.240
Nothing's worthless for the one that sees
that gold

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.160
New for Old.
