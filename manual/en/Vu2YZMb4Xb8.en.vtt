00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.033
- Last week, a picture of
a dress was posted on Tumblr.

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:04.866
Millions of people from all over
the world saw it,

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:05.933
and now it's being called

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.500
"The Dress That Broke
the Internet."

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500
Take a look.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.300
- It's the question that divided
the Internet,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.033
indeed,
divided this great nation.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:14.700
Now, time for the great debate:

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.900
What color is this dress?

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.633
- It's clearly gold and white.

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:20.633
- Black and blue.
- It's totally white and gold.

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:22.300
- There's nothing white or gold
about it.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.866
- It's blue and black.
- I'm going blue and black.

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.933
- This dress is white and gold!

00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.833
It did start off
as one woman's Tumblr post

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:30.600
asking that simple question.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.500
- Scottish singer
Caitlin McNeill posted:

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.866
"Guys, please help me--

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.100
is this dress white and gold
or blue and black?”

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.366
And with that, the Twitter
hashtag "\#TheDress" was born.

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.066
- It is breaking
social media records.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.566
- At its peak,
the hashtag "\#TheDress"

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:48.500
was tweeted out more than 11,000
times per minute Thursday night.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.166
It reached a total
of 11 million tweets.

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.433
- Even celebrities are also
taking to Twitter

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:55.633
to voice their optical opinions.

00:00:55.633 --> 00:01:00.566
- And even now, it is still
a top trending topic.

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.966
- From Colonsay, Scotland,

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.466
please welcome Grace,
her husband Keir,

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.700
and their friend Caitlin.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.500
So this is--
this is unbelievable.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.400
I mean, you can't possibly have
fathomed that this would happen.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.200
Your mother sends you a dress
to wear at your wedding, right?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.100
- Yeah, so she sent me
three photos

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.500
of three different dresses,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
and I said, "So which one is it?
Which one do you like the best?"

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.533
And she said, "The third one."

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.433
I said,
"Oh, the white and gold one."

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:25.533
- Mm-hmm.
- And she said,

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.366
"Um, no,
the blue and black one."

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.633
And I was like, "No, Mum,
that's white and gold,

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:30.633
"and if you think
it's blue and black,

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:31.933
you need to go to the doctor's."

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.733
[laughter]
- Right.

00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:35.800
- And, yeah, so we had
a bit of a row,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.500
back and forward like that,
and on it went.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.700
- So you showed that picture
to Keir, right? Is that--

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.233
- Yeah, and he saw--
- And you saw--

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:44.333
- Well, I'm a founding member of
Team Blue and Black, I'm afraid.

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:45.566
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:47.633
- So then that must've
confused you even more.

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:48.633
- Yeah.
- So then

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:49.700
who did you show it to?

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.333
- Well, being such
a small island...

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:52.433
- Uh-huh.
[laughter]

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:53.700
- My mum and dad live next door.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.533
We have an adjoining door.
- Uh-huh.

00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:58.666
- So I knocked on the door,
and through comes my dad,

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:00.200
and I said,
"What color is this dress, Dad?"

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.800
And he says, "Well, son,
that's white and gold."

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.200
And so I thought, "Hmm, these
guys are playing a trick on me."

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.200
- Wow, okay, so then how do you
come into this, Caitlin?

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.800
Then you posted it, right?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.500
- Yeah, I posted it on Tumblr,
and, um...

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.733
I mean, we had been arguing
about this for weeks.

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:18.166
Like, it had been tearing
the community apart.

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.600
[laughter]

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.600
We were losing our minds,
and then I posted it on Tumblr.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.966
I had a couple thousand
followers.

00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:24.766
I thought, like, maybe
I'd get some answers, you know?

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:27.766
Sometimes Tumblr's good for
that kind of science-y stuff.

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:29.733
And, eh...
[laughter]

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.766
- Yeah, I always go to Tumblr
when I have a science question.

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:33.433
- That's what I do too.
I go for science.

00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:34.733
[laughter]

00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:36.733
- And then, yeah, I posted it
on Tumblr, and then,

00:02:36.733 --> 00:02:39.433
within not half an hour,
it was on Twitter,

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:40.966
and then somebody just texted me
and said,

00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:43.400
"Can you just search
'TheDress' on Twitter?"

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.300
And I was like, "Eh, sure,"
and then,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.666
hundreds and hundreds
of pictures of this dress

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.766
on--in people's tweets.

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:52.500
- So let's see the dress
and your mom--Cecile--Cecilia?

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.433
- Yeah, that's right.
- Come on out, Cecilia.

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:58.100
[cheers and applause]

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.266
All right.

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:00.433
To me...

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:04.200
that's white and gold.
[laughter]

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.066
Okay, so--hi, first of all.
- Hi.

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:07.166
Nice to meet you.

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:10.000
And so, when you say
"blue and black,"

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.533
and then your daughter's saying
"No, it's white and gold--"

00:03:12.533 --> 00:03:14.133
- And I'd even showed it
to my partner

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:16.133
who actually bought the dress,
and he took the photo--

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:17.500
I took the photograph,
I showed him,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.100
and he'd seen gold and white.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.933
- But then when you look at
the photograph, do you--

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:22.466
I mean, you obviously know
it's blue and black,

00:03:22.466 --> 00:03:23.466
but when you saw
the photograph--

00:03:23.466 --> 00:03:24.866
- No, blue and black.
- Still?

00:03:24.866 --> 00:03:26.233
- I've never seen
gold and white.

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:27.766
I don't get the gold and white.

00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:29.000
- I don't get
the blue and black.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.333
- Really?
- No.

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:32.366
I mean, I see it now.
I know that you're right,

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:34.633
but that to me
is so white and gold.

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:36.300
All day long,
that's white and gold.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.300
- Totally.
- No!

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.400
- No.
- Yes!

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.400
- Yep.
- I thought--

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.900
[talking over each other]
- Yes!

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.400
- I mean, it's Grace's wedding
and I wanted to get--

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.566
I wanted to do her proud,
and I thought--

00:03:45.566 --> 00:03:46.800
I'm quite busty,
so I thought

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.400
"This'll pinch me in
at the waist.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.833
It'll give me a figure."

00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:51.900
And so--and I just wanted
to get it right, and then

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.400
I was worried that there was
something wrong with my brain.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.833
[laughter]

00:03:55.833 --> 00:03:58.766
- Everybody else is gonna see--
- It's quite possible.

00:03:58.766 --> 00:04:01.433
- I wanted you to have
some souvenirs, so to go home--

00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:03.866
You know, our Ellen underwear
is the most popular--

00:04:03.866 --> 00:04:05.933
Ellen underwear--we have--

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:06.933
So, just to--

00:04:06.933 --> 00:04:10.266
- Aw!
[cheers and applause]

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:13.166
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:15.866
[all talking over each other]

00:04:15.866 --> 00:04:16.866
- Thank you.

00:04:16.866 --> 00:04:18.066
- Everybody's right.

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:19.966
[cheers and applause]

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:21.500
You left your honeymoon early,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.300
and we appreciate that
so very much,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.633
'cause I know everybody in
the world wanted to talk to you.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:29.200
So we're going to send you
to the all-inclusive

[cheers and applause]

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:40.933
One more thing.

00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:42.200
