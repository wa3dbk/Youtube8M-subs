Hello there! I'm Thomas the Tank Engine. This
video might look a little strange, or you might

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.310
not be able to see me. That's because this
is a special video, in this video it's like

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.810
you're right here on the Island of Sodor!
But in order to

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.279
view it correctly you need to be watching
it in either the lastest version of Google

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:28.619
Chrome on a computer or the latest version
of the YouTube app on a mobile device. Then

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.949
if you're on a computer, use the widget in
the top left hand

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.790
corner of the video to move the camera around.
If you're on a mobile device, simply move that

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.870
around in order to move the camera. You can
also check the video description for more

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.530
information.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.270
Alright then, I've got to go now, but some
of my friends will be coming along.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.020
Can you count how many coaches or trucks they're
pulling?

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.660
Post your answers in the comments section.
(Whistles) I'll see you again soon!

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.520
(Whistles) Express coming through!

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.000
(Whistles) Hello there! Welcome to the Island
of Sodor.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.680
(Whistles) Hello again! I hope you're having
fun!

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.920
A goods train. A goods train. The shame of
it. Oh the shame of it.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.320
