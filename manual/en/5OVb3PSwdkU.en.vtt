00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:18.439
this Martin Kippenberger exhibition "Very Good Sehr Gut"

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:19.250
is the first exhibition

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.760
in a major institution -- we are the National Gallery

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.310
here in Berlin

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.539
uh... since ever

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.529
he had some smaller exhibitions, let's say in Potsdam and there was

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.289
in the early eighties as well a
very very small institution

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.619
Neue Gesellschaft f端r Bildende Kunst NGBK, but not more.

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:42.040
And because the situation in berlin

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.390
was in the eighties that there are not
so many uh... art dealers here in Berlin

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.200
while now we are

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.200
you know, the hotspot of the art scene.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.820
We start in our exhibition uh... with
his time here in berlin. he lived in Berlin

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.259
from nineteen hundred seventy nine to
nineteen hundred eighty one

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.729
these were the only two years, or two and
a half years before he was in florence

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.070
but he came from florence to berlin

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.030
to become

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.150
uh...

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.320
a painter

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.470
but when he was here he decided: I am an artist, not only a painter because

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.310
we had always these big

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.180
painters and a painters tradition here
in berlin uh... like the uh... Junge Wilde,

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.150
like Fetting, Salome and all this

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.850
and he was not interested in this kind
of art

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.990
so he decided not to become a painter
but to be an artist and what has an

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.350
artist to do, an artist has to offer

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.500
what he can do

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.180
so he offered

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.400
"Dienstleistungen", so he offered all the work

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.490
what you as well have nowadays from artists
you know nowadays artists make their own

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.459
exhibitions, they create their own um...
invitation card

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.359
they have the whole portfolio you know for

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.000
the things weren't done for the arts scene

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.680
and he was offerings this in nineteen
seventy nine this was very very early so

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.489
he opened an office

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.780
the Kippenberger office, the Kippenberger B端ro, which is very very famous

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.790
and this was at that time extremely
unusual

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.790
and a new way very avant-garde, because
nowadays artists are doing this.

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:37.659
You know if you ask about the Kippenberger B端ro:

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.819
and in this office

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.939
he was doing everything he was
managing the SO 36,

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.239
know this was his punk club

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.849
every evening he was over there, they
invited a lot of artists and a lot of

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.199
musicians

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:57.279
uh... so he organized this from the
B端ro, from his office

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:58.870
here uh...

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.870
was producing his stickers

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.510
his uh... newspapers, you know he had a secretary in his office

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.629
this was Gisela Capitain

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.580
you know, and

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.670
he had to a lot of assistants and the
main point you know what is now and what

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.929
we as well tell here, the major point

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:24.669
he decided not to paint his paintings himself

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.110
he said okay i want to have a cinema
painter

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.620
they know how to paint

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.910
and i give them some motives

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.210
and he should paint the painting for me. The Kippenberger paintings are

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.799
not made by himself

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.159
by his hands, you know

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.559
he was delegating this

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:50.559
to another painter.

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:08.849
This series of paintings was not often shown,
because it's extremely difficult

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.480
and expensive to install them

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.949
because you have to

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:17.719
to build up walls before the walls
of the museum

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:21.379
and it's uh... and it's an unusual series

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:26.840
you know this is uh... not what
people uh... are expecting of Kippenberger

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.650
you know Martin Kippenberger was
well known

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.169
for all his very loud um...
you know

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.770
for his shouting around and as well for

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.969
the big, big, uh... paintings

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:43.340
and he was not

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.090
well known, or many people don't know that
he as well has another side

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.870
that he as well was very much reflecting

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.310
on the way how you present

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.459
paintings

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:59.449
what you have to do, you know, in an
exhibition you have to uh... think about

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.800
it you know how can i present it, what i
want to present

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.979
and this was the way he was thinking

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.460
and as well with these um...

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.169
very good paintings his white paintings, "Weisse Bilder"

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.739
he was reflecting

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:15.800
on all the theories

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.590
which are running through all
the uh... twentieth century what does

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.460
it mean to

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.910
to work with painting of white or a
painting of black

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.430
if you look, you know, in the twenties,
thirties especially uh... in the fifties

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.199
many many art is well reflecting on
the color

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.710
and often the color of nothing.
