Goldilocks and The Three Bears

00:00:08.031 --> 00:00:25.031
Once upon a time there was a little girl called Goldilocks. She was called Goldilocks because of her curly golden hair. 
She was a happy but sometimes naughty little girl. One sunny morning she went for a walk in the woods 
to pick some flowers for her mother.

00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:39.031
As she was walking she saw a charming little cottage with pretty flowers outside. 
She could smell something delicious coming from the cottage and went to take a closer look.

00:00:40.031 --> 00:01:00.031
As Goldilocks got closer she noticed the front door was slightly open. 
She walked up the garden path and knocked on the door, but no one came. 
So she called out "Is anyone home?", but still there was no answer.

00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:23.031
Goldilocks was so curious that she opened the door and crept into the cottage. 
She saw three bowls of porridge on the breakfast table. 
There was a BIG Bowl, a MIDDLE sized bowl and a SMALL bowl.
[How many bowls do you see?]

00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:29.031
Goldilocks was feeling hungry so she tried the porridge from the BIG bowl. 

00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:34.031
…but it was too HOT!

00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:39.031
Then she tried the porridge in the MIDDLE sized bowl.

00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:43.031
…but it was too COLD!

00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:49.031
Finally, Goldilocks ate some porridge from the SMALL bowl and…

00:01:50.031 --> 00:02:00.031
...it was JUST RIGHT!
"mmmm, yummy!", she said, "what delicious porridge!", and she gobbled it all up.

00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:22.031
Goldilocks felt quite full and looked for somewhere to sit down. 
She wandered into the next room where she saw three chairs. 
There was a BIG chair, a MIDDLE sized chair and a SMALL chair.
[How many chairs do you see?]

00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:29.031
First, Goldilocks sat on the BIG chair, but it was too HIGH, 

00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:36.031
Then she tried the MIDDLE sized chair, 
...but it was too LOW.

00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:49.031
Then Goldilocks sat down on the SMALL chair and it was JUST RIGHT! 
She was really enjoying herself, playing with a toy shaker, when suddenly...

00:02:51.031 --> 00:03:04.031
CRACK! …the chair broke! Goldilocks fell on the floor with a crash and a bump, 
and hurt her bottom. "OUCH, that hurt!" she cried.

00:03:06.031 --> 00:03:19.031
All this commotion made Goldilocks feel quite tired and so she felt like lying down. 
She noticed some steps leading upstairs and decided she would go up.
[Shall we go and see what's upstairs?]

00:03:20.031 --> 00:03:35.031
When Goldilocks went upstairs she saw some beds. 
There was a BIG bed, a MIDDLE sized bed and a SMALL bed. 
[How many beds do you see?]

00:03:38.031 --> 00:03:44.031
Goldilocks jumped onto the BIG bed first but it was much too HARD.

00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:52.031
Then Goldilocks tried the MIDDLE sized bed but it was far too SOFT.

00:03:54.031 --> 00:04:00.031
Then Goldilocks sat down on the SMALL bed and 
it felt JUST RIGHT!

00:04:02.031 --> 00:04:08.031
It was so cosy and comfortable that Goldilocks lay down and fell fast asleep.

00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:26.031
While Goldilocks was asleep in the SMALL bed, the owners of the cottage returned -  
the three bears! There was Father bear, Mother bear and Baby bear. 
They'd gone out for a walk while their porridge cooled down.

00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:44.531
When they got back to the cottage they noticed the breakfast table was very messy 
and someone had been eating their porridge. 
"Who's been eating my porridge" roared Father bear.  
"And who's been eating my porridge" cried Mother bear.

00:04:45.531 --> 00:04:54.531
"And who's been eating my porridge?" said baby bear in a sad voice 
"…and they've eaten it all up!"

00:04:57.031 --> 00:05:11.531
They went into the next room and found that someone had been in sitting on their chairs. 
"Who's been sitting on my chair? " growled Father bear. 
"And who's been sitting on my chair and made it all messy?" cried Mother bear.

00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:20.031
"And who's been sitting on my chair and look… they've broken it" squeaked Baby bear.

00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:28.031
Then the three bears went upstairs...
[Shall we see what they found?]

00:05:29.031 --> 00:05:44.031
The beds were a big mess. 
Father bear looked at his bed and said "Who's been sleeping in my bed?" 

00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:52.031
"...and who's been sleeping in my bed! She's still there, come and look!" cried baby bear.

00:05:54.031 --> 00:06:04.031
So the three bears looked, and were astonished to see Goldilocks fast asleep in Baby bear's bed.
They were not at all impressed.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:22.031
And as they looked, just at that very moment, Goldilocks woke up and rubbed her eyes. 
She saw the three bears staring down at her and she got a terrible fright. 
She leapt out of the bed, ran straight down stairs and out of the cottage.

00:06:24.031 --> 00:06:44.031
Off Goldilocks ran, as fast she could, out of the forest and straight home. After that she never went near the three Bears' cottage again. 
And do you know that that was the last time she ever helped herself to anything without asking first...

00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:51.031
The End

00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:59.031
