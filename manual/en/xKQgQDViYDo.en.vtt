THAT'S ABOUT A 10-FOOT DROP.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.800
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO SPEAK ON

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.170

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.660
IT WAS A VIOLENT PUSH.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.660
IF THERE WASN'T PEOPLE TO

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.890

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.200
GRASS WOULD BREAK THEIR FALL.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.570
MY TAKE IS IT IS A PARTY

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.740
THAT GOT OUT OF HAND.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.700

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.140
TROUBLE BEFORE.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.510
SHE WAS GOING TO JUMP

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.210
ANYWAY.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.010
IF SHE JUMPED SHE WOULD HAVE

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.180
HIT THE GROUND AND SO HE

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.810

PARTY WAS NOTHING OUT OF THE

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.120
ORDINARY.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.720
AT FIRST I AM YELLING AT

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.260
HER DON'T BE STUPID.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
AND THEN THE NEXT THING I SEE

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.860
IS THE KID GO UP THERE AND

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.090
SOMEHOW THEY GO TO THE EDGE

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.660

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.110
WAS UNACCEPTABLE AND THEY ARE

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.310
INVESTIGATING WHETHER

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.670
DISCIPLINARY ACTION IS

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.140
NECESSARY.
