Hi guys! Welcome back to Toy-U Channel!

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.460
Today we have this amazing figurine playset

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.149
from the Marvel Avengers new movie.

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:17.149
Let’s see it closer.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.580
This pack is from Disney, and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.940
includes the main characters and villains from the movie.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.360
Let’s spin around the box to see well.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.740
Here’s a cool picture of all the superheroes,

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.030
On the back, there are some warnings
in different languages,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.400
and here it says that this set is not allowed for children under 3.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.500
Okay, let’s open this amazing playset!

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.720
You may need to use some cutter or scissors and a lot of patience.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.720
If you can’t do it by yourself, you can ask an adult

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.140
for some help.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.640
First, we need to remove these tabs, like
this.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.540
As you can see I’m using my fingers but

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.680
I have cut already all the cellophane
with the scissors.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.680
And now, we are gonna take off the plastic with the cutter,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.040
so be careful guys, and if you need help, you know, just ask an adult.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.460
Be patience guys, it takes a little.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.540
You need to cut from the bottom

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.180
all the box in order to break the plastic.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.540
I’m doing it from right to left.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.780
Once you have made a hole, you can open it with your fingers.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.460
Just like this.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.010
We do some strength… and it’s out!

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.600
Ups… Okay!

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
Finally! Here they are!

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.000
The set includes Iron Man, MS. Marvel,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.560
Hulk, Captain America, Ultron and Vision.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.760
Now we're gonna try to liberate the figurines,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.920
because they are very well fixed to the plastic with wires.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.000
Let’s accelerate the video meantime.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.920
Remember guys that these figures are made of plastic,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.840
so it’s difficult to break them.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.480
Fine!

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.549
Now we can see better all the figures.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.120
First, we’ll draw out Iron Man.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.700
As you know, Tony Stark is a billionaire who fights villains when

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.240
he wears the Iron Man armor.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.700
This figurine is pretty cool,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.700
with many details like the real one.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.440
It has shoulder pads, and details in red and gold.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.340
It also has the ark reactor,

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.020
and the light circle in the hands.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.080
Nice.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.220
Here we have Captain America,

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.920
with his amazing blue, red and white costume.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.200
He is also full of details.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
This is his famous shield.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.600
He always wears it.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.860
It is so cool, right?

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.310
And with this black platform he can stand up.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.540
Let me free the rest of superheroes to make it easier.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.840
They are well stuck, so that’s
why it costs so much to take them out.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.380
Remember this set of figurines is not allowed for kids under 3.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.180
Okay, just one more.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.700
Perfect!

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:56.769
They are all free!

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.280
Now, here we’ve got Ultron, the villain.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.880
He is the bad guy from the Avengers 2 movie.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.200
He is a super intelligent robot with self-consciousness.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.440
He is powerful, so that’s why he is a good enemy for the Avengers.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.820
He also has a prettycool armor, can you see?

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.200
You can see the details on his back, legs and arms.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.800
He is so shiny.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.830
Let’s put him here.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.240
And, this is Vision, with his green and yellow

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.330
costume and his red mask

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.510
See? He is all covered by the costume, so nobody knows how he is, actually.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.960
And… he also wears a yellow cape.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.480
It’s a nice superhero costume.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.420
I love how this is made, with a lot of lines and curves, full of details.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.480
Okay! She is MS. Marvel, a woman superhero.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.100
She can fly, that’s why this figurine seems be flying.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.460
She wears this blue costume, with
some details in red and gold. See?

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.220
She has short and blond hair.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.780
By the way, we’ll see her in her own Marvel movie on 2018,

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.300
did you know that? I can’t wait!

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.300
Okay, and finally here it is the Incredible
Hulk!

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.080
His real name is Doctor Bruce Banner,

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.890
and he becomes Hulk when is angry or sad.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.000
This is because he was affected by gamma radiation.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:54.729
Now he has an incredible strength and endurance. But also he is green… Look how big it is.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.869
Look at all this muscles. Very cool!

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.980
Now we know all of them, let’s play a little

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.240
with these amazing figurines.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.400
I’m gonna put all the superheroes together on one side

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.480
Hulk, Ms Marvel, Iron Man,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.360
Vision, and Captain America… Here.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.080
All them are facing Ultron because he is their enemy.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.120
Together they are gonna confront him

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.720
to defeat his power.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.440
You can create your own story too.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.860

battles with these figures!
