00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.809
&gt;&gt;IT WAS MY DAUGHTER MALLORY.
SHE ASKED US FOR A STOPWATCH FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.930
I NEVER SUSPECTED ANYTHING.
&gt;&gt;MY SON MATT STARTED HANGING OUT WITH A NEW CROWD.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.990
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOOD KIDS, BUT SOON HE

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.600
STARTED WEARING SHORT-SHORTS AND T-SHIRTS WITH BAD PUNS.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.300
&gt;&gt;WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?
RUNNING NOSE.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.589
&gt;&gt;I KNOW.
&gt;&gt;EVERY YEAR 13 MILLION KIDS TRY DISTANCE

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:29.869
RUNNING FOR THE FIRST TIME.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.160
UNAWARE THAT THEY'RE BEGINNING A LIFE OF CHAFFING

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.800
AND MALE THIGH EXPOSURE.
&gt;&gt;YOU DR. SCHOLL'S?

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.570
&gt;&gt;INDEED I AM.
YOU GUYS NEED SHOES?

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.760
&gt;&gt;YEAH.
&gt;&gt;OH, BAM.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.900
AND THESE RIGHT HERE.
TRY THOSE ON FOR SIZE.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.000
&gt;&gt;WHAT'S THIS GOING TO RUN US?
&gt;&gt;IT'S 25.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.670
&gt;&gt;GIVE IT TO HIM.
&gt;&gt;YEAH.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.360
&gt;&gt;OUR SON ADAM SAID IT WAS JUST A PARTY,
BUT WHEN WE WENT TO GO ON CHECK ON HIM--

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.579
NO!
IT WAS A 5K.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.270
NO!
I HAVE NO SON!

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.900
&gt;&gt;HONEY, STOP.
&gt;&gt;I HAVE NO SON!

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:14.500
DON'T YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT COMING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS! [CRYING]

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.300
&gt;&gt;ADAM!
&gt;&gt;YOU ARE LITERALLY BREAKING YOUR MOTHER'S HEART.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.200
&gt;&gt;SOON 5KS WEREN'T ENOUGH.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.579
HE STARTED GETTING INTO MARATHONS.
&gt;&gt;WHAT IS THIS?

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.030
OKAY!
&gt;&gt;IT JUST KEPT GETTING MEDAL, AFTER MEDAL,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.979
AFTER MEDAL-- &gt;&gt;AFTER MEDAL.
HIS NECK...

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.219
&gt;&gt;SO MUCH WEIGHT, IT JUST DRUG HIM DOWN.
&gt;&gt;EVERYDAY MORE AND MORE OF THESE HOODLUMS

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.350
ARE RUNNING THE STREETS.
BUT WHAT ARE THEY RUNNING FROM?

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.219
WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO HIDE?
WE GOT TO GET BACK TO TRADITIONAL VALUES LIKE

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.880
WALKING, SITTING DOWN--
&gt;&gt;I SHOULD HAVE SEEN

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.639
THE WARNING SIGNS.
YOU KNOW, HE WAS RUNNING IN PLACE A

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:59.340
LOT AND USED GEL INSERTS.
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE YOU FIND

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.569
THAT KIND OF THING.
&gt;&gt;SUSPECT IS BEING CHARGED WITH DISTANCE RUNNING,

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.779
RUNNER'S HIGH, FREAKISH SCRAWNINESS--
&gt;&gt;HEY!

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:08.030
&gt;&gt;YOU KEEP QUIET.
&gt;&gt;BUT AS THE RUNNING EPIDEMIC SPREADS,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.590
PARENTS AND TEACHERS ARE POWERLESS TO STOP IT.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.720
&gt;&gt;WE TOOK AWAY HER RUNNING SHOES 
HOPING SHE WOULD STOP

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.820
AND THEN WE HEAR ABOUT THIS THING
 CALLED BARE-FOOT RUNNING?

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.210
WAS THIS SOME SORT OF SICK JOKE?
I MEAN, WHERE DOES IT STOP?

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.390
&gt;&gt;PARENTS, TALK TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT DISTANCE RUNNING.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.300
HELP THEM FIND BETTER HOBBIES LIKE VIDEO GAMES.
&gt;&gt;COULD YOU STOP IT FOR MINUTE MATT?

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.400
&gt;&gt;NAPPING OR DIABETES.
&gt;&gt;IF YOU DON'T EAT YOUR DONUT YOU CAN'T

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.570
HAVE BROCCOLI.
&gt;&gt;NO, DAD.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.490
IT'S GOING TO SLOW ME DOWN.
&gt;&gt;I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:52.490
&gt;&gt;IN EXTREME CASES SEEK MEDICAL HELP.
&gt;&gt;YOUR SON HAS TESTED POSITIVE FOR SHIN SPLINTS.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.510
&gt;&gt;CHOP THE LEG.
&gt;&gt;IT'S-- &gt;&gt;CHOP THE LEG.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.460
&gt;&gt;DISTANCE RUNNING, IT'S A DANGEROUS
AND SLIPPERY SLOPE.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.460
SOMETIMES A HEALTHY LIFE IS WORSE THAN DEATH.
