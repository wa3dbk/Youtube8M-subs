Hi virtual reality friends, this is a new Paris Meetup video

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:17.509
about virtual reality

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:22.909
Here you can see Elena testing a 3D tablet named zSpace

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.679
with one of the sellers who explains what it is about

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.929
It's a 24 inches tablet with two infrared cameras

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.510
that track our spatial position with the help of the glasses

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.580
They are passive glasses and include their own sensors

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.460
We are also using a pen, as you can see, to move some objects

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.670
It's also based on infrared technology, and it's really cool

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.150
There is a 3D skeleton that pops out of the screen

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.830
It has a high detail level and a very good resolution, 1080p

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.370
Here we can see Elena using an anatomy app

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.110
She is controlling a small camera to move around the lungs

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.420
And it can be seen on a scren on the left

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.840
You also see that screen in front of you, it's awesome

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.050
This is really cool for education

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.120
And this is me

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.650
I'm about to try an architecture app

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.820
Now I'm grabbing the house

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.360
and I put it inside a virtual reality vortex

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.560
and here we are

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.939
He is explaining to me how it works, in French

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.560
He is telling me that there is a button on the left

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.620
to move between the different floors

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.550
and change between them, but I just try to move that green object

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.120
because I didn't understand it the first time

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.690
And now I finally use that button

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.510
Now I'm pushing it

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.530
and it changes

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.820
to a different view

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.380
It's really interesting for the architects

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.789
it shows some incredible ways to work easily

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.209
So this was the zSpace tablet, I hope you enjoyed it

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.649
Please let me know what you think, see you soon rovianos!
