00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.870
My name is Zeibra Lemley and I'm with the
Different Body Two beauty salon and I'm going

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:12.780
to demonstrate how to do basic Cornrows. The
key to a good Cornrow is to make sure that

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.580
the rows are even and straight, especially
if you're doing just a straight back Cornrows.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.900
The first step is to slice the hair close
to the ear and you want to make a straight

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:40.960
back parting, close to the ear. You want to
clip off the hair that you're not braiding.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.370
You need to clip it off and get it out of
the way so the hair won't come entangled with

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:54.600
the hair that you're braiding. We're going
to start with the hair closest to the edge.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.710
You're going to divide the hair into three
sections, starting with your, the sections

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.580
in your left hand, you're going to bring it
over and grab the section closest to your

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.170
right hand with the section in the middle
and you're going to pull it under and pick

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.120
up that section in your left hand, and you're
going to do this all the way down. You're

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:23.360
just going to cross over the hair. We're going
to go from right to left, unless you're left

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.960
handed, you're going to go from left to right.
You're going to keep the hair close to the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:43.140
scalp and just continue to cross over until
you have all the hair completely braided in.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:54.550
But as you go down, you're going to pick up
slices of hair to add on in to each cross

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.230
as you go down, all the way down to the nape
of the neck holding the hair close to the

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:19.469
scalp. You're going to pick up the last slice
at the nape of the neck, keeping the hair

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:33.170
close to the scalp, and just continue to braid
all the way down

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.259
to the end.
