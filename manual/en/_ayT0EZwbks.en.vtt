00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.990
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.019
I tell you that this station will be operational as planned.

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.550
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.679
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.019
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.779
That is correct commander and he is most

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.220
displeased with your apparent lack of progress.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.160
We shall double our efforts.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.570
I hope so, Commander, for your sake,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.570
the emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.450
Luke. Luke. Join me on the dark side of the force.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.190
My son.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.090
He is the only way.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.130
Luke...

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.829
Luke...

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.470
What a forsaken place this is. Why couldn't that bounty hunter have taken

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.060
captain Solo to a more

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.079
pleasant environment?

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.710
We're leaving? What about Master Luke? I thought he was going to rescue Captain Solo?

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.729
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.830
You mean we're going to that horrible fortress alone?

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.180
We're doomed.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.569
Of course I'm worried.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.939
And you should be too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca  

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.849
never returned from this awful place.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.170
Don't be so sure. If I told you 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.599
half of the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short circuit.
