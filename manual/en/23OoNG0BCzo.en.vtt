Two strand twists are a stylish variation on individual braids. 

00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:15.081
Let's take a look at how they are done. 

00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:17.994
Separate the natural hair into two. 

00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:23.827
And add your braiding fiber across the top.

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:31.498
Using your right hand, twist the fiber until it is tight to the scalp.

00:00:34.646 --> 00:00:39.414
Using your left hand, twist the other section in the same direction.

00:00:41.088 --> 00:00:45.209
You want this to be tight to the 
 scalp with no gaps across the top.

00:00:47.784 --> 00:00:57.201
Now, it's simply going to take your right hand and pass it to your left 
 over the top and pick up the underneath strand, and give it a twist.

00:00:58.187 --> 00:01:05.216
You are just going to begin this pass, twist, 
 motion until you have completed your twist.

00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:10.788
So twist, pass. Twist, pass.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.401
Twist, pass. 

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:20.030
Your right hand always does the twist motion and your 
 left hand simply holds it in place. 

00:01:23.154 --> 00:01:29.263
Once you get to the ends of the natural hair, use 
 a styling product to help tuck in those ends. 

00:01:39.796 --> 00:01:43.540
You can also use a bit of the braiding 
 hair to help tuck in the ends. 

00:02:01.892 --> 00:02:04.240
Once you get past the ends, you can pick up some speed. 

00:02:07.534 --> 00:02:12.440
Continue twisting the fiber until you have reached your desired 
 length and band or seal the ends.
