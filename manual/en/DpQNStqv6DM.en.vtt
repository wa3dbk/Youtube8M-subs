If you are entertaining a group of people
and don't want to serve a complete meal finger

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.920
foods are a great alternative. I'm Karen Lasher,
Chef owner of "Around the Table" in Camas,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.219
Washington and I'm going to talk to you a
little bit today about finger foods. There

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.710
are a couple of things to keep in mind when
you are serving finger foods. First and most

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.980
important is you really want them to be finger
foods. They should be bite size, something

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.210
that someone can eat in one complete bite.
Also you want items that aren't extremely

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.760
messy, something that when someone bites into
it is not going to end up on the front of

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.829
their dress or down the side of their mouth.
It is also nice when you are doing a menu

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:57.809
to create a nice mix of items from vegetarian
to meat to baked to fresh, some vegetables,

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.560
those make great finger foods. There are a
lot of items that you can work with. I have

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:11.980
a few examples here and to show you, Phyllo
though is a wonderful item to make finger

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:19.310
foods with. 1) Because you can make it ahead
and bake them right before your party. So

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.210
here I have what I call Moroccan chicken cigars.
I like to serve them in a cigar box an it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:35.909
makes for a really fun presentation. The filling
is a mixture of spices, some egg, some nuts

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.960
and chicken and it also has a little sweet
component to it in cinnamon sugar and it is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.729
sprinkled with that on the top. This is another
form of Phyllo appetizer called a Phyllo triangle

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.000
and there are so many different fillings you
can use to make triangles. This particular

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.119
one has a wild mushroom blue cheese and pecan
filling. I also have a couple more fresh type

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.240
items. This is a prosciutto and fig roll.
It has got goat cheese in the middle. It is

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.430
just a fig that I spread goat cheese on and
wrapped in prosciutto and did a little lemon

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.709
zest olive oil on top. This is what I call
a prosciutto cup and it has actually kind

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:25.680
of created a little cup. The prosciutto the
inside, is a ricotta mixture, ricotta, Parmesan

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.680
cheese, spinach and some herbs and this is
one of my most favorite. It is called a smoked

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.439
salmon lollipop and I'll show you the inside.
So the inside of the lollipop is actually

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:46.709
what you would find in a traditional lock
splatter, cream cheese, capers, red onions,

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.230
some lemon zest and all mixed together and
then created in the little bite sized balls

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.139
and covered in your lock style smoked salmon
complete with your lollipop stick. Now whenever

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:06.150
you are serving something such as the lollipop
or often you might have cocktail meatballs

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:14.349
that have a toothpick or a skewer of some
sort always make sure that you put a container

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:21.969
so that when people are done eating and they
have a place to put their used stick. You

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.989
don't want their guests wandering around their
living room trying to find a place to put

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.829
their sticks. I think you would find them
in strange places. So again wonderful to entertain

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.359
with friends, a chance for people to gather
together and finger foods are a great way

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.199
to make it easy for you and also for your
guests.
