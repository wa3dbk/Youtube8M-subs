1993 -1995 Diagnostic Procedures Manual
Hey this is David from Redneck Garage I wanted

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.540
to take a minute to talk to you about the
YJ project one of the things that I run into

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.420
with the old YJs mine is a 1995 is that I
need to find a repair manual well I bought

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.760
on eBay just the standard YJ repair manual
that gives you general information about how

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.220
to do the front end the seals and brakes engine
redo the engine but it doesn't give a lot

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.870
of trouble code or diagnostic codes at all
for this model year now one thing Chrysler

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.809
did do is they did produce a book for the
YJ specifically also the Cherokee the Grand

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:54.100
Cherokee and the Wagoneer it's this book right
here it's the powertrain diagnostic manual

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.440
if you want to do any work on the computers
the injection anything else electronic on

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.690
the vehicle this book is invaluable in being
able to diagnose look at and give troubleshooting

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:14.390
flowchart of what could be wrong with the
truck sadly because its obd1 what I use an

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:22.210
old snap on scanner that was used for obd1
Chrysler and it also does Jeeps but that's

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.470
one of the few besides the factory scan tool
that you can use on these even that it is

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.560
limited you have to to go through a flowchart
procedure with this truck you want to do it

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.880
and you have some thing missing to go figure
out what that is the general repair manual

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.670
that you can get for it doesn't go into dip
in that but this book does it's got all kinds

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.600
of cool stuff band electronic modules and
positions of each of the different wires so

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.770
this is a really great book unfortunately
this book has been out of print for almost

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.780
20 years what do you do well I went on Amazon
and bought a used copy just because that was

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.570
the only one I could find don't be confused
if you are going to buy your own copy there

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:16.700
is a 2.5 liter and this is the one for a jeep
1993 to 1995 they also make a 1993 model 2.5

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.780
which was a Chrysler engine this is the AMC
engine that was used in our Wranglers so there

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.090
is two different books and it kind of gets
confusing if you're trying to look that up

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.260
now if you look at the bottom of this video
there's going to be a link happily I will

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.950
show what I did with the book here in just
a minute I ripped it apart I'm scanning it

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.840
into a PDF okay here's the book I'm going
to be working on today I found that I like

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.050
PDS way more than I like the paper books that
don't get dirty I can look up quicker quicker

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.030
more quickly whatever it's easier for me to
look up stuff if I can do a search on a computer

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.170
rather than flip through a bunch of pages
the first thing I'm going to do is disassemble

00:03:01.170 --> 00:04:33.159
the book and with that I'm going to use a
heat gun 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:38.569
if you wanted to see how that file came out
click on the bottom of the video and that

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.800
will be the PDF of this book and it will be
indexed and everything else which is really

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.629
cool I wish someone had done that for me don't
send me a bunch of messages on copyrighted

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:52.020
material this thing has been out of print
for 20 years Chrysler has nothing anything

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.050
like this and I'm going to leave it up there
until Chrysler AMC or which both are gone

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.169
or the Fiat folk call me and get upset that
I put this 95 manual on the web then we'll

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.210
take it out but until then click on that link
on the bottom and there's your free stuff

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.040
for today
