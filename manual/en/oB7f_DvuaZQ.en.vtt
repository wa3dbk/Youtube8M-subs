00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:19.593
I just saw the video someone sent me of the

00:00:19.593 --> 00:00:23.180
woman who says she's the mother of Snow.

00:00:23.637 --> 00:00:25.868
Kelly: If I just sit down somewhere in the yard

00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:28.703
near her, she'll make her way over to me,

00:00:28.703 --> 00:00:30.052
she'll hobble over to me.

00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:33.495
She still doesn't quite have use of her right leg.

00:00:36.785 --> 00:00:41.053
I just wanted to say to her, really creative editing

00:00:41.053 --> 00:00:44.925
it's interesting how you have no desire to have

00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:49.417
an actual dialog. You edit out the part when I say

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:51.748
I am clearly against animal cruelty.

00:00:51.748 --> 00:00:53.690
There is no reason to torture animals,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.893
there is no reason.

00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:58.661
I don't eat veal because to make them tasty

00:00:58.661 --> 00:01:02.940
suspending them or putting them in a box

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.175
their whole life is absolutely inhumane.

00:01:06.175 --> 00:01:09.218
The animals are here to keep us warm,

00:01:09.218 --> 00:01:13.647
to keep us fed, it is our job to treat them humanely,

00:01:13.647 --> 00:01:15.851
to treat them the right way.

00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:17.859
There are millions of Americans who feel just

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:21.926
like you do on animal cruelty. We just don't think

00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:23.812
it's cruel to eat animals.

00:01:23.812 --> 00:01:27.166
I have friends that are a part of - I don't agree

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:30.366
with everything PeTA says- uhm, I have people

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:33.900
that work for me - I'm deeply religious- they're atheist.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.844
I have friends who are atheist. I have friends and

00:01:36.844 --> 00:01:39.278
conversations and can make real progress

00:01:39.278 --> 00:01:42.512
with people who think differently

00:01:42.512 --> 00:01:45.015
but at least have respect for the truth.

00:01:45.015 --> 00:01:47.866
And for you to take and edit out and make

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:51.130
it seem as though I'm in to animal cruelty

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.179
is so unbelievably dishonest.

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.084
When people decide to be honest

00:01:57.084 --> 00:02:01.089
and say 'I'm sorry I've made mistakes in my life

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:04.001
and I just want to move things forward

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:05.748
and we're not going to agree on everything

00:02:05.748 --> 00:02:08.501
but we can move together on this one',

00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:10.968
you'd make real progress. But too many people

00:02:15.282 --> 00:02:18.339
are only concerned with winning.

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.461
Read Martin Luther King, it's all able reconciliation

00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:22.733
and not winning.

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:27.065
And I would hope that some day you'll join

00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:30.781
me and millions of other people who are tired

00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:34.262
of this fight and this bashing and the lies

00:02:34.262 --> 00:02:38.711
and talk about reconcilation and not winning.

00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:41.534
Because together we can actually stand against

00:02:41.534 --> 00:02:43.271
animal cruelty.
