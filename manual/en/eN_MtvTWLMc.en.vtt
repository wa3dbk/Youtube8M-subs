00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.410
Aproximately three milles to landing site

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.410
And there is the runway.

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:24.839
speed

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.570
And there's a (inaudible) view of space shuttle Endeavour as it's coming in for landing

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:35.570
Gear down and locked

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.920
Main gear touchdown

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.170
Drag chute deployed by Greg Johnson

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.170
Forward gear touchdown

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.190
and so after a journey of six and a half million
miles, Endeavour landing in darkness, and ever landing in darkness but eliminated

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.840
but illuminated by the ingenuity, dedication of evert astronaut, scientist,
engineer,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.570
flight controller, mechanic and dreamer that helped it fly

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.940
the fleet's youngest ship completing its 122 millionth mile after its crew delivered

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.200
the instrument to the International Space Station

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.990
It'll sift through the cosmic darkness for years to come.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.320
Mark Kelly/STS-134 Commander: Houston, Endeavour wheel stop.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.280
Barry Butch Willmore/CAPCOM: 122 million miles flown during

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.930
25 challenging spaceflights.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.720
Your landing ends a vibrant legacy for this amazing vehicle that will long be

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.110
remembered. Welcome home Endeavour.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.670
Mark Kelly/STS-134 Commander. Thank you, Houston. You know the space shuttle is

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.150
an amazing vehicle. To fly through the atmosphere, hit it at match 25.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.049
I mean steer through the atmosphere like an airplane, land on the runway.

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.750
It is really, really an incredible ship.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.049
On behalf of my entire crew, I want to thank every person that's worked for,

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:03.049
to get this mission going every person that's worked on Endeavour.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.059
It's sad to see her land for the last time, but she really has a great legacy.

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:14.909
Kelly Humphries/STS-134 Descent Commentator: And so the space shuttle Endeavour

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.260
touching down at Kennedy Space Center on time, at 1:35 a.m. Central Time, 2:35 a.m.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.629
Eastern. Commander Mark Kelly guiding it to a very gentle touchdown on runway 15

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.369
and the Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility.
