00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.220
 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.130
I'm Mike Hanley with cars.com if you're
looking for mid-size family sedan you

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.730
may have already checked out the Honda
Accord and Toyota Camry

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.730
mazda's redesigned its six mid-size
family sedan for 2009

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.300
and now it's better equipped to compete
with those models thanks to distinctive

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.939
styling

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.450
a roomy cabin in a solid overall driving
experience

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.980
let's take a closer look at this model
where I think mother really got it right

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.700
with the new six is the car's exterior
styling which is very distinctive

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.629
and draws on some styling he is seen in
recent months the concept cars

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.359
like there you go you can see his
balding front fenders

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.120
this let like headlight elements and no
I would have liked to see some chrome in

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.230
the front grille design mazda's gone
with the body color look as you go

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.039
around the back up the car the sleek

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.309
well proportioned looks carry on their
which is something you can say about

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.999
sold its competitors like the new Chevy
Malibu

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.870
as before the mazda6 is offered with
force under or

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.170
v6 power the engines though for 2009 are
larger

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.630
and they make more horsepower the base
engine is a 2.5 liter four-cylinder

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.780
minutes rated at 170 horsepower

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.270
you can step up to this offline Jennifer
3.7 liter v6 and it's rated at 272

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.120
horsepower

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.770
if you're looking for the best gas
mileage it's the four-cylinder with the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.130
automatic transmission model

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.630
trade at 21:38 miles per gallon the
highway

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.040
but the v6 you see here that maker drops
to 1725 city/highway

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.210
and that's probably 10 the month the
Sixers

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.200
bigger shortcomings is that a number of
competitors get better fuel economy than

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.860
this car

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.290
mazda6

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.080
redesign cabin features a premium
appearance thanks to upscale dash

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.100
materials like this

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.360
soft touch surface here high quality
control knobs

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.910
as well and it features a four gauge
instrument cluster it's very similar to

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.750
the company's CX nine crossover

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.129
like the 69 the mazda6 can be equipped
with the

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.610
blind spot monitoring system what that
does it keeps track in the side to the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.280
vehicle

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.380
to let you know when there's a car on
either side in you

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.600
in a few intend to move into the
direction that car as an alumina warning

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.200
tone

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.470
to what's know that may not be the best
idea at that time the new mazda6 is

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.600
significantly larger than its
predecessor

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.830
and that translates into more room on
the inside for passengers

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.670
you can see here with the car's backseat
that there's plenty of space for taller

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.340
Dulce

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.930
and with a nicely reclining backrest
angle comfort is also good

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.610
mas the six now has won the larger
trucks in its class

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.330
in measures 16 points 6 cubic feet in
the car also comes standard with a 60/40

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.950
split-folding back seat

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.490
the back seat release by straps on
either side in the cargo area

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.069
and when the back seat is down it's flat
with the cargo floor

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.370
after scrutinizing the new six it's
clear Mazda said practically all the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.880
right buttons with its new sedan

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.340
well we don't know yet is our liability
will be over the long term

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.709
but that proves to be good at all only
enhance what's already a strong

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.080
contender for Mazda
