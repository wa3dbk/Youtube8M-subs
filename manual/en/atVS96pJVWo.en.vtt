Veggie Burger Recipe - Portobello Mushroom Burger - Vegetarian Burger - Vegan Friendly 

00:00:01.138 --> 00:00:03.138
Hey my Sweet V's, it's The Sweetest Vegan here. It's summer time

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.759
and everybody is starting to have BarBQ picnics

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.497
You don't want to be left out when everybody 
 else is eating burgers off the grill

00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:14.466
So today I am going to show you 
 how to make a Portobello Mushroom Burger

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.743
It is so good, here we go.

00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:20.573
Veggie Burger

00:00:20.573 --> 00:00:26.146
Now, a key step to cooking any mushroom is cleaning them

00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:31.231
Just take a damp cloth, and that wasn't dirt. Those were just veins 
 from the mushroom that was laying on the opposite side of it

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:33.762
But it is still good to get it all clean.

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:37.222
Then, you are just going to put a little oil in the pan

00:00:37.222 --> 00:00:41.076
and I am just going to arrange my portobello mushrooms in the cooking pan.

00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:45.140
And, I am slicing some onions, I am not slicing them correctly, but

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.847
you get the drift

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:50.484
Put those in the inside. You want the mushrooms face up, vein side up

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:52.286
so that you can stuff them a little bit

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:57.758
So I put my onions in the mushrooms, now I 
 am going to make the liquid marinade mixture.

00:00:57.758 --> 00:01:02.392
I have some canola oil, agave nectar, soy sauce, 

00:01:02.392 --> 00:01:07.454
Liquid smoke, poultry seasoning, and then salt and pepper.

00:01:07.454 --> 00:01:09.962
Of course, always have to have salt and pepper.

00:01:09.962 --> 00:01:15.302
And then last, I wasn't sure I was going to add 
 it in or not, but I put in some garlic.

00:01:15.302 --> 00:01:20.945
And I just gave that a good stir until 
 everything was well combined in the oil

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:25.333
You can just drizzle that over the mushrooms 
 and you actually don't need that much

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:31.347
because the way you cook it, is cover it with foil and you 
 can put these on the grill too by making a foil pack

00:01:31.347 --> 00:01:36.316
It steams up so well and everything just comes together.

00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:38.778
So you don't need that much even though it 
 looks like you need a little bit more.

00:01:38.778 --> 00:01:42.440
You will see when you go back in that it did just fine

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:45.260
Bake the portobello mushrooms and 450 degrees for 15 minutes.

00:01:45.256 --> 00:01:49.840
Or throw them on a hot grill in 
 a foil pack for about 15 minutes.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:53.800
And they will come out so tender and juicy, and just look at this.

00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:05.300
So good, right? I know.

00:02:05.295 --> 00:02:07.990
So then we are just going to dress our veggie burgers

00:02:07.988 --> 00:02:15.440
So I have some Sunbeam Hamburger buns, it was a lot of crap 
 in them, but I didn't see any dairy or animal products

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:19.850
So just have some mustard, and I think 
 that is a whole steak of tomato

00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:25.440
and then avocado and you can optionally top it with nutritional yeast

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:28.910
just to get a little bit of cheesy flavor in there

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.390
It was so good. That liquid smoke, and poultry seasoning, and soy sauce, everything

00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:38.780
Just song like this hymn from old school country church

00:02:38.778 --> 00:02:43.060
I don't know, it was just so good. It 
 even fell all out of my mouth

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:47.160
I started to edit it out, but I just left 
 it in for you. That's it for today, Bye.
