00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970
What's the most impressive car you have ever driven?

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.420
I get that question frequently and usually respond: the Porsche Carrera GT.

00:00:10.452 --> 00:00:13.601
That's been around for ten years, but it's still ranked quite high on my list.

00:00:13.804 --> 00:00:20.875
Hence this is a very special moment, because this is its successor: the Porsche 918 Spyder.

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:54.871
And it's electric! Look, I'm driving off!

00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:04.707
This is THE new supercar. The new age of supercars has arrived.

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:30.438
887 ps in total! 600 thanks to a V8 behind my back, the rest is delivered by two electric motors.

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:39.043
This enables an average fuel consumption of 3 litres per 100 kilometres, which makes it eligible for low added taxes.

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:47.637
Today we don't care about that, because I want to find out how it feels and how it performs.

00:01:47.783 --> 00:01:56.864
I can tell you it does 0 to 200 km/h in less than 6,1 seconds!

00:01:57.235 --> 00:02:00.165
And 0 tot 300 km/h in less than 20 seconds!

00:02:01.537 --> 00:02:08.791
So it's not really about fuel consumption, emissions or low taxes, but about the sensation.

00:02:11.068 --> 00:02:20.814
As you can hear, the engine has kicked in. Everything comes together. Let's floor it.

00:02:36.254 --> 00:02:42.312
There are four driving modes: E, for Electric, which I can easily engage through a button on the wheel.

00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:54.290
H, for Hybrid, for city driving or touring, in which it shifts between electric driving up to 150 km/h and hybrid mode.

00:02:54.474 --> 00:03:01.612
But this is the track, so I'll put it in S - you know what, let's go with R, for Race.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:12.102
This enables for better aerodynamics, quicker gearshifts and mostly, more boost and more power.

00:03:33.556 --> 00:03:41.642
Now you really forget you're in a hybrid, because the car feels like a pure, hardcore race car. It's amazing.

00:03:44.793 --> 00:03:49.359
There's one more button left, the red button, which enables Hotlap mode.

00:03:50.345 --> 00:03:56.410
This provides you with all the power and boost you can get for a limited time.

00:03:58.183 --> 00:04:00.992
It also sharpens the response of the car.

00:04:02.377 --> 00:04:07.856
That's how they lapped the NÃ¼rburgring in a record time of less than 7 minutes.

00:04:10.993 --> 00:04:24.055
Despite the sheer power and the violent V8 rumble, because it really sounds amazing, the most impressive aspect is the handling.

00:04:25.668 --> 00:04:29.675
There's a Porsche Turbo S driving in front of me, going flat-out.

00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:38.360
There's a Porsche test driver behind the wheel, and I could almost keep up with one hand on the wheel.

00:04:40.138 --> 00:04:44.737
You can carry so much speed into a corner.

00:04:45.672 --> 00:04:56.314
Torque vectoring helps the rear wheels during turn-in, which allows for very stable handling while cornering.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:08.922
Remarkably, if you want to get the most out of it, you should really grab it by its scruff, despite all the technology, and brake hard into corners.

00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:18.059
On one hand it's a very accessible car, but if you want to experience its full potential, you have to go all-out and push it.

00:05:18.627 --> 00:05:23.758
When you take it too easy, there's a bit of understeer.

00:05:24.377 --> 00:05:33.278
It's a 4WD car after all, with electric motors on the front wheels, so there's a bit of understeer unless you really go for it.

00:05:33.682 --> 00:05:35.501
What an amazing car!

00:05:38.012 --> 00:05:47.707
If anyone asks me again, like I said before: what's the most sensational, violent car you have ever driven?

00:05:48.502 --> 00:05:52.567
There's no shadow of a doubt: it's this Porsche 918 Spyder.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.902
I'm very curious to see how Ferrari and McLaren will respond.
