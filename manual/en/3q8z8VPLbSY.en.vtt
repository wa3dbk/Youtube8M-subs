00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.033
Again I would like to welcome you ITSE2309 -- 
In this module  we will be in looking

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:14.066
at creating the database that will be used for the 
lab    ---   at this point the sample databse 
should have been  established

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:21.066
now we will begin the process to create the 
actual database to the used in this lab

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:27.066
we will begin by stating that the information needed for the lab is located in the 
blackboard web site

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:37.033
that is located off the  ACC main web site--  you log on to 
blackboard using their student ID parameters

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:42.066
within that process you'll see the classes that 
you are enrolled in --

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:47.066
You will select the ITSE class - the ITSE2309 
class you are enrolled  in

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:50.033
you will also select the Competency module 
item --

00:00:50.033 --> 00:01:00.066
- from there we will drill down to selecting 
competency one (1) -- and within Compentency 
one (1) you'll see the learning procedures

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:10.000
lecture materials tab -- selecting that drilling 
down through there --you'll see the "Watch" 
and "Do it"  file,  within this item you will see that

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.066
there are instructions on

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:21.033
downloading the Oracle 11g tutorial   -- you'll see 
some of the information --  you also see a list of 
all the files needed to create the tables and

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:25.033
the data associated with the tables for the 
database

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:35.066
is important to begin with the fact that we 
recommended that you  open all the files using 
notepad print the files- the data  for future review

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.000
and analysis

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
you can also download these files and save them 
into some appropriate directory for your 
convenience

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.066
for this process there will be five tables that will 
be created -- there is the -  1) customer table, 2) 
orders table

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:56.066
3) the items tables, 4)  the stock table  and 
5) the manufact or manufacture table

00:01:56.066 --> 00:02:05.066
there are several ways that we can do this--  we  
can type the information directly into the SQL 
prompt  you can use the copy paste method

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:12.000
which is a line by line process you can also do 
a load  import  - script  process

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.066
whichever one chooses OK  depending on what 
your comfort is ---  we will begin by selecting the 
manufacture file off blackboard you will see that

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:26.000
as you open  it in notepad  --  you'll have this 
instructions

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.066
you'll do a copy paste scenario

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:35.066
and you'll see this item where you'll paste it into

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:40.066
the SQL script  in the  SQL workshop

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:49.000
at this point you will run the you will  press the 
run  button -- You should see a table created at 
the bottom left

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.000
this process will be continued for all tables and 
will also be continued for the data process

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:08.033
we will also be looking at the upload function 
this is a little more involved--it  requires you to 
select the

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:12.033
and SQL script process

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:23.000
here you see an upload function --  you select 
the the upload function  you will be required to  
use the browser button to select the file location

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.066
you will select the file location in your 
appropriate directory at this point you will see 
the

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:40.000
file name into a selected  - - you will do upload --  
at this point you will see where information is 
listed you will  select the file name

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
you will press create an then you will use the 
run  function

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.033
at this point you will jump to the browser object 
tab -- there you will select

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:57.033
the manufacture tables that shows  -------------

00:03:57.033 --> 00:04:08.066
The data processing follows the same 
methodology you select the item you insert the 
item and you can also see the data as it is

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:19.066
loaded for those of you're brave there's also 
the utilities tab which allows you to use the old 
fashion create table line by line

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:32.000
You use the Utility's function - select the table 
and at that point you are able to create the 
tables in a table field line by line description

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.033
process that is not recommended at this point 
but I show this to you because you'll be using

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:44.000
this later on to create some tables and other 
processes -  this ends this portion.
