Azul: Azul here with CamelBak.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.620
We're really excited to tell you about our
new bottle collection, the Eddy Collection.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.460
It's made for active and on the
go individuals who need a bottle to suit their

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.930
everyday hydration needs.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.520
Catherine: My name is Catherine and I work
for CamelBak.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.010
I do everything
from Crossfit to riding my bike to walking

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.099
downtown to shop and nutrition
and hydration is just as important to me as

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.570
my exercise and staying fit.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.440
When I leave the house in the morning I don't
leave without my keys, my

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.730
wallet, or my CamelBak.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.379
So, you know, if I feel naked without it,
I would

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.659
say it's pretty important to me.

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:40.729
Azul: And eddy is applicable to our customers
out there because in their

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.510
active and on the go lives they need that
moment to stop, collect

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.510
themselves, and hydrate.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.430
Catherine: Well, it's easy to use.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.570
It's convenient.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.620
I can cruise around and
without thinking just grab it and drink without

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.150
having to fumble with the
lid or, you know, worry about sloshing water

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.150
everywhere.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.800
It makes it so I
don't have to think about it.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.430
Azul: It's important for people to have products
that they know they can

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.211
depend on, because it helps enable them to
move away from plastic

00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:07.530
disposable water bottles.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.590
Catherine: Living in the Bay area and having
access to local vendors for

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.550
everything from clothing to vegetables to
fruit, olive oil, it's very

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.770
important and has been a part of my life since
I was a child.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.061
The fact that
I can avoid using plastic water bottles, it

00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:29.450
definitely helps me to do my
part.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.050
Azul: We also understand that you've got a
family that needs to hydrate so

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.580
we've got kids bottles, large bottles, small
bottles.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.930
We've got insulated
bottles, that's going to keep your water cold.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.320
We want you to have a
product that you can depend on to stay hydrated

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.320
through the day.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.640
Catherine: It's important to me to have a
selection and a variety when I'm

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.730
choosing my bottles.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.170
I have everything from a bright pink to a
stainless

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.479
steel to graphics and everything in between.

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.090
I'm not the type that has the
one bottle that I carry around all the time

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.510
that's banged up and scuffed.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.760
I've got to have, you know, a bottle for every
day.
