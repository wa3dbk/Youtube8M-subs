00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.190

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.830
generations. 44 Tony

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.710
Sharna Val Karina thanks

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.830
you guys 50 so

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.370
this is super fun, coming

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.720
up on 19 seasons of

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.770
dancing with the stars

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.340
we're doing this and this

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.140
is really fun. tell me

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.610
about ballroom with a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.980
twist? 00 3600

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.580
Ballroom with a twist is

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.550
a wonderful show that's

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.110
on stage. 04 we actually

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.710
have a quite a mix of

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.180
different reality shows

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.720
like from so you think

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.250
you can dance from

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.850
american idol from

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.490
dancing with the stars.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.490
10 so we all created the

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.120
beautiful show that every

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.130
body gets to go to. 14

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.990
3614

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.590
what makes it special is

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.000
it's for many different

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.660
generations for your

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.200
entire family to come and

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.830
enjoy together 20 I think

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.650
every body has a blast 22

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.410
especially when Karina

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.970
gets on stage 25 even at

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.540
the last minutes some

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.810
times! yes exactly 30

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.310
3630

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.840
we do play a lot of games

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.950
with the audience we

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.510
interact we have our q

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.110
and a so it's not like

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.480
where people come in and

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.050
the have to sit for 2

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.520
hours 3638 no we make

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.150
them dance

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.650
yeah we even get them up.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.120
Tony has the whole

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.720
special program. Scare

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.660
them up. Scare in a good

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.260
way. laughs 3648 we have

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.860
some moves that we teach

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.430
them, I also have a lot

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.030
of stories that are

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.400
pointless 55 that's ok

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.060
that's ok. 56 3656

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.630
well you guys are just so

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.140
much fun and this is

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.670
really apart of a

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.270
phenomenon that has

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.540
happened in the past few

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.170
years with dancing how

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.140
great has that been and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.640
not only for your

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.240
industry for your

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.210
talents, to be part of

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.150
this movement. 09

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.750
well we're no longer like

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.150
a secret society. Karina

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.750
and I were talking about

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.490
it the other day people

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.090
we'd have to explain what

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.720
we did for a living. 19

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.060
now people strange people

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.690
will come over and talk

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.260
to us about the pas doble

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.360
23 like the other day

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.990
this biker 6'6", tattoos,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.730
who had this ZZTop beard

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.300
comes to me hey the pas

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.930
doble I want to learn

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.100
that I was like what? 31

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.740
so it was pretty cool. 33

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.340
we bring people from all

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.410
walks of life to watch

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.170
us. 35 3838

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.770
So Sharna, how do you see

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.940
that transition for you

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.580
and the partners you work

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.150
with because it's such a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.750
growing experience in so

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.350
many ways not only for

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.620
the people your working

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.020
with but for the pros

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.280
too. 49 3949

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.880
Yeah really. 52 The first

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.450
thing I realized when I

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.020
came into dancing with

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.620
the stars is how close

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.260
everybody was and how

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.860
everybody just helps each

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.990
other out and everybody

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.490
is there for one another

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.000
whether it be the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.630
celebrity or the pro

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.260
dancer and it was really

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.860
not a hard transition. 03

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.500
I felt like I walked in

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.300
and everybody welcomed me

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.930
with open arms and it's

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.570
just amazing to see that

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.070
and now I get to do that

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.710
for the new people each

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.210
season. 12 So it's really

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.610
wonderful to be a part

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.040
of. 14 3914

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.640
You know I think what's

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.540
really neat too, is all

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.180
of you are involved in

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.750
other types of whether it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.250
be different types of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.850
programs, different types

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.990
of entreprenurial works,

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.620
charities that you work

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.860
with, this has taken you

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.190
out into the community as

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.990
well. 30

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.530
Dance has been through

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.460
out history that has

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.060
brought so many different

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.630
things together such as

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.160
charities and helping

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.700
them raise money for

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.330
different causes, in

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.830
fact, all of us we travel

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.440
all of us travel and do

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.370
charity work constantly

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.900
because dance brings

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.500
smiles to people and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.010
that's the best healing

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.710
you could ever have. 47

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.340
Not only smiles, but

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.210
really what's great about

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.780
this movement too is it

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.340
healthy, it's great to

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.950
see people move their

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.550
bodies and in away that a

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.180
lot of them love to do.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.790
What is that meant to all

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.950
of you to impact people

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.590
in that way? 01

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.120
Well, dancing has always

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.160
been a very healthy

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.760
activity not only

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.360
physically but for your

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.930
mind and your soul. You

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.530
see people come out of

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.000
the dance studio happy,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.630
tired in a good way, so

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.270
this is one of the things

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.500
we do during the show, we

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.100
want the audience to get

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.700
up and actually start

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.670
moving with us because

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.310
that gift that passion

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.010
for dancing is for all of

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.640
us. We want to be able to

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.240
share it with people that

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.180
love the show and love

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.680
Ballroom with a twist and

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.310
for us it is the

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.650
opportunity to do it. 28

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.250

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.780

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.380

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.950
already, but glad you

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:03.490

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.390

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.360
dreams I've been here
