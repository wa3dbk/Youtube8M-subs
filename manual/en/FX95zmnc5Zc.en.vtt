00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.460
you're going to America!

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.330
these are dogs that have been kept on this farm for their entire lives and will be sent

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.430
to slaughter Through Humane Society International, we've come here

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.960
and we've worked with the farmer

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.270
to negotiate the release of these dogs

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.879
for these dogs, today the dog meat industry is over for them

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.859
they will be removed and having happy lives in America

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.380
This is snowball, as we've named him

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.520
he is from a Korean Dog Meat Farm

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.530
which we've recently worked with to rescue all 23 dogs

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.690
off the farm and the farmer has agreed to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.350
close his doors for good and transition
into

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.550
a much more humane trade of blueberry growing

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.159
well we're very excited that these 23 are the first

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.570
to act as ambassadors of what we hope will be more farms

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.590
that will close down

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.400
These dogs are now headed to 5 different shelters

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.920
They will be evaluated for both health and behavior

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.119
and from there, they'll be determined if they can go up immediately for adoption

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.579
or if it will be adoption down the road and they need a little bit of work

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.920
we feel that helping these 23 dogs we can help many, many more

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.340
by getting this issue out

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.340
these dogs are serving as a symbol and
by helping them

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.980
I think we are going to be helping many other dogs

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.200
it's a great day it is a great day

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.940
and certainly we're thrilled to be a
part of that

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.540
and to be able to facilitate the adoption of these guys

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.640
from Korea to the United States
