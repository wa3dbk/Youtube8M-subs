00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.440
How to Choose Toys for Your Baby.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:21.480
Safety, of course, should be your number one
concern when buying toys for your baby.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.080
But there are other considerations to keep
in mind.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.669
You will need Time to shop and common sense.

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:28.669
Toy recalls are on the rise.

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:29.669
To find out about specific toys, visit the
Consumer Product Safety Commission’s website

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:30.669
at www.cpsc.gov.

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:31.669
Step 1.

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:32.669
Visit toy stores.

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.700
Even if you plan to use mail order or buy
online, it’s a good idea to check out a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.700
toy in person.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.010
The best toys for kids 18 months and under
include mobiles, soft books, rattles and other

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.060
noisemakers, busy boxes, activity tables,
stacking toys, and push- and pull-toys.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.130
Step 2.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.260
As you browse, ask yourself two questions
about any toy that catches your eye—does

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.630
it look like something my baby will enjoy,
and is it safe?

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.020
Step 3.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.430
Consider size and weight.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.320
Your baby will have the most fun with a toy
that he can get a grip on, one that’s not

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.900
too heavy or large for him to manipulate.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.920
Step 4.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.160
Look for a toy that offers different textures,
especially for very young babies.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.330
Step 5.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.950
Choose toys that your baby can interact with.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.680
He should be a participant in making it jingle
or roll—not a passive observer.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.450
Basic or old-fashioned toys like blocks or
stacking cups can be very educational, whether

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.909
or not they’re labeled as such.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:29.909
Step 6.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.320
Pick toys in bright, cheery hues.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.610
Even infants love different colors.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.610
Step 7.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.970
Do a safety check.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.370
Don’t buy any toy that your baby could choke
on, that has small pieces that could break

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.720
off, or that has a string or cord that’s
shorter than six inches.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.290
If a toy is small enough to fit inside an
empty toilet paper roll, it’s small enough

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.780
to choke a baby.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.780
Step 8.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.380
Finally, rate its annoyance factor.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.690
Who cares what the baby likes—is the sound
the toy makes going to drive _you_ nuts?

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.980
Did you know Dolls are the oldest known toys.
