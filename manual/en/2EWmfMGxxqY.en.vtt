Hello! I’m Norman from Arizona Tuxedos in
Scottsdale, Arizona on behalf of expertvillage.com.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.860
We are going to give you a few tips on selecting
your tuxedo style. Today we are going to show

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:25.760
you how to do your shirt. Now the shirt that
Richard has chosen is a lay down shirt because

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.449
he wants to wear a long tie. You can also
wear a bow tie with this type of shirt opposed

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:40.820
to the regular winged traditional tuxedo shirt.
Also, you can get it in different pleats.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.640
This happens to be a quarter inch pleat, they
make it in an 8th inch pleat and you can get

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.960
in a ½ inch pleat or you can get it with
no pleat at all. Those are variations that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.409
you have in just the shirt styles alone. The
next important thing is you want to make sure

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:03.510
the sleeve on the shirt is long enough to
where it will hang out of the coat at least

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:15.670
a ½ inch. Now all shirts for tuxedos are
made to be worn with cufflinks which makes

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:26.100
it a finished look when you get your coat
on. Now on the pants if you will notice the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.880
tuxedo pants always have the satin stripe
on them. It is very important to wear tuxedo

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:41.370
pants right at the navel, on top of the hip.
It ruins the look if you let them below the

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:48.729
hip or below the navel because the pants are
made to be worn up. Then on the length of

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:56.810
the pants it is very important again to have
the proper length and the length is right

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:10.850
to where your heel and shoe meet. These pants
now fit perfect. They hang straight, their

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:18.480
not too long, they’ve got just the right
break and they fit. They are adjustable so

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.849
if you like them a little loose you can just
open them up on the side a little bit and

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:23.989
give yourself more room.
