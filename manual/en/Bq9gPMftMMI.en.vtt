00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.979
we're going to add some greens into this
I've got some chopped coriander leaf

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.979
I've got some chopped mint leaf to give
a very nice aroma to this dish

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.250
also you can add your favorite greens
that are available this dish often

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.320
features in my house once a week

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.640
the reason is throughout the week we use
a lot of vegetables at the end of the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.020
week we will be left out with you know
some of each vegetable we put all of

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.430
this into this and we make this a really
really healthy meal

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.860
ok now you can add some spice by adding some green chillies, some ginger finely

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.450
chopped ginger, some cumin seeds and a
pinch of turmeric

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:18.270
not too much very little just to give
that enhance color and add salt and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.420
I'm just going to mix this once

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.290
put the lid switch it on in 30 minutes

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.380
you got a treasure of nutrients in this
awesome preparation what we're doing.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.480
After about 20 minutes you can see that
this is already the vegetables,  the rice

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.430
the lentils everything

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.110
well now look at this all the vegetables
are perfectly cooked

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.420
when you make any fat free dishes like
this you need some kind of moisturizer

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.170
so you can eat it comfortably and you
can swallow the food now

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.060
here I've got the cucumber and tomato
chutney this is nice and juicy chutney

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.320
and I'm telling you these kind of chutneys even fat free raitas are the

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.280
ones you can enjoy these kind of rice
preparations with it

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:17.910
this is definitely a treasure of nutrients in this, wow and the taste the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.560
taste is just awesome

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.560
look at this simple idea and you can
make your own fantastic one pot full of

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.260
treasure without adding a drop of oil; dear friends if you want you can also add

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.040
nuts

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.180
you can add peanuts to this you can add
almonds or any kind of nuts and

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.530
it will tastes fantastic

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.530
wow

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:54.140
this is super super tasty definitely this one pot treasure of nutrients so if I

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.099
eat like this

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.580
will I be healthy, dear friends it's not about
the recipe

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.430
it's about the lifestyle; if I eat this Khichdi, this pulao in large quantities

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.170
that's not going to help me, fruit juice is
awesome but when you drink one glass a

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.860
day

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.530
it is awesome when you drink two glasses of fruit juice a day is good but imagine if

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.500
you drink 5 glasses of juice a day

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.739
the same juice is going to hurt you so
dear friends

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.229
eat wise and Be fit be cool, see you in
another healthy session in

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:27.950
vahrehvah.com

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:35.840
mmm just because this is tasty that
doesn't mean you can eat as much as you

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.840
want

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.030
