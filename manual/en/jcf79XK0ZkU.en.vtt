00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.330
Hi I'm Michael from Advent Controls.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.400
Today we're going to take a quick look at
our twin output GSM board.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:15.169
This is mainly for roller shutters and garage
doors that need a 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:35.920
separate up and down control.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.629
To have the board alternate between open and
close we set the call channel to alt... and

00:00:41.629 --> 00:01:10.430
to keep the relay active whilst ringing we
set the rely mode to 'RING'.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:22.689
We have connected the blue LED to the CLOSE
or STAR relay and the green LED to the OPEN

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.750
or HASH relay.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.590
As you can see whilst the phone rings out
the relay stays lit and when we call the number

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:38.620
for the second time the other relay stays
lit again whilst the line is ringing.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.969
We can also operate the relays using the DTMF
keys on your phone's keypad.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.270
Unfortunately most mobile phone do not send
long tone bursts so cannot be used for this

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.270
function.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.320
Here we've enabled this mode by sending the
connect enable command.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.770
We then add our office telephone number to
the system using the Add command.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.070
Then when we call the board the call is connected
and we can control the star and hash relays

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.110
using the DTMF keypad on the phone.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:19.080
This is why we call the relays STAR and HASH.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.440
If we only need a single channel activated
by a call we select the channel using the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.220
channel command.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.940
In this case we've selected the star or close
channel.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.320
Now when we ring the board this relay is activated
by our call.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.580
By default the on command will now operate
the other channel to the one selected by the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.440
call channel command.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.560
In this case the on command switches on the
hash relay.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:54.770
We can then switch off this relay using the
OFF command.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.400
We can still operate the star relay by SMS
text, but to do this we must specify which

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.620
relay by sending the star or hash character
with the on or off command.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:23.260
Here we're specifying the star relay to be
active 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.140
for 10s seconds.
