00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.020
In 2009, The Guardian asked the great British
public a simple question: “Have you ever

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.140
claimed to have read a book when you have
not?”

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.439
65% percent of respondents bowed their heads
in shame, and for 42% the book was the same:

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.570
George Orwell’s 1984.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.629
Which makes sense when you look at the world
and see how poor some folks are at identifying

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.170
and opposing totalitarian oligarchies.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.980
Similarly, I’m willing to bet there’s
a healthy subset of folks who SAY they’ve

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.140
played Beyond Good and Evil, but who are just
trying to score points by namedropping one

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.520
of the best stealth adventures of the sixth
generation.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.830
Well, now’s your time to make good by actually
playing this thing, because more of us need

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.370
to know how to identify and oppose occupation
by a secretive peacekeeping force that MIGHT

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.159
BE in cahoots with the aliens that keep invading.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.830
Just in case that happens, y’know.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:14.439
There’s been a 
lot of talk going on about how games need

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:15.710
stronger female characters.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.299
Well, here’s how we were doing it in 2003:
A girl with a stick and a camera who leaves

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.030
the orphanage she runs to dismantle an alien
invasion, through the use of bo kata and photojournalism.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.100
She starts out just getting by with odd jobs
and assignments to keep the lights on - and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.750
by lights we mean “shields” - like documenting
all the species of the area and doing some

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.049
investigation for a mysterious dude in a spiffy
hovercar.

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.540
Turns out it was all a test from the insurgent
group IRIS - pretty darn close to an unfortunate

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.329
name there - who want to recruit Jade here
to infiltrate the Alpha Sections’ more dubious

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.799
operations, take some pictures, and publish
them in order to stoke an uprising.

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:01.109
That’s one way to do it.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:06.700
The bad news is that certain elements of this
game are a bit… um… dated.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.399
While the models have been tuned up, things
like cutscenes and overlays are still pretty

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.940
pixelated, to say nothing of facial animations
when characters are talking.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.520
Y’might as well just presume it’s an intentional
homage to the kung-fu films of yore, if it

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.780
makes you feel better.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.940
Plus, for a game so fixated on stealth action,
getting the camera to obey you takes a swift

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.070
hand and a firm stomach.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.070
There.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.070
The gripes are out of the way.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.580
Now let’s get back to what makes Beyond
Good and Evil one of the most celebrated games

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.690
of this century: the world and its characters.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.800
This is, at its heart, a game about how media
shapes the world around us.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.690
After the disturbance at your lighthouse,
there’s a news crew on the scene to get

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.360
the scoop - but only the scoop that plays
well with the heavily-armed authorities.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.420
Most corners of the game have a radio or a
TV belching out the latest spin - with the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.890
occasional special message from the benevolent
Alpha Sections and maybe a call for recruits.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.800
It’s an all-pervasive, constant bombardment
of propaganda… which manifests itself in

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.020
the background music of the Akuda bar, considered
by me to be in the top five pieces of video

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.340
game music ever crafted, and a standout even
on its own stellar soundtrack.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:19.040
Even if it is in mostly-unintelligible Bulgarian.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.440
Beyond Good and Evil tried to be a game with
a message.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.611
Sometimes, that can be a tricky situation;
plenty of well-meaning games before and after

00:03:25.611 --> 00:03:29.100
would find themselves slaves to their central
point, trying to beat it into our skulls with

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.700
a mallet at the cost of gameplay and enjoyment.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.470
But Jade’s adventure managed to keep the
entire experience light-hearted enough to

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.170
balance the two, with a healthy dose of slapstick
and pithy one-liners to go along with the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.590
important takeaway that all the media you
take in is heavily politicized and deserving

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.410
of criticism in its own right.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.430
You’re just going to be getting this message
between bouts of big ol’ boss fights and

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.940
cruising the inland sea looking for sweet
upgrades to your hovercraft.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.120
Unfortunately for fans of obscene translation
guides, though, there is no option to fill

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.120
it with eels.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.700
You’ll have to do that on your own.
