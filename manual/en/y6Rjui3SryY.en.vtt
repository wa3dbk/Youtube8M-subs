Phil: Hey guys this is Phil from smilinggardener.com.
If you haven't picked up my free online organic

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.180
gardening course, you can do that right on
my homepage of smilinggardener.com but this

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.180
is today is this is actually the first 
of the new three series of lessons on how
to grow a healthy organic garden, obviously

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.690
I am not in my garden right now, I am actually
in the south of Peru hanging out on the beach

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.690
here. I am in Peru for another month or so
and once I get back in my garden maybe reshoot

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.620
this video and I will certainly be shooting
more videos in this series of lessons but

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.620
I wanted to stay talk about soil.
Always when I start a new any kind of like

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.890
my smilinggardener academy which is my online
gardening course or even this free series

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.020
of lessons here I always started talking about
soil even though it's not the most exciting

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.310
for some people because it's definitely the
most important thing for having organic garden

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.229
is improving your soil. What I am talking
about today in this first lesson.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.229
I am not gonna say it all in the video but
is how soil forms and what soil is made of

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.390
because this is really important question
to ask ourselves, we can learn a lot by asking

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.870
this so if we look at this soil here.
If I try to roll this into a ball and then

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.870
into a cylinder I can't do it. It just falls
apart and that's because it's sand. Obviously

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:27.719
I am on a beach but you can do this in your
soil and you can kind of figure out how much

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.200
sand you have, how much clay you have, clay
sticks together more and that helps you make

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.200
a lot of decisions about how much water to
apply, how often to water how much fertilizer

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:58.609
you can apply, which plant you should be planting,
really helps to know your soil texture is

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.790
what we call that, texture sands tilting clay
and then what texture we can help figure our

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:50.829
structure which is how our soil stays together.
How it aggregates, helps us answer a lot of

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:59.029
these gardening questions. So I will talk
more about it and 
the written part of the post I am gonna get

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.780
into it today because I can't really show
you anything but that is all for now.
