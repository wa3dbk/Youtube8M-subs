Hey what is up everybody, Gio here from the
Nerd Herd, and today we take a look at the

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:16.209
Top 5 Apps you can't miss on your Android
Phone!

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.750
The first one I'd like to talk about is Pocket.
I'm sure I've mentioned it a couple of times,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.420
but it deserves a more thorough description.
Previously known as Read It Later, Pocket

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.190
lets you save and store links from the web
and then access them offline.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.170
You can save articles, pictures, reference
pages, Amazon items and everything else that

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.250
is accessible via link.
You can even save video, in theory, but they

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.360
won't be accessible without a connection unfortunately.
The reading mode for articles is really well

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.180
thought, and gives you basically the same
options that a normal e-reader does, like

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.949
sepia and black background, fonts choice,
and fullscreen mode.

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.640
You can also tag articles and send them to
friends, but if you feel you don't need all

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.540
of them right away, you can archive them and
recover them when connected to the internet.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.270
Overall, I find it almost indispensable for
my everyday life.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.840
I've looked for something like Pushbullet
for years, and since it came out I've never

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.530
let one device of mine not have it.
Pushbullet does exactly what is name promises:

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.729
send files, text and links via push notifications
to anyone you have an email address of.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.360
And that is just the starting point.
Pushbullet has gained lots of features over

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.649
the years, and it is now capable of amazing
stuff like notification sync between devices

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.860
and even copy and paste between devices.
Also, thanks to the recent announcement of

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.830
WhatsApp Web, you can not only send and reply
to normal text messages, but also WhatsApp

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.680
messages.
Finally, Pushbullet now also includes Channels,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.850
which are basically feeds you can subscribe
to, and get a push notification when something

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.159
noteworthy is published.
Aren't you already downloading it?

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.660
This one would have maybe fit better in the
Top 5 Browsers, but since I'm using it a lot

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.770
and I'm loving it, I thought I couldn't exclude
it.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.140
Flynx is the browser for the procrastinators
like me: you can tap on any link in any app,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.080
and instead of opening a new app and interrupt
what you were doing, it will open a little,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.170
unintrusive bubble that will load the link
on the background and be ready for you to

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.910
open it.
It behaves basically like Link Bubble from

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.250
Chris Lacy, with the important difference
that it is completely free.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.060
Among the many cool features offered, Flynx
now also includes an 'article' mode that eliminates

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.260
all the clutter for a clean and easy-on-the-eyes
reading experience.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.810
As always, I've written this text exactly
with this app.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.820
Evernote is a cross-platform note-taking app,
but is also much more than that.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.920
You can organize notebooks, share them with
your co-workers, create slides, set memos,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.880
change the format, assign tags, add images
and so on.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.950
With the latest upgrades, the Work Chat feature
has also been added, and that is a welcome

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.730
plus for organizing tasks within a project.
Like someone said, while Google Keep is good

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.960
for the grocery list, Evernote can be used
for your graduation thesis.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.590
What was previously known as the app with
the most unpronounceable name ever, the IFTTT

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.370
acronym stands for If This Than That.
The fact that it is now called IF does not

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.620
change its fantastic capabilities.
It allows you to create the so-called 'recipes',

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.910
where you choose what you want to happen after
a certain event.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.190
For example: send a notification if the following
day is snowing, or change your wallpaper when

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.580
the NASA publishes a new picture, or send
a message to your wife when you leave work,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.130
or anything else that may come to mind.
There are lots of channels to choose from

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.230
like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Pocket, ToDoist,
and the list is growing.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.100
To crown all that, there are now also a couple
of companion apps that allow you to quickly

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.320
activate certain actions in any moment.
Oh and by the way, in case you are unsure

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.590
about how to make good recipes, there is an
insane number of pre-loaded ones ready for

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.470
you to use, so the one thing you have to worry
about is download it and sign up.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.450
So that's it for today, I hope you guys enjoyd
this video, and if you did leave us a thumbs

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.810
