00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.120
Chicken Nuggets with sweet and sour dip

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.580
I am hungry!

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.420
what should we eat?

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.720
Must be something good but fast

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.220
I have an idea!

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.140
Chicken McNuggets

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.560
Let´s do them and then we continue

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.960
you know what I love about the chicken mcNuggets?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.040
They are really easy to prepare and fast!

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.920
what do you need for the batter?

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.880
we need these ingredients:

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.520
1kg chicken breasts

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.420
salt

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.540
pepper

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.120
1 1/2 cups flour

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.540
1/2 cup starch

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.340
1/2 liter water

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.500
baking powder

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.460
why do you need baking powder?

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.100
so that we batter gets nice and fluffy

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.080
Today you will be my assistent

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.400
and you will mix everything for me

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.540
first put the flour

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.820
add the starch

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.680
add the baking powder

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.600
a bit of salt

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.720
pepper

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.960
1/2 liter water

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.940
mix it

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.820
it is starting to bubble already!

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.320
add a bit more water

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.400
it shouldnt be too thick nor too liquidy

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.320
this is how thick it should be

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.540
now we add the sliced chicken nuggets and we let it soak for about 10 minutes

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
mix it

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.500
we let it rest now for 10 minutes

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.440
what´s next?

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.300
Now we prepare the super sweet and sour dip

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.140
what do we need for that?

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.340
we need:

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.340
homemade apricot jam

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.860

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.800
salt

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.600
water

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.400
mustard

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.640
soya sauce

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.700
syrup

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.620
vinegar

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.200
the ingredients you will find underneath this video in the text space

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.000
we mix it all together and cook it

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.500
ok I mix it

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.220
it already smells sooo good

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.560
Let me taste it

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.020
let´s cook it

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.040
we cook it for a couple of minutes until it thickens and then we are finished

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.820
Now we heat oil in our pan. Once it is hot we can start frying

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.720
I have to try it at least three times :)

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.800
Look what a bit mountain we made!

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.480
smells great!

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.000
Let´s go try it!

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:35.900
This is how the nuggets should be:outside crunchy...

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.820
and inside juicy

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.300
The recipe is really great!

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.100
The nuggets really taste like from McDonalds!

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.460
and even the dip is just like from McDonald´s!

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.440
and I love the fact that the dip is mainly made out of fruits

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.840
