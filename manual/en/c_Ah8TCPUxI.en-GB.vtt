Auckland is growing fast with 22,000 new homes
planned in the South.10,000 of these will

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.500
be fast tracked as special housing projects,
they are a part of large growth plans for

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.559
the area, on land its mainly rural at the
moment.

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:37.559
New industrial areas will increase the number
of people working here.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.000
Upgrades are needed on Redoubt, Mill and Murphy's
Roads to provide for the increased traffic

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.629
that will come with more people living in
the area and using the route.

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.769
The upgrade will also improve the safety of
the road which has a number of accident hotspots.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.449
Without the upgrade there are expected to
be further safety issues and more traffic than

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.520
the existing road can cope with.
The proposed route includes the separate lane

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.790
for buses getting into Manukau city centre,
improving public transport, on road cycle

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.570
lanes and an off road path for cyclists and
pedestrians will improve safety. They extend

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.570
the length of the upgrade and include improved access
to Totara park.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.860
Flatbush is having major population growth
already, more houses will be built soon within

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.470
the  special housing area.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.470
At the Murphy's Road intersection, traffic
is slow at peak times, the new route will

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.070
be realigned to improve the intersection &amp; make
it safer.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:00.070
A 23 metre high viaduct will be built across
an area of native forests, minimizing impact

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.840
on the area's ecology. Another 17 metre high
viaduct, will be built in the South Mill Road

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:21.019
gully to cross the bush. Areas of native planting,
wet lands &amp; stream restoration are amongst

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:28.209
the projects environmental elements.
The area around Ranfurly Road &amp; Alfriston

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.519
Road is a planned future urban zone adding
1000's of new houses and people to the transport

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.030
network.The new route will improve safety
in this area, particularly for children in

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.090
Alfriston School, planning is continuing to
identify how to upgrade the Mill Road corridor

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.469
to Papakura and Drury.
The Redoubt &amp; Mill Road upgrade will make

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:56.829
sure the transport network can support the
tens of thousands of new people living &amp; working

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:57.530
in the area.
