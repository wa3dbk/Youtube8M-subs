00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.870
Why, hello.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.870
Hello!

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.630
And welcome to the Loop, where we talk all
things health, wellness, and of course, Livestrong

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.630
Woman.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.540
Now last week, I was talking about what makes
a Livestrong Woman.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.220
I would like to share some of the comments
that were left.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.870
We have PastaandPearls, who says, "A Livestrong
Woman sees each new day as a challenge and

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.960
faces it with a gorgeous smile."

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.960
I love that.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.359
We also have Inox55, who says, "There are
3.5 billion women in the world, so there are

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.210
3.5 billion ways to be a Livestrong Woman."

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.190
Love that one as well.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.079
Okay, and also, we have melindama96, who says,
"Yes to the recipe!!"

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.370
Now if saw last weeks show, I was thinking:
What am I gonna do this week?

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.850
And I thought: Maybe I'm gonna do my dad's
homemade granola recipe.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.519
So mlindama96, because you said "yes" to the
recipe, that's what I'm gonna do.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.610
Let's get to it.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.510
So here we are in the kitchen.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.510
Woohoo!

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.840
Okay, time to make some granola.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.350
We are in the kitchen.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.060
Time to make us some granola.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.210
Okay, so here we are: We have our nice, deep,
large pan.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.370
3 cups of rolled oats.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.770
I've got 2 cups of desiccated, shredded coconut.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.490
1 cup of raw sunflower seeds.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.470
1/4 of a cup of sesame seeds.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.310
1 cup of ground flaxseed.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.320
You can switch that out for wheat germ orâ€¦what
do you call it -- bran.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.790
And 1/2 a cup of honey.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.100
A 1/4 of cup of oil -- I'm using olive oil.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.140
But you can use sunflower oil or vegetable
oil.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.180
And about a 1/2 cup of water.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.660
We're gonna mix it all together, and then
we're gonna pop it in the oven.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.980
I've got the oven preheated at about 280.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.440
You want it at moderate heat.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.640
So I'm gonna go ahead and get mixing, okay.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:18.069
So we got 3 cups of rolled oats.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:25.400
2 cups of desiccated coconut or shredded coconut.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.120
1 cup of sunflower seeds.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.819
1/4 of a cup of sesame seeds.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:46.521
And then 1 cup of ground flaxseed.

00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:49.450
1/2 a cup of honey.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.049
You can use agave or maple syrup, if you wish.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.230
That is 1/4 of a cup of oil.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.090
1/2 a cup of water.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.299
Now you give it a really, really good stir.

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.930
Just give it a really, really good mix.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.299
Okay, once you've given it a really good stir,
and you've made sure that everything's been

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.920
coated, we're just gonna pop it into the oven.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.400
Like I said, I've set the oven for about 280
degrees Fahrenheit -- a nice moderate temperature

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.400
there.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.459
And we're gonna put it in for about 45 minutes.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.790
Now we're gonna go back every, I would say,
every 10 minutes or so and make sure we give

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.810
it a good stir -- make sure it, you know,
cooks evenly.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.050
Okay.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:46.389
And because I do have ADD, I'm gonna set my
alarm: 45 minutes.

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:52.790
This ought to be good.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.700
Once that's cooking, I want to take the opportunity
to just say to you: Obviously, that's a really

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.269
basic granola recipe, and it's a really, really
good start for anyone who, you know, is doing

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.919
it for the very first time.

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.329
And you can just change it accordingly to
your desires and needs.

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.730
All I know is I'm getting really hot in here.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.830
My oven's on and it's like a sauna in here,
woo.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.740
Another 42 minutes to go.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.740
Okay, so it's been about 10 minutes.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.740
I'm now gonna give it a stir.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.400
And off we go back in the oven.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.250
You hear that?

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.150
It's ready.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:45.080
Baring in mind, I just wanna say that -- hold
on, let me turn this off -- you don't necessarily

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.990
have to wait for the 45, the full 45 minutes,
because if your seeds getting golden brown,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.650
it's pretty much done.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.971
So just to give you a little recap: We combined
all the ingredients, put it in the oven, we

00:04:58.971 --> 00:05:03.330
checked on it periodically (quite frequently,
actually), gave it a stir.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.580
You're looking at around 45 minutes.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.580
It may be slightly over.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.780
It maybe slight under.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.530
But just keep an eye out because as soon as
it gets golden brown then it's pretty much

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.530
ready.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.650
I've now turned the oven off.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.690
I am gonna let it sit in the oven for, I don't
know, maybe like 15 minutes.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.110
If you found that it's slightly more than
golden brown, I would just leave the door

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:31.360
open a little bit, let it dry out, and it
always should be good, it should be fine.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.360
Okay.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.560
There we go: Looking lovely and golden right
there.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:45.520
So here we have it: A nice bowl of homemade
granola, courtesy of my dad.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.500
Okay, lovely.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.490
Delicious.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.030
I shouldn't speak with my mouth full, should
I?

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.530
My mom taught me better.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.250
Thank you for staying with me today.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:08.520
I hope you enjoy the granola, and let me know
how you change it up.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.169
Let me know what you do to change up your
granola!

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.849
Okay, I'll see you all next week.

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:19.029
Bye!
