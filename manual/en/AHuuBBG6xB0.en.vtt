00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.880
Hey guys.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.450
I'm Grace, this is Game On and I'm going to
be bringing you the best gaming news of the

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.450
day.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.820
First up everybody's been wondering how much
Sony intend to charge for upcoming cloud streaming

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.640
service PlayStation Now and I might be able
to tell you how much.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.610
According to an image posted on Gaikai a rental
for Uncharted 3 looks to be $5, Far Cry 3

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.539
coming in at $6 and full out buying last of
us for $50.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.750
Sony announced it at CES earlier this year
that Gaikai would power the Now system.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.820
We don't have any footage of the service but
I'm sure Sony's big boss Andrew House will

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.190
bring more news soon.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.420
This image could of course just be a mock-up
for the site, a bit of rumour and speculation,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.079
but we'll find out soon enough.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.530
Some news about Watch Dogs now.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.670
The team went live online to answer some of
your questions and chat about the game and

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.720
some big news came out that if you don't want
to play online with other players, you can

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.879
just turn multiplayer mode off.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.059
The drop-in multiplayer setting means other
players can come in and start hacking into

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.640
your hard earned cash but if you don't want
to take them on, you can just not invite them

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.640
in.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.630
Lead game designer Danny Belanger said it's
a choice and if someone is not into that they

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.340
can totally turn it off.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.860
This follows last weeks news that eight players
can roam freely in multiplayer mode.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.000
Watch Dogs comes out May 27th.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.290
And finally, Titanfall developers Respawn
Entertainment are teaming up with Playfight

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.280
the guys behind the Call of Duty live action
short Operation Kingfish to make Titanfall

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.600
its very own live action epic.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.200
A site has turned up called yourtitanisready.com
where a clock is counting down to the games

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.030
launch when a teaser trailer should come online
for everyone to check out.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.329
The site hasn't been confirmed as belonging
to either Respawn or Playfight but I guess

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.310
if it stays up long enough we'll be able to
see what the timer leads to when it reaches

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.439
its climax.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.159
Titanfall launches in North America on the
11th, Europe and Australia on the 13th and

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.159
the UK on the 14th.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.700
Will you be buying it.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.310
I definitely will and I'll be getting up a
review as soon as possible.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.789
