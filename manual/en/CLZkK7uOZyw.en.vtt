Hi! This is Rich Buccola of New York City
and today on behalf of Expert Village, I'm

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.020
going to show you how to make coconut shrimp
with orange marmalade dipping sauce. Alright,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.290
so we're back. We're going to devein our shrimp.
I know in a couple of clips instead or orange

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.000
marmalade, I might have said apricot marmalade.
Just reiterating, it is orange marmalade today.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.220
Like I said, you can use apricot. You can
use different things. I was used to always

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.660
using apricots. Today, I'm going with orange
because that's what my aunt said to do, and

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.399
I'm going to listen to her because she knows
better. Deveining our shrimp and descaling

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.430
it. Here's our beautiful shrimp. We're going
to take our small pairing knife, and what

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.190
we're going to do is just hold our shrimp
open and we're going to get in between the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.129
legs. Here's the legs. I'm going to try and
do this real easy. Just cut nice thin cuts

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:54.289
straight through the legs. Once you do that,
these come off very easy. You see it comes

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:01.679
off very easy. What I do is I save the last
part of the shell on the tail. I leave that.

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.752
Also, you want to get the vein out. See that
blue vein? Some people leave it. I don't like

00:01:06.752 --> 00:01:11.909
it. I get rid of it. A nice small easy cut,
and you see it comes right out. Just with

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.600
the point of your knife. You can just pull
it right out with your finger and you see

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.299
it comes right out. Again, we put it right
here. This is where it all goes. Your shrimp

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.800
goes here and that's it. You want me to do
another one real quick? Again, I'll show you.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:36.399
Just open it up, cut through the center. The
shell comes right off then real easy. I leave

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.200
the last part of the tail on. I come back,
I look for that. I already cut a slice, so

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.689
it pretty much comes off just nice and even.
You don't want to cut it so hard. You'll see

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:54.149
that vein comes right out. Pull it right out
and that's it. That's deveining and deshelling

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.409
your shrimp here on Expert Village. Come back.
We're going to keep making this great appetizer.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.059
Coconut shrimp.
