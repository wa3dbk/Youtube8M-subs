00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.430
hi I'm Annie I'm the kits designer for

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.810
Paper Source and today we're going to be

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.990
making simple pop-up place cards with

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.630
rubber stamping and here are some

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.969
examples of some of the place cards that

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.050
we have these we here we're using any

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.279
stamp that has some nice bold imagery so

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.650
you can use botanicals some strong

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.199
graphics or even some nice flourishes

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.019
like this one here and today we're going

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.050
to be doing our large rose rubber stamp

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.730
and we're going to be making this place

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.890
card here so what you're going to need

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.390
is the rubber stamp of your choice some

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.980
inks of your choice here I'm using two

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.030
different colors place cards again and a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.309
lot of different color varieties you're

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.350
going to need a nice sharp craft knife

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.410
and a self-healing cutting mat so right

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.329
now is I'm about to get ready to stamp I

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.059
want to make sure that I have a piece of

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.460
paper covering my cutting mat keep a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.220
nice and clean because this technique

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.840
that we're doing we're going to be doing

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.630
a little bit of bleeding off the edge

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.369
and so you want to keep your mat nice

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.229
and clean and you don't want to get ink

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.240
all over it now when I'm using two

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.860
different colors of ink in the same

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.860
color family I generally tend to like to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.780
use the lightest color first and then go

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.970
to the darkest color that way it's a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.040
little bit easier if you don't want to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.200
have to clean right away in between is

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.880
just a little bit better to use lighter

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.310
color first and then dark color so here

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.509
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.159
start with a pink and I'm going to be

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.040
rubber stamping to pink flowers first

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.140
and then the red one so I'm going to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.329
take my rubber stamp which is this rose

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.689
large rose and I'm going to lightly ink

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.659
and I'm going to go ahead and stamp to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.850
pink and one red slightly off the edge

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.570
of the place card we ink just a little

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.119
bit and so for this top one I'm going to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.640
make sure that I come off onto the fold

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.460
or just right above the fold here so I'm

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.170
going to do I'm going to rubber-stamp

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.340
about halfway or more right at the fold

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.000
line like so

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.900
and then to take any excess ink just as

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.140
a quick tip you can just go ahead and

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.510
blot off that excess ink

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.420
and then go right to your next color

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.709
again lightly stamp and I'm going to

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.320
create this little red rose here so I'm

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.790
just going to go ahead and overlap like

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.930
so so now your image is going to look

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.700
just like this and from here if you want

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.260
to make the line just a little bit more

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.840
defined so it's easier to see go ahead

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.400
and fold your place card like so so now

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.510
we're going to go ahead and open your

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.820
place card back up and with a really

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.680
sharp craft knife new blade and all

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.870
you're just going to carefully cut all

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.780
the way around your rose and so you're

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.160
going to start right at your fold line

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.540
and continue to cut and another tip with

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.540
cutting is that I never place my fingers

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.489
in front of my craft knife I always have

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.040
my hand away from the motion of the

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.670
blade so as not to accidentally cut

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.070
myself from a knife that's just slipping

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.560
and don't be afraid to like pick up your

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.640
place card turn it and just cut really

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.920
carefully in small little movements okay

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.600
so here I went from edge to edge of the

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.430
fold of the score and when you fold it

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.730
your flower remains popped up and there

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.769
you have it a simple pop-up place card

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.180
with rubber stamping treatment

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.580
