00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.840
Half Life 3, a long awaited followup to Half
Life 2, obviously.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.890
Will it finally materialize?

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.759
All reports indicate it could be on the way
from Value before you know it.

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:17.259
Plus in other tech news, Windows 8.1 goes
on pre-order and an Amazon 3D smartphone with

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.410
4 front facing cameras?

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.820
This is computing forever, I'm Gordon Freeman!

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:33.040
Let's go ahead and get started.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.650
First up is the news that Valve has trademarked
the name Half Life 3 in Europe.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.040
Although there's been no official announcement
that the game is in the works, this move certainly

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.790
suggests it's a strong possibility.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.940
On September 26th, Valve filed this trademark,
which is said to cover "computer game software"

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.330
and "downloadable computer game software via
a global computer network and wireless devices".

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.040
Sounds like a real game to me.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.190
Additionally, the production seems pretty
much confirmed following the accidental leaking

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.140
of Valve's staff lists database to the public,
which is usually used to track bugs.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.360
The database revealed the development groups
that have been assigned to work on Half Life

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.360
3.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.480
The question is, when will the game be released,
surely 2014 would be too soon, perhaps 2015

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:25.200
and maybe then it could be a tie in to the
proposed Half Life movie.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.060
Next up, Microsoft are now accepting pre-orders
for their new OS Windows 8.1, this is basically

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.230
a service pack update for Windows 8, which
is free to those users already running that

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.390
operating system.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.870
Both Windows 8.1 and 8.1 Pro will set you
back $119 and $199 respectively.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.520
The new features and fixes expected in this
new release include Internet Explorer 11,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.880
greater personalization abilities, built-in
Bing search, built-in apps and SkyDrive cloud

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.880
connectivity.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.700
The OS is due to launch worldwide on October
18th.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.640
In other news, reports of Amazon's rumored
smartphone have circled the internet merry-go-round

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.130
on and off for many a month.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.009
Well according to Tech Crunch, Amazon are
in fact working on 2 handsets, the most powerful

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.099
of the two is said to feature an innovative
3D interface that tracks the user's head movements

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.290
and displays onscreen 3D effects by way of
four front facing cameras.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.180
Of course as with all non-glasses-based 3D
systems, only the primary user of the phone

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.290
would be able to see the effects properly.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.959
The second handset is sans 3D and will likely
be a mid-range market device.

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.349
It's suggested both smartphones won't see
shelves until 2014.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.159
And finally guys I will leave you with today's
tech question, and it's pretty simple: What

00:02:42.159 --> 00:03:14.849
is your smartphone?
