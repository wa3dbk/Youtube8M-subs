00:00:04.076 --> 00:00:06.688
Female Player's Right Defending Posture

00:00:07.199 --> 00:00:08.250
Key Points

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.379
The body should be facing the shuttle cock

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.326
The end of the racket should be pointing the shuttle cock

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:15.809
Ready go

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:18.528
stop don't move stay

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:20.051
stay

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.350
put racket little lower

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.139
yes because its coming down

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:34.597
thats very good because you are ready and accurately moving posture

00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:37.353
in this way thats backhand

00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:38.611
if shuttle comes here

00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:40.704
you can use forehand

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:44.244
but many players they do that way, see

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.817
so they are ready for forehand

00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:49.600
and then shuttle comes there difficult

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.310
ok ready

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:59.795

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:02.055

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:08.014

00:01:21.673 --> 00:01:22.149

backhand and kill

00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:09.315

00:02:12.142 --> 00:02:12.546

always face the shuttle cock and be ready

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.246
for forehand and backhand both side 50% and 50%

00:02:47.246 --> 00:02:49.983
rather than ready for one side only

00:02:49.983 --> 00:02:53.704
and hope for shuttlecock to come there

00:02:54.027 --> 00:02:58.000
