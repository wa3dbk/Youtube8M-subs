Astronomers have used the Hubble Space Telescope to forecast a future cosmic pile up: 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.500
the titanic collision of the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.500
in about four billion years time.

Hubblecast Episode 55: Crash of the Titans

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Presented by Dr J, aka Dr Joe Liske

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.500
The Andromeda Galaxy, some 2.2 million light-years away, 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.500
is the closest spiral galaxy to our home, the Milky Way. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
For around a century, astronomers have known that it's moving towards us,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.500
but whether or not the two galaxies would actually collide, 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.500
or simply fly past each other, remained unclear.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.500
Now, a team of astronomers has used the Hubble Space Telescope to shed light on this question, 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.000
by looking at the motion of stars in the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.000
We wanted to figure out how Andromeda was moving through space. 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.500
So in order to do that we measured the location of the Andromeda stars 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.500
relative to the background galaxies. 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.500
In 2002 they were in one place, and in 2010 they were in a slightly different place.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.700
And that allowed us to measure the motion over a period of eight years.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.500
The motion is actually incredibly subtle, and not obvious to the human eye, 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.000
even when looking at Hubble’s sharp images. 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.500
However, sophisticated image analysis revealed tiny movements

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.000
that the scientists were able to project into the future.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Based on these findings, it is finally possible to show 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.700
what will happen to the Milky Way over the next eight billion years,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.850
as the galaxies drift closer,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.300
and then collide 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.000
and gradually merge into a single, larger, elliptical galaxy with reddish stars. 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.000
And yet the Solar System should in fact survive this huge crash.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The reason we think that our Solar System will not be much affected by this collision 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.000
between the Milky Way and Andromeda is that galaxies are actually mostly empty space. 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.500
Even though our galaxy, as well as the Andromeda Galaxy, 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.000
has a hundred billion stars in it, they are very far apart.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.500
So if two galaxies actually collide with each other, 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.500
the stars basically pass right between each other 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.500
and the chance of two stars directly hitting each other is really, really small.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.500
So the likelihood that our Solar System will be directly impacted by another star, 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.000
for example, in Andromeda as we collide with it is really, really small.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.000
Well, if life is still present on Earth when this happens, the changes in the sky will be quite spectacular.  

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.500
Now they will be very very slow because the timescales on the scales of galaxies in the Universe 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.000
are very very long.  

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.500
So you have to think, millions of years but even then over these timescales over millions of years, 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.500
people will see big changes. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.500
If we wait a few billion years, Andromeda will be huge on the sky.  

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.000
It will be as big as our Milky Way because we’ll be very close to it.  

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.500
And then later, when the galaxies merge, 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.000
the merged remnant of the Milky Way Galaxy and Andromeda 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
will look more like an elliptical galaxy and we’ll be sitting right in it.  

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.000
So the view of the Milky Way on the night sky will be completely gone and

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.700
this band of light will be replaced by a more spheroidal distribution of light.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.500
And so, the Sun, born in the Milky Way almost 5 billion years ago 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.500
will end its life in a new orbit, as part of a new galaxy.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.829
