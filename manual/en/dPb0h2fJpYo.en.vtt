00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.861
- Good morning clan, welcome to Sunday,

00:00:02.861 --> 00:00:04.115
we're here at Mimi and Papa's house

00:00:04.115 --> 00:00:05.090
because we all stayed the night,

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.365
responsible adults, we
do that sort of thing,

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:08.875
and the boys are wasting no time,

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.453
they're already in the pool,

00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:12.241
Bryce, Mason, Ryan,

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:14.099
Ryan you going on the diving board dude?

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.117
You gonna jump?

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.393
Show 'em how you do it.
Show 'em how you do it.

00:00:19.393 --> 00:00:20.763
(splash)

00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:22.295
Yeah! That's right, that's right.

00:00:22.295 --> 00:00:24.315
It is Sunday, we have no plans,

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:25.662
we have no idea what we're doing today.

00:00:25.662 --> 00:00:26.846
Everyone's kind of just
chilling right now,

00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:28.820
catching up, talking, reminiscing,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.934
all that sort of thing.

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:32.488
At some point we have to go pick up Sierra

00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:35.205
from her sleepover, which
is kind of on the way,

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:37.480
actually not really, we
actually have to go a mile,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.616
two miles out of our way to pick her up.

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:41.056
But it's all worth it, it's all good.

00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:42.681
She had a good time I'm sure

00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:44.191
and we'll hear all about that later.

00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:47.662
But for now, we're gonna eat
some cold pizza and hydrate.

00:00:49.176 --> 00:00:50.686
Well guys, we made our way back home,

00:00:50.686 --> 00:00:53.820
as per usual, Tiffany is taking a nap,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.747
Sierra's in her room on her iPad,

00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:57.768
and of course me and Bryce
are gonna play some "Destiny."

00:00:57.768 --> 00:01:01.041
Nice and slow, laid back day.

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:02.899
Look who woke up from her nap!

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:03.990
(mumbles)

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.407
You look very well rested.

00:01:05.407 --> 00:01:07.589
- I look a little bored.

00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:09.238
- [Clintus] You look a
little bored? (laughs)

00:01:09.238 --> 00:01:10.561
Picking stuff off the couch.

00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:11.722
(mumbles)

00:01:11.722 --> 00:01:13.673
And baby's just chilling?

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:17.504
She got her star and her bandana back on?

00:01:17.504 --> 00:01:18.920
My star, my star!

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.960
Sierra's in here, she has a friend, hello.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.121
- Hi.

00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:25.723
- [Clintus] Did you get a new iPad?

00:01:25.723 --> 00:01:27.477
- No, it's just out of the case.

00:01:27.477 --> 00:01:28.452
- [Clintus] It's out of the case.

00:01:28.452 --> 00:01:29.311
Ah, I see, I see.

00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:31.053
What are you girls up to?

00:01:31.053 --> 00:01:33.398
- Playing a new game, "BlockCraft."

00:01:33.398 --> 00:01:35.255
It's like "Minecraft," she said,

00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:36.997
with like outlines of
what to build and stuff.

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:38.134
- [Clintus] Very cool.

00:01:38.134 --> 00:01:40.642
And Bryce took off to Brayden's house

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:44.102
to go play over there, level
up his "Destiny" character,

00:01:44.102 --> 00:01:45.263
play some Nerf guns, you know,

00:01:45.263 --> 00:01:47.143
all the stuff that boys like to do.

00:01:47.143 --> 00:01:52.143
- So Tati is here still,
and we are, we were drawing,

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:54.573
and this is our results.

00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:56.036
We were drawing Bob the Minion.

00:01:56.036 --> 00:01:59.712
So here's mine, closer
look, here's Tati's,

00:02:02.397 --> 00:02:04.759
and for the eyes, Bob has
two different colored eyes,

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.592
this one's, if you look really
close you can kind of see

00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:08.799
they're different colors.

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.332
For that one we used a bronze Sharpie

00:02:10.332 --> 00:02:12.096
and for that one we used a gold Sharpie.

00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:15.068
Same for hers.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.647
- Well guys, that's gonna
do it for us tonight,

00:02:16.647 --> 00:02:20.153
another uneventful day,
sorry, it is what it is,

00:02:20.153 --> 00:02:23.125
at this age I think things
are gonna start to slow down

00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:26.074
with the kids, between
playing with their friends,

00:02:26.074 --> 00:02:29.650
and playing with their
toys, and what they do,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.017
unless we're up and out
and out doing something,

00:02:33.017 --> 00:02:35.919
the vlogs are kinda like eh,

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.287
but hey, there's always tomorrow, right?

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:39.100
Another day.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.213
But I thought I'd end
today's vlog with something

00:02:41.213 --> 00:02:44.789
I used to do, it's been a long
time since I've done this,

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.484
and someone reminded me of it yesterday,

00:02:46.484 --> 00:02:48.364
and I was like, you know what,

00:02:48.364 --> 00:02:49.711
I'm gonna do that in tomorrow's vlog.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.128
One of the things I used to do,

00:02:51.128 --> 00:02:52.126
for those of you who are new,

00:02:52.126 --> 00:02:55.795
is I would give shoutouts
to our most engaged users.

00:02:55.795 --> 00:02:58.511
And so, if you have a YouTube channel,

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:03.511
youtube.com/audience gives
you a look of all your fans,

00:03:04.757 --> 00:03:07.172
and you can sort it by a
couple of different ways,

00:03:07.172 --> 00:03:11.607
but I love looking at the
most, sorting it by engagement.

00:03:11.607 --> 00:03:15.299
These are the most engaged
users, as of right now,

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.854
as of today, and it updates every day.

00:03:16.854 --> 00:03:18.712
So the more you thumbs-up,
the more you comment,

00:03:18.712 --> 00:03:20.476
the more you share,
the more you add videos

00:03:20.476 --> 00:03:23.913
to your favorites, it updates the page.

00:03:23.913 --> 00:03:25.910
So, I'm gonna give a shoutout to

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.790
our most engaged users as of right now.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.759
And that is, A Whiting,
bad4daze, TheWESMan Production,

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.106
I think that's what that says,

00:03:34.106 --> 00:03:37.960
LpsKandy Studios, Killian
OConnell, Maddy Gaul,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.960
vampvivid, Dylan DeThomas,
Noah Maria, Wazzup,

00:03:44.044 --> 00:03:49.044
PS PRODUCTIONS, Aaron
Curtin MX, sledrideing114,

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:51.659
there you go.

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.981
A lot of you guys ask for
shoutouts on a regular basis,

00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:56.419
and my rule has always been
that I do not give shoutouts to

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.461
just anyone who asks,
especially if you ask,

00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:00.761
I don't give shoutouts.

00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:04.244
Shoutouts are earned either
because you did something cool,

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.753
you did something that
caught my attention,

00:04:05.753 --> 00:04:09.143
you're super engaged, I retweet
people's tweets when they

00:04:09.143 --> 00:04:13.485
take screenshots and snapshots,
and make cool little artwork

00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:16.365
and whatnot, I post them on
Facebook, all that stuff.

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:18.826
So basically you earn a
shoutout, that's how it works,

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:22.007
and so these people
here are super engaged,

00:04:22.007 --> 00:04:24.863
they like our videos, they
comment on our videos,

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:26.395
and I'm not saying that you don't,

00:04:26.395 --> 00:04:29.181
these people just must do
it more frequently, I guess,

00:04:29.181 --> 00:04:30.946
because YouTube is saying that these

00:04:30.946 --> 00:04:31.898
are the most engaged users.

00:04:31.898 --> 00:04:33.105
I have no control over it.

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:35.218
But all of you that I mentioned earlier,

00:04:35.218 --> 00:04:36.611
thank you so much, I appreciate it,

00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:38.748
if you'd like to be an engaged user,

00:04:38.748 --> 00:04:40.043
be sure you hit that thumbs up button,

00:04:40.043 --> 00:04:42.272
leave a comment down
below, share the video

00:04:42.272 --> 00:04:45.012
on Twitter, Facebook, wherever you can,

00:04:45.012 --> 00:04:48.309
and it'll all get aggregated
and you never know,

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:50.886
you might get a shoutout
as an engaged user,

00:04:50.886 --> 00:04:52.395
because I think I might
start doing this again,

00:04:52.395 --> 00:04:54.346
not every day, not
every day, but you know,

00:04:54.346 --> 00:04:55.762
maybe a couple times a week.

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:57.341
Oh my gosh, I almost
forgot to tell you guys.

00:04:57.341 --> 00:05:00.638
Big surprise tomorrow,
big, big surprise tomorrow.

00:05:00.638 --> 00:05:03.819
Stay tuned, be sure you're
watching my Snapchat,

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:05.189
be sure you're watching Twitter,

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:06.977
because I'm gonna be
dropping little hints,

00:05:06.977 --> 00:05:10.135
and then I'm gonna make a big
announcement of what this is

00:05:10.135 --> 00:05:12.735
tomorrow, and then you'll
see it in tomorrow's vlog.

00:05:12.735 --> 00:05:14.384
So, if you're following
me on social media,

00:05:14.384 --> 00:05:16.752
you'll get a teaser and a hint,

00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:18.099
and you'll know what the surprise is

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.190
before the vlog comes out,

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.603
because that's just kinda how
it works, but so, so excited,

00:05:22.603 --> 00:05:24.971
super excited, it's huge, it's amazing,

00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:27.270
so stay tuned for that tomorrow,

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.035
tap the "i" in the sky for
the last three years' videos,

00:05:29.035 --> 00:05:30.838
and we'll see you then. Vlog on.
