00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.909
MARK BLOCKER: Okay. In this segment, we're
going to cover compressing the caliper. And

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:11.490
what I'm referring to is the caliper sitting
under--as your brake pads are wearing down,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.110
this caliper piston has to keep traveling
out further and further. And when you let

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.530
off the brake, the caliper doesn't--the piston
doesn't come back in. It stays roughly right

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.560
there. It just doesn't have pressure against
it. And that ensures that the brake pads are

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.630
right there tight so you get a good swift,
clean braking action every time you apply

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.910
the brakes. But as the brake pads wear down
and the caliper extends--the piston extends

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.190
further and further outward, in order to have
room for the new pads, we need to compress

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.020
this piston back into the caliper. I like
to use just a large pair of pliers. You can

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.100
use a C-clamp; that works real well. A good
way to compress it is if you take one of the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.890
old pads--and we'll just lay it in there across
the piston. And that gives a large surface

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.109
to push against and it also helps ensure that
the pressure we're using to push it is applied

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.130
evenly across the piston so the piston doesn't
want to bind, they want to compress it back

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.729
in. And essentially, what we're going to do
when we compress this in, we're pushing the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.930
fluid back through the brake line and back
into the master cylinder. Now, a lot of times,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.070
when you have your car service and people
will be checking various items, they'll check

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.090
that brake fluid and they'll say, "Oh, it's
a little bit low." They'll add brake fluid.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.609
If that's the case, and right now, your brake
master cylinder reservoir is full. When you

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:35.450
compress this, that brake fluid is going to
come out of the top of the vent--on the breather

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.990
cap for the master cylinder and you'll see
it dripping down on the floor. I'm making

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.950
you aware of this so if you see this happening,
you'll know why it happened and understand.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.700
And it's just 'cause of the fact that somebody's
topped off your master cylinder. If your master

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.179
cylinder level is low but not below the add
line, never add break fluid. That's usually

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.640
just an indication that your brake pads are
getting worn and the pistons have travelled

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.890
outward and your brake fluid isn't necessarily
leaking, it's being held down here in the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:13.650
caliper right now instead of the reservoir.
So, I'll just get my pliers set up to adjust

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.599
for a--large enough to get around the caliper
itself in the back of the--from the back of

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.230
the caliper to the front where the piston
is and have enough room for a brake pad. Just

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:38.459
lay the old brake pad in there, and then I'm
just going to apply a gentle, even force and

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:49.790
watch the piston travel backwards. I'm compressing
it into the caliper.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.000
You want to just squeeze it until it goes
all the way down and it'll stop there and

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.330
you want to make sure it goes all the way
in. And then remove your brake pad and you'll

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.480
inspect to make sure that that rubber seal
that came out. That was a dust seal that kept

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.920
dirt and contaminants away from the piston,
is all seated in there correctly and nothing's

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.910
ripped or torn. You might want to take a little
bit of your brake clean and a rag. And this

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.640
time, you'd wipe out any excess dirt or dust.
Check and make sure that you're caliper mounting

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.819
pivot slides freely. This is where the bolt
is and this is the pivot point here. The pivot

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.510
point doesn't move. It's got a large boot
on it. You want to inspect it. See it's not

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.890
torn or contains grease inside. Now, we've
got the caliper compressed. We know all the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.459
caliper functions are working correctly. We'll
go ahead and set it aside. Our next segment,

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.880
we're going to cover installing the caliper
mounting bracket and then we'll install the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.999
new pads into it.
