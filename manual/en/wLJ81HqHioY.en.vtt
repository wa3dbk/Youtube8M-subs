This is part two of the video brought to you
by GetTeachingJob.com.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.469
For part one, one please click the red link
here.

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.539
Well that certainly worked, you did get a
fair number of interviews.

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.430
Were there any questions at the interview
that kept cropping up?

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.660
Can you recall any questions that were asked
fairly commonly?

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.370
Yeah, a number of them seem to keep cropping
up.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.950
I’ve got a list here, are you ready?

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.610
First, what are your greatest strengths and
weaknesses?

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.510
What did you struggle with during student
teaching?

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.809
What would your cooperating teachers say about
you?

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.539
What questions do you have for us?

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.629
What is your classroom management plan?

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.499
What will be your policy on homework?

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:48.659
How will you assess your students?

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.319
How will you include reading and writing in
your class?

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:56.249
How will you handle a student with an IEP?

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:59.219
How do you motivate students?

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.999
What sports or clubs would you be willing
to sponsor?

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.210
How will you differentiate instruction?

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.760
How will you prepare your students for the
state tests?

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.120
Tell us about a success you had, and a time
when you failed.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.800
Describe a lesson or unit that went well.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.530
The last one, what would we see if we walked
in your classroom?

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.530
Got that?

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.900
I did notice that in middle school interviews,
there were lots of questions on teaming, middle

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.830
school philosophy, and integrating other subject
areas.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.310
In high school interviews, I noticed there
were more questions on lessons, getting and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.700
keeping students interested, preparing for
state tests, questions on content as far as

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.060
what students liked best.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.220
That’s great information.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.520
I took notes.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.190
I’m sure it’ll help many others.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.630
Do you believe in asking questions at the
end of your interview?

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.630
Always!

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.630
Always.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.920
Always have thoughtful questions at the end
of the interview.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.230
I think it’s incredibly important because
it shows you’re interested in that district.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.560
Off the top of my head, here are some of the
questions I’ve asked.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.750
What are you the most proud of about your
school?

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.590
How many students are there in each class?

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.100
What kind of facilities, training and technology
are available?

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.850
Do the regular education teachers work closely
with the special education teachers?

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.820
What mentoring system do you have for first
year teachers?

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.230
And so on.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.030
Listen out during the interview, and if they
bring up anything special about their school,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.440
ask them more about it.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.470
This shows you’re interested in them.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.060
At the very end of the interview I’d ask
what the next step was and when I should hear

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.090
something.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.290
If you don’t ask questions, they might get
the impression you really don’t care where

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.490
you work.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.290
They might think your lack of curiosity means
you’re just thinking “give me a job”

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.470
and that you feel their school is interchangeable
with any other.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.220
They know you are looking elsewhere, but try
to act as if you have standards and let them

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.870
know what you like about them.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.160
That’s a great point.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.680
It’s nice to be liked.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.810
But, you know what, many candidates aren’t
able to ask questions at the end because they

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.650
just haven’t landed interviews in the first
place.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.040
That must be quite frustrating.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.070
Do you have any advice for qualified candidates
who haven’t gotten calls for interviews?

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.870
Sure, I’ve got some ideas on things to do
here.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.290
First, make sure the principal of every school
you are interested in has a copy of your resume,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.209
hand-delivered or mailed directly.

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.300
Next, have others check your cover letter
and resume.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.790
You’ve labored over it and you're just too
close to it.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.970
Some parts of it will make sense to you but
will confuse others, who won't get the point.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.930
You need help from others to find these blind
spots.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.490
Another tip is to ask friends or family to
think they're a principal, to put themselves

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.160
in the shoes of the principal.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.220
And have them read the resume from the perspective
of the principal, asking the question “is

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.630
the candidate letting me know why I should
consider him or her?”

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.471
Just because you have the correct certification,
or went to school there, or need a job, or

00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:47.160
did your student teaching there - so what?

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.860
And I'm not wanting to be mean by saying this.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.500
I just want to emphasize that the principal
is looking for what you can bring to the school.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.900
Anothing thing, apply everywhere in your "driving
area".

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.070
Only you know how far that is.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.430
And if you can move, that opens up greater
possibilities.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.880
Apply everywhere - online, in the paper, talk
to people.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.370
I also applied to charter schools and private
schools.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.150
They don't pay as much, but they do provide
experience.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.580
And if you find yourself in a glutted field,
find something to set you apart.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.320
Do some volunteer work, start working on another
certification, take a job as an aide or a

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.320
substitute.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.470
And let them know in your cover letter that
you're willing to be flexible.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.130
And look, if what you are doing isn't working,
change tactics!

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.410
Ask for advice and take some of it.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.190
Ask other teachers.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.220
Call a local principal and ask for ten minutes
of their time.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.910
Show them your resume and cover letter and
ask if they can give you advice.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.940
A last point - keep on trying.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.000
Don't get bitter.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.500
No one is "owed" a job because they're qualified.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.590
Many graduate from college and can't find
work in their chosen field right away.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.030
Make a contingency plan to get you through.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.460
Many find permanent positions through long-term
sub work.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.870
I can see you’ve brought your life experience
and sales training into the hunt for a teaching

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.870
job!

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.340
Do you have any other interview tips that
you think might help?

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.639
Yes, I've got lots of ideas here that can
help.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.350
