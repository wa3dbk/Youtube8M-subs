I'm Jackie M and I have this thing called
Sambal Belacan which is a condiment, a chilli

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.970
sauce that everybody who tries just
absolutely loves, they want the recipe, they

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.450
want to buy it from me by the tub. Let me
show you how quick and easy it is to whip

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.970
this up yourself at home.
I'm just going to show you what sort of ingredients

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.970
I use in MY own sambal belacan, and as usual,
I'm going to cheat and use some fried shallots

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.159
that I soak in some water to soften them up
a little bit, and I've got some oil - here

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:40.159
I'm using a red palm fruit oil so it gives
a nice orange-y colour to the end product.

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.079
I've got some chicken stock granules - you
don't have to use that, you can use chicken

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.159
stock cubes if you have trouble finding chicken
stock granules; I've got some fish sauce,

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:55.409
and some belacan powder, which is a dried
shrimp paste powder - you can of course, use

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:01.309
a shrimp paste block and just slice it up
and toast it in the oven or under a grill

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.939
until it crumbles, or you can just use a Thai
shrimp paste out of a jar - they work pretty

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.659
similarly.
I've got some crushed chillies over here...let's

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:17.659
get started; I'm just going to throw all this
in together. So I'm just going to mix all

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.119
this in together; just make sure you mix it
in quite well.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.570
In the meantime I'm going to heat up some
oil in the frying pan and we're going to fry

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.659
this up. Let's go. We're going to need a fair
bit of oil - the end product should have a

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.659
nice layer of oil over the top. And this is
the mixture I've got over here - I'm going

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.729
to pour this in slowly and just add sugar.
So I've got everything in there and I just

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.109
need to fry this up until it's nice and aromatic;
it shouldn't take too long at all. We're going

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:07.049
to bring this to a boil, and just cook it
until it thickens up a little bit. And this

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.580
is something that you can use with all your
Asian dishes, really, as a side with your

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.480
noodles or with your rice dish. Okay, so we've
been cooking this for 5 minutes, and there

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.890
you go, as you can see it's thickened up quite
nicely, but you don't want it too dry either.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.890
I'm just going to turn off the heat, and put
some in a little bowl so you can see what

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.490
it looks like,and of course, this keeps really,
really well - you can just bottle it and keep

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.890
it in your refrigerator for at least 6 weeks
and you'll have sambal belacan to serve with

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.140
your meal anytime you want.
