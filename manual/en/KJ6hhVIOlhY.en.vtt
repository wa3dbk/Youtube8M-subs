00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
There are so many talented people in Mexico.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.627
If we put them together,
the result is even better.

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:15.483
Our idea is to approach talents with different passions.

00:00:15.603 --> 00:00:18.297
Get them know each other and
bring out the best in them.

00:00:28.306 --> 00:00:29.393
Mercado Roma.

00:00:29.513 --> 00:00:32.528
A new place in one of the
hottest districts in Mexico City.

00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:36.845
A space where food, design
and traditions converge.

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:44.167
Mercado Roma started
a year and a half ago.

00:00:44.287 --> 00:00:52.397
A space where we bring and
display high-quality products.

00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:56.815
People devoted to their work.

00:00:56.935 --> 00:01:00.077
We want to bring out the best in them.

00:01:02.714 --> 00:01:07.927
We try to organise the market as efficiently as possible...

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:13.876
...to make sure that the shopping area has lots of movement.

00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:18.881
To ensure exchange between the shop owner and the client.

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:25.524
The food area is more relaxed.

00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:31.944
You can eat here and get to know the person sitting next to you.

00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:38.563
We offer variety.

00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:41.257
We offer organic chicken, for example.

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:43.381
Vegan and gluten-free products.

00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:47.168
Different types of meat.

00:01:47.288 --> 00:01:51.087
A gourmet section.

00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:53.594
Restaurants.

00:01:53.714 --> 00:02:00.298
On the incredible terrace you'll find our biergarten.

00:02:00.418 --> 00:02:03.764
Interesting ideas from creative people.
