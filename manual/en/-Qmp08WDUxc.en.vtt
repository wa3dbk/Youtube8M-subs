00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.650
bjbjVwVw HARI SREENIVASAN: Wall Street had
its worst day of the year, amid worries about

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.670
continuing divided government in Washington
and bad news out of Europe.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.820
The Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly
313 points to close at 12,932.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.590
The Nasdaq fell 74 points to close at 2,937.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.040
For more on what happened, I spoke earlier
with economist Hugh Johnson, who runs his

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.890
own investment services company in Albany,
New York.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.070
So, Mr. Johnson, tell me, how do we distribute
the weight of what's pulling the market down?

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.269
Is it the fears in Europe?

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.160
Is it the fears about the fiscal cliff?

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.570
HUGH JOHNSON, Johnson Illington Advisors:
It's hard to tell which is more important.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.800
They're both very important.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.420
And you know, today sort of dramatized both.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.560
The European Union formally reduced its forecast
for what's going to happen to the European

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.210
Union, their economy, in 2013, and they reduced
it very, very sharply.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.500
That's very bad news.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.550
It's particularly bad news for any U.S. company
that's doing business with Europe or selling

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.140
things to Europe.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.380
Obviously, their revenues and their earnings
are going to suffer from that.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.260
So that's a big part of it.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.670
And the other part of it is the concerns,
the ongoing concerns about the fiscal cliff,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.040
meaning the automatic increase in taxes and
spending cuts that are going to occur at the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.401
federal government left at the end of this
year, unless something is done about it.

00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:27.650
And the belief is that, you know, with things
being sort of unchanged in Washington, Obama

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.090
winning, the Republicans still controlling
the House of Representatives, the Democrats

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.870
controlling the Senate, that it's business
as usual, and that we will have trouble avoiding

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.190
that fiscal cliff at the end of the year.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.340
That might mean bad things for the U.S. economy.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.770
So I think those are both very significant
concerns, and weighed on investors today,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.070
and they obviously responded by selling stocks.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.070
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.060
Also, briefly, we heard late today that Greece
passed its austerity measures through their

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.060
parliament.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.270
Is that likely to give the markets a bounce?

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.150
HUGH JOHNSON: Yes, I think you're going to
get a bounce and I think that that certainly

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.160
is going to help give it a little bit of a
bounce.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.049
I'm a little surprised at the austerity measures.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.989
There are a lot of unsettled people in Greece.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.340
The economy of Greece is clearly suffering
from the austerity measures that have been

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.989
imposed on Greece, an economy that's in a
recession.

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:18.989
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.049
HUGH JOHNSON: I think those same kind of concerns
are about the U.S. imposing fiscal restraint

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.599
in the form of higher taxes and less spending
on our economy.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.889
But I think you will get a little bit of a
bounce tomorrow, yes.

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.310
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Hugh Johnson,
thanks for your time.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.090
A new storm threatened the Northeast today
with wind, water and snow.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.480
Its arrival came just over a week after Hurricane
Sandy battered the region.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.439
Police cars in New York City patrolled low-lying
neighborhoods, urging people to evacuate again.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:53.349
The approaching nor'easter brought a wintry
mix of cold and snow and possibly minor flooding

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.840
in already damaged coastal areas.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.209
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg: MAYOR MICHAEL
BLOOMBERG, I-New York: We haven't and won't

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.540
order the kind of large-scale evacuation that
we did in advance of Hurricane Sandy, but

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.650
if you are experiencing significant flooding
during Sandy, you should consider taking shelter

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.059
with friends and family at a safer spot or
using one of the city's storm shelters.

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:18.829
HARI SREENIVASAN: In New Jersey, thousands
of storm-weary people braced for their brush

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.609
with the new storm, even as cleanup efforts
continued from Sandy.

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.420
Governor Chris Christie suggested it was a
little like the biblical plagues.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.420
GOV.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.870
CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J.: When I finally got
that final kind of forecast that I got last

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.129
night, I said I'm waiting for the locusts
and pestilence next.

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.340
(LAUGHTER) HARI SREENIVASAN: The storm could
also bring wind gusts of 65 miles an hour,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.549
bedeviling efforts to restore power to more
than 600,000 customers still in the dark in

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.739
New Jersey and New York.

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.230
CHRIS CHRISTIE: We may take a setback the
next 24 hours.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.799
You need to be prepared for that.

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.309
I'm prepared for that.

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.120
I hate setbacks.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.340
I don't tolerate them usually very well, but
this one, I can't control.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.299
The weather is what it is, and we're going
to have to deal with it.

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.469
HARI SREENIVASAN: At regional airports, a
new round of "canceled" notices went up, as

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:12.430
major airlines scrapped hundreds of flights
into and out of the New York City region.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.639
And all construction in the city was halted,
after Sandy left a crane dangling from a Manhattan

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.259
high-rise last week.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.810
The manned behind an anti-Muslim film that
triggered violence in the Middle East now

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.169
faces one year in federal prison.

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.880
Mark Basseley Youssef was sentenced today
in Los Angeles for violating probation on

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.020
an old bank fraud convention.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.200
The case is not related to the film "Innocence
of Muslims," which portrayed the Prophet Mohammed

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.629
as a fraud and a womanizer.

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:43.409
Diplomatic efforts to end the civil war in
Syria entered a new phase today, hours after

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.560
news of President Obama's reelection flashed
around the world.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.050
British officials announced they will begin
dealing directly with Syrian rebel leaders,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.270
and they urged the U.S. to join them.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.139
And Turkey confirmed it's in talks with NATO
allies, including the U.S., to create a safe

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.450
zone inside Syria.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.560
One plan would deploy Patriot missiles just
inside Turkey to protect civilians inside

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.690
the safe zone.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.690
Those are some of the day's major stories.
