00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.610
Hi, my name is Dan Delavan, I am the owner/operator
of Plaza Cutlery in Costa Mesa, California.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.480
We have a great selection.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.409
We also have a website plazacutlery.com.

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.890
And today, we are going to be talking about
knives.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.270
The main brands in the better quality switch
blades are Benchmade, Spyderco, Pro-Tech.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.150
There are other companies that make them too.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.880
But these companies pretty much specialize
in them and they do a lot of military contracts

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.640
and law enforcement contracts.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.460
This is Benchmade, these three right here,
and this is Pro-Tech.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.590
All of them are American made also, except
for Spyderco.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.820
But I believe that all of their switchblades
are made here in the United States.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.969
You do not want to buy a foreign made one.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.069
There are a lot of restrictions on bringing
them into the United States.

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:54.269
So you just want to look at the quality.

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:55.719
There's no hang ups.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.379
Some of them the locks can stick and get in
the way.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.390
You want it very smooth and the blade good
and firm, you do not want a bunch of play.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.640
Make sure the lock does not hang at all when
you open and close it.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.910
And then it should have a safety.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.030
Some companies do not, like for example Pro-Tech,
they have a very deep release on theirs.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.660
Again if you are going to carry it, you want
to make sure you have nothing else in your

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.400
pocket, you could accidentally depress that
button and pop it out.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:32.150
Most of your better quality switchblades are
going to be made of 1504cm S30V, which is

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.220
now being changed to S35V, and some of the
different tool skills.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.080
So as long as you go with the major company
you will not have a problem.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.780
They can range from around 150 up.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.500
With the internet there are all different
prices out there.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.830
But Pro-Tech, with there small California
automatics, because that is primarily all

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.390
that we carry from them, they start at around
140 or so, 135, and go on up.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.690
From there, you get into some of the more
fancy ones and the Damascus, you know, 500

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.690
or so.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.460
You can get into some of your custom and hand-made
ones, up into a few thousand dollars.
