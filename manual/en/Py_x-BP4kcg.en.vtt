00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.110
To hula hoop longer you need to learn certain
techniques for keeping the hoop up when it

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.940
starts to fall.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.640
So start feet hip distance apart, one foot
slightly in front of the other, knees nice

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.640
and soft, shifting your weight from one foot
to the other.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.000
I like to think about pressing forward with
my left hip to keep the hoop going.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.290
So starting with it on your waist.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.370
Now if this is really hard for you and the
hoop starts to fall right away, the technique

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.730
for bringing it back up is that you bend your
knees so your spine is nice and straight,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.570
straight down into the hoop, and then start
pushing really hard and quickly with that

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.030
left hip to get the hoop to come back up,
and then stand back up.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.089
So I'll demonstrate that now.

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.539
You're around your waist.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.999
Hoop starts to fall.

00:00:58.999 --> 00:00:59.999
Bend down.

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:01.899
Hip, hip, hip to bring it back up.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:02.999
Couple more times.

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:04.159
Hoop's falling.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.900
Hip, hip, hip.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.270
Notice how my spine stays nice and straight?

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.810
I'm not bending over.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.049
Hip, hip, hip.

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.860
And let's say I were to bend over to try and
get the hoop to come back up, and this would

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.840
start to happen, and I've totally lost my
horizontal waist hooping.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.710
One thing also to consider, if the hoop continues
to fall, even though you're trying these techniques

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.220
and practicing a lot, is that you may be using
a hoop that is too small or too light for

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.869
you.

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.159
The diameter of your hoop for a beginner should
be at least or almost to the height of your

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.630
belly button from the floor.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.420
This is a very good size for starting.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.390
I also suggest using a hoop that has a nice
weight to it.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.420
No heavier than two pounds, but around the
one pound range is a good starting weight.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.729
So if you notice that your hoop is very light
and very small, that is probably the main

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.670
problem that you're having.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.840
So keep that in mind when trying.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.989
I'll demonstrate this one more time to hoop
longer.

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.980
Then it falls, bending down, picking it back
up with your hip.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.830
And that is how you hula hoop longer.
