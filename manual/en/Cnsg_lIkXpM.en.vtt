00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.250
Modern Sonic: I can't believe I'm actually meeting myself!

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.250
Classic Tails: So, I think I've figured it out!

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.000
Modern Tails: Yeah! I think I've figured it out, too!

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
Classic Tails: There's doubles of us...

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.500
Modern Tails: ...and the enemies and places from our past, which means...

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.250
Classic Tails and Modern Tails: ...we're traveling through time and space!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.500
Modern Sonic: How did this happen?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.750
Modern Tails: I think it has to do with that large "thing" that just abducted Eggman.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
Classic Tails: I think that was that same "thing" that abducted your friends.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.750
Uh... I mean OUR friends.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, my head hurts...

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.750
Modern Tails: There it is again!

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.500
Classic Tails: It disappeared!

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.000
Modern Sonic: All right! We have to hurry and find that "thing!"

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.000
Cream: Thank you very much, Mr. Sonic!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We were so scared, but I thank you for saving us!
