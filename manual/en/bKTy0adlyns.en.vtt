Hi! I am Drew Finn here for Expert Village.com.
We are going to discuss how to cut down a

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.540
tree safely today. This video is brought to
you by Black Dog Video. You can visit it on

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.039
blackdogvideo.biz. These are the tools we
are going to be using to cut down the tree.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.929
Obviously a chain-saw is the most important
part of it. The Husqvarna has a 20 inch blade

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.630
on it. One thing we are going to make sure
before you start cutting down any tree is

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:39.120
that you have got gas ready to go. You do
not want to be halfway through the tree and

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.190
run out of gas. So it is very important to
have the gas ready to go and maintenance of

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.340
your chain-saw. You will have to refer to
your guides because they are so many different

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.941
ones. But primarily add oil to it, chain bio-oil
and then your gasoline, but make sure your

00:00:55.941 --> 00:01:03.149
gas is full before you start. The falling
wedge is another item. It is very important

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.850
to use. You can use it for fallen trees or
even when you are cutting logs later. It is

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.730
a plastic wedge so if you do hit it with your
chain, you will not destroy. If you use the

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.270
metal one and hit the chain, you could destroy
the chain, you could jam it, you could really

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.520
cause you serious injury. So, the plastic
one is ideal. With a come along, we attach

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.130
one end to something solid like a tree trunk,
a toe hitch on a vehicle so that we can pull

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.550
on it. We put a rope on one end and other
end, we extend and then we put, this is only

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:45.130
twelve foot width of cable. So, from there
we go to a rope that is around the tree. Now

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:54.760
how this operates is there is a ratchet here,
so when we push it, this clicks over and notches

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.320
it up. So, we really have good mechanical
advantage. Thatâ€™s why this is just a short

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:11.840
throw, you can pull a ton, a 2000 lb. force
on the cable itself and then there is a release

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.450
on the top for unwinding the cable so that
you can pull it out. All those instructions

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.440
are usually on the side of the come along
or on the box in which you purchase it. I

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.330
look at this as the central part of cutting
down a tree.
