00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.054
("Fur Elise")

00:00:02.054 --> 00:00:04.117
- [Voiceover] There are six
types of guy friends you have.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.081
Here's the guy who's got
his (bleep) together.

00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:08.589
He's always there whenever you need help.

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:09.544
- Need some help?

00:00:09.544 --> 00:00:10.966
- [Voiceover] Like when are taxes due?

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:11.799
- April 15th.

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:12.915
- [Voiceover] Where should I grab dinner?

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:14.725
- There's a great new
Indian restaurant downtown.

00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:16.126
- [Voiceover] Who's your
favorite Kardashian?

00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:17.833
- None, there are way
better things on television.

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:18.991
- [Voiceover] But if you had to pick.

00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:20.230
- Khloe, obviously.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.201
- [Voiceover] Then there's
the guy who you try to fix.

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:23.644
He always needs your help,

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:25.493
even if he's not totally aware of it.

00:00:25.493 --> 00:00:26.813
Talk to her.

00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:27.687
- What? No.

00:00:27.687 --> 00:00:29.312
- [Voiceover] Hey,
Allison, he thinks you look

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:30.531
really nice today.

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:32.725
- Thank you. See you soon.

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:33.757
- Bye.

00:00:34.737 --> 00:00:36.362
Maybe I should invite her over.

00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:37.602
Should probably tidy up the place a bit.

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:39.511
- [Voiceover] Yes, your
project is a success.

00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:40.912
- I bet my mom will clean it for me.

00:00:40.912 --> 00:00:41.820
- [Voiceover] (sighs)

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.758
Next up, the guy who makes you laugh.

00:00:43.758 --> 00:00:45.810
He's the first person
you'd invite to a party.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.069
- Little girl!

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:49.365
- [Voiceover] If he's not
throwing a party himself.

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:51.437
- Oh, you're too skinny.

00:00:51.437 --> 00:00:52.535
(laughter)

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:53.733
- [Voiceover] The one
thing he takes seriously

00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:56.613
are things that, well, aren't serious.

00:00:57.675 --> 00:00:58.934
(laughter)

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:01.352
- [Voiceover] But there's also
the guy who pisses you off.

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:03.606
He's the last person
you'd invite to a party.

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:04.908
- Well OK, I'm just saying

00:01:04.908 --> 00:01:06.208
I have my own opinion. You have yours.

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:07.244
Just respect that.

00:01:07.244 --> 00:01:08.463
I always feel like I'm being attacked.

00:01:08.463 --> 00:01:10.129
- [Voiceover] For some
reason he's just cool enough

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:11.511
to still be your friend.

00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:14.233
He has zero clue how bad he
can come across to others.

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:16.041
- Hey you know, hey, the
lady is not interested

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:17.220
so back the (bleep) off.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.906
- [Voiceover] Well, at least he's honest.

00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:19.820
- You OK?

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.999
- [Voiceover] Honesty isn't something

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:22.299
you'd associate with the guy who's

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.498
secretly in love with you.

00:01:23.498 --> 00:01:24.677
- So what are your plans this weekend?

00:01:24.677 --> 00:01:26.586
- [Voiceover] It's especially
bad when he happens to be

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:27.683
your close friend.

00:01:27.683 --> 00:01:28.963
- I was thinking of seeing a movie.

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:29.876
- [Voiceover] He acts like your friend,

00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:31.320
but he doesn't know that you know

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.944
that he wants to be more than friends.

00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:34.550
- There's a new animated film out.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.663
I can't remember if it's
Disney or DreamWorks.

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.024
- [Voiceover] Every time you're alone,

00:01:38.024 --> 00:01:40.483
things potentially get super awkward.

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:43.835
- So, did you wanna invite anyone else?

00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:44.973
- [Voiceover] Yes, you do.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.406
- (laughs) That's cool.

00:01:48.913 --> 00:01:50.174
Yeah, we can all get something

00:01:50.174 --> 00:01:51.474
to eat afterwards or something.

00:01:51.474 --> 00:01:53.079
- [Voiceover] Last, but
definitely not least,

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.416
the guy you're secretly in love with.

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:57.854
Every moment with him is torture.

00:01:57.854 --> 00:01:59.052
- I think you got something--

00:01:59.052 --> 00:01:59.987
- [Voiceover] Your heart stops.

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:01.063
- stuck in your teeth.

00:02:01.063 --> 00:02:02.384
Might be parsley. (laughs)

00:02:02.384 --> 00:02:03.664
- [Voiceover] (sighs)
He almost touched you.

00:02:03.664 --> 00:02:04.802
Does that mean he likes you?

00:02:04.802 --> 00:02:05.574
- Well, what do you think about it?

00:02:05.574 --> 00:02:06.346
- [Voiceover] Wait, you weren't listening.

00:02:06.346 --> 00:02:07.078
What did he say?

00:02:07.078 --> 00:02:08.702
Just agree enthusiastically.

00:02:08.702 --> 00:02:10.836
- Really? I don't really
care much for it at all.

00:02:10.836 --> 00:02:12.238
- [Voiceover] Shit, you idiot.

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:13.823
You must look so dumb right now.

00:02:13.823 --> 00:02:15.408
- You OK?

00:02:15.408 --> 00:02:16.911
- [Voiceover] Act completely normal.

00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:18.191
- Oh, you're just acting a little weird.

00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:19.979
- [Voiceover] Ugh, that's
the opposite of normal.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:20.994
- Not that weird's a bad thing.

00:02:20.994 --> 00:02:23.026
- [Voiceover] Yes, he
totally loves you back.

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:24.977
You're going to be together forever.

00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:27.232
Nope, never mind, he likes her

00:02:27.232 --> 00:02:28.878
and you're gonna be forever alone.

00:02:28.878 --> 00:02:30.299
But we all know that's not true

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.438
because you'll at least have these

00:02:31.438 --> 00:02:33.530
six types of guys friends
to help you find out

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.296
who you really are.
