but it's not so

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.300
and so killing two is expecting

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.980
that's the one thing is she got another that
makes me think

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.740
yesterday

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.540
helm

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.490
armed with those in the news with the business
that

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.650
all what have you

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.050
i got a little distracted over here buddy

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.220
missus uh... who were rupiah

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.720
of date

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.469
so at this situation look

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:31.100
my thought on it is uh... one uh... and i
realize you're crazy men eat dot com to pay

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.509
you twenty five dollars in the u father who
can apply my luggage and useful drug is quite

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.050
right out of the palmetto

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.010
fono

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.800

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.660
number two you lose my luggage and i give
me a damn thing over or not

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.950
with it so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.590
eyed with her and i like the fee

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.190
fought back

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.900
five million dollars

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.100
get it

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.840
but i think that might fit your bank badly

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.790
he with

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.750
second got down like this

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.379
so this is probably what people don't distribute
late-night cutter tired of it

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.490
twenty-five thirty dollars so you can take

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.379

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.369
setback but they're let your most interesting
thing is that it's a class action but that

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:52.940
makes it a little bit more

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.229
