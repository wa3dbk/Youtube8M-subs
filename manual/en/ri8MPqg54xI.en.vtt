Behind The Scenes
#146: EOC/LEgacy Mashup &amp; Road Trip

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.417
On this week's behind the scenes

00:00:13.417 --> 00:00:17.321
Mod Raven’s here to give us the low-down on May's RuneScape road trip.

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:21.147
But first let’s get an update on the EOC Legacy mashup.

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:25.056
Next week’s update is all about EOC and Legacy mashup.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:27.879
It’s a combination of legacy combat with EOC interfaces.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.880
The idea behind all of this came from forum posts.

00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:33.755
Players liked having a legacy mode and an EOC mode

00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:35.509
but they wanted to know if we could combine the two.

00:00:35.563 --> 00:00:40.688
The main benefit this feature will provide is allowing players much more customization on their gameplay,

00:00:40.688 --> 00:00:45.615
so they can either have full on legacy mode, full on EOC mode or a combination of the two.

00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:49.615
To enable any of these modes you can go into the game play tab on the settings panel

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:52.008
and then choose any of your options via the check boxes.

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:56.243
So if you prefer legacy combat with EOC interfaces that’s perfectly available,

00:00:56.244 --> 00:01:01.115
or if you prefer to have EOC combat with legacy interfaces that is also available.

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:04.073
We’ve had lots of positive feedback on this update through the beta servers

00:01:04.073 --> 00:01:07.681
where you can still go to try out any other potential updates that are in there.

00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:10.768
The beta servers are there so that you guys can try out features that

00:01:10.768 --> 00:01:12.775
maybe we want a bit more feedback on

00:01:12.776 --> 00:01:16.295
or maybe we feel it needs to be a bit more refined before we stick it into the live game.

00:01:16.296 --> 00:01:19.649
So we put a feature onto the beta server so you can try it out,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.160
give us your feedback, we can tweak it as many times as we like,

00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:25.916
and when the players are happy with it we can put it in the main game.

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:28.289
On the beta server we’re currently testing a few things.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.824
We’re testing an improvement to our looting system which will bring up a looting window

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:35.576
and allow you to do cool things like AOE looting.

00:01:35.577 --> 00:01:40.543
We’re testing a complete rework of the death system to make it a little bit fairer

00:01:40.543 --> 00:01:44.989
for those of you who get DDoS’d or if you can’t get back to your grave quickly.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.630
We’ve got a faction PVP Jmod run event you can take part in

00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:53.246
where you can support one of two gods and you can fight it out with other players.

00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:57.582
And we have some combat changes, some improvements to two handed abilities,

00:01:57.583 --> 00:02:01.113
we’ve got some improvements for soul split for legacy users

00:02:01.114 --> 00:02:04.113
and we have some changes requested from the PvP community.

00:02:04.113 --> 00:02:08.967
Players can get onto the beta server by going to runescape.com/player-beta.

00:02:08.968 --> 00:02:11.847
There you’ll see a list of all of the things we’re currently testing

00:02:11.848 --> 00:02:14.127
and you’ll have a link to the beta client.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.190
This may we’re bringing back the RuneScape road trip!

00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:21.605
Little passport book, there are various tasks, lots of lovely tasks,

00:02:21.606 --> 00:02:25.493
you can tick them off each in turn or skip them with a J-mod – it’s such fun!

00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:29.217
Players will have a number of tasks to complete.

00:02:29.218 --> 00:02:31.499
There are twenty in total, five per category.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.980
The categories are skilling, combat, social and the aptly named miscellaneous.

00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:40.083
Tasks include things like completing a dungeoneering floor at complexity six

00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:42.132
or completing a slayer target

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:46.524
or finding the golden idol of billy the goat,

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:48.604
so assorted tasks that they can complete.

00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:52.441
This road trip differs from last year in that we’ve made a few tweaks to usability.

00:02:52.442 --> 00:02:55.609
Previously for example you could get J-mods to stamp your book

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.748
but the process of doing this was a bit convoluted.

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:59.749
You had to click a thing and say you could do it.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.981
Then the J-mod to stamp it and then you’d maybe do it

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:05.363
but you weren’t all too sure. It was a bit confusing. Now we’ve made that a lot simpler.

00:03:05.364 --> 00:03:10.490
Now not only do we have some J-mod clones as well who are NPC versions of J-mods to do it for you,

00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:15.075
When you go there all you need to do is be around the J-mod when they do the stamp

00:03:15.076 --> 00:03:19.194
and you’ll get what’s called a chit. And a chit can be used to skip one of the tasks.

00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:22.371
You don’t even need to spend them straight away. The chits can stack up.

00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:24.753
You can have multiple of them to just keep on skipping.

00:03:24.993 --> 00:03:26.799
We’ve assorted rewards available.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.800
For each task you complete you’ll get an XP lamp.

00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:33.471
For completing each of the individual categories you’ll get an XP lamp and

00:03:33.472 --> 00:03:38.046
you’ll also get a piece of a compass as well as a new Aura.

00:03:38.047 --> 00:03:42.122
When you complete all the compass pieces you’ll get a huge dose of XP

00:03:42.123 --> 00:03:44.370
and you’ll get access to a very special pet.

00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:47.073
The Aura scales up for each of the categories you complete

00:03:47.074 --> 00:03:50.498
and gives you access to your own personal resource dungeon,

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:54.017
which has increased rate of gathering, it has increased XP

00:03:54.018 --> 00:03:59.840
and it also has a dungeon just for you full of the lovely shiny resources that you’ll want.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.898
We’re back next week with Mod Mark

00:04:02.898 --> 00:04:05.611
to look at the updates coming to RuneScape in May.
