00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.689
We're above the Arctic Circle with Saab,
It's quite cold here.

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:13.185
We're going to play in the snow
and sleep in the Ice Hotel.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:16.347
We're going to drive Saabs through the snow.

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:19.733
But first the dogs will bring us to the hotel.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:23.690
It's bizarre, those animals just keep on going.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.521
About 45 mph on ice, it's quite slippery.

00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:12.276
You're going to make the whole lap!

00:02:12.468 --> 00:02:14.550
Watch out, he's spun.

00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:43.525
Well guys, how did you like it?

00:02:43.587 --> 00:02:45.986
I think my smile says it all.

00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:51.167
It's wicked, just really cool.

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:54.197
It's a once in a lifetime experience.

00:02:55.809 --> 00:03:00.802
What happens when you brake at 45 mph?
-The first time nothing happens.

00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:04.474
The first time you just go straight on.

00:04:57.831 --> 00:05:01.428
Today we're at Saab...
