00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.929
How to Do the Cow Face Pose.

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:11.219
Don't take the name of this position personally—it's
called the Cow Face pose because, when seen

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.590
from the front, the outline of the body is
thought to resemble the broad mouth and narrow

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.260
head of a cow.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.420
Honest.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.520
You will need Comfortable clothing suitable
for stretching and moving A calm place where

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:30.100
you won't be distracted or disturbed A yoga
mat or folded blanket A small towel and a

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.119
strap or belt.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.370
Step 1.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.329
Sit on your mat with your legs stretched straight
out in front of you.

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:38.520
Step 2.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.429
Bend your knees, drawing your feet up closer
to your body, and slide your right leg under

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:45.749
your left leg, bringing your right foot back
to your left hip.

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:47.100
Step 3.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.850
Draw your left foot to your right hip, stacking
your left knee directly on top of your right

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.850
knee.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.280
Your heels should each be an equal distance
from your hips.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.679
A variation on this pose advises tucking your
feet under your butt rather than leaving them

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.620
next to your hips.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.179
Step 4.

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.990
Raise your left arm into the air, bending
it down at the elbow as you reach behind your

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.010
head down along your back.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.110
Simultaneously reach behind you with your
right arm and bend it up at the elbow, so

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.970
that your right forearm runs up along your
spine and the back of your right hand rests

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.780
between your shoulder blades.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.440
Step 5.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.740
Interlock the fingers of your left hand with
the fingers of your right.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.050
Don't overstretch—if you can't get your
hands to meet behind your back, hold a strap

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.950
or belt in your left hand and grip it with
your right.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.160
Step 6.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.770
Breathe naturally in this upright posture.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.770
Step 7.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.610
Bend forward, bringing your chest down toward
your knees.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.830
This will deepen the stretch in your hips
and shoulders.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.190
Step 8.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.620
Breathe smoothly and evenly while holding
the pose for as long as you're comfortable.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.820
Step 9.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.270
Release the pose by raising your chest back
up, ungrasping your hands, and unbending your

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.270
knees.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.360
Step 10.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.170
Repeat the pose on the other side, with your
right knee on top of your left and your left

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.530
arm reaching up behind your back and right
arm down behind your head.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.530
Step 11.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.170
Release the pose by raising your chest back
up, ungrasping your hands, and unbending your

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.170
knees.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.170
Good work, Cow Face.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.530
Did you know Hinduism holds the cow in sacred
esteem for its gentle nature and nurturing

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.250
qualities, symbolic of the earth's abundance.
