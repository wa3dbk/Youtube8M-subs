00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.250
[Darris McNeely] The question has come in
from a Beyond Today viewer regarding Jeremiah

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.480
chapter 10 and what it says about bringing
a tree in and decorating it with gold and

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.970
silver, and whether or not that is talking
about a Christmas tree.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.930
[Steve Myers] It says some interesting things
when you actually read what it says there

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.670
in Jeremiah chapter 10.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.800
And it starts out I think in an amazing way
in verse 2 by saying, and this is God talking,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.169
"Thus says the Lord, 'Do not learn the way
of the Gentiles.'"

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.910
Some versions say heathens.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.160
And then He goes on to say, "The customs of
the peoples are useless.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.360
They're futile.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.890
One cuts a tree from the forest, the work
of the hands of the workman with an axe.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.960
They decorate it with silver and gold.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.490
They fasten it with nails, hammers so that
it will not topple.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.120
They are upright like a palm tree.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.100
They cannot speak" (Jeremiah 10:2-5).

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.240
So what exactly is it talking about?

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.300
Some of those things, especially if you look
at the holiday decorations start to sound

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.300
pretty familiar.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.350
[Darris McNeely] Matches up pretty closely,
doesn't it, to what might, what is a Christmas

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.729
tree and what Christmas decorations of gold
and tinsel on a tree that's been cut down

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.280
from the woods, at least in the traditional
way, brought into a home, set up, and around

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.020
which gifts are spread.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.320
It is very, very plain, and matches up with
this.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.109
Now, some commentators on Jeremiah chapter
10 say that this is talking about a form of

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:28.821
idolatry where a tree is cut, but then it
is cut into a totem or an idol from that,

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:35.950
and the axe is actually a skilled artisan
carver that makes this into something different

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.259
from and therefore cannot be applied to the
idea of a modern Christmas tree.

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.639
But I think that the fact that Jeremiah here
is talking about avoiding the practices of

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:52.609
the heathen that then become idolatry and
a part of worship that replaces something

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:57.850
that is truthful was something that is wrong
and pagan in place of God.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.590
I think that it still refer to what is being
described here.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.369
[Steve Myers] Absolutely applies in the sense
that if you look into some of the practices

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.939
of the pagans during this day, they did worship
trees.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.390
They worshipped all kinds of things.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.189
They had a god for just about everything you
could imagine.

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.650
So when you look at the trees, especially
at this time of the year, they're looking

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.349
at the life that a green tree would bring.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.720
And that was a common practice back in that
day as well.&nbsp;

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.980
[Darris McNeely] Yeah, they were cut.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.610
They were used in the middle of the winter
time because they supposedly didn't die, still

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.500
had life in them, and to represent the life
that people wanted to gather around at this

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.920
time of year in the darkest part of the winter.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.670
Those trees were a part of the practice of
the ancient world, and yes they did migrate

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.709
into other parts of the world including Northern
Europe from which our modern customs in the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.920
United States and the Western world regarding
a Christmas tree eventually were adopted.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.709
And yet they were still connected with pagan
ideas and worship that did migrate from the

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.409
exact part of the world Jeremiah is talking
about where anciently green trees, evergreen

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.569
trees, were even used in the winter time as
a part of this type of worship.

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.590
[Steve Myers] And I think that's such an important
point.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.810
Can you adopt a pagan principle?

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.159
Can you adopt something from the Gentiles
or heathens, those that don't know the true

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.829
God, and somehow try to use that to honor
God?

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.799
Well, He says right here don't learn that
way.

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:21.799
Do not do that.

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.819
That is not a way to honor God by adopting
some other practice, and try to call it Christian.

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:28.819
He says that's unacceptable.

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:29.819
You can't do it.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.739
[Darris McNeely] And so you're left with the
question: does it really matter?

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.030
And the answer is it does matter.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.439
And truth does matter and our worship and
our relationship with God, we should worship

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:48.549
Him in spirit and in truth and not according
to the ways that are adopted from heathenism

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:49.640
or paganism.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.200
That's what the scripture says.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.709
It does matter.

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:53.980
