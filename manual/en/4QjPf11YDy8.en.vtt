00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
Hey guys and welcome to a new video from HappyAnimals Happy

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.640
Today I talk about a topic which I really care about

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.960
The whole thing was created in a cooperation with the YouTuber "NagerBlog"

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.000
We had a conversation and asked ourselfes what we could do to teache you guys something

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.900
and we also celebrate something!

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.620
NagerBlog has got over 400 subscribers now!

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.280
And I have got over 2.400 subscribers now!

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.180
so it fits perfectly

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.700
and her video to this topic is linked at the end of this video

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.380
it is also linked down below for mobile users

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.940
and now lets get started

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.060
What is this all about?

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.200
I want to show you guys what I did wrong with my hamsters care

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.480
I want to show you my first mistakes

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.580
thats why I am now going to put all of my old stuff into my old hamster cage. But I do not use these things anymore!

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.080
And I can tell you guys...

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.240
Thats how the cage really looked like.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.680
Thats the original cage from my first hamster

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.000
Back then I just cut a door into the front

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.940
Of course thats very bad, a hamster cage where the doors are just at the top.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.200
Then you can see the measurements...

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.280
It was 65.5cm by 35cm

00:01:25.938 --> 00:01:28.578
Way to small as you can see

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.118
back then a dwarf hamster lived in there

00:01:32.118 --> 00:01:34.718
and the wheel was also way to small

00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:36.838
It was just 19cm

00:01:37.075 --> 00:01:40.875
and yeah as you can tell also way to small

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.060
I am now just starting to put everything inside the cage.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.660
Don't wonder about the stains at the bottom of the cage

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.840
I used it for my guinea pigs litter tray

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.200
and I wasn't able to clean it perfectly

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.860
Thats why there are a view stains left

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.660
what ever...

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:17.140
while I put bedding and everything else into the cage. I am going to tell you all of my mistakes

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.980
At first, I put way to less bedding into the cage

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.880
I think.. I didn't mesure but I think I put about 3cm of bedding into the cage

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.660
and that is waaaay to less as you all know

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.580
and I also want to tell you that I haven't bought anything new out of the things that I use here

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.520
the cotton fluff stuff, or the bad food. All of these things I had at home

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.120
back then there was a level in the cage and I put a big pile of hay down there

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.020
and most of the time my hamsters slept down there

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.580
Oh yes because you can see that right now...

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:08.880
I had no idea how to put this wheel onto the cage, when I filmed this video. So it can't move.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.180
It's not the exact same wheel as back then.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.460
It was the same model and the same brand but I think it was yellow

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.860
But I had another cage from this brand and the wheel was red this time

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.980
and as you can see now. Back then I put this door at the side of the cage.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.840
as you can see I also used a water bottle

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.560
what I can not recommend at all!

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.440
And if you are wondering why I put the bottle at the inside of the cage

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.540
and why I do all of this with a hair band

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.260
I just realized it later that it is wrong to put it to the inside

00:03:45.906 --> 00:03:52.126
I did all of this with a hair band because I had no wire

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.960
of course I also used a plastic bridge

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.100
as you can see it is very chewed of

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.942
And this "wonderfull" food

00:03:59.927 --> 00:04:01.927
I didn't actually use this food

00:04:01.927 --> 00:04:12.767
I can remember that I used food from Vitakraft and I was in a green package

00:04:14.077 --> 00:04:22.497
This food was "Harry Hamster" I bought it to do a review but I never made one

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.220
Then the house that you can see...

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.560
it has got a floor... its made out of plastic... cotton fluff inside...

00:04:29.576 --> 00:04:36.276
I did everything wrong what you can really make wrong...

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.820
and I also want to say that I make this video to show

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.260
that everyone makes mistakes and you can learn from it.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.180
This treat stick I showed you to tell you guys that I also fed treat sticks back then

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.360
But not from the brand "Grainless". I fed the really bad ones with honey and so on

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.680
and yeah thats the finished result

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.280
With the toilette paper rolls and everything else

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.560
my hamsters did not have more toys than that

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.340
they also sadly chewed the bars which I thought was cute back than

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.780
and they also climbed the bars

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:19.380
but as I told earlier, I just wanted to show you that everyone makes mistakes

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.160
and that everyone can learn from his mistakes

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.200
and here I just change the water bottle again

00:05:27.304 --> 00:05:33.104
don't be sad if you make mistakes. Just change them.

00:05:33.104 --> 00:05:38.064
Most of the time its not as hard as you might think at first.

00:05:38.064 --> 00:05:39.984
You can also do many things yourselfe

00:05:40.153 --> 00:05:42.153
Or build extentions to your cage

00:05:42.187 --> 00:05:43.507
or whatever

00:05:43.507 --> 00:05:47.927
just dont be sad when someone tells you that you could do a view things better.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.500
sooo we are now at the end of the video

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.440
I just want to give another shoutout to "NagerBlog"

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.280

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.280
Her cages are just awesome.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.720

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.540
And now we are at the endcart.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.240
how do you like the endcart?

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:48.680
The picture was painted by @chrissis.art.world at Instagram

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.620
I am going to link her page down below

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.320
And again a huge thank you to you!

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.680
That you painted this wonderfull picture

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.200
there are all of my pets on it

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:07.300

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:16.040
