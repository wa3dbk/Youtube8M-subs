00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.020
How do I feel about graduating?

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.140
Graduating.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.727
[Laughs]

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.940
I know that I'm ready to leave, but that doesn't mean
I want to.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.700
Excited, thrilled, nervous, scared.

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.369
I'm still in denial. 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.260
Aaah!

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.280
I feel very sentimental about everything.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.320
Almost ready.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.620
I feel very prepared.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.660
I think I'm going to like run, skip, hop, or jump like across the stage.  I'm not going to walk.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.960
Do I have a senior bucket list?

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.740
So, I want to watch the sun rise from the top of the castle.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.040
Actually count how many
Rabb steps there are.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.440
Taking a picture with Ollie.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.880
I've never rolled down the library
hill.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.080
I want to try at the Skydiving Club.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.620
I want to say that I ate all three meals and
Sherman and lived to tell the tale.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.700
I want to go to back-to-back Sherman meals.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.100
How do I usually spend Saturday nights?

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.340
Having fun and dancing with your friends in Boston.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.320
Asia Wok, only when I'm really in the mood.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.620
Go to a party or an event.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.660
Trying to catch up on sleep, because we're too busy on the weekdays.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.720
Sometimes lame, doing work.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.600
Yeah, I can't work on Saturday nights.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.700
What will I miss most about Brandeis?

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.420
Friends. I'm definitely
going to miss the friends the most.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.140
I'm going to miss being able to just so freely feel
like myself.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.060
I'm going to miss a lot of people here.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.800
The other night, I was lying in my bed
in the Mods and I heard someone playing the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.230
Harry Potter theme song on a violin outside
of my room.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.270
There's always a lot of surprises around every corner.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.920
I made chainmail armor, and I wore that around campus.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.260
Oh my God, I love this place, I love Brandeis. 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.720
I'm going to miss everything. 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.580
What is my idea of a perfect day at Brandeis?

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.460
Classes are cancelled.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.140
The weather would on point, like not too hot, but not too cold.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.900
Spring, warm weather, everyone
out on the Great Lawn.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.520
Just that light, cool breeze caress.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.120
A giant pillow fight on the Great Lawn with like a couple hundred people.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.450
Free food. 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.790
Go to like a really engaging class.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.890
Yeah, that's a good day. 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.530
What advice would I give to future students?

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.040
Definitely get involved as early as possible.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.580
Minimize the amount of time you spend on the computer.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.800
You just need to get out of your books and just get out there.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.340
Don't panic, definitely don't panic. 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.720
Find the club, organization that is your niche, that fulfills you.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.920
Do not cross the ice on Massell Pond. 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.600
Take a class that's totally out of your comfort zone. 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.940
It'll change your life.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.220
Just go for it.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.420
What does Brandeis mean to me?

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.159
I came to Brandeis because of
the people, and I stayed because of the people.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.099
It sort of turned into home for me. 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.679
I don't really have any regrets. I think I did okay, yeah.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.300
I don't know who I would be, where I'd
be if I hadn't come here. 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.780
Well, I have become Andrea in this world at Brandeis.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.780
