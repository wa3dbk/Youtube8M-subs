00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:17.080
My name is Christopher Ritchie, I'm 21 and
I work for Greater Manchester Police.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.320
My vision before treatment was quite bad.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.990
It was -5 in both eyes.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.980
I started wearing glasses when I was 5 years
old.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.500
Half way through secondary school I started
to wear contact lenses.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.820
I considered having laser eye surgery due
to my current occupation and also the current

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.490
price of contact lenses was also rising.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:44.590
I found out about laser eye surgery by speaking
to people who’d had it done.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.809
I then started looking on the internet.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.710
The material that I found online was very
useful.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.120
The testimonials were great.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.780
A number of my friends and colleagues gave
me recommendations about who to use, a number

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.030
of them mentioned Optical Express.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.700
It took me at least 3 weeks before I decided
which firm I’d want to use for my laser

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.780
eye surgery.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.039
I consulted a number of people during my decision
process, including friends and family and

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:20.310
colleagues at work.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.420
The only things that put me off with regards
to laser eye surgery were the possible side

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.970
effects.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.720
My concerns were addressed prior to treatment
by the consultants and the surgeons at Optical

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.080
Express.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.369
The procedure I opted for was Lasik Wavefront
with IntraLase.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.110
I chose Lasik Wavefront with IntraLase as
this was the best option that the surgeon

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.679
advised me.

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:53.220
The treatment for laser eye surgery cost me
£3,500.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.420
I chose Optical Express for my treatment due
to the reviews and testimonials.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.280
I also chose Optical Express due to the reviews
from my colleagues.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.380
The effects of the treatment were noticeable
immediately after the surgery.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:18.010
Within a couple of days my vision was 20:20.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.200
The procedure has changed my life on a day
to day basis.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.319
I am now able to go to sleep and wake up without
worrying about having to put contact lenses

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.770
in and out.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.620
One advantage of having my laser eye surgery
is that I've been able to take on longer driving.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.180
I've been able to travel further distances
without my eyes becoming tired like they used

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.420
to with contact lenses.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.239
I can’t imagine going back to previous before
the surgery.

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.559
The best thing about having the procedure
is having my life back.
