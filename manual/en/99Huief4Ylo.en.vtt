Hi, I'm Frank Anderson and I'd like to tell
you how to set up a home darkroom, of course

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.049
first you'll need a room, it doesn't have
to be a very big room but it does have to

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:14.589
have a water supply and it does have to have
some power points. The first thing you have

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.609
to do is to get the materials to blackout
the room, there must be no light coming from

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:26.860
the windows and no light coming from the door.
Of course, you'll need an arrangement of equipment,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:35.170
for example, you'll need a safe light, you'll
also need an enlarger with which you can make

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:45.080
black and white or color prints. You'll need
an enlarging easel to hold the paper flat,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:57.710
you'll need some photo paper to make the prints
with and then you'll need a minimum of three

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:08.400
trays to develop and stop and fix your prints.
These print tongs are also very useful, you

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.280
shouldn't put your hands into the chemicals,
your skin might be sensitive to it. Of course,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:22.030
you'll need a sink and, in this case, a print
washer to wash your prints. The prints can

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:30.979
be washed in the sink itself with running
water and you can use one of these to plug

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.950
the sink, so the sink can actually fill up
with water and then it won't escape by the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.670
top of the tunnel and you can wash prints
in the sink. After your prints are washed

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.610
you can squeegee them and then you can dry
them in racks, if you like, but you can also

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:06.760
use one of these, this is quite cheap. It's
a print dryer and this will dry resin coated

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:21.180
prints very quickly, only a matter of minutes.
In order to make up and store chemicals, I

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.900
would suggest that you try to find storage
bottles like these. They're very useful because

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.799
if the bottle is half, or a little bit more
than half full, you can compress it like this

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:42.560
to exclude air from the container inside and
that way you can keep the liquid for much

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:55.620
longer. You'll need some measuring cylinders
for mixing chemicals and you'll also need

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:04.370
a timer to time your exposures. In this particular
case, this enlarger comes with a timer, if

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:14.459
it doesn't you can use timers like these or
you can use, very small and very convenient

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:25.489
digital timers like these. Finally, although,
again, it's not necessary because you can

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:32.120
do it simply by hand, it can be very useful
and release you to do other things, if you

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:41.650
buy a film processor. These processors are
useful because they rotate the developing

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:49.810
tanks and keep fresh develop around fresh
chemicals, coming to the film and they do

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.110
it instead of you so they can release you
to do other things.
