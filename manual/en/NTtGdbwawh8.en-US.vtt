00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.000
Ok this is my hamster Shuki

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.060
He is now in my hands and is a little stressed

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.940
It's better To keep your hands like this In order to keep it warm

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.700
Some people mix between a hamster and a mouse

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.140
This is not true

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.180
Because its tail is short

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.540
A mouse has a long thin tail

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.040
Just a moment I will return it to its cage so I can continue

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.140
Let's start, hamsters really like lettuce and carrots and cucumbers

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.900
He is probably not hungry now Because I fed him earlier

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.280
Oh, he eats it

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.760
And it also likes lettuce

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.460
He loves it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.400
It also has a pumpkin seeds he is also very fond of

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.800
He also really likes them

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.460
It also has a stick of vitamins which is very healthy for him

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.420
The vitamins stick has a hook that attaches in the cage

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.020
It also has a wooden house

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.900
If you have a small cage and you want enough place for your hamster its not advisable to add the wooden house

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.140
It also has a wheel with to spin in

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.740
If you look at both the front or the back there is a Flamingo

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.940
You should buy this food and the company is  Flamingo

00:02:51.100 --> 00:03:00.020
About food again, be careful because he buries it in his bedding so dig a little corner and put his food there in order not to give him too much

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.040
This is the amount of food you need to give, not more

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:14.380
Thank you for watching, this hamster helps me study.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.380
