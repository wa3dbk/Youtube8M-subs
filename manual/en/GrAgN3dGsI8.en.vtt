Hi, this is Laura Turner, and today I'm going
to talk with you about how to write a compelling

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:11.889
script. A compelling script is going to contain
six primary themes in my estimation. The first

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:19.060
thing that a compelling script will contain
is a well formed plot. A plot in which the

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.970
action feeds off of the previous action. So
you have sort of actions in sequence that

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.061
build on one another and come to a climax
obviously. Number two you're going to want

00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:38.250
to have characters who are complex and active,
we don't want to watch people onstage or in

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.250
film who are not constantly driving towards
something, who want something, who are doing

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.540
things. So make sure your characters are active
in the sense that they are always doing something

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.670
in order to get a reaction or to get something
out of someone else. They're not just doing

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.489
things just to do them, or they're not just
doing nothing. Number three, your compelling

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.090
script will contain dialogue that is well
written. And by well written I mean not expository.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.060
Not dialogue that is just commenting on the
plot of the play or dialogue that is commenting

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.560
on the background of the plot of the play.
Or dialogue that is commenting on you know

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.100
relationships in the play, as you know you
are my sister and we have a bad past together

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.950
and this is what's going on right now. You
want to have dialogue that is sort of full

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.800
of conflict and sort of within the moment.
Okay. So well written dialogue. Number four,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.530
you want to contain themes in your play or
your movie script that are universal. Themes

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.100
that are over arching, you know, love conquers
all, things like that. You want to have a

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.900
universal reach into your audience. Number
five, you want to contain musical elements

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.090
that are going to enhance the drama. You want
to have a rhythm to where your characters

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.280
speak. You want to have a rhythm to the way
the scenes are organized. You want to have

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.531
any kind of sound elements that come in, be
symbolic or you know cluing you in to the

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:19.810
themes of the play, things like this. Music
can really be many different things, it can

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.280
help your play a lot. And finally number six,
you want it to contain spectacle elements

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.311
that will wow the audience. We see this is
a lot in film, sometimes in film 'cause film

00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:37.590
is primary visual we see a whole spectacle,
we see a whole lot of you know, bursting semi

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.570
trucks, you know, blowing up in front of you,
you know violent images, that we may not see

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.150
onstage so much because onstage is right next
to a spectacle or can be smaller, okay, so

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.930
think about how important spectacle is to
a compelling script and you definitely need

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.040
all of these elements in order to make it
compelling.
