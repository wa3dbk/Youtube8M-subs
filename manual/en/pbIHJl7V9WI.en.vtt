00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.300
The all-new Mazda6 has a little bit of
everything. The elegance, sportiness and

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:27.010
generous interior space equally reminds of
BMW 3 Series, Jaguar XF and Tesla Model S,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.100
but the price is more affordable. Mazda6 is a
car carefully built and you can easily see that

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.230
the Japanese wanted not only a new generation
for this model, but a significantly better car.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.450
Its lines evokes consistency and sportiness.
Kodo design language – soul of movement –

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.000
looks very good on this model. And if you like
the look of the Mazda6 , remember that is based

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:05.010
on a very nice concept. It's called Takeri and it
was presented at Tokyo in 2011 as a world premiere.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.640
As soon as you jump behind the steering
wheel or on the back seats you can easily

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.780
observe the simplicity and sportiness of the
interior. Light coloured leather gives it a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.010
special touch of elegance.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.670
Driving position is exemplary,
uncompromising in terms of ergonomics,

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.620
even if, for example, the armrest is not height adjustable.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.220
Door panels are very well designed and
leaves much room for knees and elbows.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.970
And the back seats are roomy. Including
people over 1.80 m in height can sit very

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.410
comfortably and without touching the ceiling
with the head.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.480
The feeling of quality in the interior is stained
by cheap carpet under the floor mats.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.490
It also has a too small screen of the
infotainment system and looks already outdated,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.800
although it has only 2-3 years on the market.
But if you only have basic requirements,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.110
this multimedia system will not disappoint you.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.410
But do not expect high performance and do
not even think the system recognizes voice

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.990
commands of any kind. And I think that's not
my accent to blame, because it worked very

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.900
well on BMW, Ford and SEAT.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.270
But who cares so much about multimedia in a
car that drives so well?! The tested version is

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.350
a top of the range, Revolution, with navigation
and 6-speed automatic transmission.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.160
The engine is a real gem and even though it
has a displacement of 2.2 liters and develops 175 PS/hp,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:00.730
the two turbines are not blowing
the fuel efficiency at all. On a distance of 470 km

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.590
the real fuel consumption remained at 7.6 l/100 km.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.770
This Mazda6 reaches 100 km/h in 8.4 seconds
and it does it like this.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.730
The automatic gearbox makes a poor
impression in the first moments, but after you

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.020
get used to it and work with paddles on the
steering wheel, the grievances begin to disappear.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.950
It's fast enough and won't make
you be ashame, but it not tops the speed

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.520
performance of dual-clutch transmissions or
the more modern automatic 8-speed.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:56.970
The ride quality is a very pleasant surprise.
Weighing just a ton and a half, the car is agile

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.000
and easy to handle, despide its size. The
steering is a little too light for this segment,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.330
but if you want a tough one, you buy a Ford
Mondeo.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.630
The body roll on winding roads is reduced
and the satisfaction of driving is guaranteed.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.400
Especially if you're the kind of driver who
loves to feel the car.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.440
Mazda6 has a starting price of under 22,000
Euro with VAT in Romania and one identical

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.210
to the one we tested has a list price of 34,000
Euro, including VAT.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.780
It is not very affordable, but Mazda6 offers
nothing less compared to its rivals.
