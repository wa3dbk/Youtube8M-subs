00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:01.325
- Hey everyone!

00:00:01.325 --> 00:00:02.301
My name is Tyler Oakley

00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:03.723
and I'm just chilling here.

00:00:03.723 --> 00:00:05.592
I'm a simple jelly man.

00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:07.342
(laughing)

00:00:07.342 --> 00:00:09.435
And we know, look who's
here today, you guys.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:11.595
It's my special guest, my good friend,

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:14.683
the one and only, Mamrie Shart.

00:00:14.683 --> 00:00:15.719
- Hey guys!

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.223
- (laughing)

00:00:17.223 --> 00:00:19.011
We just accidentally drank
a bottle of wine each

00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:20.636
so here we are!

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:22.266
Mamtown and we have to put on costumes.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.362
It feels just right.

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:25.110
- And I was like, look it, look,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.883
there's nothing, look--

00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:27.101
- (laughs) Look, look, look--

00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:29.762
- Look, there's nothing
I like having on my chest

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.631
more than some creamy nuts.

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:33.704
- OK. (laughs)

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:35.268
You're like, and I'm out.

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:36.764
- It's not a time ray video without--

00:00:36.764 --> 00:00:38.389
- It could happen!

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:40.563
- What? (laughs)

00:00:40.563 --> 00:00:41.376
I was gonna say, it's not--

00:00:41.376 --> 00:00:42.615
- Our ship, our ship.

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:43.794
(Tyler laughs)

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:44.627
I'm still sailing it.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:46.679
I'm the only person on
the whole damn thing.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.101
- It could happen!

00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:49.787
Besides having a video without a costume,

00:00:50.325 --> 00:00:51.859
or a drink, apparently,

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.649
what were we before?
- Children.

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.065
- A couple of kids. (laughs)

00:00:56.065 --> 00:00:56.899
- Innocent.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.137
Wait, be more specific.

00:00:58.137 --> 00:00:59.113
Why're we wearing sun glasses?

00:00:59.113 --> 00:00:59.864
We look insane.

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:02.627
- I gotta keep 'em on.

00:01:02.627 --> 00:01:03.684
- Can we connect with the audience

00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:05.025
if we're wearing sunglasses?

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:06.061
- What are you--

00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:08.215
- Look, I wanna make sure
that I reach your people.

00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:09.312
- You will peach.

00:01:09.312 --> 00:01:10.246
You will reach.

00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:11.526
You my peach.

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:13.335
If you will reach, if you're lucky.

00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:14.371
Mamrie.
- What?

00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:15.671
- There are children watching.

00:01:15.671 --> 00:01:16.586
- I'm sorry.

00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:18.882
(laughing)

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:20.121
- So, the children at home,

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.157
they need the talk.

00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:22.396
And I feel like who are better

00:01:22.396 --> 00:01:24.509
to give the people at home the talk

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.728
than peanut butter and jelly.

00:01:25.728 --> 00:01:27.963
- Holy shit!

00:01:27.963 --> 00:01:29.426
Before you put your body in a sandwich,

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:31.112
listen up to this sandwich.

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:32.352
- Should we make out?
- No.

00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:33.266
- OK.

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:34.729
- Yeah, we think you little nuggets

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.760
need to learn from a good source,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.484
not your old geriatric ass parents.

00:01:39.484 --> 00:01:40.906
- But we gotta talk like the youth.

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:41.739
(laughs)

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:45.010
- Fo shizzle, shizzle. (burps)

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.037
- OK, so we asked you guys
to tweet us your questions

00:01:47.037 --> 00:01:49.231
with the hashtag, what was the hashtag?

00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:49.882
- Birds and the bees.

00:01:49.882 --> 00:01:50.877
- Birds and the bees.

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:51.771
Because you know what,

00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:56.647
I feel like education is the key to

00:01:56.647 --> 00:01:59.641
preventing unhappy moments.

00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:00.962
OK, so Julie wants to know,

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:02.546
I haven't had my first kiss

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:04.964
and I'm very nervous to have it.

00:02:04.964 --> 00:02:08.560
Tips to get over my fear of
touching lips sensuously.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.450
- Everything is made out of tiny atoms.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.421
Things that make up your lips--

00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:14.174
- Your lips.

00:02:14.174 --> 00:02:15.392
- are the same things that make up a

00:02:15.392 --> 00:02:17.180
bunch of traffic cones.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.602
- How do you prevent an STD?

00:02:18.602 --> 00:02:19.314
- Mamtown.

00:02:19.314 --> 00:02:20.593
- Wear a damn condom.

00:02:20.593 --> 00:02:22.238
- Bam. Name five, go.

00:02:22.238 --> 00:02:26.139
- Chlamydia, herpes, gonorrhea,

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.168
that's a tough one.

00:02:29.168 --> 00:02:31.606
And damn genital warts.

00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:33.779
- All five of those are drama llama.

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:35.141
- Save it for your mama.

00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:38.118
Alright, STDs should stand for stop,

00:02:38.718 --> 00:02:40.382
take a second--
- And.

00:02:40.382 --> 00:02:41.580
- Don't.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.466
Think of a condom as a poncho.

00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:46.954
- For?
- Your dick.

00:02:47.493 --> 00:02:48.875
- How do you put on a condom?

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:49.952
Let's do it.

00:02:49.952 --> 00:02:53.406
- Don't risk it, wrap your biscuit!

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:55.072
At the end of the day,

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.571
if I'm gonna touch something

00:02:57.571 --> 00:02:59.257
that's been in other people's trash,

00:02:59.257 --> 00:03:00.537
I'm gonna put a glove on.

00:03:00.537 --> 00:03:01.268
You know what I mean.

00:03:01.268 --> 00:03:02.631
- Amen.
- So what you're gonna do,

00:03:02.631 --> 00:03:04.319
Tyler is playing the part of a dick.

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.025
He does that in most days of his life.

00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:07.021
(Tyler laughs)

00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:08.565
When you get a condom it's going to--

00:03:08.565 --> 00:03:09.581
- Oh my God.

00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:10.556
- It's going to be rolled up.

00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:11.612
Right, OK.

00:03:11.612 --> 00:03:14.985
You might see a little perforated thing.

00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:16.021
- [Tyler] Like a little dooly doo.

00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:17.260
- Like a little thing up top.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.479
A little cave to catch stuff.

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.369
And roll--
- [Tyler] Oh my.

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:22.194
- it down.

00:03:22.194 --> 00:03:23.718
- [Tyler] If a dick ever does this--

00:03:23.718 --> 00:03:26.135
- (laughs) Run, homie.

00:03:26.135 --> 00:03:27.923
- [Tyler] Figure it out, figure it out.

00:03:27.923 --> 00:03:29.467
Now, if there's any holes,

00:03:29.467 --> 00:03:31.013
girl, get out of there.

00:03:31.013 --> 00:03:32.131
- Get out of there.

00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:33.126
- Mamrie.
- What?

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:35.117
- Now that we've told them
how to put a rubber on--

00:03:35.117 --> 00:03:37.514
- We'll tell you how to get your lover on.

00:03:37.514 --> 00:03:39.403
- What happens after you put the meat tube

00:03:39.403 --> 00:03:41.394
in the love cave, asks Stefan.

00:03:41.394 --> 00:03:43.121
- I believe you won't
have to worry about that

00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:44.970
if that's the way you're describing sex.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.230
- (laughs) Jesus Christ.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.180
- When you're too consenting,

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.277
hold that thought.

00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:50.070
I don't think you could--

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.289
- No such thing as too consenting.

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.878
- Yes!

00:03:51.878 --> 00:03:53.932
- Got it, nailed it, nailed it!

00:03:53.932 --> 00:03:55.963
Wendy wants to know how do
you do the hip hop diddly doo?

00:03:55.963 --> 00:03:58.623
Well Wendy, we got a fucking song for you.

00:03:58.623 --> 00:04:00.716
- I said five, six, seven, eight.

00:04:00.716 --> 00:04:02.621
♫ Hop to the left, eat take out

00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:04.449
♫ Hop to the right, get make out

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.135
♫ Hop to the left, get busy

00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:07.192
♫ But you better hop on it

00:04:07.192 --> 00:04:08.594
♫ You feel real dizzy ♫

00:04:08.594 --> 00:04:09.630
If you're drunk--

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.869
- Honestly--
- Or if you feel like

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:12.901
this isn't something you want at all--

00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:13.815
- If you think things aren't right--

00:04:13.815 --> 00:04:15.217
- Get the fuck out of there.

00:04:15.217 --> 00:04:18.183
- Just remove yourself from the situation.

00:04:18.183 --> 00:04:19.463
- Also, don't hang out with that person.

00:04:19.463 --> 00:04:20.479
They should know better.

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.145
- If they're making you dizzy,

00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:23.633
you's gots to go.

00:04:24.218 --> 00:04:25.416
(Mamrie laughs)

00:04:25.416 --> 00:04:29.216
OK so, that's all you need.

00:04:29.216 --> 00:04:30.292
That's sex ed in a nutshell.

00:04:30.292 --> 00:04:31.085
- I think so.

00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:32.487
Sex is great,

00:04:32.487 --> 00:04:34.986
if you're 100% ready,

00:04:34.986 --> 00:04:38.683
and also, 200% ready.

00:04:38.683 --> 00:04:42.462
- Have fun, be safe, use a condom.

00:04:42.462 --> 00:04:43.397
If you like this video,

00:04:43.397 --> 00:04:45.429
be sure to give it a--
- Thumbs up!

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:47.460
- And then go watch Mamrie's video.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.675
Mamrie, you're about to
hit a million subscribers.

00:04:49.675 --> 00:04:50.487
- No I'm not.

00:04:50.487 --> 00:04:53.088
I'm like 200,000 off or something.

00:04:53.088 --> 00:04:54.876
- Well bitch, there's
gonna be 200,000 views,

00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:55.790
let's hit it.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.212
- Oh my God, that would be insane.

00:04:57.212 --> 00:04:58.066
- Let's do it.

00:04:58.066 --> 00:04:59.224
Click the link below,

00:04:59.224 --> 00:05:00.321
go watch Mamrie's video.

00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:01.372
That's where--
- That'll be nuts!

00:05:01.372 --> 00:05:02.190
Peanut butter nuts.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.511
(Tyler laughs)

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.693
I'd like to make a toast.
- Uh huh.

00:05:05.693 --> 00:05:06.457
- Because I'm wearing (mumbling).

00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:07.777
- OK, OK.

00:05:07.777 --> 00:05:08.651
It's been real.

00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:10.642
- It's been fun.

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:13.669
- It's been--
- Really weird.

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:14.807
- I gotta go.

00:05:14.807 --> 00:05:16.224
Bye!

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.353
- If you throw a slab of bacon in here,

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:23.503
we're a goddamn Graceland delicacy.

00:05:23.503 --> 00:05:25.920
- I don't quite know what's happening.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.891
(laughing)

00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:30.573
Wendy wants to know how do
you do the hip hop diddly doo.

00:05:30.573 --> 00:05:32.889
- We got a song for you.

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.169
♫ Hop to the left, and you'll take ♫

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.490
(laughing)

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.440
♫ I said hop to the
left, and eat take out ♫

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.598
(laughing)

00:05:38.598 --> 00:05:40.305
♫ Hop to the left and get take out ♫

00:05:40.305 --> 00:05:41.077
(laughing)

00:05:41.077 --> 00:05:44.409
♫ And I'll be (mumbling) ♫

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.075
- I don't wanna copyright infringe.

00:05:46.075 --> 00:05:47.741
Oh my God, I think you
have a spider on your face.

00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:48.614
- What?

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:51.358
(Tyler laughs)
