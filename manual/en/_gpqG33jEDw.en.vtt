point three dollars

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:20.466
and on the back there's even a smack
middle at uwo attach it to a piece of

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:23.986
metal you can easily attached to
something like a stabilizer rate

00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:25.776
figures uh... pretty cool

00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:27.336
anton however

00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:31.866
uh... wanting this doesn't allow you to
do that would like to want

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:35.695
is no away to control the brightness
because we're sticking this in people's

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:38.476
faces in order to see what they're doing

00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:40.526
these lights can be pretty harsh

00:01:40.526 --> 00:01:44.926
uh... personally some face book a friend
of mine is a lot of on-camera telework

00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:48.986
made a comment about these unknowing
l_e_d_ lights interface that people are

00:01:48.986 --> 00:01:50.826
using all the time now

00:01:50.826 --> 00:01:54.216
so i wanted something basically had they
were controlled plus the slides only one

00:01:54.216 --> 00:01:55.606
color temperature

00:01:55.606 --> 00:01:59.876
uh... these excuse blue like a lot of
illini lighting so one of the way

00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:03.085
or one of the light to allow it to
change the color temperature

00:02:03.085 --> 00:02:07.015
nelson in one of those huge waves within
ninety six or hundred twenty six oh he

00:02:07.015 --> 00:02:07.896

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:12.436
and one have a little extra weight on my
re

00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:17.216
as well as the size is a really really
big into big in my opinion for what i

00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:18.435
want to four

00:02:18.435 --> 00:02:21.275
so i wanted to go for the uh...

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:24.196
may morning worship on amazon

00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:25.715

players also has a cell phone agency

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:31.825

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:32.875
uh...

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:35.556
kind of uh... such a plastic housing

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:39.075
quite a lot of these lawyers who runs on
three double a_ batteries for our

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:43.135
clients you can also use your chargeable

00:02:43.135 --> 00:02:45.125
alcorn sir or

double a_'s as well

00:02:48.015 --> 00:02:51.275
senator after another really be sort of
get pretty bright

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:54.585
you plenty of illumination i think for
the purpose of a lot

00:02:54.585 --> 00:02:58.315
and you can also do it so i can find a
happy medium

00:02:58.315 --> 00:03:01.625
rainier elephants so if people are

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:05.256
waving their hands and prather faces a
blind eye might actually be controlled

00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:06.115
the sand

00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:08.025
put in a decent spot

00:03:08.025 --> 00:03:10.425
and i staying about this light

00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:14.045
is that comes with these core
temperature plates this is a uh...

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:15.055
tungsten

00:03:15.055 --> 00:03:18.915
to norge quake will change the color
chip you can see it goes

00:03:18.915 --> 00:03:23.355
from the glued to the normal oily
delights in the world wide because they

00:03:23.355 --> 00:03:25.125
were del cid two

00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:26.865
person carter fisher

00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:28.045
interestingly

00:03:28.045 --> 00:03:31.435
you ll dot b harbor freight schools like
as well

00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:32.825
which is very blue

00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:34.035
you put this in front

00:03:34.035 --> 00:03:40.285
at worst also so in theory you could get
some uh... c_q_ joel cut it out to fit

00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:41.245
this

00:03:41.245 --> 00:03:45.806

cook you are not shave in the navy
sprayed with a little work

00:03:57.255 --> 00:04:00.815
but so this is definitely more caffeine
convenient

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:02.905
as these lights have

00:04:02.905 --> 00:04:04.825
uh... a bracket in the front

00:04:04.825 --> 00:04:07.325
you can easily slide these plates into

00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:08.635

bucks which is really pretty

00:04:27.135 --> 00:04:29.055
