00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.779
We're moving on to the stepping hook kick.
Okay. And it's exactly what the name sounds

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.360
like it is. It's a hook. It hooks around its
target. Okay. Its starts off like a sidekick

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.920
but it finishes like a roundhouse kick, okay,
and the foot positioning. So we're going to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.039
go over it very slowly. We're going to pretend
that this is now our opponent, the face is

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.990
right here. You would only throw this kick
to the face, to the jaw. Okay. So I'm stepping

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.479
in, positioning myself just like we did previously
on that side kick. I want to make sure my

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:41.269
shoulder is up, that knee is going to come
up to the side. Now the heel is going to end

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:48.309
up next to the face. And then I change my
position and I hook it around the target.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.030
So, again, it starts like a sidekick and ends
like a roundhouse kick, hooking around that

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.920
target. One more time slow, I make sure I
step in. That butt going to be turn cause

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.790
you use that muscle for kicking, the big glut,
okay. Shoulders up, knee comes up just like

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.310
we did on that sidekick, push it up, change
the positioning, bring it back in, hook it,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.200
come back to position. Okay. That's the slow
version of it. We're going to do it medium

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:26.720
speed. So it's going to look like this. Step,
hook and come back. Now on this bag we're

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.929
demonstrating with the ball of the foot, if
you really want to cause more damage, you

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:36.070
can also kick with the heel, okay. In that
case you don't point your foot. Again, medium

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:46.090
speed. Step, hook, come back. I'm going to
do with the heel also one time. Heel kick

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.149
and come back. Okay, here's a different angle
for you guys to work with, okay, hopefully

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.659
it will help you soon. Okay. Again, foot positioning,
it's that Horse Stance we start with, hands

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.270
are up, we're going to do that step you did
on the sidekick, same positioning, hands are

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.320
up, always keep your eyes focused on your
target, knee comes up, extends out, hook it

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.700
and come back to your position. That was a
slow speed, we're going to do it medium speed.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.449
Step, hook and come back.
