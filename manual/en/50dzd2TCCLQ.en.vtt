Last year for Earth Day, Ecology director Maia Bellon

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.300
was subjected to a round of tough questioning by her own daughter.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.600
What do you think you're gonna do to
help the Earth

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.500
until Earth Day comes?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.100
Does water filter from, you know, from  like sewage?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.300
And  hasn't there been a tsunami in
Chile?

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.699
Would you help clean the pastures, like
not with the doo-doo,  but I mean like,  you know?

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.100
Do you want to clean up Hanford? Come on let's  go and do it! [singing]
