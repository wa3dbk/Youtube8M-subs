Monica: 
Travis, I'm just here for support.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.130
You're my sidekick, so, like, step up!

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.900
Okay.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.110
You go first?

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.770
Craziest thing a fan has
ever done to me... Oh!

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.170
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Are you going there?

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.540
- The first one? 
- Yeah.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.930
Okay, so ... (chuckling to himself)

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.930
Wow.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.420
Okay, so who's heard this story?
'Cause I have to ask.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.140
I'm not like a certain other guy,
but I gotta ask.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.320
You coming to me?

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.700
(indistinct)

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.090
Monica (singing):
Yaoi.... Yaoi moment...

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.010
Holy cow, I can see the stars.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.850
I think I can see your liver
with these things.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.700
You're in good health, my friend.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.170
I'm lying.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.290
Okay, so this is one question I've
gotten before, like

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.610
"What's it like to be Roy Mustang?" 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.650
Okay.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.870
First really big anime role I ever had-

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.200
The first con I ever went to was 
Anime Detour in....

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.370
Monica: 2004?

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.860
- I think it was 2004, but what city?
- Minneapolis?

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.820
It was an "-apolis".

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.440
Anyway, Monica, Greg, and other
certain voice actors- Kyle Hebert-

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.900
- And you.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.360
Yeah, we're just getting.... (ppfft)

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.850
So at about two-thirty in the morning,
we're walking around, like...

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.530
What is this convention thing all about?

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.720
Monica: I think that was after you 
tucked me into bed.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.380
Oh yes. We put Monica to bed first
because she was trying

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.720
to drink from the table, 
but there was no liquid on the table.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.480
She's on the table, like...

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.720
- Just kidding.
- And I hate you.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.970
So we were at Anime Detour,
and I'm walking around

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.930
and I find myself into the, the...

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.440
I guess it was the Con Suite 
at the time.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.200
There was, like, a wicked game
of Magic: The Gathering.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.480
How much do I know about
Magic: the Gathering?

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.820
Zero.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.390
I go up to them, and I'm, like...
"Guys, what's goin' on?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.220
" 'The Spear of Alazar'. 
Sweet. Throw that down.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.320
"You're toast, aren't you."

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.740
So we're talking to these two guys

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.020
and they were looking at me
like I'm going to kill them.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.460
They're, like, "Who is THIS guy?"

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.500
"He's really big. Throw down your
rubies of ludicrous."

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.770
"Block his evil."

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.520
Craziest story? Here goes.
I'm sittin' there, right?

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.750
Out of nowhere, I see a pair of
jean covered legs come flying...

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.600
... into my - "out of my periph" -

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.970
And you know, I'd had a little to drink
so my reaction time was like...

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.340
... negative ten. 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.390
So I'm, like, oh! legs coming out of my
periph and sitting on my lap.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.480
At two-thirty in the morning,
this chick goes PFWHOO!

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.390
Jumping like Jackie Chan, BOOM!
onto my lap....

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.030
... grabs my face, and kisses me.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.270
Monica: And not just a regular--
*mwah mwah mwah*

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.680
It was, like, *laah laah laah*.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.510
She started, like, licking my tonsils,
back here. Through my nose.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.610
She was, like, "My dad was a lizard."
But whatever.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.880
So I'm, like, "Hey, uh-huh, aha!"

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.330
"Wh-what the hell?"

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.070
Now here's the thing about Anime Detour. 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.950
They really planned their stuff
to a T.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.660
They have these three badges.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.680
A blue one- a blue badge meant
you were staff... or guests...

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.900
Orange meant that you were
18 or older ...

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.650
And yellow meant 
you were below 18.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.820
I'm, like, --
(gathering composure)

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.440
Yellow badge?

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.010
Oh, my God.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.440
How old are you?

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.270
She's, like, "Sixteen!"

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.470
This sixteen-year-old sat on me and gets--

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.760
I'm like, BOOM! I bench press her onto the table...

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.540
And she was, like, "Well, I was 
sent here to make you not gay."

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.400
I was, like, "Do I *look* gay?"

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.530
This was the first convention I've 
ever been to. "Do I-- Do I look gay"??

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.680
Monica: He watches football.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.700
And then another guest, Kyle Hebert-

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.390
You all know Kyle Hebert.
Scream if you know Kyle Hebert.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.790
He was sitting next to me, and he
looks over and goes...

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.540
"Welcome to conventions."

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.530
I was, like, "Oh, my God,
what have I done?"

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.700
So craziest convention story?
THAT would be it.
