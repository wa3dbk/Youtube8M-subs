00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.699
 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.140
This is the first time I played with
Christoph.  It's always a bit more challenging

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.779
when you're playing with someone you've never played with before,

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.300
but you could tell that he's a good aggressive player.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.619
Ace-deuce - it's not a great hand

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.500
but I'm in position

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.310
and it's always nice to have a small Ace-suited and sometimes you can win big pots with those hands

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.739
Erik Seidel opened in the cut-off and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.239
I three-bet in the small blind with Ace-King

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.080
I'm happy to see an Ace now

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.940
He has to have an Ace or a Jack 
to beat me

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
I think on the flop Ace-King will be the better hand

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.230
the vast majority of the time, so I'm
betting

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.830
to get called from possibly pairs, some
gutshots and other top pairs with a weaker kicker

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.940
He bet 18,000 and I called

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.100
which is pretty standard

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.110
Once the turn comes I think my hand

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.710
deteriorates because if I'm three-betting from the small blind

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.250
I'll have a lot of broadway cards

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.500
so if I keep betting I might over-represent my hand a little bit

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.539
and therefore I decide to

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.759
check so that I can value-bet the river

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.159
He checks

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.730
and I check

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.930
Once the river comes a Queen

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.850
my hand slightly deteriorates again because if he was floating

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.290
the flop with the gutshot then on the river he would make trips

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.670
However, I think that he would not

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.040
bluff the river very often, so the best
thing for me

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.760
to get value out of the hand is to value-bet and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.830
face a tough decision if he raises me.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.580
 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.140
Now on the river he bets 45, which is a pretty big bet. My thinking was if he has

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.560
a smaller Ace than Ace-Jack then he could easily be trying to

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.700
take me off my hand because it looks like I have what I have

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.860
I just don't think he's bluffing in that spot enough

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.520
given the fact that he has to be concerned that I have a Jack or an Ace

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.270
He mucked his hand and

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.650
that was the optimal result for me - I assume that

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.040
Erik had an Ace with a weaker hand but

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.040
if Erik would have raised the river

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.300
I would have folded.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.340
Honestly I'm not happy about the hand because I should have folded it

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.360
It's one of those hands where afterwards you think "wish I could have taken that decision back"

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.810
It was my least favourite play of the day
