Hello! My name is Aaron Moon and I am here
today on behalf of expertvillage.com. I’m

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.940
discussing the steel string acoustic guitar
and going over picking techniques and I would

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:20.260
like to demonstrate how to get a muffled sound
out of your strings using a pick. Now if I’m

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:28.410
going to pick the A string and have it be
opened, its going to resonate quite a bit.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:46.859
It’s going to give a bright full sound
and it rings. Now a way to muffle that and

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:56.959
you kind of tighten it up a little bit is
to use the meaty part of your palm, down here

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:04.300
and place it against the strings kind of in
this region, in between kind of the end of

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:12.280
this circle and the beginning of your peg
board down here. So if you placed on there

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:23.750
and I play the same note,
it changes the note altogether. It is more

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:32.100
muffled, it’s quieter and it just gives
it a different texture altogether even though

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.960
it is the same exact note and
you can incorporate that in solos, incorporate

00:01:40.960 --> 00:02:02.560
that in different parts of the song just to
give a different color, a different texture.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.429
So that is a way to use your pick to muffle
the strings and give a punchy sound. So thanks

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.049
for joining us and we’ll see you back here
shortly.
