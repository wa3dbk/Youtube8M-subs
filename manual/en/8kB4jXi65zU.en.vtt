00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:09.620
Hi this is Julie with Beadaholique.com

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.410
and today I'm gonna show you how to make
Talia earring. This is actually a

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.349
complete kit

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.369
from Beadaholique.com and I want to show you how to make it

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.450
so I've already used half the ingredients in the kit to make the first earring

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.119
and then I'll show you how to do it with the
other half. So this is a large hole

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.040
pandora style bead. This is a faceted
glass Czech glass bead

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.520
there are two bead aligners, actually in
the kit there's going be four

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.890
but I already used two on in the first earring that I made

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.660
you've got these small little bead caps, a couple little bicone beads,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.660
a head pin, and an earring hook. In terms of the tools that you are going to need

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.050
is a pair a chain nose pliers, a round nose pliers

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.590
and a cutter. So to make this it's actually
quite

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.239
easy to do. Take one of your small bead caps

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.600
and place it onto the head pin in the upward direction

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.240
then add a bicone, a bead aligner

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.999
facing up your large hole bead

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:18.420
another bead aligner, that keeps that in place there

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.240
another bicone and finally

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.319
one more bead cap. So you just sandwiched
all those pieces together

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:31.289
and now you need to secure them. To do
that we're going to make a wrapped wire

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.909
loop

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.789
so right about your last bead cap go
ahead and grip your wire

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.020
with your chain nose pliers, bend the
wire

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.590
at a 90 degree angle, grab your round nose
pliers

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.959
and grab onto that wire and twist

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:50.020
it over the top of the round nose pliers

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.770
reposition your pliers so that you're
gripping it from the top

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.880
and continue making your loop

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.189
so you got that right now

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.849
so now we need to make our wrappings. To do so you're gonna grab the of top your loop

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:09.990
with your chain nose pliers

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.690
you can use another pair a chain nose, a
round nose or

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.959
I actually like to just use my fingers to do the wrapping

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:23.959
on the backside

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.720
go ahead and trim off your excess wire

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.370
now point this in a direction where it's not
going to go flying at someone

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.750
or actually you can just put your finger
over that little nub and trap it there

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.129
now you want to secure our wrappings and
make them a little bit more neat and

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.090
tidy so we're gonna take our chain nose

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.829
squish that rough wire end down

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.849
look at it from the front

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.390
if you need to you can also grab your
wire

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.180
press it, tighten it up a little bit

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.640
now we need to add the earring hook

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.150
to do so open up the base loop of the ring
hook

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.219
slip your wire loop

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:17.599
over it and twist it back. You don't want to pull it out of shape or twist it

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.719
and you've made the Talia

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:21.280
earring set.
