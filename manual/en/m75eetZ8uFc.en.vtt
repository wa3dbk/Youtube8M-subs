00:00:06.303 --> 00:00:09.023
What code should I learn to make games?

00:00:09.023 --> 00:00:13.733
Have you been watching the talks about kids
making a cheap game, listing it on iTunes

00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.253
and making a million dollars?

00:00:16.253 --> 00:00:20.143
Making something like Bejeweled doesn’t
seem hard, and there are people making a lot

00:00:20.143 --> 00:00:21.602
of money in it.

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:25.612
Not always a lot of money, but you can make
money in it.

00:00:25.612 --> 00:00:30.692
People spent about twenty billion dollars
on video games each of the past few years,

00:00:30.692 --> 00:00:34.993
while top games like “Call of Duty” and
“Mario Brothers” make more money that

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:36.893
blockbuster movies.

00:00:36.893 --> 00:00:40.943
I heard that programmers in the gaming industry
can make decent money.

00:00:40.943 --> 00:00:43.493
Now you’re talking about a career.

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:48.163
Because of the novelty factor, companies keep
churning out games.

00:00:48.163 --> 00:00:50.413
That makes it steady employment.

00:00:50.413 --> 00:00:54.263
For the industry, yes, for companies, no.

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:59.633
Realistic immersion games and kid games compete
for the top spots, while addictive Flash games

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:02.233
are an economic flash in the pan.

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:04.483
So what do I need to learn?

00:01:04.483 --> 00:01:12.453
C#, C++ and Java are the best ones that have
simple games you can make yourself via tutorials.

00:01:12.453 --> 00:01:15.992
I guess I need an A in the C languages to
get somewhere.

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:19.093
But I heard I need to learn DirectX.

00:01:19.093 --> 00:01:24.393
DirectX is a collection of programming interfaces
for multimedia in gaming like linking user

00:01:24.393 --> 00:01:30.523
actions to special effects, audio, character
3D models and the game’s environment.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:35.553
I saw a talk by a kid who invented Bustin
Jeiber without knowing how to code.

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:39.013
He used the iPhone software development kit.

00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:44.273
They tried to make it easier to create apps
without knowing Python, Java and C.

00:01:44.273 --> 00:01:46.973
I think I’d like to put something in the
Appstore.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:51.823
You’ll need to learn Objective-C for the
iPhone and Java if you want to work on Android.

00:01:51.823 --> 00:01:56.533
So that’s why I heard someone promoting
an app saying they have to find someone to

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.753
put it on the other device.

00:01:58.753 --> 00:02:04.132
But C is one of the best languages to learn;
it is used almost everywhere while it teaches

00:02:04.132 --> 00:02:05.742
you how to program both apps and hardware.

00:02:05.742 --> 00:02:09.113
It’s hard to learn.

00:02:09.113 --> 00:02:13.163
Learn the discipline with the first language,
and you’ll waste less time debugging and

00:02:13.163 --> 00:02:15.033
recompiling code later.

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:18.953
And you can use it whether you create games,
OS or the Appstore.
