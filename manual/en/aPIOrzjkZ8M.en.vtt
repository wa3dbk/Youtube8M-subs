00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.160
3D printing technology, pretty cool stuff

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.260
but let's face it, if you look at 3D printers

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.730
on the market today you'll find many

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.580
problems. Now it was not our intention to

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.770
just make another printer but rather to

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.230
take all the most desirable features

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.330
found in the best current models and to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.089
combine them into one quality product.

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:37.199
Introducing CraftBot, the all-new 3D

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.059
printer that combines quality and

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.410
affordability. One problem with many

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.420
other 3D printers is they simply cannot

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.149
make larger, often more practical objects.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.539
Our solution: we designed a printer with

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.670
the largest possible build volume and a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.839
compact desktop equipment.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.519
Another common problem with other

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.410
printers is that the finished prints

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.170
tend to bend from the plate, making them

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.960
unusable. The simple solution: a heated

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.090
build platform that is also easily

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.780
removable.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.980
The best thing about CraftBot is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.780
that anybody can use it, and it works

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.590
right out of the box.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.200
CraftBot was created by experienced

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.330
hardware and software developers working

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.909
in the industry for over a decade. Our

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.799
printers are made from high-quality

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.650
laser cut metals and CNC milled

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.400
components. They incorporate an extremely

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.149
detailed 100 micron/layer resolution.

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.840
With a CraftBot you can also use any

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.329
1.75mm filament

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.799
allowing you to choose the one that best

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.560
fits your budget. Our printing material

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.780
is environmentally friendly and presents

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.030
no hazard to your personal health. The

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.470
printer can be controlled with CraftWare,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.530
our own 3D printer software. We've

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.840
developed a slicer which is also the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.970
fastest and most efficient in its class.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.790
The software is also available for

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.349
Windows and can be downloaded at any

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.019
time, and of course other operating

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.700
systems will be supported.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.160
By combining all these great features,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.019
CraftBot 3D printers have the

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.269
potential to change the way people do

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.940
3D printing. Our job is our passion, and

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.099
we would love to see people using this

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.370
innovative technology. With your support

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.379
you can be a part of this important

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.049
technology, and the foundation for a

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.549
greater innovative future.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.670
 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.959
