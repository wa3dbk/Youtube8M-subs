**Intro Jam Of Awesome**

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hey what's up Minecraftinites.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm here with Brollo who's running the J!NX Booth... Amazingly.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They have had a line here ALL day. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
How had all this been turning out?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Very exausted, but we're super stoked. People are loving all the stuff we brought to the con. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You ran out of the little creepers right?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Yea our glow in the dark exclusive Minecon, they sold out Immediately.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Fortunately we'll have more online in a month or so. Not the glow in the dark ones. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Aww man we didn't even get one of those! Warrgggg! *Man angry sounds*

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So that's something to look forward to, cause a lot ask about those. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You guys have jewelry now too, like the diamond necklace, any more coming?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Absolutely, we sold out of the diamond necklaces, but they are online now. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We also have pickaxe keychains, and Creeper necklaces that are pretty sweet. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
By the way I like your shoes, 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
They're called "The Creeper Sneakers". 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Haha "The Creeper Sneakers". 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Awesome man, what else can we maybe expect from J!NX? Any more ideas in the works?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We're super stoked about making custom clothing. Like custom creeper hoodies maybe in the work. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Some other hoodies we can't really talk about. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Also some really awesome hats. You might see if you took some other pictures with someone around. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Nicee, I have seen any just yet...

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Well keep your eyes peeled. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It's only 1 day still, this is ridiculous.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
A lot of time left, a lot of time left. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
By the way check out this line. You have A little storage compartment there. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And it's just been like this all day. Favorite cosplay you've seen so far?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
There was a "Link" - Creeper, combined the best of 2 worlds, was pretty awesome. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
That guy was huge.  - Yea he was ginormous

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Yea I watched him try to walk, he didn't do to well. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Yea he seem to of stayed in just 1 position a lot. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Well hey, love everything you guys are doing. Keep up the great work. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Thanks for watching Minecraftinites. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And expect lots more from J!NX of course. LATER! :D
