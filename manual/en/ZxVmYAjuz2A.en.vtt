00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.650
The Sewing Advisor is one of the best things
about the Husqvarna Viking sewing machines.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.650
Here's what we have.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.490
Down here along the bottom row we are going
to master what these symbols are all about.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.650
Take a look at the top of the screen.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.770
We see where it says B, woven medium.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.920
That's the fabric that is currently selected,
and the machine is set up for that fabric

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.920
type.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.720
A, B, and C are woven fabrics.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.550
As we touch A, we get to woven light, your
lighter weight fabrics, your silk, satin,

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.890
slippery stuff, netting, that type of thing.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.320
Set the machine for that particular fabric.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.170
Then when you sew, you're going to have the
right settings.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.900
B, woven medium; C, woven heavy, like your
denim, your canvases, your home dec fabrics.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.630
That would be a great setting to start off
with.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.670
Let's go ahead and just quickly jump down
to this bottom row.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.930
These are the techniques.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.219
As you pick the pitch number or technique
number 1, it's going to say a seam.

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:11.709
A seam on this heavier fabric is going to
show you a longer stitch line.

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:14.240
If we do a lightweight fabric ... Well, look.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.159
The stitch line changes to 2.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.170
It knows that those are the correct settings
for that fabric.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.030
One other thing that it's going to also do
is adjust the pressure of the foot.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.759
It makes it more or less, depending on your
fabric that you choose.

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:29.759
Let's go on.

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.329
D, E, and F are going to be for stretch fabrics.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.159
We have stretch light.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.159
Did you notice?

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.799
We're on "seam," but the stitch changed altogether
and it moved the needle position to be in

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.159
a different location.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.409
How nice is that?

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.959
If you're a newer sewer and you're trying
out different fabrics, this is your little

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:52.780
sewing person to help you pick the right settings.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.840
E would be for stretch medium and then F would
be for stretch heavy, like a fleece or something

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.029
of that category, heavy sweatshirts.

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:05.149
G is for leather and vinyl.

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.560
Now as we do a seam, your stitch is the same.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.590
But look, you are going to be guided to use
your non-stick foot H. That's why that foot

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.159
changes on-screen, because we've told it the
leather/vinyl setting.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.680
That's going to make it so it doesn't stick
to those fabrics.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.769
It's great.

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:22.909
Let's go ahead and go back.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.569
We'll just do woven medium, and let's go across
the bottom techniques.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.239
Number 2 is going to be an overcast, as you
want to go over the edge of your fabric, secure

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.439
the raw edges so they don't come undone.

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.690
It will also recommend a foot, an overlock
foot J, that's going to be in your accessory

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.690
box.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.690
Just look for it; put it on.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.690
You're set to go.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.690
Settings are set.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.750
The pressure's set, and the right stitch length
is set.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.810
Number 3, technique number 3, is your seam
and overcast.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.400
Same foot, but a different type of stitch.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.420
That's going to be because it's going to put
a stitching line in while it's overcasting

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.230
the edge, kind of like a 2-part stitch all
done in one pass as you sew.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.379
Number 4 is a basting line, so that's going
to be a super long stitch for you and quickly

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.030
give you just a basting stitch, see if you
have your fabric properly put together.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.650
If you need to alter it from there, that stitch
is really easy to take out.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.920
Number 5, blind hem stitch.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.000
What's nice is, sometimes I don't remember
where that stitch is up on the top rows.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.159
Technique number 5, if you can't remember,
just push them all until you find the right

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.700
time that it says "blind hem."

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.140
It tells you to put the blind hem foot on.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.549
That will change based on your fabric selection.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:42.030
Also, you'll get to a stretch blind hem stitch
if you had a stretchy fabric selected.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.030
Number 6 is actually a regular hem that will
change based on your fabric you are choosing.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.030
See?

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.499
With the stretchy heavy you'll get a different
looking stitch.

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:54.450
Sometimes, too, stretch medium.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.810
It just made the stitch a little bit narrow.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.879
Stretch light is going to do just a regular
stretch stitch.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.920
The last one is the buttonhole.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.080
It's going to pick the right buttonhole for
your fabric.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.859
Let's switch these around a little bit.

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:14.200
You'll notice it will change the different
foot, and sometimes even recommend that you

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.450
cord the buttonhole, which we will show you
in the buttonhole videos.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.590
Check those out.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.759
Sometimes they'll recommend stabilizer for
the stretch light.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:25.759
Let's see here.

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:26.759
Let's do woven light.

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.970
Also stabilizer is recommended, and it has
a different looking buttonhole.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:31.970
Take a look.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.400
Use this to your advantage, because it's also
adjusting the pressure of your foot and making

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.650
it just perfect.
