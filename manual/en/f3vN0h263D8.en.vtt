00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.310
Hey it's Bauer, ok so you've got your 1080p, high definition televsion,

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.150
you've got all of your HD cable boxes,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.670
everything you're doing is in full HD, but the DVDs,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.690
not so much, you've amassed this giant collection of DVDs over the years,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.880
and maybe they don't look quite right on your old DVD player now

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.740
with this brand new TV.  You don't want to replace all your DVDs with new Blu-rays,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.960
right? Because that's going to cost an absolute fortune.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.740
So why not look into getting something like the Toshiba XD-E500,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.810
which is an upconverting DVD player. This DVD player will actually convert

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.390
your standard DVDs, that you're watching right now, into 720p, 1080i, or 1080 p

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.190
or even 4080p actually if you'd like, on this machine,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.110
so that you can watch all of your old DVDs in much, much higher detail

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.700
on your cool 1080p TV. In fact, behind me right now,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.600
we got some cartoons playing, and this is actually playing--

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.720
this is a standard DVD playing at 1080p on this screen back here,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.300
and it looks really, really awesome. In fact, look, I'm in the water,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.200
it's like I'm swimming right now, see you can't even tell the difference,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.490
because it's that good, it's 1080p.  I really do feel like I'm swimming,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.230
I look at this, it's kind of freaking me out a little bit.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.920
So, now you can watch all of your DVDs in full 1080p resolution--Woah God!--

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.540
which is actually really, really cool. That kind of freaked me out.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.680
So check it out, it's got a few modes for upconverting, right?

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.810
So we can either do-- you can choose which resolution

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.230
you want to upconver to, but you can also choose the type of upconversion

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.630
that you want to do.  As you can see, it says XDE right here,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.210
there are three different XDE modes on this DVD player.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.910
One is going to help you enhance and sharpen the detail on the screen,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.440
which is going to give you crisper lines and make things a little sharper.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.490
One of them is for richer color, which is going to give you a brighter,

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.220
more vibrant color range; and then there's also a setting

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.510
for contrast enhancement, which will allow you to better differentiate

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.480
between the blacks and the whites, or the darks and the lights on your TV screen.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.970
So it's going to look--it's just going to enhance the general appearance of what you have going on.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.460
Now, it's quite easy to use and get through, actually.  All you do is click the--

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.200
when you click the set up button on this thing,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.660
it takes you to a nice onscreen menu that's going to allow you to set up

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.790
all of your options inside. You do have multiple different outputs.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.480
You can do component, you can do S-Video, you can do HDMI,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.700
you can choose which resolution you're upconverting to within in the box,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.370
and also, the machine will-- Oh, I lost it, because  I changed the conversion--

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.400
and it also will also set up all of your languages and stuff like that,

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.460
as well, in the menu system. Now over here, on the back,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.120
is where all of your hook ups are. If we take a look here,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.270
here on the back of the Toshiba XD-E500,

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.100
this is where all of your hook ups are back here. As you can see,

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.920
all of your components are right here, along the top, as well as a composite video output

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.400
right here.  You do have a coax digital audio output,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.500
as well as a right and left standard RCA coax digital output or analog output as well.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.860
S-Video output, for hooking up to your TV here, and also,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.710
an HDMI output, for hooking up to your HDMI capable set,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.990
and an optical audio output for hooking up to your home theater system.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.610
Really, this is a life-saver for you, especially if you have a giant DVD collection,

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.680
and you're just not down with upgrading the entire thing, heck, you probably can't

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.380
upgrade the entire thing.  You probably have tons of DVDs that aren't even available

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.450
in Blu-ray.  This is going to allow you to watch them in a much better resolution,

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.890
really see them as they were meant to be seen on your big screen, high resolution TV.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.450
So this will allow you to save a lot of money, especially considering

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.910
the DVD player's not very expensive. The difference between this,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.700
and buying a whole bunch of new Blu-rays is immense.  This thing's basically free

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.750
when you look at it in those terms. So, it's the Toshiba XD-E500,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.350
it's going to upconvert, and make all your old DVDs look spectacular.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.100
It will even make you sometimes think that you're lost in the ocean...See? Oooh.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.210
Who made this movie anyway, like look how weird those animals look,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.210
alright, so got to get out of here. Go check it out,

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.830
