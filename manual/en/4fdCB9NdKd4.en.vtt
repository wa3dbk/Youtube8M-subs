00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.070
Hi this is Jeff Wong with Expert Village and
today we're going to learn the basics of maintaining

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.370
your vehicle. In this next section we're going
to be looking at the tire and looking at the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.190
tread wear and how it relates to the alignment
of the car. So if you look here you can see

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:24.630
a pretty new tire. If you take note, inside
the tire there are slightly raised bumps both

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.869
in the center and along the edge of the tire.
These are the tire wear marks. When these

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.100
wear marks are reached, when the tire is worn
down to these marks the tire is close to being

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.790
replaced. Now, if your tire does not have
these wear marks and you want to check a section

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.329
of the tire that doesn't have these marks
available for the correct depth, you can use

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:57.440
a penny. Now if you take the penny and you
notice the top of the hairline of Abraham

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.500
Lincoln on the penny, you can take the penny
and turn it upside down and put it inside

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:11.390
the tread. Now if the tread is shallower than
the gap from the edge of the penny, the Abraham

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.550
Lincoln's head the tread has been worn down
too much and the tire probably needs to be

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:25.150
replaced. So you can see along the inside
of this tire that some of the tread is shallower

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.530
than this gap on the penny but towards the
center of the tire there is still plenty of

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:40.860
tread left. So if you see wear along the inside
and the outside of the tire, but very little

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.490
wear along the inside, your tire may be under
inflated causing the inside to sink or be

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.250
pushed into the tire. Now, if you only see
heavy wear along the middle of the tire, but

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.670
the outside of the tire's are relatively unworn.
You tire may be over inflated or have too

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.250
much air in it. So you may need to adjust
your tire pressure accordingly. Now if you

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:15.110
tread wear is heavy on either the inside or
the outside or may be one corner of your vehicle

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.130
on only one tire or may be just the front
or may be just the rear tires, you may want

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.340
to bring your car in and have the alignment
checked.
