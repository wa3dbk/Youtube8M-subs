00:00:00.241 --> 00:00:03.503
The "Countdown Chapters" Game!

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:09.904
Let's begin with Marcão and Andy.
Stand up you both.

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:17.139
The "Countdown Chapters" Game is about
creating a story, like the name says,

00:00:17.139 --> 00:00:19.519
with five chapters.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:25.362
But there's a challenge in this game, I will tell you,

00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:30.734
but before that I will get
the title of our improvisation:

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.906
"A snake-bitten dog is afraid of sausages"

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.059
They will have to create a
five-chapter story, but the catch is

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.138
they have only 30 seconds
to do - or not - this challenge.

00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:57.186
This is basically five or six seconds per chapter!

00:00:58.788 --> 00:01:05.354
"Countdown Chapters" Game. A snake-bitten dog
is afraid os sausages.

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:07.714
Go.

00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:12.093
- Chapter One!
- Rex, fetch!

00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:15.294
Chapter Two!

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.673
Chapter Three!
Oh, Rex!

00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:26.841
Ten seconds.

00:01:26.908 --> 00:01:31.475
Chapter Four!
Rex, let's eat, come on!

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:36.466
Chapter Five!
I've made this...

00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:52.932
Daniel and Elidio, step up, please.
"Countdown Chapters" Game.

00:01:52.932 --> 00:01:56.115
And the improvisation title is:

00:01:56.115 --> 00:02:00.969
"Is there someone uglier than me?"

00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:08.987
But the challenge now is
five chapters in 20 seconds.

00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:13.169
20 seconds, 5 chapters...

00:02:13.262 --> 00:02:16.785
Four - thanks, man - four...

00:02:17.518 --> 00:02:22.280
Four seconds per chapter!
It's a lot of time!

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.145
I will warn you when there's five seconds left.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:32.452
Is there someone uglier than me?
"Countdown Chapters". Go.

00:02:32.994 --> 00:02:34.598
Chapter One!

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.374
Is there someone uglier than me?

00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:39.032
Chapter Two!

00:02:40.943 --> 00:02:42.741
Chapter Three!

00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:44.726
Chapter Four!

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:46.921
Chapter Five!

00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:04.849
Ha-ha, very funny, ha-ha.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.014
You guys applaud anything.

00:03:08.014 --> 00:03:10.075
It was for the sake of the scene, Marcio.

00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:13.242
I think you're fucking hot!

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:17.376
IMPROVÁVEL
Probably a good show.
