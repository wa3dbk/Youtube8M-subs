00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.560
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.710
The weapons lessons
are interesting.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.860
They are fun because
we do learn how to

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.780
actually use this.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.410
I mean, today we'll learn about
how all the parts work.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.470
That's a bit handy considering
we've had them for a week, so

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.543
we know what's going on now.

00:00:24.543 --> 00:00:25.960
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.350
So on today's lesson we're going
to go on with the ADF

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.710
system of honours and awards.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.070
"The Victoria Cross is awarded
to those individuals who, in

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.330
the presence of the enemy,
perform acts of the most

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.880
conspicuous gallantry, daring,
valour, or self-sacrifice."

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.310
You'll be able to
identify current

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.280
military honours and awards.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.218
Also outline ADF system
of honours and awards.

00:00:50.218 --> 00:00:52.608
Detail, take up the weapon.

00:00:52.608 --> 00:00:55.920
And [? start. ?]

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.120
F88 Steyr--

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.850
standard issue for the Air
Force and the military in

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.470
general in Australia.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.700
Yeah, it's got a bit
of kick to it.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.150
It's not bad.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.190
Cool fun.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.630
There are recruits around here
today to do their live fire

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.910
range firing.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.970
They do a weapons handling
test prior to coming

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.575
out into the range.

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:16.460
Then they'll come out here and
do three or four serials to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.655
improve their weapons handling,
and for future

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:20.110
careers later on should
they be deployed.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.430
The nervousness is not so much
firing the weapons, but

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.820
passing the tests.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.310
So we're all really eager
to get out there and

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.230
shoot down the range.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.340
But it's mainly the scores
we're getting at it that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.230
[INAUDIBLE] make you nervous.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.290
Definitely excited about
being out here.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.790
They get on the bus. "Well, can
we do this?" And there's a

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.980
lot of competition amongst
themselves about who is the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.060
better shot.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.585
They liked the competition
between themselves.

00:01:45.585 --> 00:01:47.016
Gas, gas, gas.

00:01:49.878 --> 00:01:53.920
We're checking to see that the
hood of the jacket is situated

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.350
correctly around
the respirator.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.240
Because if it isn't, obviously
a chemical agent and so forth

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.340
can still get inside the
respirator, soak through our

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.330
skin, and basically kill
us straight away.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.190
Now, while you're here, you're
put under pressure.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.140
And there's a reason for that,
because we are resetting your

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.890
stress levels, your ability
to cope, with

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.490
being put under pressure.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.510
Anyone going to give up?

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.820
No, sir.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.270
That's good to hear.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.030
Keep going, because lots of
people have done this before.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.036
We're sure you can do it.

00:02:26.036 --> 00:02:27.286
[INAUDIBLE].

00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:30.530
Left, right, in.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.820
I love drill.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.960
It's one of my favourite
things in the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.200
actual course itself.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.075
It is a specific tool.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.270
It's a bonding thing.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.910
It's a teamwork thing.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.700
One, two, three, hut.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.920
It's attention to detail,
working together, teamwork.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.860
One, two, three, hut.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.830
And that aura that it creates
is brilliant, never changes.
