00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.360
I'm simply special effects love

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.139
george's reason the admitted that he
will be David Prowse

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.750
he thought that was his Darth Vader the
sky over six-foot

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.040
16 have feet all and on

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.630
The uniform the constant with a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.340
disliked on Scottish accent and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.500
non the base but more like a tener and
is a very effective voice

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.449
but draws thought he wanted a pardon the
expression

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.030
darker Voice so you hire as a guy

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.820
born in Mississippi raised in Michigan
who stutters

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.809
and that's the voice is messed me II got
I looked up

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.590
in the room from all the so-called
handicaps I and looked out the good

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.030
a job baby seven thousand dollars and
I'm

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.879
and I thought those good money and I got
the B a.m.

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.420
a voice on on on a movie it was great
fun to be part of that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.659
I looked it like an actor would move
voice would you could live sinking

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.720
but there was no lip so I was lucky

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.090
I just watched his more his body
language in

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.729
and down in the second one

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.299
accused in %uh because by known David
Prowse knew his voice was not going to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.250
be used so you just saw through through
the mines in

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.759
accused who gave me a soundtrack with
him doing the voices of

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.020
leader cue yesterday twice as likely as
that the 800

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.170
unlimited you badly by it was scary as
hell

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.200
cues that was scary than I could ever be

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.530
I remembered the the second Woodman
George had a chance to cover

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.740
Kong counsel me here we say we don't
know what we did right

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.500
so this is try what we did

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.060
and iced then natural I want to make got
bit more interesting

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.659
more subtle you know more
psychologically you or you did in the

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:02.219
knowns a

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.290
he said no no what movie finding out is

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.539
you gotta keep his voice on a very
narrow band inflection

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.539
cuz you human really so that that was
the answer

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.120
after
