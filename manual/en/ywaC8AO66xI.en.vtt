Video 4 Transcript: Cooking with Fresh Fruit
from Dr. Preston Maring’s Kitchen

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.940
Hi.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.940
Welcome to my kitchen!

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.070
We’re all told that we are supposed to eat
five servings of fruits and vegetables everyday.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.110
Fruits and vegetables are loaded with vitamins
and nutrients.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.619
Well I like to eat fruits and vegetables because
they taste good.

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.150
I love to have fresh fruit in my smoothies
in the morning.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:42.420
I like putting fresh strawberries on a spinach
salad, with some pecans and feta cheese.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.879
I also love a good mango salsa topped with
pan grilled fish.

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.989
Fruits are also great in desserts.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.379
Today we’re going to make fresh peach and
blueberry crisp.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.089
We’re going to use fresh and organically
grown peaches and blueberries.

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:07.240
If you have a choice when you buy your food,
buy food grown without pesticides.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.780
You’re buying food that is good for you,
it’s good for your family, and it’s good

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.030
for the environment.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.620
It’s also good for the farmers who grow
the food for you.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.370
So we’re just going to mix this fruit together
in the bowl.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.460
Peaches and blueberries.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.400
Let’s just put in some white whole wheat
flour.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.250
A little bit of sugar.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.340
You don’t need too much because the fruit
is so sweet.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.722
And a little touch of cinnamon.

00:01:38.722 --> 00:01:42.250
This is my favorite tool here.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.880
We’re just going to use this to stir.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.550
Sometimes I get right into it with my hands.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.810
It makes it all easier.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.450
That just coats the fruit a bit.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.850
This wonderful fruit we have needs a good
topping.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.410
First we’re going to start with some oats.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.990
Good whole grains.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.710
Next, we’re going to add some whole wheat
flour.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.560
Walnuts, a great source of healthy fats.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.140
A little brown sugar always tastes good in
a crisp.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.970
We’ll add some cinnamon, a little pinch
of salt.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.990
And then, we’ve got some butter cut up into
little tiny chunks.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:37.130
So at this point, I just get in and work it
with my fingers, and work in the butter so

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:46.180
that it’s in little tiny pieces all mixed
in, and the topping is ready to go.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.050
Let’s put it all together in this pie plate.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.820
Ahhh!

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.590
Perfect!

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.720
Spread this around a little bit, so that it’s
evenly distributed.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.830
Scatter the topping on.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.870
All right!

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.580
Spread it around evenly best you can.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.760
And then, time to go into the oven at 375.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.650
The oven has been preheating the whole time
while we have been preparing the rest of the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.459
dish.

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:29.821
We’re going to bake this for 35 to 40 minutes,
until the topping is brown, and the fresh

00:03:29.821 --> 00:03:33.270
fruit juices are bubbling up the sides.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.300
The crisp should be ready.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.060
Let’s take it out of the oven.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.060
Ahh!

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.599
It looks great!

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:48.390
Let’s let it cool for a while, maybe 10
or 15 minutes.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.850
Then we’ll be ready to dig in.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.810
It’s cooled down, and it’s ready to eat.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.319
Let’s take a bite.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.060
Boy!

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.480
That is really delicious!

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:18.630
If I can make this in my kitchen, you can
too!

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.350
Yes indeed!
