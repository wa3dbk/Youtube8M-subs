00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.830
Okay, Ian Harford's been out with me this
morning. We're in glorious Hampshire. Two

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.000
to three hours, we've managed to grass a buck.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.229
And now I'm going to perform the field gralloch.
What I normally do is I open mine up, then

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.470
suspend it and fetch everything out using
gravity. So, I'm about to perform the gralloch

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.000
and I'm gonna start by hooking it.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:13.970
Make an incision down there. Turn him on his
back. Go to the penis, down either side. Do

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.640
it carefully.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.650
Down to the anal passage. Run it down like
that.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.650
Get any rumen out so they don't fall back
down into the carcass.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.670
Take the penis off, right there. A little
bit of rumen coming out.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:48.800
I'm just going to stroke the stomach with
my knife. Put my finger over the tip of my

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:57.000
knife, push it in, taking it right up until
it's under the ribcage.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.540
Get my knife flat and cut along the brisket.
Then score down there, right across the top

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.000
of the ribcage. Where's my saw?

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:20.020
Then get my chest saw. Bring it up through
the ribcage.

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.650
Just cutting the bladder off. He was laying
down and I barked him to stand up. So you

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.069
can see that he's got a full bladder and we
don't want any of that urine getting into

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.160
the carcass.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:14.000
Okay, I'm gonna reach inside and pull out
the anal passage that remains. Let that down there.

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:19.129
 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:25.620
Cutting into the diaphragm. You can see there
is a little bit of rumen content there. But

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.009
we're going to get everything down using gravity,
let it all drain out there so we're not touching

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:38.000
the haunches or fillets which is our most
expensive and tastiest meat.

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.000
Mr Harford those bullets are too good.

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.000
And now follow down either side.

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:09.629
You can see there, it's rib to rib, but the
impact of the bullet has ruptured the gut

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:20.379
and we got gut content there. What we haven't
got is gut content all over the tenderloins

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:27.550
or all over the haunches at the back. What
I'm gonna down is wipe it all out and downwards,

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.830
down through the neck. So I can put it to
the game dealer with a nice clean carcass.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Going to get some dry paper.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.669
Quite a few people wash them out. I prefer
not to do that. I'd rather dry wipe it and

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.979
get everything out, get everything down through
the cheap cuts, through the neck.

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.409
There you are. Even though we had quite a bit of
rumen content in there, it's all nice and

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:22.409
cleaned out. You can see the entry hole there
and the exit hole there from the Lapua bullet

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:31.689
that Ian shot. Rib to rib, nothing damaged
at all. Nice one for the butcher, I think

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:35.000
Wildy might be jointing this up later on.

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:49.409
