00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:03.235
So I'm here at Apple's
event in San Francisco

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:05.590
where they just announced
details about the highly

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.550
anticipated Apple Watch.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.015
So I had five questions
going into this event today.

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:11.140
Some of them were answered.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.260
Some of them are
going to have to wait

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.426
till we get back to our lab.

00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:18.600
First up, how much are
these things going to cost?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.510
We knew going in that it
was going to start at $350.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.980
And that's what you'll pay
for the Apple Watch Sport.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.750
The larger edition of the
Apple Watch Sport is $399.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.360
The stainless steel watches
are going to cost a bit more.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.480
They start at $549 and go
up to you almost $1,100.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.230
For the 18 karat gold
Apple Watch edition,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.930
that's where you're really
going to spend the big bucks.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.460
It starts at $10,000.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.050
Next up, fitness
and health features.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.949
Going into this event,
there were some rumors

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:47.740
that apple couldn't
get that stuff to work.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.620
And we're going to actually
have a test that in our labs

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.390
to know for sure.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.000
But nevertheless,
Apple is promising

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.375
that the heart
rate monitor built

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:55.690
into the back of the
device should work fine.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.330
And it also has its
built-in fitness apps

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.400
that can track your
movements and even

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.790
remind you to get up if you've
been sitting for too long.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.950
One of the really
important things

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.060
that people are wondering about
with the watch is battery life.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.029
Apple has been promising
all day battery life.

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:09.320
Today, they put a number to it.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.764
They said it should
last for 18 hours.

00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:14.180
Next up, how does this compete
with the other devices that

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.680
are on the market already?

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.880
Samsung has an entire
Galaxy Gear series.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.225
And Motorola has a really
impressive Moto 360

00:01:21.225 --> 00:01:22.908
that we've liked in our labs.

00:01:22.908 --> 00:01:24.616
Apple Watch Sport
seems poised to compete

00:01:24.616 --> 00:01:26.510
with these other smart
watches on the market.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.050
But with the stainless steel
Apple Watch and the Apple Watch

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.050
edition, they don't seem
to be trying to compete

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.130
with those guys at all.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.480
In fact, they're looking to
sell against the Rolexes,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.897
Breitlings, and TAG
Heuers of the world.

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:38.730
That's an interesting
market for them to be,

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.885
because those watches are
the type that you hand down

00:01:40.885 --> 00:01:42.135
from generation to generation.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.245
And it's very possible
that in two to three years,

00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:45.620
the technology in
the Apple Watch

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.787
will be completely outmoded.

00:01:46.787 --> 00:01:48.620
Then there's the toughest
question to answer

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.140
is, does it live up to the hype?

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.690
Well, we tried the thing
on, and what's interesting

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.186
is that they
weren't tremendously

00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:56.060
different than what we
saw a couple of months

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.377
ago at the event in September.

00:01:57.377 --> 00:01:59.585
They really do feel like
jewelry, especially the gold

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:00.826
and the stainless steel one.

00:02:00.826 --> 00:02:02.450
And one of the great
things about today

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.060
was that we actually got
to play with the watch

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.010
and see them in action.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.620
And they worked kind
of as you'd expect.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.240
We're never going to know
for sure whether or not

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.289
this watch is all it's
cracked up until we

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.470
live with it for awhile.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.095
So we're really
looking forward to when

00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:14.330
we get this in our labs.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.370
Pre-orders start on
April 10th, and the watch

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.442
is available to the
public on the 24th.

00:02:18.442 --> 00:02:19.900
Check back with us
soon, we'll have

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.660
lab results on the Apple Watch.
