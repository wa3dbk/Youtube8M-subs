Hi I’m Stephen Bent and I’m a professional
juggler. Today I’m representing ExpertVillage.com.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.020
Now we’re going to learn a basic three club
trick called under the leg. To begin with

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.760
we’re going to practice it with just one
club, put the club in your right hand, lift

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:37.600
up your right leg and throw it under. Then
try it underneath your left leg and throw.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.600
Remember it’s very important to match up
your right hand with your right leg and your

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.990
left hand with your left leg. If you try to
cross it’s much more difficult and awkward.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:01:07.630
If you feel ready with that, pick up a second
club, try throwing the second club then throw

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:32.929
the other one under your leg like this.
Again make sure to practice this on both sides,

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:39.789
once you feel ready with that pick up the
third club, juggle all three lift up the leg

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:46.450
and throw underneath it. Try it on the other
side. You can even eventually learn to juggle

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.750
all under one side while balancing on the
other leg or even ultimately the same club

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.599
under each leg or even every club under every
leg.
