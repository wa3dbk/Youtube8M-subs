00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:01.489
Dr. Sonu Ahluwalia, M.D. Orthopedic Surgeon
_ La Peer Surgery Center _ Hip Replacement

00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:03.940
Are worn-out joints keeping you sideline from
the activities you love?

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.910
Check out how a doctor got his game back and
why colleagues and team mates now joke that

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.590
he’s practically bionic.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.090
He jumps, he hops, he stretches and climbs
and that’s just in his spare time.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.689
When he’s on the clock, anesthesiologist
Dr. Calvin Johnson works hard to calm patient’s

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:24.689
fears.

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:25.789
He’s been in their shoes.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.340
I explain to them that I’ve had anesthesia,
that I’ve had surgeries.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.640
More times that he can count most of doctor
Johnson’s major joints have been repaired,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.210
rebuild or replaced.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.110
We’re doing so much stuff that our joints
wear out.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.140
Orthopedic Surgeon Dr. Sonu Ahluwalia says
knee and hip replacement surgeries, in his

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.790
practice, have tripled since 2004.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.750
Now, people want choices.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.980
They’re like: “I’m not sitting around,
I’m not hobbling around.”

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.270
At age 46 I still want to play basketball.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.030
Dr. Johnson has been a fitness fanatic all
his life.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.640
He was a college basketball star and a one
time NBA hopeful.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.210
He gave up his new dreams to become a doctor,
but he never kept back the intensity of his

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.210
drills.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.600
By the time he was 40, his hips started hurting.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.920
As it progressed, the pain got more and more
severe.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.570
Eventually the pain was there 24/7, a threat
not only to his workouts, but also his job.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.869
You can’t deliver health care if you’re
in pain.

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.159
That’s a big distraction.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.939
Dr. Johnson’s agony is caused by arthritis
in his hips.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.939
Here’s how an arthritic hip looks like in
an x-ray.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.630
All the cartilage is gone.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.159
Our arthritis hip pain isn’t located where
most people expect.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.119
It’s actually in the groin . That’s where
we feel it.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.530
At 46, with his job and his lifestyle on the
line, Dr. Johnson had a tough decision to

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.280
make, whether or not to undergo a double hip
replacement.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.030
It’s surgery and anesthesia and it’s nerve
wrack, I have to admit I was afraid.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.109
Hip replacement involves taking out the arthritic
joint and replacing it with a man made one.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.119
There’s the ball that we put in.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.109
This is the stem that holds it in place.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.080
Dr. Johnson had both hips replaced in 2006.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.510
When I woke up, the amazing thing was that
the pain was gone.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.140
He was back to work 9 days after surgery,
back to his workouts 4 months after his second

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.560
hip was replaced.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.340
It’s been five years since the replacement
and Dr. Johnson still carries his x-rays on

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.340
his phone.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.540
He’s not afraid to brag to his opponents.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.470
That’s what I played on today.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.230
Two artificial hips.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.420
Dr. Ahluwalia wishes Dr. Johnson would take
it a little easier.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.010
He warns joint replacement surgeries should
never be taken lightly.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.580
We can never replicate what used to be, but
I think that you should have a pretty good

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.730
ability to do all the things you did before.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.840
He doesn’t know how to take it easy.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.450
The average life-spend of an artificial hip
is 15 to 20 years, the more stress you place

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.840
on it, the quicker it might be needing replacement
again.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.590
To keep your natural joints healthy as long
as possible Dr. Ahluwalia advises keep your

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.620
weight into control, stay fit, but avoid high
impact exercises.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.320
