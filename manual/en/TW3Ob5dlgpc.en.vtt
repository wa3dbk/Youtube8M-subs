00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.733
- Are you watching
"The Bachelor"?

00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.700
[cheers and applause]

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.000
Mm.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.700
If you're not familiar
with the show,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.666
it's what would happen
if tequila built a theme park...

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.066
[laughter]

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.233
Is the best way
I can describe it.

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:16.600
It's on tonight,
and if you haven't been watching

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.133
and you're like,
"Oh, I can't watch now

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.700
'cause I didn't watch
in the beginning,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.766
I'll catch you up on everything
that's happened so far.

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.433
- Chris is dead sexy.

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:27.733
His smile?
Oh!

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.000
It's just a panty dropper.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.533
- I wanted to ham it up for you
today.

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.600
[both laugh]
- [imitates pig snorting]

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.766
- I'm from Illinois actually,
so pretty close to you.

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.333
Oh, my goodness.
Okay.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.633
- Bring on the weirdos.

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:42.333
- I rammed my head
into the brick wall.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.333
- Can I ask you
a quick question?

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.600
- Absolutely.
- Do y'all inseminate hogs?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.166
- Do you believe in aliens?

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.933
- And we see, like,
a body come in,

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.166
and we're screaming.

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.166
And it's Chris.

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.866
[laughs]

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.366
- Don't be weirded out.

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.266
I'm only kind of a stalker.

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.433
Don't use that.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:00:59.900
- When Ashley told me
she was a virgin,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.233
I was like, "Seriously?"

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:04.166
Like, I'm so jealous.

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.466
Like, I can't even use that
'cause I have a kid.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.666
- She's drunk tonight.

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.033
She was drunk yesterday.

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:10.233
She was drunk the day before.

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:11.900
She's gonna be drunk tomorrow.
- [bleep].

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.100
[slurring]
I don't know how.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.366
I need to be closer
to the sink.

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.566
- Oh, my God.

00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:19.733
- You don't want to lose
the whole world, right?

00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:20.733
- No.

00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:24.166
- But actually, you don't want
to gain the whole world.

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.500
- I love makin' babies.
- [laughs]

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.966
I do too.
- [laughs]

00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:27.966
Juelia.

00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.200
Juelia.
- [bleep].

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.500
- Sorry.
[women gasp]

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.066
- [cackling]

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:38.233
- Crazy.

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:39.233
- Ah.

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:42.233
[cheers and applause]

00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:47.266
Oh.

00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:49.233
I am not putting my money
on the virgin.

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:50.666
[laughter]

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.366
And "The Bachelor"
airs tonight at 8:00,

00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.100
sponsored by regret.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.466
[laughter]
