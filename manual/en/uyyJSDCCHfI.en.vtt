00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.320
This car, is an old 'acquaintance' of mine

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.160
Having had the privilege of driving it for the first time,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
eleven years ago

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.760
For the wedding occasion of its, still, current owner

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.620
In a memorable trip from Lisbon to Leiria

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.820
This 964 Turbo that i'm driving right now

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.720
is part of the first life cycle of the 964 generation

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.300
This first generation's engine is a 3.3 litre, turbocharged, 6 cylinder boxer

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.820
that was picked up from its first generation, the 930.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.820
Back then, with 260hp.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.920
In this case, with 320hp

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.240
and a very generous torque of 450Nm

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.600
although only available at 4.500rpm

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.960
peak power is reached at 5.750rpm

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.720
The sensory experience in driving this car is that we have to be alert

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.500
We have to be focused, beacuse this is not an easy car to drive

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.840
If u happen to drive a 996 Turbo, with 420hp, meaning an extra 100hp and all wheel drive

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.620
u'll soon realize that it is a much friendlier car to drive

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.600
and with which we can rapidly drive a lot faster... but in this case...

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.400
...u better take it easy!

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.600
It's amazing how we can feel everything in this car... steering is ultra sharp and direct

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.560
the brakes have an endless power

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.640
and every sort of 'in car' mechanical noises you can think of, in here, are absolutely omnipresent!

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.560
Keeping a close watch on the turbo 'boost' gage

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.300
you can easily sense when the power is building up...

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.340
..and when it does, is quite an avalanche!

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.340
The steering offset to the right is enormous!

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.400
When u leave a modern car and get inside this one, it almost seems like there was a engineering mishap...

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.100
because the left tip of the steering wheel is pointing towards the middle of our chest!

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.520
The pedals are also placed to the far right

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.360
and in here you step on the clutch, where in a 'normal' car you would have the brake pedal!

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.580
It's impossible not to get a huge smile on your face for any 5 minutes you get to drive a car like this

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.180
Christ!!

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.080
The sound is so purely Porsche... it's fantastic!

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.140
It's in an addictive way this engine delivers its power...

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.080
...it's all or nothing!

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.540
And it's fun as hell, damn!

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.380
What a powerhouse!

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.880
For a 1991 car, a top speed of around 280kph

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.780
and a 0-100kph figure of less than 5 secs...

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.060
It's staggering! It's staggering!

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.600
What's surprising is that despite all this firepower, horsepower madness

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.820
and fantastic performance

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.840
the car is actually quite comfortable!

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.640
A very rigid chassis,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.660
nevertheless, suspension can be very tolerant

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.200
and even in terms of ground clearance, there are no problems with speed bumps, or going over a sidewalk

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.740
It's not a 'difficult' car to live with on a daily basis, quite the contrary!

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.560
We only have to be careful with the right pedal

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.980
because if you misbehave and taking into account that there are no traction controls here

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.840
...4.000kms or 5.000kms and you can shred a set of rear tires, know what i mean?

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.280
It's a pity that nowadays's electronics

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.720
is subverting the simple pleasure of driving in such a way

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.960
that any 18 year old 'newbie' jumps on a 500hp car

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.140
and spanks the hell out of it!

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.440
If he tries the same here...

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.740
It'll bite his head off!!

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.560
Does it make any sense, having so much electronic

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.300
helping us to pretend with have racing driver skills?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.660
I'd rather have a driving experience like the one in this car

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.380
The makes you work, that makes you focus

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.700
That makes you... exercise your muscles!

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.260
Electronics play a very important role in so many different areas

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.540
Co2 emissions, better fuel consumption...

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.040
...and safety above all

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.800
But for those that really appreciate 'driving'...

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.280
...the 'visceral' part of driving has to be there!

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.120
Thank you my friend Rui, for another wonderful experience behind the wheel of your fantastic car!

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.360
Everyone should be able to live the sensations of driving a car like this

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.680
...at least once in a lifetime!
