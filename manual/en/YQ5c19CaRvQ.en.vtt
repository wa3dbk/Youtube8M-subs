00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.540
Already … essentially … you need a flat-head

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.020
… in our case it’s a flathead not a Philip

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.200
to open up the fasteners … something else you might need also is a socket

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.530
this is a 9x32 … 9:32’s…

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.610
find the right socket for that … you might

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.759
need a pair of gloves… cuz it's really
dirty… dusty…

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:21.279
and messy around there … you might also need

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.560
a pair of goggles

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.610
cuz you don’t want stuff getting into your
eyes … and of course you’re gonna need…

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.489
ahh…some kind of

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.259
cleaner…. This is nice… cuz ahh…some
people you mix-in cleaners…

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.669
and ahh… you spray it on and then you have

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.220
to come back and

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.559
spray some water on it to wash it out… with
this you need “No Rinse” it’s self

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.859
spray-on… self-clean… and it’s for your

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:39.559
evaporator core (cleaner)…

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.120
…could pick one up …umm… at your local hardware for around 12 bucks I believe…

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.000
Already guys, we’re at the evaporator coil

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.219
now….

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:59.629
So to access it… most furnaces are pretty much the same principle… you would score…like that… to open up the tape….

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.670
One other thing is …ahh… if you’re attempting

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.280
to…

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.409
undo the panel and you meet a lot of resistance like in this case,

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.590
obviously there must be a fastener you've

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.270
forgot to remove… this was hidden

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.310
So… I’m gonna go ahead and take that off…so
just make sure you have everything

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.430
undone, don't force anything… this stuff

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.780
is really sharp… razor sharp… it’ll

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.880
cut you in a minute… it doesn't look too
bad, but I'm… still gonna go ahead and clean

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.890
that anyways…

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.270
so we have the “Evap Foam,” … “No Rinse”
cleaner…

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.790
and what I like to do is… spray a generous

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.899
amount usually…

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:48.460
at the top and let it slide down….

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.619
The only thing is ahh… before…

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.060
spraying, you wanna make sure you remove any heavy

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.060
collection… of dust or anything…okay…

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.060
so…

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.060
you’re gonna apply… the cover

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.560
back on…

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.130
…okay…so we went ahead and applied the
fasteners…and we’re gonna just

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.450
…ahh… finish-up the last one of ‘em…

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.940
and we’re all good… so now we’re gonna

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.850
…apply duct tape… to seal that off….

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.230
You may need to double-apply… just make

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.000
it secure… and you’re good….
