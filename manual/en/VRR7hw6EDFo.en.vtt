00:00:02.786 --> 00:00:03.204
Adventures in Service: 

00:00:03.204 --> 00:00:05.735
Climbing the New River Gorge, Part 3.

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:10.633
In the last installment of Adventures in Service, 

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:13.560
Venturers of crew 5.14 were rewarded for 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.814
their help with bolt maintenance by 

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.695
top rope climbing some of the New River Gorge's

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:18.065
classic rocks.

00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:20.991
While enjoying the challenges of the gorge's pristine

00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:23.167
sandstone, the crew received instruction

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:24.985
from local climbing guides from the 

00:00:24.985 --> 00:00:26.773
New River Alliance of Climbers.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.500
I've been climbing for about 25 years,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.233
guiding for 21 of those.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:33.344
I work for New River Mountain guides and I

00:00:33.344 --> 00:00:34.691
sit on the Board of Directors of the

00:00:34.691 --> 00:00:35.736
New River Alliance of Climbers.

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:38.150
I'm certified by the American Mountain Guides Association as a 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.867
single pitch instructor. And I had some goals

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:42.028
with these guys today.

00:00:42.028 --> 00:00:43.793
Two of them were pretty qualified and I

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:45.581
wanted to get them lead climbing.

00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:47.369
So I put them through a pretty rigorous lead test,

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:49.157
which they passed.

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:52.867
I just finished my lead test.

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:54.869
Leading is a different type of climbing where

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:56.216
you bring the rope up with you and you 

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:56.216
you bring the rope up with you and you 

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.632
clip in to the draws like that.

00:00:57.632 --> 00:01:00.200
It's important to know your skill level

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.856
with leading because there is a bigger risk of falling.

00:01:02.856 --> 00:01:05.167
So, taking the test assures our guide and

00:01:05.527 --> 00:01:08.197
ensures all of us that we have the required skill.

00:01:08.197 --> 00:01:09.474
That we're not going to wrap our foot behind the rope and

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:11.494
potentially injure ourselves.

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:14.629
I think it's important to show people how to rock climb because

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:17.160
it's a great sport. It's really fun and

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.157
it's a really good group activity.

00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:22.942
Rock climbing properly is extremely important because

00:01:22.942 --> 00:01:24.892
if you don't, there's a really good chance

00:01:24.892 --> 00:01:26.000
that you're going to get hurt.

00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:29.815
Clipping.

00:01:34.877 --> 00:01:35.689
Clipped.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.630
Lead climbers must take on a variety of challenges.

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:45.880
While physically and mentally engaged

00:01:45.883 --> 00:01:47.090
in the rock climbing itself,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.020
lead climbers must also understand how

00:01:49.018 --> 00:01:52.010
to use the appropriate gear to keep themselves and

00:01:52.013 --> 00:01:52.940
following climbers safe.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.370
They must learn to continually assess potential

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:58.120
risks and maintain situational awareness.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.430
So I just finished a solid 5.8 lead climb and

00:02:07.222 --> 00:02:08.930
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go down and

00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:10.820
clean it, which means I'm going to take all of these off

00:02:11.727 --> 00:02:13.400
so that our other climbers can use it as a

00:02:11.727 --> 00:02:13.400
so that our other climbers can use it as a

00:02:13.515 --> 00:02:14.700
top rope set-up.

00:02:13.515 --> 00:02:14.700
top rope set-up.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.790
Whether lead climbing, top roping or bouldering,

00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:20.470
climbing is an enjoyable activity with a

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:22.110
variety of challenges.

00:02:22.965 --> 00:02:24.000
The combination of physical conditioning, 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.050
technical skill and mental discipline needed to take part

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.050
technical skill and mental discipline needed to take part

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.470
in such an activity provides a great opportunity 

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:30.880
for personal growth.

00:02:31.626 --> 00:02:33.400
The Venturers in crew 5.14 went home having

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.770
grown as Scouts and climbers by seeking out

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:38.070
adventure in service here in the neighborhood of the

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:39.830
Summit Bechtel Reserve.

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:42.260
Join us next time on Adventures in Service.
