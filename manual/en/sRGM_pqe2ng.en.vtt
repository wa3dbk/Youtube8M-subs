00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.776
(attempting to call through Skype)

00:00:03.776 --> 00:00:05.015
(Ian) Shut up!!

00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:08.817
Look, Tiffany, it's been six months.

00:00:09.107 --> 00:00:11.437
You promised me you'd 
show me your face by now.

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:14.112
(distorted voice) Yeah, I-I don't know.

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:15.739
Tiffany, look.

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.375
You know I hate arguing with you
'cause I love you so much.

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:23.315
Just please show me your face.

00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:25.185
Okay, fine.

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:27.757
Just, I gotta fix my hair, okay?

00:00:27.757 --> 00:00:29.689
I'll be right back.
I promise.

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:31.726
Awesome.

00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:35.620
You're gonna make such a beautiful wife.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.311
(Tiffany) Okay, are you ready?

00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:39.347
- Yes!
- (Tiffany) Here I come.

00:00:39.347 --> 00:00:40.599
(power shuts down)

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:42.991
No. No!

00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:47.423
No! I was gonna see 
your possibly beautiful face!

00:00:47.643 --> 00:00:51.223
Tiffannnnnnnnnny!

00:00:51.363 --> 00:00:52.630
Dude, the power's out.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.142
Yeah, no sh*t.

00:00:54.142 --> 00:00:56.208
Okay, dude, we need to get 
the power back on right now

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:58.294
because I was in the middle 
of a super hot date

00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:00.674
with a possibly extremely hot girl.

00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:02.139
What are you talking about?

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:04.967
Okay, I really didn't want to tell 
you until I married her,

00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:07.658
but I've been kind of 
secretly dating this girl

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:11.477
for the past six months 
and I haven't exactly seen her face yet.

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:13.508
You can't be serious.

00:01:14.038 --> 00:01:15.201
Yeah, I'm serious.

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:18.018
If you're so serious, 
do the serious dance.

00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:20.429
(sighs)

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.115
(dubstep music)

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:28.824
My god, you are serious.

00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:31.422
Yeah, okay, the power's out.

00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:34.366
The breaker probably tripped
so we just need to flip

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:35.383
that little switchy thingie.

00:01:35.383 --> 00:01:36.529
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.770
I would definitely not go 
outside if I were you.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.277
Why?

00:01:40.587 --> 00:01:42.539
Well, because the power's 
probably out everywhere,

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.017
so the planes in the sky 
probably also don't have power,

00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:47.258
so they're coming to the ground,
crashing and killing everyone.

00:01:47.528 --> 00:01:48.505
That could happen?

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:49.663
Seriously?

00:01:50.653 --> 00:01:57.129
(dubstep music)

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.300
Oh my god.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.495
Yeah, it's serious.

00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:02.159
Look, I'd probably just give 
up on her anyway.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.893
Man, look, it's been what?
Two minutes?

00:02:05.193 --> 00:02:06.719
Dude, girls move on so quickly.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.900
She's probably already with some other guy,

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.579
if she hasn't already been crushed 
and killed by all the falling planes.

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:13.970
No, man. This is the love of my life.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.281
I can't give up on her now.

00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:17.261
- You haven't even seen her face!
- I've seen her breasts,

00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:18.571
and they're amazing.

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:22.492
All we need to do is find 
another way to power the computer.

00:02:23.132 --> 00:02:24.821
(shuffling)

00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:26.161
Hey, what are you doing?

00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:27.705
It's simple physics, dude.

00:02:27.705 --> 00:02:31.129
If I build up enough static electricity,
then I can touch the computer,

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:33.217
then it'll come back on.

00:02:33.217 --> 00:02:35.405
Oh my god, that is never gonna work.

00:02:35.565 --> 00:02:37.541
TWO HOURS LATER

00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:40.102
Please work, please work, please work!

00:02:40.422 --> 00:02:41.838
Tiffany, I'm coming.

00:02:42.338 --> 00:02:43.497
(groans)

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:44.887
Oh my god! 
Dude, are you okay?

00:02:45.177 --> 00:02:46.332
(groans)

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.115
Dude, that's it.

00:02:48.695 --> 00:02:50.629
I'm never gonna get the power back on.

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.184
I'm never gonna see 
Tiffany's possibly hot face.

00:02:54.904 --> 00:02:58.032
And I'm never gonna even be able 
to take her to an Elvis concert.

00:02:58.062 --> 00:03:00.274
You know Elvis has been dead 
for, like, 50 years, right?

00:03:00.274 --> 00:03:03.195
Dude, I saw him in Vegas a month ago.

00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:05.818
If the power was on right now,
I would totally Wikipedia the sh*t

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:07.350
out of that and prove your ass so wrong.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.172
Well, if you're serious 
about him being dead,

00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:10.870
do the serious dance.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.832
No, I don't want to--

00:03:11.832 --> 00:03:13.801
Do the f*cking serious dance.

00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:20.644
(dubstep music)

00:03:20.704 --> 00:03:23.252
Oh my god.
Oh my god!

00:03:24.652 --> 00:03:25.959
Oh my god.
I'm so cold.

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.373
Everything's falling apart.

00:03:27.913 --> 00:03:30.112
I need one of those useless foil blankets 
that they always give

00:03:30.112 --> 00:03:31.599
to victims of tragedies.

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:36.536
Here you go.

00:03:37.596 --> 00:03:40.745
Hey, you have the same 
shirt as my girlfriend.

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:44.339
I--yeah, yeah, this is a real popular shirt.

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.770
You have the same 
belly button hair as her too.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.464
Yeah, I mean, it's a really--

00:03:48.464 --> 00:03:50.641
You have the same crotch bulge as her too!

00:03:52.461 --> 00:03:54.484
Dude, have you been catfishing me?

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.159
Okay, yes!
Okay, yes.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.974
I catfished you.

00:03:56.974 --> 00:03:57.942
(groaning)

00:03:57.942 --> 00:03:59.964
You were moping around 
like a fricking loser.

00:03:59.964 --> 00:04:01.258
(groaning)

00:04:01.258 --> 00:04:03.816
I had to do something 
to raise your self esteem.

00:04:03.816 --> 00:04:06.494
By pretending to be 
my girlfriend for six months?!

00:04:06.494 --> 00:04:08.975
Dude, I quit gluten for you!

00:04:09.105 --> 00:04:11.093
Yeah, and your acne cleared up.

00:04:11.093 --> 00:04:14.009
I wrote a bunch 
of erotic fan fictions about us.

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:15.695
And they all got published.

00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:20.115
We cybered for 12 hours straight!

00:04:20.115 --> 00:04:22.261
Look, dude, I was just 
trying to be a good friend.

00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:23.701
(grumbles)

00:04:25.441 --> 00:04:26.356
Wait...

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:27.804
(Anthony) What?

00:04:28.304 --> 00:04:29.984
(Anthony) What-What are you doing?

00:04:30.054 --> 00:04:31.221
This could work.

00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:33.013
You-You're not serious.

00:04:34.323 --> 00:04:39.691
(dubstep music)

00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:40.982
F*ck my life.

00:04:42.812 --> 00:04:43.659
