00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.490
This video shows how to set up and use the
scan to e-mail feature

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:14.050
on an HP LaserJet Pro MFP using HP's software
wizard in the Windows operating system.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.199
These instructions apply to all LaserJet Pro MFPs,

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.479
but the steps might vary slightly depending
on the model.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.460
This procedure requires a network connection,
SMTP server address,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.480
and the port number of the outgoing email address.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.380
Depending on the server security requirements,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.149
additional security authentication might be required.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.879
For public email service,

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.110
the SMTP server names and port names can typically
be found by doing an Internet search.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.100
For example, use terms like Gmail SMTP
server name 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.120
or Yahoo SMTP server name to search.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.580
If you do not know the SMTP server address,
SMTP port number, or authentication information,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.430
contact the email service provider or your
system administrator.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.220
The product should be connected to the same
wired or wireless network as your computer.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.220
HP recommends that the printer network be
set to DHCP and not manual IP.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.710
To make sure your product is connected to a network,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.770
from the Home screen on the product control panel,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.450
touch the Network button to display the wired IP address

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.630
or touch the Wireless button to display the
wireless IP address.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.520
To access the wizard, from your computer,
click the Start button,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.420
then the Programs or All Programs folder.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.480
Click HP, click the product name folder,

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.229
and then click Scan to E-mail Wizard.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.860
If the Scan to E-mail Wizard option does not
exist or does not work,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.899
this indicates that the Wizard was not properly installed

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.190
during the initial printer setup.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.260
In that case,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.540
please refer to another video showing how
to set up Scan to E-mail

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.150
using the HP Embedded Web Server or EWS.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.000
To send scanned documents,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.960
the printer must use an outgoing email address.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.629
To add a new outgoing email profile,

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:32.849
click the New button.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.840
On the Start page,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.950
enter the sender's email address in the
Email Address field

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.760
and a name in the Display Name field.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.360
The name will appear on the printer's control panel.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.019
Depending on the printer model,

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.330
your screen might look slightly different,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.430
and these fields might appear on multiple pages.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.220
To secure the email profile, enter a 4-digit PIN.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.800
You will be prompted to enter the PIN on the
product control panel

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.310
every time before using that profile.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.620
Click the Next button.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.409
On the Authenticate page,

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:17.670
enter the SMTP server address and the SMTP
server port number.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.310
Please note that firewall settings inside
internal networks

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.769
might prevent external accounts like Gmail
and Yahoo from connecting.

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.330
If you are using Google Gmail for email service,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.269
click the Always use secure connection (SSL/TLS)
check box.

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.180
HP recommends you use the default setting Automatic.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.180
If the outgoing SMTP server requires additional
security authentication,

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.209
click the check box labeled E-mail Log-in Authentication

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.239
and enter the required user email and password.

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.779
Click the Next button.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.040
On the Configure page,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.590
check the box Include sender in all email
messages sent out successfully from the printer

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.599
if you need to include the sender when you
send all email messages.

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.839
Click the Next button.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.100
On the Finish page, click the Save and Test button.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.199
You might have to wait several minutes while
the configuration is tested.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.560
When the Congratulations message appears,
click the Finish button to complete the setup.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.580
You have successfully set up the scan to e-mail feature.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.360
You can now send scanned documents and images
as email attachments.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.140
Next, we will show you how to use scan to
e-mail from the printer control panel.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.320
