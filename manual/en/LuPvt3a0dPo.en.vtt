00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.640
Just as we had alternative shapes of movable
seventh chords starting on the E string, we

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.280
have a set of other shapes for movable sevenths
and minor seventh chords on the A string.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.230
So let's take a look here. Remember we had
just finished playing the barre chord seventh,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:25.480
but yeah it can be hard on your hand to do
a lot of this especially on an acoustic guitar

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.979
though it is valuable still. So let's try
creating another shape for the seventh chord.

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:41.829
Well if we use our third finger to play A,
on the A string, fifth fret we use our second

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.329
finger to play the forth fret of the D, we
going to use our second finger, we can use

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.390
our forth finger to play the fifth fret of
the G and our first finger plays the third

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.499
fret of the B string. So all of our fingers
are in commission on different strings and

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:06.210
this creates a set of movable seventh type
as long as we only strum between A and B.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:15.560
You can do this, now if we move this up one
you have a B flat seventh chord. This would

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:34.040
be an F seventh chord, yes! So remember this
was D, E flat and F. Try moving around this

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.350
chord. Now if we take our first finger here,
this is going to take a little bit of barring

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.430
and it's an extra barre but we barre across,
let's say we're doing it starting here again.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.530
You barre across the third fret for the D
and B strings, it's going to be important,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.110
we're going to use our third finger to play
the fifth fret of the A or forth finger to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:04.100
play the fifth fret of the G. Now we have
a movable minor seventh barre shape. That's

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.910
comparable to this; this gives you a different
combination of same notes in a different order

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.780
to make a different sound.
