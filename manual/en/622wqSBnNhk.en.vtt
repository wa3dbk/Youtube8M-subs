00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.520
NARRATOR: Parent tip--

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.833
responding to different
reactions.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.130
MARGIE: My name is Margie, and
I'm in a military family going

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.460
through a divorce.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.300
I have three kids.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.280
Victoria is 11, Joshua's nine,
and Cadence is almost seven.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.150
Going through a divorce is
extremely difficult.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.750
And my three kids have handled
it each very differently.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.090
My oldest, Victoria, she
reacts the strongest.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.580
But in a way, it's easiest,
because I know exactly how

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.310
she's feeling when she gets some
bad news, when she finds

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.616
out something new.

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:41.720
We tell her, and she
reacts right then.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.380
She cries.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.590
And so with her, I'm
able to talk to her

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.580
about it right then.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.500
We discuss exactly what
she's feeling.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.260
Because sometimes, she doesn't
know what she's feeling.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.320
So we identify what it is
that she's feeling.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.170
And then, we talk about it.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.510
And then, she's able to kind
of process through it.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.860
Joshua--

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.090
he's a sweet boy.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.710
And he wants to make me happy.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.390
And I don't think he quite
understands everything that's

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.460
happening right away.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.250
So typically, he'll find out
something or he'll make a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.120
connection, and he won't
say anything about it.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.190
And it's been through a lot of
just continuing to talk to him

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.320
about it and teaching him how
to use his words to say what

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.530
he's feeling.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.470
Because if we I don't say
anything to him, if his dad

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.650
doesn't say anything to him,
he'll keep it inside.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.750
Cadence is the youngest.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.580
I don't think she really
understands everything

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.880
that's going on.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.720
It is very similar to our life
before when we weren't in the

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.570
middle of a divorce.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.990
Because her dad was gone a
lot due to the military.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.010
Now, he's gone a lot due to the
military and the fact that

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.080
we're separated.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.340
She kind of wonders
what's going on.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.690
So just telling her that she's
safe, she can feel this way.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.340
At one point, she told
me she was going to

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.860
pretend to feel good.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.060
I was like, you don't have to.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.900
Just however you're feeling,
you can tell

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.670
me how you're feeling.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.690
And then, we can deal with
the correct way to

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.740
handle those feelings.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.889
When we first started letting
the kids know what was going

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.800
on, my kids immediately wanted
to change their behavior.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.620
It was very important for me
and their dad to tell them,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.890
nope, nothing you could
have done would have

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.800
made this any different.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.450
Nothing you didn't do, nothing
you did do, would have made

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.620
this any different.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.890
This is just something
that happened.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.620
I tell them that daddy and
I are getting divorced.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.790
But daddy is not divorcing you.
it's a totally different

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.270
relationship.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.160
Even though you're living with
me, he's still your dad, and

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.610
he will always be your dad.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.550
CADENCE: Bye, daddy.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.620
VICTORIA: Bye daddy,
I love you.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.820
FATHER: All right, I love you.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.720
VICTORIA: I love you.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.970
FATHER: Bye, guys.
