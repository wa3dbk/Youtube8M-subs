I'm Sarita Holzmann, the president of
Sonlight Curriculum

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.039
where we've been serving homeschoolers
for more than twenty years.

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.469
I'm thrilled with the improvements we're
making to our product this year,

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:21.119
and I'm looking forward to our team
sharing with you some of our biggest improvements.

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.330
Sonlight's Cores have always included
History, Geography,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.849
Readers, Read-Alouds, as well as Bible
reading and memorization. What we found was

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.849
we could include Language Arts

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.960
as well as Bible resources
for one incredible package.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.430
Part of what made it possible to bring
Language Arts into the Core is that we're

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.810
already re-evaluating all of the
Language Arts activities in Cores A-G.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.630
We knew we could bring you a better balance
of Writing, Grammar, and Mechanics.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.160
And that's exactly what you'll get each week in
the Lanauage Arts instruction in your Core.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.980
This year we're bringing you more
focused and intuitive Instructor's Guides.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.100
Your weekly materials are all in one
place. You get your vocabulary, your notes, and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.040
all the other tidbits and teaching information
that you need to have a successful week.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.200
We've dramatically enhanced our maps

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.590
Bible notes and discussion questions.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.910
Sonlight has always prioritized Bible
reading, study, and memorization.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.560
This year we revamped the reading schedule.
But that was enough. We've also created

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.100
weekly parent study notes. Now
you can give even more for the Bible

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.530
portion of your Sonlight Core.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.130
We read thousands of books as we
re-evaluated every title

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.910
in Cores A-G.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.820
I'm thrilled with the books,
old and new

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.350
included in your Core.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.130
Thank you for letting us share with you
what's new with Sonlight in 2012.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.270
Stay tuned for more videos where we'll give you
specifics into all the enhancements and improvements.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.000
See you soon.
