00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.780
I think I'm in the Capitol

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.659
We're going to a cafe opening, but it's not just any kind of cafe

00:00:22.673 --> 00:00:26.273
Beginning the Kawaii Monster Cafe opening ceremony!

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.980
- We're at the opening... Not the opening -It's a press event

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.400
Press event of the Kawaii Monster Cafe

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.040
It's basically what LSD trips are made of

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.169
Or Alice in Wonderland or the Capitol in Hunger Games

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.220
As expected

00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:57.511
Really awesome bathroom

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.640
Oh yeah, that's the men's room

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.860
There's a lot of details in this place, like this ant climbing the wall, and then

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.760
Printed ants

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.164
And there's ice cream smashed against the ceiling

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.980
What do you think Jody?

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.518
You can take little kids here and they can line up for a ride

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.060
I don't see why not

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.900
It's definitely unique and trippy

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.780
I think they can become one of the iconic Tokyo theme restaurants &amp; cafes

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.920
It's gonna join the ranks of Alcatraz, Robot Restaurant

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.540
It has a more real, authentic feel than the Robot Restaurant

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:37.454
The Robot Restaurant is just for foreigners

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.599
This place is opening officially in a few days so you can come check it out

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:43.641
Oh, Mexican food

00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:46.100
You excited for your favourite burritos?

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:48.082
Yeah, as always

00:02:04.232 --> 00:02:07.032
I am now in the Metropolis Magazine office

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:10.126
To see Chris, the editor-in-chief

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.300
Chris Jones, the editor in chief of Metropolis Magazine

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.920
- We're gonna record a podcast now - It's what we do

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.180
Looking for a place now

00:02:19.707 --> 00:02:23.867
Turns out it's super difficult to find a quiet spot in this area

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.360
In this garden there's cicadas

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.282
Somewhere else there's a concert, there's a lot of people everywhere

00:02:31.282 --> 00:02:33.647
And there's waterfalls for decoration

00:02:34.377 --> 00:02:36.217
Everything's so noisy here

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.420
Let's go to this table over there

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.742
Allright, we're going for the cicadas

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.229
It's like proper noise

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.340
You wanna risk it?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.800
I don't know

00:02:50.248 --> 00:02:54.408
Cicadas were too loud after all, we're choosing the waterfall

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.620
Check out Kris on my podcast, Metropolis On Air

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.788
You can find it on our website, metropolisjapan.com

00:03:06.788 --> 00:03:09.640
Or go to iTunes and search Metropolis On Air

00:03:09.657 --> 00:03:10.937
It'll come right up

00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:23.267
While Kris is off having a more interesting day than me doing a podcast

00:03:23.894 --> 00:03:26.214
I have to find a Starbucks with WiFi

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.760
So that I can upload yesterday's video for you guys

00:03:29.924 --> 00:03:34.564
I just bought headphones so that I can also do subtitles while I'm at it

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.580
Well the Wifi in this Starbucks was the worst, I got almost nothing done

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.460
You ready for YouTube?

00:03:55.745 --> 00:03:56.865
Doing subtitles

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.860
This thing here is the YouTube summer party

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.455
It's like Matsuri-themed, so this is one of the matsuri games they have

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.780
It's a good chance to meet Japanese YouTubers

00:04:14.893 --> 00:04:16.653
And there's food and booze

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.060
I think those are pretty good ones

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.840
One more thing to do. I am getting tired

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.960
We're gonna go that way, to see our friend play

00:04:41.076 --> 00:04:41.716
Oh my God!

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.460
Kasia!

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:44.844
And Krzysztof!

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.860
This is the changing room

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.540
Our friend Ken was playing

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.463
-He's gonna go to Poland soon. -Yes yes yes

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.760
Subscribe!

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.980
It's gonna be fun if you do!
