00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:26.590
I suppose itís my job to do so, but I canít
even tell you how good that felt.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.329
Welcome to the second half of our look at
Nintendoís latest Zelda masterpiece, Skyward

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:39.430
Sword.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.470
Even the most stubborn Nintendo defender would
admit the Wiiís grandiose mission statementóthat

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.140
motion-controlled revolutionóended up being
more of a rough storm than total sea change,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.700
so to speak...emphasis on the rough.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.739
For every Wii game with fantastic motion controls,
there are three or four with broken ones.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.739
But this?

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.680
This is the revolution weíve been waiting
for.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.220
Itís rare to play a game in which the controls
actually immerse you into the gameís world,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.920
but thatís what MotionPlus does for Zelda.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.170
Sword fights are no longer routine exercises
in obligatory button mashing.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.140
Each one is an event that requires attention,
even strategy.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.070
Enemies will protect themselves, and youíll
have slash them where theyíre exposed.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.040
The game never lets combat feel arbitrary.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:43.290
Thereís always an interesting hook that makes
Linkís battles more rewarding than ever before.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.750
The motion is also built into your environment.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.020
Ropes have to be cut at an angle.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.600
Objects obscured by stone might have to be
stabbed through a thin space.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.250
Motion controlóspecifically, accurate motion
controlóis simply built into Linkís world.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.470
The application eventually feels as natural
as trimming a candle wick or cutting a loose

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.470
string.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.530
It starts to feel real, and as a result, so
do your objectives.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:23.590
Calibration is still annoying, but when itís
working, itís fantastic.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.749
But as well as it plays, I think what makes
Skyward Sword so tremendous is the

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:29.749
way it looks.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:35.401
Itís not often I get to reference centuries-old
art movements in a video game review, but

00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:38.040
how beautiful it is when the opportunity arises.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.560
And more than its controls, more than its
structure...what defines Skyward Sword is

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.120
its spectacular appearance.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.700
Skyward Sword is based on impressionism, an
art style that blossomed in the 19th century.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.719
The whole idea is youíre not necessarily
painting an object as much as youíre capturing

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:57.999
light.

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:02.730
Impressionists focused more on the way light
makes the object appear than the object itself.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.469
Detailís not important.

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:09.499
Pure colors, short brush strokes and the reflections
of light are.

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:14.080
This is exactly what Nintendo has accomplished
with Skyward Sword, and whatís perhaps even

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.450
more spectacular than its sheer beauty is
the way the medium of video games brings it

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.739
to life.

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.739
Objects looming in the distance are beautifully
rendered in the impressionist style, but as

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.829
you approach them, they slowly come into focus.

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:29.989
Details emerge.

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.120
The painting begins to move.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:46.139
Itís just a stunning effect, but itís also
admirably bold.

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:51.680
Nintendoís decision to forego conventional
graphics for this impressionist style not

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.109
only makes Skyward Sword one of the most gorgeous
games Iíve ever seen, but one of the most

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:01.819
artistically significant...a game that would
certainly earn Monet and Renoirís smudges

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.909
of approval.

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:12.450
Now, I donít use the term ìmasterpieceî
loosely.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.519
Thatís a word I reserve for games in only
the uppermost echelon of their industry, but

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.730
itís a perfect fit for what Nintendo has
accomplished with Skyward Sword.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.939
The Zelda games have almost unreasonably high
standards, but for many reasons, this one

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:30.230
sets them even higher.
