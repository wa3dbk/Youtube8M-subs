"Long beneath the great Wayne Manor"

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.640
-Batman, don't you want to spend christmas with me and Alfred?

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.200
-Later, Robin. I'm busy...

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.620
-Come on it's Christmas

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.740
*Singing* I'm dreaming of a White...

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.460
-What are you?

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.720
-Christmas!

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.520
-Stop!

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.800
-Just like the ones I used to know...

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.580
-Stop singing...

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.380
-Where the tree tops gliste...

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.360
-I'm serious, stop... just stop!

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.280
-And children listen...

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.560
-Okay, fine!

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.560
I'll go upstairs.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.500
And... And I'll spend some time with you. Okay?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.420
-Hurray!

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.440
*alarm sound* -Oh, nevermind...

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.620
-Oh, come on! Can't you just let the police handle this one!?

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.669
-Let's Watch it at least.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.560
-Hello, this is Jack Ryder with breaking news.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.320
We got a report just minutes ago that someone has left around christmas presents all around Gotham.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.420
Is this our shadow vigilante?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.280
-Is it some guy dropping them off without knowing?

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.060
Or is it just some really nice guy?

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.220
That's the questions we want answers to.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.940
And as soon as we get them...

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.160
We will tell you!

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.640
How was that?

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.597
-Some really nice guy, eh?

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.040
Hmm...

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.120
-Oh my god! Please, Batman.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.760
We need to look into this!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.440
-What? Why?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.000
I mean, I thought you wanted to spend time with me and Alfred.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.500
-Batman, this is obviously Santa Claus work...

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.560
And I am gonna find him--

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.420
with or without your help!

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.600
-Okay, I guess we're off then.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.640
-Aww, there's no presents here!

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.340
-We're not here to obtain presents, Robin.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.860
Now what happened here?

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.940
Hmm...

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.840
Interesting...

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.540
There's no sign of toxin or explosives...

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.640
The presents we're definitely put here on purpose...

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.480
As far as I can see, our main suspect is--

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.030
Some really nice guy...

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.620
Robin, I Think we're done here.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.040
Robin?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.080
Robin, where are you?

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:10.675
-Batman, over here!

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.320
-Robin, did you find something?

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.380
-Look Batman.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.520
It's tire tracks.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.900
If we follow them, we may find Santa!

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.150
Oh my god, I'm excited!

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.350
-Good find, Robin!

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.800
Now let's get out of here.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.960
-Look!

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.800
The car tires leads to this car!

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.440
-It looks like this was Another destination of crime...

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.500
-Crime?

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.780
-Oh, sorry...

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.140
It's an old habit... yeah...

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.500
-There's no presents here.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.740
-Well I guess that's why no one is here.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.980
Robin, look for evidence around the car.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.300
I'll look inside.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.700
It looks like...

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.160
A GPS, could it maybe?

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.520
Yes!

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.040
Robin! I Think we've found Santa!

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.020
-Really? Why?

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.020
-This GPS holds the destination of an old warehouse.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.630
Who else but the one guilty of this crime... Again sorry...

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.550
-But why would Santa be in an old...

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.390
-Robin, come on! There's no time to spare!

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.400
Be careful now, Robin.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.620
He could be anywhere.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.580
-Uh, yeah...

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.720
-That's good, because, you know they can attack you from nowhere...

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.900
-Look! It's Santa!

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.100
-Robin wait!

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.540
Robin, stop running!

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.220
-No, Santa! Don't go!

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.080
-Robin, why can't we just walk?

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.480
Stop wathever you're doing!

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.100
Justice is served.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.060
-Batman, what are you doing here?

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.960
-I came here to stop whoever is delivering gifts around the city.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.320
What are in those presents!?

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.480
-Bane?

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.380
-Uh, let's see...

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.700
Six toy cars, five teddybears, three lamps and a cat.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.080
-Meow...

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.280
-What have you done to them!?

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.100
-Nothing.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.500
-Then why are you dropping them off in the city!?

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.120
-Batman...

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.360
We have been the bad guys every year--

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.360
for as long as I can remember.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.440
No one respects us... Or, even likes us...

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.980
They just want us back in Arkham...

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.960
But then Bane came up with a thought.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.340
Instead of seeking a way to revange them...

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.740
We could try to do something nice...

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.180
But then I remembered you.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.680
If you found out, that it was us...

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.240
You would just hunt us down because...

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.300
You know...

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.400
It's us...

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.860
-So why DID you do it?

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.020
-Well...

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.000
The plan was for me to not leave any riddles behind.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.140
It took some time, but...

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.260
I managed to control myself at last.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.220
-Did it work?

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.720
-Well, you're here so...

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.089
I guess not...

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.060
-You aren't going to arrest us are you?

00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:06.781
We haven't done anything wrong...

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.000
-*echo* Or is it just some really nice guy?

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.210
-No...

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.990
I won't.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.740
Oh, by the way...

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.490
How did you afford all the presents?

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.840
-Well, we're still the bad guys so we took some extra time stealing some Money from the rich guy,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.840
Bruce Wayne.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.040
He has so much money...

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.300
He won't notice...

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.220
Right?

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.800
-You?

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.180
...

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.420
You know what?

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.380
I don't think he will...

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.340
Merry Christmas, everyone!

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.540
*Bane and Riddler*  -Merry Christmas!

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.160
*Loud door slam*

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.630
-I...

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.890
Did you see Santa?

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:45.649
-What?

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:46.969
-I followed him...

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.480
Didn't you see me run away?

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.280
-I thought you said you were working alone!

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.320
-We-we are!

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.180
-Batman, wait! Wait!

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.000
-Robin! Did you see Santa!?

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.639
-No...

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:05.959
No, how could I?
