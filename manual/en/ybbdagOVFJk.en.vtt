Hi it's Toby's Grandma with Grandma's Toys
and I have a project to show you today that

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:22.070
is so fun, so beautiful and so easy you can
do it yourself with just a few materials.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:30.310
Would you like to turn a plain clear glass plate
into a beautiful plate like this? Or, would

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:39.050
you like to turn a plain glass plate into
a beautiful plate like this? I'll show you how!

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.399
Here's what you need: A plain glass plate. I got
some of these plates at Goodwill for about

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.879
$1.00 a piece. But, you can go to the dollar
store get them for $1.00 a piece there, too.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:59.350
They are pretty easy to find. You also need
a piece of tissue. The kind of tissue that

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:07.340
you use in a gift bag. This is the kind of
tissue I used to make the floral plate.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:18.479
It would be pretty with butterfly tissue
paper or something with a stamp on it. I picked

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.590
out this tissue for this project because it
reminds me of Easter. It's pink and it's polka

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:34.270
dot and I think it would be so nice on the
Easter table. The third thing is my all time

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:42.310
favorite craft supply... Mod Podge. I think
you can use white glue but if you have the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.560
opportunity to go to the craft store and get
a bottle of Mod Podge, you can use it for

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:56.360
so many things. Plus, little sponge brush
to spread the Mod Podge on your plate.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.879
Okay, I'm ready to start. The first thing I did
was wash this plate after I brought it home

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:07.530
from the store. Sometimes glass comes with
a little bit of a film on it when you buy

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.250
it. You want to make sure that especially
the bottom is completely clean before you attempt

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.130
your project. I also cut out a piece of my
tissue that is just big enough to cover my

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.920
plate with a little bit of overhang all the
way around.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:42.940
I'm ready to glue my plate.  I'm going to cover the bottom of my glass plate
with Mod Podge making sure that there aren't

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:53.609
any spots left unpainted, unglued. I want
to make the rim has Mod Podge all the way

00:02:53.609 --> 00:03:01.810
around. Like my other projects, I want to
make sure that there are no big globs of Mod

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:10.260
Podge. But that it's just painted on very
smoothly and consistantly around the plate.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:21.980
I'll take the tissue and put the brightest side
down because that's the side I want to show

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:31.079
through my plate. I centered it in the middle.
It's fragile. The tissue paper is delicate

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:39.799
so first of all I will press it onto the glue
in the center of the plate and then I'm going

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:47.609
to touch it around this rim. I don't want
any gaps when I'm done where the tissue doesn't

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:58.290
touch the glue. Now that it's touched all
the way around the plate pressing the tissue

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:07.090
down carefully... trying to keep it as smooth
as I possibly can. Because the plate is curved,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:16.950
there are going to be creases in the tissue
but you want to keep those to a minimum.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:27.090
Go all the way around, touching the glue, making
sure the tissue is touching the rim all the

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:36.940
way around. Isn't that pretty? It's pretty
all ready and it's not even done. I'm going

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.560
to set this plate aside for a couple of hours
to dry. If I was doing this project in the

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:49.980
evening, I think I'd let it dry overnight.
I'm going to set it upside down on this glass

00:04:49.980 --> 00:05:04.620
to dry. Here's a plate that I glued earlier.
It's completely dry. So I will cut away any

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:16.370
paper that isn't glued down, just going along
the edge of the plate. Cutting around the

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:30.450
edge of the plate a little bit at a time.
Almost done. There! Now that the paper is

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.840
cut away from the edges, I'm going to put
one more layer of Mod Podge on the bottom

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:52.430
of the plate to seal the paper. Be sure to
cover the whole plate. Because of these creases

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:03.310
in the paper, it's a little tricky to get
all of the paper glued. This is why it's important

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.720
to let the plate dry completely when you put
the first layer on.... so you're putting the

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:16.530
second layer on top of a completely dry layer
of Mod Podge. I'm going to set this aside

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:27.900
for a couple of hours or overnight to dry.
Don't user your new plate for hot or messy

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.250
foods. Don't use it for a dinner plate. Use
it for serving plate for appetizers or treats or snacks

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:44.200
or dessert. Dry foods. When you're done clean
it with a little soapy water and dry it completely.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.330
Don't put it in the dishwasher or the Mod
Podge will act just like Elmers glue and all

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:58.800
your work will come off. If you are very unhappy
with the way it turned out, soak it in a little

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:07.110
pan of hot water, clean it off, wash it again
and start again with a new piece of tissue.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.890
Here are some ways you can use your plate.
If you collect plates and have a plate stand,

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:21.720
you can display it. You can fill up your plate
with cookies or brownies and serve them to

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:30.500
your family or friends or take them as a gift
to someone else and they can keep the plate!

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:38.640
Put your plate on your nightstand or dresser
as a place to keep your jewelry or change.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.500
I did some matching plates with some spring
pink polka dot tissue.... two small and one

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.240
large... and I am so happy with the way they
turned out. I think they will look very pretty

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:58.120
on my Easter table.
So whatever size or style you decide to make,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.180
I hope you have fun making your own personalized
plates.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.710
Thanks for watching Grandma's Toys!
