00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:09.620
Hey there, today I'm just going to show you
a different eye makeup look.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.990
Another one that I do every other day.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.170
I guess!

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:25.100
The idea is it's supposed to make your eyes
look bigger.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.990
So, I'll turn back time.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.260
And start with no eye makeup.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.260
Bye!

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Eeee!

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
No eye makeup!

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.290
Well, I'm going to start by using this white
pencil.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.880
On the waterline of my eyes.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.059
Hopefully you can see...

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.160
And a little bit on the inside corner too.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:09.830
Next I take a black kohl pencil and draw a
line just above the eyeball - uh - just above

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.920
the eyelid crease thing.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.430
Sort of as a guideline.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.000
It's a bit messy, but that doesn't matter.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.439
It will get smoothened and cleaned up.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.509
Next, I like to use a silver eyeshadow.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.750
The trick is to use a light colour on your
eyelids.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.510
I like silver.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:47.619
It's called Rimmel 'Silver Moonlight'
And I fill that in up to the black line.

00:01:47.619 --> 00:02:02.060
Going to go over that black line again, this
time a bit more carefully.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.159
Next I'm going to use two different black
eyeshadows.

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.270
The first is LorÃ©al's 'Lush Raven'.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.269
I don't really like it.

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.090
But it's good for blending cause it's quite...
gentle.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.510
It's quite... mild?

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:27.989
Whereas my usual favourite Maybelline 'Smoky
Black' is a lot more strong and pigmenty.

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:35.920
So, for underneath I'll do under my eyes first.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:44.219
Using the Lush Raven.

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:57.569
Then I'm going to put some on the top of my
eyelid above where that black line is.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:06.120
And then I use a fingertip so smoothen it.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:14.739
Now to 
really know where to put anything else, where

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:21.450
to put the rest of the eyeshadow, going to
put some eyeliner on first.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.040
I'm using a gel eyeliner.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.310
This is Rimmel Waterproof Gel Eyeliner.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.939
I hate it.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:29.579
I hate it.

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.500
But I ran out... and it was all I could get.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.609
Start underneath, and create a kind of triangular
gap on the inside corner.

00:03:40.609 --> 00:04:01.709
Where the white pencil went to start with.

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.889
It looks nice if the wings of the cat eye
match the length of the eyebrows.

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:14.180
So I'll do my eyebrows now.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:25.569
Going to do the wings...

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.840
Oh!

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.680
I've smudged it!

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.560
That's why I hate this eyeliner.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.669
Grr.

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.650
So smudgy, takes a million years to dry.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.259
Hate.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:54.090
So much hate.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.699
There!

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:04.530
Kinda like that.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:19.460
Um, and as I grumbled earlier, the reason
I hate this eyeliner is cause it's so smudgy.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:27.719
But I found it sets it if I stick ... pack
a bit of black eyeshadow on top.

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:29.819
There.

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:40.300
Put some mascara on now.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:47.699
Going to use this Maybelline Volume Express
Turbo Boost.

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.919
Like I said in another video, oops!

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.159
Push down on the upper lashes.

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.740
Then upwards , push them up.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:04.669
Then, same deal for the lower ones.

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:10.690
Kind of, roll them out.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.100
Nearly done!

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:20.469
Going to stick some of my favourite Maybelline
black eyeshadow on.

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:27.249
Sort of um, mostly on the outside edges and
underneath.

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:45.159
It'll also help emphasise the crease, the
line.

00:06:45.159 --> 00:07:11.509
Then smudge with a fingertip.

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:16.139
And if you're ever using a fingertip to smudge
anything on your eyes, be very gentle.

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:18.540
Because the skin there is quite delicate.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.240
Especially if you're ginger like me.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.539
Gonna go over the line again just to be sure.

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:24.539
There!

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:26.949
That was quick.

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:31.240
Not so bad.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.099
Looks ok.

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:48.529
Um, yeah well once again thanks for watching,
I hope you found this useful, see you next

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.789
time.Bye!
