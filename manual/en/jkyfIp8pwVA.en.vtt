00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.829
I'm in charge of discovering medicines that will

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.779
make a real difference in people's lives.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.709
So, as you may know Genentech is now an incorporated

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.439
company in the United States but 100 percent owned

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.824
by a large Swiss drug company called Roche.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.499
But our group is completely independent and our job

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.969
is to discover medicines that make a difference.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.954
We don't make any generic drugs.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:38.044
We don't make any copies of other drugs. Innovation is our...

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.514
We're going to live or die based on innovation.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.134
We also believe very strongly in the view of personalized medicine.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.519
That is, making medicines that are tailored to individuals.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.769
The Roche group owns two businesses: a pharmaceutical

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.589
business and a diagnostic business.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.799
So, very large, I don't know,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.669
maybe fourth, fifth largest pharmaceutical company in the

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.814
world and the largest diagnostic company in the world.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.909
So the idea is to make medicines that really,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.709
really deliver benefit-tangible, terrific benefit-for people.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.469
So if we make a medicine for somebody with cancer,

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.364
we have to show that they actually live longer

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.089
when they take the medicine, for example.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.879
So I oversee research. So our research group is about 1,300 folks.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.299
We have about 150 other people who are post docs.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.599
Now, why would we have a post-doc program? People come through.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.769
They come from all over the world. They stay for four five years.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.524
They bring in new techniques and ideas. They're not cynical yet.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.409
They work at night and in the weekends

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.799
and it just energizes the place.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.019
Then we have scientists at various levels.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.959
And the job of the scientist is two-fold, to do basic science.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.919
We'd like to give each of our scientists somewhere,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.324
some what we call discretionary time.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.709
Maybe that's somewhere between 10 and 30 percent of their time,

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.819
so it depends on the individuals.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.689
Some people are, frankly,

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.604
it's a 100 percent but that's a different topic.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.579
And with their discretionary time,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.609
they're supposed to just do interesting things.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.444
Do whatever you want; make a discovery, publish a paper.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.309
We published 20 papers in science, nature and cell last year;

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.319
hundreds of papers overall from the company.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.699
But the other real tangible deliverable of the scientist

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.409
is to come up with a medicine and move that medicine

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.929
into what we call early development.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.429
And in early development,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.109
the compound goes through various further stages

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.989
of testing to make sure that it's safe.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.059
We do all the work to file in I&amp;D.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.899
That's a new drug application with the FDA and we file the I&amp;D

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.369
and then we do the clinical studies Phase I and Phase II.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.229
In Phase I, you usually just treat patients.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.379
Then, make sure that the drug is safe.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.449
You start at a very, very low dose.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.179
I mean, imagine, putting something into a

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.424
human that's never been in a human before.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.889
Slowly, escalate the dose. It depends on the disease.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.659
Sometimes it will be in patients with the disease, sometimes not.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.239
But then, usually in Phase II,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.449
you do a relatively small number of patients but enough

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.119
patients so that you have statistical power to see

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.774
that you're making a difference in the disease.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.809
And what we then do would be, if their Phase II trial works,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.189
to hand the medicine to them, the Global Development Group,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.629
to do the final clinical testing.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.949
And the final clinical testing would then

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.209
be done in 80 countries around the world.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.719
It's a logistical absolute nightmare.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.274
It's done in many, many more patients so that

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.404
the statistical power increases dramatically.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.238
And then, work with the regulatory authorities to get permission,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.569
if you will-so the FDA,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.049
in case of the United States-permission to market the drug.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.849
So my job is to deliver molecules that we

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.299
say have gone through proof of concept.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.469
We believe that they work. We have the chemical entity.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.169
We know that it can be manufactured and to hand this to the

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.929
Global Group where there's a lot of science involved but there's

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.329
a huge amount of logistics and regulatory involvement.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.559
And that's when the commercial people get involved and so on.

00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:57.424
Frankly, I'm less interested in that.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.909
I then go back and try to discover

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.950
a new medicine and show that it works.
