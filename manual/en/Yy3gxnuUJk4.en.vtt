00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:04.336
- IN ORDER TO MAKE A MYOFIBRIL
WE HAVE TO HAVE THICK FILAMENTS

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:06.139
AND THIN FILAMENTS.

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:09.642
AND THIN FILAMENTS HAVE
SOME MORE WEIRD STUFF GOING ON.

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.545
SO WE'RE NOT JUST DEALING
WITH A SINGLE PROTEIN

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:13.846
IN THIN FILAMENTS.

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.315
BUT I JUST WONNA REMIND

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:19.251
YOU THAT WE'RE STILL JUST
STACKING UP SOME PROTEINS.

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:22.288
AND THE WHOLE PURPOSE IS TO PUT
THEM TOGETHER INTO A MYOFIBRIL.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:27.059
AND REMEMBER MYOFIBRILS FILLED
UP A MYOFIBER,

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:29.195
THE MUSCLE CELL ITSELF.

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:34.066
SO LET'S LOOK AT THE PARTS
OF THE ACTIN MOLECULE.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:39.539
I MEAN THE THIN FILAMENT.

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:46.512
AND REALLY THE THIN
FILAMENT IS MOSTLY ACTIN.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.083
AND SO IF WE
WERE TO LOOK AT ACTIN,

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.989
IT ACTUALLY KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE THIS AND IT MAKES,

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:59.092
OH THIS IS GONNA
BE A SAD EFFORT.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.326
IT WINDS--

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.895
THERE'S ACTUALLY
LIKE TWO STRANDS OF ACTIN

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:06.332
AND THEY WIND AROUND EACH OTHER.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.369
OKAY.
THAT'S NOT TOO BAD.

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:12.138
CAN YOU SEE HOW I'M
TRYING TO MAKE THEM FORM

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:15.341
LIKE A DOUBLE HELIX?
FANCY.

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:20.212
MAYBE I BETTER MAKE IT GO THERE
SO THAT YOU CAN

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.248
SEE THAT IT IS HAPPENING
ALL THE WAY.

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:25.218
WOW. LIKE THAT.

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:30.190
THOSE ARE ACTIN MOLECULES
AND THEY'RE JUST PROTEINS.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.558
AND THIS WHOLE THING
THAT I'M ABOUT TO BUILD

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:35.595
IS A THINK FILAMENT,
ACTIN.

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.029
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.465
WHAT COLOR DID I MAKE MY MYOSIN?

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:43.870
BLUE.
GUESS WHAT ACTINS HAVE?

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.170
TRUE STORY.

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:49.508
THEY ALL HAVE

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:56.983
A MYOSIN BINDING SITE.
OKAY.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.985
SO I COULD DRAW THIS ON
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE GUYS.

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:01.554
AND DO YOU AGREE THAT,
DUDE,

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.322
IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE FILAMENTS,

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.358
WE BETTER HAVE THEM BE ABLE
TO STICK TO EACH OTHER.

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:09.595
AND ITS TRUE ACTIN AND MYOSIN,

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:13.399
WHEN THE MOON AND THE STARS
ALIGN AND YOU SEND A MESSAGE,

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:20.072
JUMP, THEY CAN ATTACH
TO EACH OTHER.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.208
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:27.312
THERE IS ANOTHER MOLECULE
CALLED TROPOMYOSIN.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.716
AND I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA HAVE
TO MAKE TROPOMYOSIN GREEN.

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:35.421
TROPOMYOSIN IS ANOTHER FRIENDLY

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:41.527
AND WHAT HAVE I DRAWN
TROPOMYOSIN DOING? OH.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.830
IF YOU WERE--

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:49.168
WOW.
OH JEEZ.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.770
I'M NOT SURE WHAT JUST
HAPPENED IN THIS AREA.

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:54.340
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT--
I'M GONNA TELL YOU.

00:02:54.407 --> 00:03:06.319
TROPOMYOSIN BLOCKS THE MYOSIN
BINDING SITES ON ACTIN.

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:08.554
DID I DRAW
THAT FOR YOU WELL ENOUGH?

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.089
ARE YOU COOL WITH THAT?

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:13.259
THE TROPOMYOSIN BLOCKS
THOSE BINDING SITES.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.961
SO WHEN TROPOMYOSIN IS IN PLACE,

00:03:16.028 --> 00:03:19.032
CAN YOU HAVE
A MUSCLE CONTRACTION?

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:20.366
NO. NO.
NO.

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:23.469
YOU CANNOT BECAUSE
THE BINDING SITES ARE BLOCKED.

00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:26.038
SO GUESS WHAT? WE
HAVE TO BRING IN SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:28.040
WE HAVE TO BRING IN
A GATE KEEPER.

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:31.510
AND THAT WOULD BE THIS GUY.

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:36.449
AND THIS GUY IS CALLED TROPONIN.

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:39.418
AND TROPONIN, JUST
ANOTHER PROTEIN.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:42.021
AND TROPONIN'S JOB,

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:44.824
THIS IS VERY COOL.
SO COOL.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:54.733
TROPONIN HOLDS TROPOMYOSIN
IN PLACE,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.072
RIGHT?
WHAT'S IN PLACE?

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:03.075
BLOCKING
THE MYOSIN BINDING SITES.

00:04:03.141 --> 00:04:05.244
OKAY. ARE YOU SEEING?

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:06.746
ARE YOU GETTING KIND OF LIKE,

00:04:06.812 --> 00:04:09.915
UH, I BET I CAN PREDICT
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:16.422
I'M GONNA MAKE THE PLOT GET
THICKER BECAUSE LOOK.

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:21.193
TROPONIN HAS ITS
OWN BINDING SITE.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.162
WHAT?
YEAH.

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.931
IT HAS--

00:04:25.998 --> 00:04:27.032
I MEAN TROPONIN.

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.368
DID I SAY TROPONIN?
I HOPE I DID.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:37.009
TROPONIN
HAS A CALCIUM BINDING SITE.

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:41.314
DID I ALREADY TELL YOU
OR AM I JUST IMAGINING IT?

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.450
THAT CALCIUM IS STORED
IN THE SARCOPLASMIC RETICULUM

00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:48.154
OF THE MUSCLE CELL?

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.590
OH.
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:55.994
IF CALCIUM, BINDS TO TROPONIN
AT THE CALCIUM BINDING SITE,

00:04:56.061 --> 00:05:01.000
TROPONIN WILL CHANGE SHAPE
AND IF TROPONIN CHANGES SHAPE.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:03.302
IT CAN NO LONGER
HOLD TROPOMYOSIN

00:05:03.368 --> 00:05:08.040
IN POSITION TO COVER
THE MYOSIN BINDING SITES.

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:13.312
AND NOW, ACTIN'S MYOSIN
BINDING SITES ARE REVEALED.

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:17.083
THE TRUTH IS REVEALED
AND ACTION CAN HAPPEN.

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:19.752
SHOULD WE GO-- I
THINK YOU'RE GOOD.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.989
I THINK WHAT WE NEED
TO DO NOW IS LOOK AT--

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:25.358
I THINK WE DO NEED
TO GO BACK HERE.

00:05:25.424 --> 00:05:27.259
BECAUSE OUR NEXT JOB--

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:28.660
WHAT YOU CAN SEE--

00:05:28.727 --> 00:05:30.329
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT VIEW.

00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:32.397
WHAT YOU CAN SEE
IS THAT IT'S NOT

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:39.805
LIKE A HAPHAZARD TIDDLYWINK PILE
OF MYOFILAMENTS, THICK AND THIN.

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.641
THEY'RE SUPER ORGANIZED.

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:44.510
THEY'RE SO ORGANIZED
THAT THROUGH A MICROSCOPE

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:46.011
YOU SEE STRIPES.

00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:47.746
THAT'S HOW ORGANIZED THEY ARE.

00:05:47.813 --> 00:05:49.915
THEY'RE LIKE TOEING THAT LINE.

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:52.051
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
FOR THEIR FUNCTION.

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:54.287
SO THEY TOE THE LINE.

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.355
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA TALK
ABOUT NEXT.

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:59.425
HOW ARE THEY ORGANIZED
INTO THIS MYOFIBRIL?

00:05:59.491 --> 00:06:01.427
AND THE FACT IS
THEY'RE ORGANIZED

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.162
INTO SOMETHING CALLED
THE SARCOMERE.

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.762
LET'S TALK
ABOUT SARCOMERES NEXT. OKAY.
