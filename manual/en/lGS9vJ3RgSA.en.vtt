00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.680
The Porsche Macan is clearly not sports car.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.640
And it's not a practical, family-friendly
SUV either, but it very much splits the difference

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:15.669
between those extremes to create a compromise
that should appeal to a lot of people.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.550
For now there are two models available: the
Macan S and the Macan Turbo.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.250
Despite their names, both actually have turbocharged
V6 engines â€¦ along with standard all-wheel

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.260
drive and Porsche's PDK transmission.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.190
The 3.0-liter S produces 340 hp, which is
more than everything in the segment except

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.539
the heavier, 354-hp Audi SQ5.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.609
Both go from 0-60 in about 5 seconds.

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:48.700
Needless to say, then, that the 3.6-liter,
400-hp Turbo blows the doors off every other

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.469
compact luxury crossover.

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.359
It simply does not have an equal, and really,
no other SUV comes as close to feeling like

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:00.780
a sports car than the Macan â€¦ be it the
Turbo or the S. Whether you're bombing along

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.260
a back road or just running errands around
town, it corners flat, its hefty steering

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.180
offers lots of feedback and all its mechanical-feeling
controls make you feel connected to the car

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.370
and the road.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.760
It has roughly the same length and wheelbase
as competitors like the Audi Q5 and BMW X3,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.210
but it's wider and not as tall.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.320
There's also a significant difference in interior
space.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.670
The back seat is cramped and its cargo capacity,
with the seats up or down, is essentially

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.480
tied with the Lexus NX and Range Rover Evoque
for class worst.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.000
Its cabin quality is amongst the class best,
though, giving up nothing to pricier Porsches.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.630
Construction embodies the term precision,
the materials used are excellent, and the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.910
design, right down to the ignition being to
the steering wheel's left is pure Porsche.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.530
Now, we could probably do with fewer buttons
on the rising center console and a more user-friendly

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.640
touchscreen.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.310
It can all be a little overwhelming.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.360
The same could be said of the price.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.700
Until a base model Macan comes along, pricing
starts at just under $50,000 and few hundred

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.040
more than a base Cayenne.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.600
That's a lot, but it does match the SQ5.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.200
Just beware of the lengthy and hilariously
expensive options list â€¦ tens of thousands

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.140
can be added to the bottom line like that.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.280
Which is really just another way that makes
the Macan a true Porsche.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.040
