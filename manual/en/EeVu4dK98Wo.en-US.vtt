Dukan Crakers, easy (no oatbran needed)

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.419
by lasrecetasdexoniaparadukan.blogspot.com.es

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.240
Ingredients:

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.859
2 tablespoons cornstarch,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.119
2 oz / 55 grams fat free cream cheese,

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.849
1 teaspoon baking powder,

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.179
1 egg white (raw)

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:26.810
and 1 pinch of salt.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.759
Combine all the ingredients

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.890
in a small bowl:

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.060
cornstarch, baking powder, salt

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.700
fat free cream cheese

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.280
and 1 egg yolk.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.750
You just beat everything together 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.440
until creamy. 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.830
Your batter is ready,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.580
easy, isn't it?

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.800
See?

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.569
Smooth, creamy and lump free.

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:01.360
Almost ready to bake.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.430
Cover an oven tray with parchment paper,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.680
this way you don't have to use oil or butter 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.900
to grease the tray..

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.190
Scoop small amounts of batter using a spoon

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.750
and place them onto the tray,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.400
making like little crackers.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.760
Xonia says she uses small silicone molds,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.820
like the ones you use to make muffins, only 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.570
smaller, to get tiny, beautiful crackers.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.910
But I like them like this, rustic.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.050
Now, sprinkle some spices over the crakers

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.300
to add flavour and aroma.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.980
This one smells like serrano ham

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.470
and chorizo. It's just amazing!

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.440
You  can add  minced onion, 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.729
onion salt, oregano, garlic,

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.990
sesame seeds

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.790
or any spice or herb you like.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.790
What about some sweet paprika?

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:16.479
It gives them a smoky flavour,

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.039
Didn't I told you I like rustic, strong flavours?

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.770
Sprinkle some sea salt over your crakers

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.359
and you're done. Bake them at 350 F / 180 C

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.259
for 12 to 15 minutes,

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:32.219
they'll be crispier if you bake them longer,

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.879
but don't let them burn!!

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.529
They are so tasty, that someone

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:40.509
eat almost all my crakers

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:45.819
while they were cooling down 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:46.549
over the counter top.

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.149
I went into the kitchen and

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:50.639
was able to save just theese 3!

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.929
I had to bake a new batch

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.729
to take the photo and finish 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:59.430
my video. Funny, eh?
