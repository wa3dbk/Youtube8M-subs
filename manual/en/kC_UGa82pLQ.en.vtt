00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.540
It's mid-morning in the backcountry 
of central Oregon.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.360
I can see it.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.400
Where?

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.620
What? You tell me when you can see it.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.000
Troy Capps and his family are on a mission.
They're searching for antlers.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.960
It's just excitement, I guess, of being
out there and walking around and when you

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.489
find one, realizing that you're standing
right there at the moment that deer dropped

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:32.529
its antlers. It's pretty exciting to know:
it was right here, and I found it.

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.529
That's what we're looking for right there

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.820
Deer and elk naturally lose their antlers
every year. It's kind of like when a child

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.100
loses a baby tooth.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.980
Three point.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.980
Call Teresa, you gotta tell her.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.880
Found one.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.760
The sport of searching for them is called
shed hunting.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.560
Bu tot everyone is as ethical as the Capps'
family.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.220
Hunting for antlers can seem like a harmless,
fun game. But there's an ugly side.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.680
Shed hunting is illegal when people trespass
onto private property or protected areas.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.329
When nobody is watching some people will chase
elk on foot or with ATVs.

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:17.009
The stress of being chased can make elk shed
their antlers prematurely. It can also spark

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.549
a stampede.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.689
And stampeding elk can end up sick, injured
or dead.

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.090
This kind of activity prompted Capps to help
start Oregon Shed Hunters to promote ethical

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.579
shed hunting. No cutting fences, no destroying
habitat, no harassing animals to get them

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.079
to drop their antlers faster.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.940
You're an official Oregon Shed Hunter.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.340
I guess I am. That's not bad.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.600
That is really good.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.520
To be out there with an ATV trying to chase
you know a deer around until it drops. Or

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:50.329
even being out there running around. That's
just not healthy for them, and it's not

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.279
healthy for the sport.

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:55.939
You've probably seen antlers used as art
or to build furniture.

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.240
Hunters can sell antlers for up to 35 dollars
a pound. A prized set of antlers from a trophy

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.980
elk can bring in thousands.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.960
The commercial market on these is... People like to just have them around. Some people do.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.379
Wildlife enforcement officer Richard Mann
is on the watch for illegal shed hunting in

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.739
Central Washington.

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.860
He says it's especially cruel. Illegal shed
hunters chase elk when the animals are at

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.629
their most vulnerable.

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.430
They're in poor body condition, not a lot
of fat left, so if they're made to run, they're stressed.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.930
It puts them in a condition where they may
not fall dead when you're looking at them

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.349
right then, but up to a day or two after that
stress has occurred it has an impact on them.

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.459
And we lose elk, they die because of it.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.659
If caught in a closed wintering area, illegal
shed hunters get a trespassing ticket. Citations

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.159
can be as steep as $1,000. But they're usually
lower than that.

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:51.180
I view it as almost theft. It's theft. Theft
of either the opportunity, theft of resources.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.879
And that all effects all of our citizens who
enjoy it. Like to come out, like the opportunity

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.900
to come out and find just one antler.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.000
It's legal to search for antlers all year,
as long as the place you're looking is not

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.500
closed to protect animals.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.900
Come on, go on. Let's go for a walk.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.709
One Northwest group is working to protect
elk on their wintering grounds. Kyle Winton

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.749
is the co-founder of Eyes in the Woods.

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:16.289
We're taking a camera that was a problem camera out in the field

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.629
and I'm testing it to see if it still continues to fail

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.880
The group hides cameras in closed areas. They've
caught people with ATVs, people with dogs,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.120
and people on foot.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.660
Our hopes is that we can actually be the deterrent
out there, rather than the people that, 'You did it'

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.700
pointing fingers

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.180
Winton says illegal hunters stockpile antlers
they've collected all winter. Then they

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.670
carry the antlers out when the gates open.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.560
It's amazing how they can find that many in
a short time but how can you question

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.880
em, cause how can you prove it? So by us being
there, hopefully we can catch them going into those caches.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.060
It's dawn on May 1, the opening day of shed
hunting at Oak Creek Wildlife Area outside

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.170
of Yakima.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.689
These hunters are playing by the rules -- they've
waited all winter. Some camped out all night

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.669
to be among the first to enter.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:27.600
By now, the elk have migrated into the mountains,
safely away from the ruckus.
