00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.069
well on the twenty twelve allot happen
this week small political stories of the

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.490
kind of a little stories that the twenty
twelve audience loves and we will get to

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.630
those little bit later we have a great
book review coming were in a get

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.570
in-depth into the main senate primaries
and the results there and and looking

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.469
forward to

00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:21.719
the the november election aaron some
very quirky things happening in the

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:23.400
state of maine all year long

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.109
and awards and no doubt be important

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.939
uh... com befall uh... but we're gonna
take a look at out a couple the adds a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.220
came out this week in the presidential
campaign analyze them a little where

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.879
they're coming from i think there's a
missed opportunities here i don't think

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.170
they were all that great

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.130
uh... but i think i did and what was
that the other were to start with that

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.479
one is of uh... an ad

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.109
released by the d_n_c_

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.399
uh... this is what we're calling the
firefighter ad and this is addressing

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.420
of the sort of

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.920
the idea coming out of the private
sector to kind of labeling what public

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.899
sector jobs are in something the obama
campaign has to do because the were

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.739
public sector job public-sector unions
is too vague approve to bake in the

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.899
state of wisconsin where scott walker is
a will hold on to his governorship but

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.049
it also will be proved too big four the
general election campaign that's why

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.820
we'll take a look at this in seeing then
put a face on who these public sector

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.850
union people are this is the firefighter
at

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.080
i'm a firefight

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.130
and it takes

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.870
unlawfully songs

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.140
mitt romney says there should be fewer
of me

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.470
and me

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.920
who wants to cut taxes for people like
themselves

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.530
by cutting jobs like mine

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.100
and i talked to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.980
tells us support our families

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.860
strip in our communities in korea
company

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.110
within the same thing in massachusetts

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.740
community stuff

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.719
at large

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.830
through crowds

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.320
didn't work there

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.030
anymore

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.540
knowingly having a blast and

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.890
from here

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.660
you know this is an effort to allowed to
obviously paint economic plant planet

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.899
met ron it's also very clever ad in the
what it does as we mentioned before

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.159
is it was a face on the some these
public sector jobs art

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.970
and when you see a firefighter speaking
when you see somebody who's a police

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.060
officer when you see a teacher and you
realize that they are gonna be the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.039
casualties of iran economy according to
the obama

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.629
the animated a far more effective and
and this is one of the things we know

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.149
that wisconsin again

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:24.439
stahl walker retained

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:25.540
that seat

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.000
uh... and and was able if i
public-sector unions but he excluded the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.410
police unions and the firefighters units
from all his conversations about about

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.730
limiting collective bargaining there and
that was smart because the people like

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.230
their policemen they like their
firefighters and and of course they like

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.820
their teachers and and and that's what
the obama campaign is trying to play on

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.740
i thought a very effective foray into
that because matt romney is always super

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.060
vague when talking about these things
panoramic comes back i think uh... you

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.469
know coming off of the old palm up

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.359
and gap which was certainly a gap in and
it's uh... where

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.760
obama said the private sector is doing
fine at mit romney wanted to say in fact

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.739
the private sector is not doing fine he
did so many comical add where the comedy

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.280
just didn't work this is the molecule
nad

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.839
uh... from the romney campaign

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.069
you know you're from our thing people
uh... are going to see that

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.019
uh... we're starting make some progress
if i don't have this done in three years

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.540
than this limit one per

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.540
proposition

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.619
so at noaa clever ad for a second again
i was on in seattle wasn't paid for by

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:51.799
the run the campaign and that it takes
to be done

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.370
mole again as an idea and that somebody
will get another shot first of all i

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.909
don't think you're getting a lot of
votes from people who don't play golf

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.739
there the mall again is absorbing arcane
terms

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.779
but views all the time for golfers and i
think there's a in popular culture

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:09.329
it's known what a modem is but it
doesn't spread much further than that

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.609
also morgan is taking in other shot here
they shown taking the same shot over and

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.229
over and over again

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:18.009
i'd just feel like they have an
opportunity here when you have somebody

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:20.799
making saying something like the
president did

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.210
uh... when he said do you know did give
us the time we're gonna get it done if

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.040
not then give a chance to vote us out
very similar to some in the bill clinton

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.170
said when he visited cuyahoga community
college in two thousand ten he said the

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.520
president of our monies he set up
president of bomb a we had a lot of

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.460
fixin to do give us two more years that
we don't do the fixing hot now then you

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.980
can go to sam two more years when you
have things like that sort of lying in

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.150
your lap anew the republicans and this
is the best at even come up with not

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.990
terribly effective i don't think in and
i think you think they have a a of

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.060
course other opportunities to play with
that line to play with president

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.290
clinton's line but these were not
opportunities well-taken so there you

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.620
had a when we're back we're gonna be
back with uh... with mike mammoths of

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.740
um... unit from maine who's gonna be
talking to us about in the main uh...

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.430
election and coming up in the fall and
the primers that were held this past

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.490
