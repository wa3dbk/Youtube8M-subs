00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
This is Assyria

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.077
It’s the future and we’ll get violent
- one town founded

00:00:03.077 --> 00:00:05.388
It needs a matching Siege Tower

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:07.688
Also Liberty means another Settler

00:00:07.688 --> 00:00:08.688
Cities everywhere

00:00:08.688 --> 00:00:10.328
Where’s the enemies?

00:00:10.328 --> 00:00:11.617
Need some enemies

00:00:11.617 --> 00:00:12.998
Hello Enemy

00:00:12.998 --> 00:00:13.998
Triggered some war

00:00:13.998 --> 00:00:18.058
Can’t trust the Spartans - much better apples
are out there

00:00:18.058 --> 00:00:19.448
Eat the Spartans!

00:00:19.448 --> 00:00:21.318
Delete their Worker

00:00:21.318 --> 00:00:22.658
End the suffering

00:00:22.658 --> 00:00:24.998
Hopefully Alex can’t recover

00:00:24.998 --> 00:00:27.408
No one can recover from Siege Towers

00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:28.898
Especially Alexander

00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:32.118
Two Siege Towers got near and claimed it for
Assyria

00:00:32.118 --> 00:00:33.428
Where’s my religion?

00:00:33.428 --> 00:00:34.527
I want a religion

00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:38.727
I don’t want to deal with this lady - she
won’t trade Embassies for free

00:00:38.727 --> 00:00:41.277
Our little island nation can withstand attacks

00:00:41.277 --> 00:00:45.177
I’m not one to ignore reading between the
lines - I think she likes me

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:48.347
The National College will lead us to an advanced
military

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:50.407
We can be first place!

00:00:50.407 --> 00:00:51.907
Right now in second

00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:54.207
Life goes on while a World’s Fair is considered

00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:57.668
We were also at war with Darius but his men
never came

00:00:57.668 --> 00:01:01.097
A Roman soldier keeps an eye on our danger
levels

00:01:01.097 --> 00:01:03.218
Right now we aren’t very dangerous

00:01:03.218 --> 00:01:06.858
We are hospitable and industrious - take that
Caesar

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:07.928
And we trade good

00:01:07.928 --> 00:01:11.278
And use our Great Church Man to keep other
religions out

00:01:11.278 --> 00:01:13.998
A Work Boat moves to the oil slick

00:01:13.998 --> 00:01:16.808
The 1900’s should be great - just great

00:01:16.808 --> 00:01:20.028
Ideologies will change - but it’s part of
a plan

00:01:20.028 --> 00:01:23.658
This guy is not part of the plan - he’s
just mean

00:01:23.658 --> 00:01:25.268
School will be cool

00:01:25.268 --> 00:01:26.658
Then Subs and Tourism

00:01:26.658 --> 00:01:30.288
Still Free so the Liberty Statue will be…
free

00:01:30.288 --> 00:01:32.328
Also free to chose Aesthetics

00:01:32.328 --> 00:01:35.588
Then switching to Order since Lady Liberty
is done

00:01:35.588 --> 00:01:36.678
Knowledge is power

00:01:36.678 --> 00:01:39.098
Augustus is a d-bag

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.168
The Kremlin is in order

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:43.788
All sorts of amazingness in Assyria

00:01:43.788 --> 00:01:47.808
Tourists can go to the Hermitage soon - turn
here once it’s built

00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:51.318
Hello Atomic atrocities - the future is totally
nuke-ariffic

00:01:51.318 --> 00:01:54.268
1950 - the year of the Water Mill

00:01:54.268 --> 00:01:56.327
Also found out about Oxford

00:01:56.327 --> 00:01:58.568
Which led to cameras in orbit!

00:01:58.568 --> 00:02:00.848
Finally the Hubble is under construction

00:02:00.848 --> 00:02:04.698
A Siege Tower has no where to go but the bottom
of the Arctic Ocean

00:02:04.698 --> 00:02:09.317
There’s tales of radioactive rock out west
- so need a Settler

00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:13.658
Gotta settle on an Antiquity Site - no I’m
not proud of my actions but it was for the

00:02:13.658 --> 00:02:14.658
good of the people

00:02:14.658 --> 00:02:18.298
Tourism isn’t enough - need weapons of mass
dangerousness

00:02:18.298 --> 00:02:23.298
Come on Internet - need AOL Instant Messenger
already, and Google Maps Streetview

00:02:23.298 --> 00:02:24.557
Now I am angry!

00:02:24.557 --> 00:02:25.837
How dare they go to space

00:02:25.837 --> 00:02:30.578
And how dare they bomb all my units - you
don’t want to see the carnage

00:02:30.578 --> 00:02:32.408
Need time to ready ourselves

00:02:32.408 --> 00:02:35.388
Stealth technology will mend and defend

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:39.328
Missile Cruisers also do some defending - active
defence

00:02:39.328 --> 00:02:41.548
You built that city on rock &amp; roll, eh?

00:02:41.548 --> 00:02:42.987
And beautiful hat

00:02:42.987 --> 00:02:44.718
Ready to claim some Greece

00:02:44.718 --> 00:02:47.828
Girl - you got to change your crazy ways,
you hear me?

00:02:47.828 --> 00:02:49.078
Say sayonara to Argos

00:02:49.078 --> 00:02:51.917
Knossos is knocked down

00:02:51.917 --> 00:02:55.417
Darius rocks the culture - you gotta get that
look

00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:58.988
Back and forth with Alex over his cities - the
man is incorrigible

00:02:58.988 --> 00:03:01.707
It’s ours for all eternity now

00:03:01.707 --> 00:03:03.697
Found the last bit of Greece

00:03:03.697 --> 00:03:05.968
The Destroyer waits for its moment

00:03:05.968 --> 00:03:07.447
The moment is gone!

00:03:07.447 --> 00:03:09.017
As are the Greeks

00:03:09.017 --> 00:03:12.787
Nothing else to do but load up another game
- we did lose remember - the screen fades

00:03:12.787 --> 00:03:36.807
to black and there’s farewell music in the
distance
