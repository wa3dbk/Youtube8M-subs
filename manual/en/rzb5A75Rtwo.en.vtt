00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.690
Hi!
I am Shawna Coronado and I am here today with

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.820
Chef Ryan Hutmacher, "The Centered Chef".
And he is going to show us how to cook a meal

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.080
for ten dollars or less.
And guess what?

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.270
We are right front, standing right inside
my front lawn vegetable garden.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.350
We are going to use the vegetables from the
garden to make our lunch.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.980
So we are doing a curried turkey salad and
we are going to put a little spin on it.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.650
We are actually, we are going to put, we are
going to start off with the dressing.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.260
Which will start off with the curry.
We have a little bit of olive oil based mayonnaise

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.540
right here.
Oh, that smells wonderful already.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.170
A little red wine vinegar.
It is that curry.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.990
It jumps out right at ya.
And a little bit of mustard right there, a

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.510
little Dijon.
What I am going to do Shawna, I am going to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.570
mix this up.
I am going to pass this over to you, because

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.159
anytime you are going to make a salad with
a vinaigrette or a mayonnaise based dressing,

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.200
you always want to make the dressing first.
So I am going to pass this over to you and

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.030
we have some really cool ingredients over
there that I am going to have you toss in

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.030
there.
Okay.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.360
We have grapes.
We have some red flame grapes.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.490
How many should I add?
You know, you can go ahead and add the whole

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.750
thing inside of there.
Now add some dried apricots inside there.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.340
Apricots, and we also have some celery.
We have some celery, which is going to add

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.759
a nice little crunch.
And we have, what is this?

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.860
Those are dried, tart cherries.
And those are actually from Travers City,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.800
Michigan.
Alright, so I have got my sauce all stirred

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.049
up.
You can see that is coming together really

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.420
nicely over there.
I am going to give you some red onion.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.009
Okay.
Which is going to add a nice savory element,

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.090
but still stay sweet and true to the flavors
of the curry.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.759
So you go ahead and mix those inside there.
Alright.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.460
What I have got going on right here, I have
got a nice sweet, tart element going with

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.299
some green apple.
So we are just going to just throw that right

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.810
inside there.
While you are mixing that together, what I

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.549
have is, this is the main element of the dish.
This is the turkey.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.979
So I just got this at the deli.
It is a whole muscle meat turkey, so it is

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.790
a nice healthier version instead of processed
meat.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.290
Um, this is going to be between four and five
dollars a pound.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.890
Okay.
So this is the most expensive component to

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.810
the dish, but.
If we wanted to lower the price even more?

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.950
If you wanted to lower the price even more,
you can go with chicken believe it or not.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.190
Because it is going to be about twenty to
twenty-five percent cheaper.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.720
This is going to add a nice lean element with
all those bold flavors in there and a little

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.680
bit of that mayonnaise.
So you are going to mixed that in there and

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.650
what is really going to brighten this up is
add a dash of lemon juice.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.521
You go ahead and just keep mixing that in
there.

00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:49.060
Alright.
I am stirring.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.040
Now, to make it all come together.
Okay.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.180
We have your lettuces from the garden here.
One of things I really like to do with this

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.530
is, is instead of eating it like lettuce leaves
and kind of just breaking it up, I actually

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.909
like to kind of just take it and cut small
ribbons.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:09.159
Just like this.
And we can either make this into a salad,

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.159
or we can make it right into a garnish right
on a sandwich.

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.159
Easy.
See that?

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.280
Nice and fluffy.
Taking this just like this, going right on

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.959
the plate.
Beautiful.

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.659
And then, what we can do is, we will take
that right there and go ahead.

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.350
But it right there on the side.
Go ahead and dish up a nice serving right

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.120
there.
You have about four servings there in total.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.299
Wow!
That is a lot of food.

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.810
So this is a nice option right here or what
you can also do is if you did not want it

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.159
as a salad, then you can have it as a sandwich.
So we have a flatbread or if you have a tortilla

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.481
on hand.
Go ahead.

00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:45.680
Alright.
And dish that right up inside of there.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.501
What do you think?
Is that enough?

00:03:51.501 --> 00:03:54.180
I think that it looks fantastic.
I think that it looks fantastic too.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.040
The best part, is sampling.
A little taste.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.350
Yes.
Oh!

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.510
Mmm!
This is delicious!

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.959
Wow, this is really good.
Ten dollars or less meals.

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.109
You rocked it man!
And I love this.

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.840
It was terrific.
So, next time, do you want to come back with

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.500
me and do it again?
I will be back, absolutely.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.999
Alright, then we will see you next time.
