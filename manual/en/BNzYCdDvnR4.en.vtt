00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.480
And there,
my No-bake cheesecake is ready to be served.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.150
It tastes so good.
I do hope you make it, too.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.950
Hello, again.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.110
Now,
I'm going to make my No-bake cheesecake.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.270
Iingredients are as follows;

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.970
Biscuit, melted butter, cream cheese,
sugar, yogurt,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.060
fresh cream, lemon juice and powdered gelatin.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.240
Let's get started.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.360
Now,
Let's get to it.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.590
First,
make a basement of cheesecake.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:48.160
Add the biscuits to a food processor.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.540
Turn it on.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.180
Turn it off.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.270
By using a food processor, 
you can do it easy.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:16.680
Add the melted butter to the powdered biscuit.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:26.640
Mix them, again.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.320
Turn it off.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:46.470
Next,
move the mixed dough to a cake pan.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.430
Press the dough into the bottom, making flat.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.770
Here,
it's done.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.090
Next,
mix the powdered gelatin and water.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:17.160
Add the gelatin to hot water of over 176'F (80'C) degrees.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.290
melt it.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.360
This work is simple.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.860
But if the water temperature is too low, 
A cheesecake is not solidified.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.880
Pay attention to the water temperature.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.460
It's done.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.750
Next,
make dough of No-bake cheesecake.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.880
Add the all ingredients to the food processor.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.280
The cream cheese.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.300
The sugar.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.350
The yogurt.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.830
The fresh cream.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.660
The lemon juice.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.440
Turn on the food processor.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.250
Great!

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.610
Turn it off.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.760
And then,
add the water-soaked gelatin.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.140
Mix them before the gelatin gets cold.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.180
Stop.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.970
They have just well-blended.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.640
Pour them into the cake pan.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.350
Look delicious.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:23.630
Using a spatula, scrape it up.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.370
As it is, there are many air-bubbles in the cake.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:39.190
By doing this, remove the air-bubbles.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.760
Finally,
put plastic wrap, and chill for three hour in the refrigerator.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.030
Here,
place the cake in the refrigerator until it has set.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.740
Chill for three hour in the refrigerator.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.160
Look,
the cheesecake has set, like this.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.280
Finally,
garnish a dish.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:17.760
Sprinkle pink colors.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.120
It's ready.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.150
And there,
my No-bake cheesecake is ready to be served.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.250
It' tastes so good.
I do hope you make it, too.
