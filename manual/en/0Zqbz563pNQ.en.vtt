00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hello America,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm Pat Condell, and I'm your friend

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
because I live in the UK and our two countries have quite a lot in common

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
apart from the fact that everyone else on the planet hates our guts.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We speak the same language, you and I, we share the same culture, more or less,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and we worship the same god,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
a just god, a jealous god, a psychotic god

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
whose vengeance is terrible to behold, especially if we've got anything to do with it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Praise the Lord.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Your president is a born again Christian, in the sense that Dracula was born again when he rose from the grave -

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
or was that Jesus?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Do we drink his blood, or does he drink ours? I've often wondered about that one.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Our prime minister is also a Christian, although I'm not sure if he's been born again.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The truth is a lot of people in my country are now sorry he was ever born in the first place.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But you have a particular brand of Christianity in America which is unique and extremely creative

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in that it bears absolutely no resemblance to the message of the prophet it supposedly reveres

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and is in fact diametrically opposed to every single thing that he ever said, without exception,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
which, if nothing else, America, shows incredible balls on your part.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
In Britain we have an established church, which means we are officially a Christian country.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But, like you, we don’t discriminate. We’ll sell arms to anyone.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And we really don’t care what atrocities they’re used for

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Praise the Lord.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Because God is on our side, we both know that when our country is doing evil

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
it’s good evil, as opposed to evil evil.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And we know that good evil always defeats evil evil,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
except when evil evil cunningly disguises itself as good evil

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and becomes born again. Then you’ve got a whole new ballgame.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And your president plays this particular game very well indeed.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We all know his history;

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:27.000
we know how he used to be just a useless cocaine-snorting drink-driving draft-dodging daddy’s little rich boy hellraiser,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
until one day, after a chat with Billy Graham, he had a revelation

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that he had been chosen by God, to be a dangerous delusional bigot.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
He was quickly shoehorned into the governorship of Texas, where he finally found he had a talent for something –

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
signing death warrants, praise the Lord,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and from there it was just a short step to George W. the Lionheart, president of all Christendom.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Because they say he’s very well connected, your president,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and this doesn’t mean his joints are reinforced with steel wire – nothing as sinister as that.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It simply means that he has a lot of corrupt and powerful friends

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
who will stop at nothing to get their way.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And by his own admission he invaded Iraq because one of these friends,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
namely God, instructed him to.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Now I’m not going to try and tell you that your president George W. Bush is insane,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
because the way I see it you don’t actually need to be insane if you’re George W. Bush.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
If you’re a cynical small-minded nasty little born again hypocrite with a Bible in your hand,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
then frankly, you’re already holding a royal flush, and you don’t need any more cards.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And besides, he’s more than ably assisted in all his endeavours by our insane Christian prime minister,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
another little man with blood on his hands

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
which he didn’t get from having nails hammered through them,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
although I’m sure his press office would like us to believe otherwise.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And we all know that he joined in with the invasion of Iraq

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
because he felt "the hand of history" on his genitals

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and because he wants a cowboy hat.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
The way he walks when he’s with Bush, it's like they’re on their way to the OK Corral,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
or some other gay club.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
But it turns out that some people in Iraq, for some inexplicable reason,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
don’t actually want freedom and democracy imposed on them from outside,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
which just proves the truth in the old saying, America, that you can lead a horse to water,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
but you can't make him suck your cock.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000
But never mind, because we’re still here, and we still love you, yes we do.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And let me just say that we don’t feel at all used or defiled by you, America.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Well, maybe we do just a little. Actually, maybe quite a lot,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
but it's worth it for the privilege of being friends with you,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
even if you do insist on taking our fingerprints

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
before you'll let us into your country.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Because frankly, America, you have saved our bacon.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
If not for you, we wouldn't be the high profile country we are in the world today.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Having lost an empire, we were ready to be shunted away into the sidelines of history, and forgotten

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
but now, thanks to you, and your glorious mission from God,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
we find that we still have a role to play in the world,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
poking our nose in where it's not wanted,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
stealing and wasting every precious resource we can get our greedy hands on,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and kicking the shit out of brown people, the way Jesus would have wanted.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So thank you for that, America.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I can't tell you how proud that makes me feel.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I really, really can't.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
But it's human nature to live in hope,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
so let me just say in closing, America,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
as one friend to another,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
get well real soon.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We're all praying for you.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Peace.
