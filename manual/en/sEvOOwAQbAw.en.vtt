00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.710
So apparently evil robots from another planet
have destroyed our world (again), and humanity's

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.060
defense in this game's case is to don a suit
so you can ski down slopes, crashing into

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.290
the robots, and destroying them.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.119
Their one weakness!

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.280
Krashlander has you traversing hazardous mountain
paths with the end goal of smacking into these

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.800
robots, before moving onto the next mission.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.160
It's a physics based arcade game in bite sized
levels, but there is one crucial difference

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.560
here, the control scheme.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.399
Games like Bike Baron, that deal with positional
physics in relation to landing a jump usually

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.810
have a left and right arrow to adjust the
character in mid-air.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.820
Krashlander has a circle of directional positions
that take up half the screen.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.020
You can freely move through these eight positions
if you think of the center of the layout like

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.100
a joystick.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.940
Opposites play a large part in jumps (using
a crouch/leap system), but adjusting your

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.260
landing in mid-flight is not as simple as
moving left or right to compensate.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.850
Not only that, but crouching forward doesn't
really increase your speed on slopes, and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.070
the whole thing is more a case of trial and
error than learning the controls.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.040
The developer relates this input to learning
to ride a bike, and talks about everything

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.249
clicking and becoming second nature.

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:15.829
This was not true while reviewing, and even
if others have better luck, this learning

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:21.210
curve is a high barrier to entry and will
put off all but the most dedicated players.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.399
Presentation is quite striking with flat colors
combined with black and white.

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.219
It creates mood while imparting game information
easily, and the ambient wind noises help to

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.049
sell the whole package.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.210
Stars are achieved by completing levels in
a certain number of tries, though seeing that

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.130
you can restart a level, once you know what
you're doing, you can gain three stars without

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.880
any problem at all.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.880
Krashlander just asks too much of the player
while not meeting them halfway with an adequate

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.000
tutorial or first series of levels to teach
this complicated control scheme.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.039
The fun factor of barreling into robots suffers
as a result, and only those who wish to master

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.639
the complexity for self satisfaction or bragging
rights are going to persist or get anything

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:05.079
out of what this has to offer.
