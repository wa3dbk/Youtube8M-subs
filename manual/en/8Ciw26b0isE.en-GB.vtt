Hi and welcome back to Keep Calm and Bake.
My name is Caroline and I have been teaching

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.340
people how to cook on YouTube for yonks.
Anyway, this episode I'm going to teach you

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.240
how to make a very decadent chocolate tiffin.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.919
[Music]

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.109
This is unsalted butter. It's going to go
into my saucepan. I'm going to put this on

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.329
a very gentle heat because you want to this
part very slowly. You don't want to burn the

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.660
chocolate.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:45.070
Golden Syrup, I'm going to add. One. Two.
Once that has melted down I'm then going to

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.260
add the chocolate to it.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.900
While I"m waiting for that to melt. I'm going
to bash my biscuits. Now I've got some digestive

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.489
biscuits and I want to make them, I want to
mush them up basically. I don't want them

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.470
to be fine bread crumbs or anything. Still
want some chunks in there.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:10.340
So, I'm going to add them to a food bag. Half
of this I'm going to use. Put that, there

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:19.789
you go. I'm just going to break these up with
my hands. OK. You can if you want, bash them

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.170
a little bit. There you go.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:36.689
OK. Now, before they get to mushed, I'm also
going to add some Maltesers. Yum. Add Maltesers,

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:44.380
some into there. I'm going to give the Maltesers
a bit of a bash as well.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:55.079
So everything is, in small crumbs, I'm going
to add this to a large bowl. This is going

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.630
to be the base for your tiffin. I'm also going
to add some raisins.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.069
Once everything is melted together, I'm going
to add the chocolate. Pop it in there, mix

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.140
up some more. You can turn the heat off now
as well. So just let everything slowly melt

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:25.380
together. Heat off. See how quickly it all
melts.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.970
Chocolate mixture is melted. I'm going to
add some more Maltesers, add some more in

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:51.840
to my base mixture. Simply add the chocolate
to the biscuits. OK. Mix it all together.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:06.760
Once everything has a nice coating of chocolate
and you can pour it into your tray. Like so.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:20.980
Pat everything down firmly. You can pop this
in the fridge while you make your topping.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:37.780
So heat your cream, very gently again in a
pan with the golden syrup. Now here's a thought,

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:47.510
thumbs up if you want me to make some lavender
shortbread. I hope so. Anyway, my cream. Yeah,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.001
that's nice and warm. I'm going to take it
off the heat. And I'm going to throw in all

00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:57.720
my chocolate. I've got milk chocolate and
dark chocolate. If your more of a dark chocolate

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.090
fan than just keep it dark, that's fine. Or
if your a milk chocolate fan, than you can

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.270
keep it milky.
Keep stirring until everything is melted together.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:25.011
Lovely, that's all melted. Now get your tiffin
out. Mine is chilling. Okay. Lovely. Pour

00:04:25.011 --> 00:04:31.070
your melted chocolate goodness all over the
top. If you like the look of this recipe than

What a treat this is. So spread chocolate

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:48.310
all over the top. Looks like silky smooth.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:56.310
Now this goes back into the fridge until its
set. So a good maybe, 2 hours.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.630
Great! This has now set. We are going to take
it out.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:11.520
Oh it's lovely. I'm just going to cut this
into little pieces. Oh you can hear that lovely

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:19.150
crunch. The crispy Malteser and biscuit base.
Yum.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:27.840
You can now serve these all up. Pop them onto
your serving plate and let everyone get stuck

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.820
in. And I might have to just take a little
bit off the end now. There's always the corners

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:48.120
look a bit messy. I'm going to have a little
taste. Let's see. Mmm hmm. That was a really

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:56.010
big mouthful. But delicious! And easy. I hope
you all really really love this recipe. Please

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.320
