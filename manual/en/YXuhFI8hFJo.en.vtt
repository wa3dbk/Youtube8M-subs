Hi, my name is Brandon Sarkis, on behalf of
Expert Village. Today I'm going to take a

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.720
few minutes and show you what to look for
when buying a new set of pots an pans. So,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.269
just to summarize what we are going over today.
Is things you want to look for in a pan, or

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.099
things you don't want to look for in a pan,
like in this one's case. Don't get plastic

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.430
handles. All they'll do is melt, chip, crack
or break. Plastic handles are very very very

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:29.529
bad. Also try to avoid cheap steel pans. Because
they heat inconsistently, they cook inconsistently,

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:36.160
they warp, they bend, they break. They are
not good. Sure you can work with this, you

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.760
could make something with this, but it wouldn't
be nearly as much fun or as easy as making

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:50.829
that's all nice stainless steel like this.
Stainless steel is probably your best bet

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.250
for beginning or for intermediate cooking.
Once you get to a super advance stage or feel

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.590
comfortable or once you win the lottery you
can switch over to copper. And that's going

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.961
to really provide you with and exquisite experience
with cooking. Just keep in mind a couple of

00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:13.120
things though. You pay for quality to a point.
A good saute' pan should run you any where

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.310
between fifty to a hundred dollars. Anything
over that, I'd begin to question whether that's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.710
just, you know, an overly inflated price.
You can buy these things on discount. Look

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.060
online a lot of times. A lot of online retailers
will have them online a lot cheaper. And also

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.409
typically, you get a really good deal if you
buy a set. The problem is that sometimes the

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.729
sets are going to have pieces you wont use.
And also keep in mind, if it says its an eight

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.899
piece set, its usually four pieces and four
lids. Because the lids count as pieces too.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.549
With that being said though, what I like to
do is I'll buy a set to start. And then from

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.690
there I'll kind of add and subtract to is
as I go. And kind of get the set that I'm

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.399
ultimately looking for. Buying pots and pans
is a very personal thing. You know, what works

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.259
for me, may not work for you. I tend to prefer
aluminum pans over steel. Just because I don't

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.409
like having to deal with the hassle of cleaning
the steel pans, you know. But, now that's

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.980
just my opinion. Now I do have a couple of
stainless pans that I use, but all in all

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.700
I've used aluminum professionally for almost
the last fifteen years. And that's what I

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.190
know. I know the properties of aluminum, and
that?s what I know, I know the properties

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.220
of aluminum and that's why I use it. Some
people who've worked extensively in high end

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.460
dining situations use nothing but copper.
Copper is the comfort level for them, so that's

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.060
when you would use copper. I wish that I could
have copper, I'm just not going to spend four

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.672
thousand dollars on a set of saute' pans.
At least not right now. Also like I said,

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:37.250
bear in mind. Don't get into that mentality
that you have got to have every piece in the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.720
set. There are pieces that you will never
use. You might not need the steam rinser,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.390
you might not use the huge shock pot. You
might not need the omelets pan. You know,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.381
just use what you need. If nothing else just
own a medium size, like a ten inch saute pan.

00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:53.600
Own like a nice five or six quart sauce pan.
And own a nice stock pot and a steamer insert.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.370
And that will get you most of your stuff.
So with that being said, I hope you enjoyed

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.600
watching my video, I know I enjoyed making
it. Hopefully I helped you find a better way

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.110
to pick out your pots and pans. So have a
good one.
