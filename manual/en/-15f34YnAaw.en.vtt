00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.640
This train behind us is the TAZARA.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.720
It’s the longest railroad we’ll be taking: 1800 km!

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.680
It starts in Kapiri Mposhi,
where we are right now

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.200
and terminates in Dar es Salam, Tanzania.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.920
This is our little cabin,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.920
 just for the both of us.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.680
We brought tickets for 4 beds. 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.760
We don’t really travel light

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.120
so we do need space for the luggage.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.440
That’s why it’s simpler
to have the entire cabin to us.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.520
I just got out of the shower.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.480
It’s my first shower on a train,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.200
and it’s quite the experience.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.520
A good one.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.280
I wouldn’t do it every day

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.120
but twice in a lifetime is pretty good.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.560
Big step: we’ve just entered Eastern Africa.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.920
It is the 3rd of October and
we’ve just crossed the Tanzanian border.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.880
It’s our 17th country.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.440
We actually crossed the border in the train;

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.240
the longest trip of our journey is in the TAZARA.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.840
We’ve ben travelling for almost 24 hours

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.600
and there’s 1870 km in total.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.280
Mythic train;

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600
we’re in a small cabin.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.160
Everything went smoothly with customs:

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.080
we didn’t need to get off the train,
which is quite amazing!

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.880
They stamped our visas on a page
that is already quite full,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.480
which makes us hope we’ll be able
to end our adventure

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.960
with just one passport each!
