00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.370
Vsauce, I'm Jake and these are places in the
world that share my first name.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.190
You can use the tool on Data Pointed to find
your own or use teleporter to jump to random

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.990
spots around the planet with Google Street
View.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.859
Once you're done teleporting, check out some
more things you can Do Online Now, Guys...DONGs.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.679
Artist Daniel Boschung uses an industrial
robot to capture 900 million pixel portraits.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.949
He takes 600 macro photographs and stitches
them together to form one complete image.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.340
The result is a breathtaking ultra high resolution
photo that can be zoomed into for an incredible

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.120
level of detail.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.660
There are also a few amazing ones of insects.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.390
Instead of looking at dead insects, look at
dead colors.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.340
A chart that shows all the colors with the
hexadecimal number DEAD in them.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.390
Now let me ask you a question, what if the
moon were only 1 pixel, a scale model of the

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:05.350
solar system where 1 pixel is equal to 2,159.1miles
or the diameter of the moon.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.810
Then create your own solar system with Super
Planet Crash.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.790
The goal is to make a planetary system that
can remain stable for 500 years.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.300
It gets more difficult and fun when you start
adding in bodies with a greater mass and more

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.300
catastrophic.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.670
After possibly mastering planet placement,
find some new ones with Planet Hunters.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.040
Using data from NASA's Kepler Space Mission,
the site aims to have participants try and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.360
detect possible planets by judging the change
in a star's brightness.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.700
While exploring space, read up on what Einstein's
famous equation of e=mc^2 really means.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.140
Henry from MinutePhysics put together a great
interactive mass-energy scale that shows how

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.090
things like the energy of a rifle bullet corresponds
to the mass of a human sperm.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.090
Lets leave the vastness of space to check
out the urban jungle.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:00.340
Pick a location and see what the streets would
look like if they were overrun with wilderness.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.980
If you find it difficult to get around the
trees and snakes, take the mini metro.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.539
A subway layout game where you draw train
routes between stations to try and get your

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.849
growing population to their destinations on
time.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.650
If all goes well as a transportation mogul,
come up with a slogan using The Advertising

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.239
Slogan Generator cus Mama's got the Magic
of Vsauce.

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.730
Now that you control the metro control some
GIFs with GIF Control.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.680
You can fast forward or rewind random ones
to your heart's content and upload your own.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.879
I could watch this forever.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.880
Obligatory 2048 mention.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.709
And Holy Smokes Batman.

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.040
com is a site dedicated to bringing you the
very best catchphrases from 1960's Robin like

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.719
my personal favorite...

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.609
Now take a moment to come on and sl.am.

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:57.840
A website that will change your life forever
but for something delicious let's check out

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.769
some porn...burger.me.

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:10.030
Pornburger shows you some of the most ridiculicious
burger creations ever made like the cali-corn-ication

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.640
or the artery altering Slumberjack.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.010
Then burn off some of those calories with
Epic Boss Fighter.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.000
Like a wave of Contra nostalgia, Epic Boss
Fighter gives you 10 levels of epic battles.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.370
As you destroy more villains you get cash
to upgrade your abilities and armor.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.540
Or be stealthy in Assasseed's Crin, a demake
of Assassin's Creed that thankfully still

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.749
includes hiding in hay.

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:39.629
But instead of just demaking games, dedesign
the web.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.780
Where you guess the website only by its wireframe.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.739
And then move to the art world with Painting
Parodies.

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.720
Pick which painting by what artist you think
each one is to win.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.409
After displaying your art awareness, create
your own with Bomomo, a really fun drawing

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:54.409
site.

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.430
There are a multitude of different shapes
and brushes to choose from so you can make

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.310
something unique.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.139
Keep creating with Patatap, a music tool.

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.099
The sounds you have at your disposal depend
on what background color you choose.

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:14.520
Every letter key between a to z is a different
sound so you can make things like this...

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:22.480
To fight off spam, there's a 10 minute email
address to use on sites that require an email

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.500
without giving your personal one.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.500
Since you're not spending so much time deleting
spam, relax with A Soft Murmur, an ambient

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.870
sound generator that you can adjust to suit
your needs.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.570
While that's playing in the background see
how many words you can create out of these

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.630
random assortments of letters.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.840
Before shutting down your computer for the
night, make sure to use Jurassic Park OS to

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.500
access the main program grid...

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:58.030
I can only express my frustrations with emojicons.com!

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.090
To go with these DONGs there is a new JAM,
a playlist of Just Awesome Music, over on

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.090
WEsauce so you can listen to some cool songs
while checking out some cool sites.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.190
And as always, thanks for watching!
