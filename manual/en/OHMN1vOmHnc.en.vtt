00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.760
Port-au-Prince a city centre abused

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.440
from Petionville to downtown is a headache

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.160
trash on the street, sidewalks an invasion

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.400
people stacked on people, houses on houses

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.840
merchants selling everything

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.520
Port-au-Prince the city centre exploding

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.240
let's get ourselves together, decentralise

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.600
maniacs on the streets

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.160
naked kids, people stacked on people, animals on animals

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.480
merchants selling everything

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.760
I remember long ago my parents would tell me how beautiful
Port-au-Prince was

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.040
every day they would explain how the city was bright

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.960
the streets clean, on every corner a trashcan

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.360
Port-au-Prince the Prince's Capital where tourists flock

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.400
my parents often told me it was safe and secure

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.240
people were not broken-hearted

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.600
there were no power-cuts

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.440
in those days people lived everywhere in peace

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.640
no traffic jams - beautiful buses and tap-tap taxis

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.560
very little risk or vice - there was no aggression

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.920
in the city everyone was honest

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.840
Port-au-Prince today is not the place it once was long ago

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.240
people with a dollar- it's here they would come to enjoy the moment

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.640
to play in the Petionville Casino

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.320
dance on the beach, eat mangoes

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.840
take Bicentennial pleasure at a go-go

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.480
no mud, no trash, no puddles at every street corner

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.200
there was hope: but now the city's blown

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.560
the swollen city is close to bursting

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.880
it's here that everyone has come to live

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.320
Port-au-Prince can't support it

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.480
can't we see it's going to explode?

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.320
a city of 100,000 is now 3,000,000

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.520
we've surpassed all departments

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.960
we're left only with an explosion

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.480
we see the city swelling, merchants invading every street

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.840
peasants come to seek life

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.400
it's on the sidewalk they unite

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.680
people stacked on people in every park

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.120
there's no space from Main-Street to Champ de Mars

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.560
you'll see a true masquerade

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.960
plastic bottles and trash become a walkway

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.200
people and cars become a mass

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.560
the council say it's a disaster

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.920
Port-au-Prince is asking us for grace

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.360
traffic jammed from up-top to downtown

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.520
packed like a Legba

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.840
tap-tap taxi rides are a battle

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.240
after the rain a mass of trash

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.880
9 at night is already too late to go out

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.560
from up-top to downtown there's no electricity

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.560
the city is pitch-black

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.560
Port-au-Prince has no hope

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.520
what to do with this capital but rebuild?
