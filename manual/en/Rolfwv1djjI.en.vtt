00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:00.580
Hey guys!

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.280
So breakups are one of the many tough things people have to go through.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.340
And there's a lot out there on how to deal with it, or how to cope with breakups.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.760
But there actually isn't a lot on how to break up with someone.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.080
And if you have ever had to do that before,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.000
You know that sometimes breaking up with someone can be harder than getting broken up with.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.900
Especially if you still care about the other person.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.880
Which is why so many people use the worst breakup tactic of all.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.100
THE TEXT MESSAGE BREAKUP.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.780
As most of you know, this is one of the absolute WORST ways to break up with someone.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.960
And I know from personal experience,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.100
It is just the worst feeling ever.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.700
It's downright rude and cowardly.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.440
Unless, of course, they do something terrible to you and you don't care about them anymore

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.700
But if that's the case,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.920
you've come to the right place

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.520
Here are a bunch of other terrible ways to break up with people that you no longer care about.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.260
Hey, you ready?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.860
What?

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.200
Ready to go to class?

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200
We don't have chemistry anymore.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200
Exactly.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.240
Why didn't you flush?

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.240
Looks like a turd in a shape of a "C"

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.240
Ohhhh, that's cause you have to tilt
your head to the right

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.820
Now what do you see?

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.940
Just looks like a "U" now.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.380
Don't you see?

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.300
I dumped "U"

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.100
Hey, you must be popular on twitter

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.260
with all of those people following you, huh ?

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.120
I don't have a lot of people following me.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.540
Then, how do you explain

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.020
all the people I've been seeing behind your back?

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.160
Oh, actually, could you not

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.980
stand on my right side ?

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.720
Why?

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.720
Cause I realize that you're actually not right for me

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.720
and it's time I left you.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.680
Is that hair in the jar ?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.320
Yeah, it's a part.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.820
Are you watering it ?

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.140
No, we're watering it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.060
We're growing apart.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.680
Ah..man. I'm tired.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.240
Are you tired?

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.200
No, why?

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.460
Well, I mean you have been running through my mind all day.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.940
And I think it's time we took a break.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.900
Aanndd... done!

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.480
I just put this above you real quick.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.900
What is this?
And why you paint the "E" red?

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.140
Oh, just to let you know,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.140
that I'm already over you.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.860
You know, our relationship is like a broken mirror.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.460
It's better to just leave it alone,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.260
than to hurt ourselves trying to fix it.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.960
And also, if you look into it

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.780
you can see how much 
of a crazy crackhead you are.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.780
Why did you tell me to meet you at the gym,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.920
if we're just going to sit here?

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.020
Oh you know, just to let you know

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.760
that we're not working out.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.320
Alright.what about this peephole?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.020
I still don't see anything

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.800
I don't think it's working

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.400
Huh... you might be right.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.880
Maybe we should just...

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.580
see other peepholes?

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.560
What are you doing?

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.860
Obviously not you anymore.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.620
Hey, can I ask you a question?

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.120
Sure.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.120
Do you like this movie ?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.120
I get it.
I know what are you gonna do

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.620
What?

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.500
You're gonna break the DVD,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.360
and say that you think we should break up.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.260
Good one.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.740
What? No.
I was just gonna show you this

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.540
and tell you to look up.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.840
Seriously?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.580
What?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.580
You did this whole thing, just to 
break up with me ?

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.620
Just to make a joke?

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.340
No, I didn't....

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.340
If our relationship meant so little to you,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.340
that you can make a joke out of all of this,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.340
then I have nothing to be sad about,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.340
because it was never real to begin with.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.000
G, look...

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.380
Honestly, I... I didn't want to break up with you earlier

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.280
And....

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.640
I didn't know how to do it.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.900
So I made up all these stupid break-up jokes.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.380
And then I realized...

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.460
Breaking up isn't tough at all.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.400
Breaking up is easy.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.100
Most relationships end 
because people just give up on them

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.100
And, I know now

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.340
That... I'm not ready to give up
on this.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.440
Not just yet.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.620
Well...

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.680
Neither am I.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.040
Now I'm ready.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.640
What?

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.580
(phone buzzing)

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.740
So thank you guys again so much for watching,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.260
if you wanna see bloopers and behind-the-scenes,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.820
click the one on the left,

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.980

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.220

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.120
See you there! Or here. Or in the bloopers or in the previous video.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.720
See you-... I'm probably not going to be there.
