Hey, Bass Resource fans.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.040
Mike Iaconelli back here at ICAST 2013 at
the Molix booth.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.469
Usually, we do very new products that are
being introduced to the public, but I want

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.460
to do something a little bit different and
give you teaser of something that's very prototype,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.670
something that we're still in the process
of figuring out and give you a little teaser

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.080
on a bait that's going to be really hot for
open water fishing and structure fishing.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.710
And, everybody knows about the technique called
deep flutter spoon technique, where they're

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.450
taking these fluttering spoons and catching
fish off of ledges, off of deeps drops, and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.800
schooling fish, using that very wide, fluttering
spoon.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.200
One of the problems with that spoon has always
been the hook up ratio, the fact that it had

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.270
one hook.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.760
You'd get a lot of bites on it and put maybe
50 or 60 percent of the fish in the boat.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.880
One of the amazing thing about working with
Molix is they're the best in the business

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.780
with coming up with solutions to problems.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.630
So, with all the baits we've designed, with
the Lovr, the Lovr Buzz, the spinner baits,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.170
colors, they're the best at designing cutting
edge stuff.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.740
And so, here, I'm going to give you the first
look, and this really is the first look, at

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.900
a prototype structure spoon or, flutter spoon,
that we're working on.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.060
And, when you look at it, it really starts
to look a lot different than a regular spoon.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.461
It almost has kind of a bug look to it, and
it's got a scale pattern, natural eyes, and

00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:35.290
you can see that special cupped design of
that spoon.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.260
And, that's going to give the spoon that very
hard wobble, or flutter, as it falls.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.049
But then, you're going to see something that
stands out like a sore thumb, and that's the

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.410
addition of a second set of hooks.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.040
And that's the solution of the problem.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.659
So, we've got a hook on the bottom, like a
lot of traditional flutter spoons, and then

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.740
we've got a belly hook that actually lays
flush against the body of the bait.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.040
So, it's not going to tangle with the hook,
it's not going to be a nuisance around cover.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.209
But, when that fish slaps at it, it's going
to be two extra points in that fish's mouth.

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.510
You're going to go from having a 60 percent
ratio to a 90 or 100 percent hookup ratio.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.969
You add a Sampo swivel that's going to let
that fish rotate a lot of other features and

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.560
it's going to be amazing.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.900
We've got a gold one and a silver one, but
you're going to see a lot more.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.410
This is something that we're working on the
rest of the year.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.799
When this comes up it's going to change the
way you structure fish with the spoon.

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.249
Mike Iaconelli here, ICAST 2013, to give you
that special teaser.

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:41.649
Bye.
