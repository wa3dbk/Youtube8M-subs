Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:08.609
Today we will make mushroom bonda.

00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:14.880
They can also be called as mushroom pakora’s and are yummy and crispy.

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:20.731
The foremost advantage
of making these bonds is

00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:25.776
that they are prepared
within fractions of minutes.

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:31.716
Let’s see what all ingredients are required for making mushroom bonds.

00:00:31.953 --> 00:00:34.112
Mushroom - 7

00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:39.902
Bread crumbs - 1 slice (grinned in mixture grinder)

00:00:40.214 --> 00:00:43.103
Gram flour - 2 tbsp

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.543
Corn flour - 2 tbsp

00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:51.167
Red chilly powder - less then ¼ tsp (can also use black pepper instead of red chilly)

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:56.434
Salt - ¼ tsp (or as per taste)

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.186
Ginger paste - ½ tsp

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:02.998
Green coriander - 1 tbsp (finely chopped)

00:01:03.373 --> 00:01:05.476
Oil - to fry bonda’s

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.499
Prepare a batter of corn flour and gram flour firstly.

00:01:13.994 --> 00:01:28.618
Take corn flour and gram flour in a big bowl.

00:01:34.853 --> 00:01:41.604
Add little amount of water at a time and stir until all lumps get dissolved.

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:52.265
 Don’t add water all together because it takes more time to dissolve the lumps.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:07.128
Now add ginger paste, green coriander, salt and red chilly powder in the mixture.

00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:12.167
Add little amount of water because the mixture is quite thick.

00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:24.966
Keep the consistency bit thick so that the mushrooms get coated nicely with the mixture.

00:02:28.864 --> 00:02:34.477
Now cut mushrooms and heat oil in a pan.

00:02:35.236 --> 00:02:44.946
Clean mushrooms with wet cloth and cut them into two equal halves.

00:02:47.623 --> 00:03:05.486
Dip one piece at a time in gram flour mixture and then coat them with bread crumbs.

00:03:10.494 --> 00:03:14.161
Like wise prepare all mushrooms.

00:03:41.862 --> 00:03:45.212
Now fry all the coated bread crumbs when oil gets hot enough.

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:56.874
Place the mushrooms in oil gently and cook on medium flame until they get light brown color.

00:03:58.118 --> 00:03:59.999
It hardly takes much time to fry the mushrooms.

00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:06.998
Don’t keep the flame too low because they might start absorbing oil.

00:04:07.182 --> 00:04:10.865
Once they get golden brown color take them out immediately.

00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:28.568
Mushroom bonda is ready.

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:34.127
