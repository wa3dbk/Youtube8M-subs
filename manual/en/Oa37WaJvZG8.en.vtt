Hi Folks -- this is Sid from 3 Minute Travel
Tips. Walt Disney World Resort is now testing

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.140
a new technology that will soon be available
to all guests. It's called My Magic+ service

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.500
and it uses a handy device called a MagicBand.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.480
This is one of the most ambitious steps Disney
has taken in more than 30 years.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.590
 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.520
Ready to find out more? I've got the lowdown
in 3 minutes or less!

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.489
What if you could use a single source for
tickets, room keys, credit cards, PhotoPASS

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.559
cards &amp; even FastPass tickets while you're
vacationing at the Walt Disney World Resort?

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.789
That's where the MagicBand comes in. And
it all starts with the My Magic+ service.

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:54.789
Guests can go online to link your resort reservation
and tickets to your My Magic+ account. Using

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.829
the My Disney Experience website and app,
you can make dining reservations, make FastPass+

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.210
selections and even order MagicBands.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.990
The magic begins even before you enter the
resort or use Disney's Magical Express.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.990
Don't pack your MagicBand. Instead wear it and Disney Cast Members
can automatically check you in when you arrive.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:21.410
Your MagicBand is programmed to unlock the
door to your room. Don't worry -- the embedded
chip doesn't contain any personal information.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.430
 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.870
To enter the park, just touch your MagicBand
to the kiosk and place your index finger on

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.640
the scanner. Even small guests can use it. .

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.640
MagicBands are also connected to Disney's
new FastPass+ system. This could save you an enormous amount of time. No more running around

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.660
the park to collect FastPASS tickets! Just
bring your smart phone and select a time!

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.520
Bring a power cord and you can charge your
smartphone at charging stations throughout

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.530
the park or at Guest Relations.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.130
Don't have a smartphone? No problem! Kiosks
in the parks allow you to make reservations

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.060
and change your FastPass+ selections.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.810
* Purchases can be made using your MagicBand.
* PhotoPass accounts can also be linked to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.390
your MagicBand.
* Guests who cannot wear a MagicBand or prefer

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.780
not to use them can use an electronic card
supplied by Disney.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.610
* Program features subject to change after
testing phase.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.310
Because this service is being tested, some
of the features are subject to change. Check

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.069
