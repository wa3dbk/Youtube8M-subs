00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.649
Hyundai is playing a little bit of
catch-up with the redesigned Sonata

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.190
Hybrid which comes one model year after
the regular sonata was fully redesigned

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.900
but it's a pretty solid effort overall
with comfort affordability and space

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.750
that kind of salvage some
middle-of-the-road gas mileage when you

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.590
compared to the rest of the class now
unlike the previous generation of the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.099
sonata hybrid this generation actually
tries to look a little bit more like the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.670
non-hybrid car on which it's based you
can definitely tell some differences

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.850
though first front-and-center Hyundai's
sort of hexagonal grille here on the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.960
sonata a little bit deeper visually on
the hybrid the front and rear bumpers

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.739
also knew and check out these fenders if
you look closely hyundai says they're a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.329
little bit more aerodynamic on the
hybrid now the sonata hybrid has some

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.750
different gauges here versus the regular
sonata one of my favorite screens here

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.230
just kind of puts a very simple layout
of your driving style shows you how

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.399
economical vs aggressively you've been
driving very simple there I like that a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.969
lot

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.090
now otherwise the cabinet very roomy
especially in the back seat again like

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.870
the regular sonata very straightforward
layout of controls here we've been

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.750
having some issues though with the
multimedia system in our test car

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.310
navigation screen has been showing us
way off of the road were driving on and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.130
the radio screen actually froze for a
couple days and we were trying to change

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.460
stations it seems to be working now but
definitely something to keep an eye on

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.689
during your test drive now typical of a
hybrid it takes a few moments from when

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.479
you really get on the gas to win the
engine and the electric motor kind of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.840
come on and start working in tandem but
once that's going on the sonata hybrid

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.229
really does have enough passing power
especially if you take it out of eco

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.860
mode and put it into the drivetrains
normal or sport mode now like the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.009
regular sonata the sonata hybrid is
quiet it's comfortable at cruising

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.280
speeds not the sportiest of cars you
think that the hybrid you know what its

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.549
battery pack sitting behind the rear
seats there would add a little bit of

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.970
rearward weight distribution and improve
handling a little bit not so much the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.560
case some editors were also split over
breaking I thought they were ok in terms

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.860
of brake pedal feel for a hybrid one
other editor thought the pedals to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.100
spongy and difficult to modulate bring
the car to a stop

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.299
add it all up and EPA combined gas
mileage for the sonata hybrid is in the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.600
low 40s that's a lot better than the
regular sonata which gets combined

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.560
numbers anywhere from 25 to 32 miles per
gallon but in this class of sort of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.340
mid-sized hybrid sedans

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.069
a little bit middle-of-the-road you
think that Hyundai having the most

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.340
recent redesign with a leapfrog the
competition that's not really the case

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.769
with the sonata hybrid hybrid typically
lose out on trunk space because that's

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.519
where the battery pack has to sit but
the sonata hybrid actually does OK from

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.989
volume 13.3 cubic feet that's about
twenty percent less than the regular

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.220
sonata but actually pretty good for this
crowd of mid-sized kind of family sedan

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.360
hybrids there's a 60-40 split folding
rear seat it actually folds down in both

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.319
sections and leaves a pretty large pass
through you get a lot of stuff through

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.700
if you got to go to that hardware store
now the sonata hybrid starts under 27

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.760
thousand dollars which is pretty
affordable for this group of cars are

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.360
limited trim test car here runs around
thirty six thousand dollars which is

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.540
right around where the others top out
that comes from a pretty good pedigree

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.950
given that the regular sonata one cars
comms 10-car family sedan comparison in

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.700
2014 the hybrid builds on that I gotta
say it's worth a look

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.680
yeah
