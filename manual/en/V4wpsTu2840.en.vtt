This is James, Clairol color
director, and today we're

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:06.710
going to learn to get
head-turning highlights.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.890
Who doesn't want head-turning
highlights at home?

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.980
Here's what you're going
to need for this look.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.020
One Nice 'n Easy hair painting kit,
four hair clips, a role of plastic wrap,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:25.320
cotton balls, towels, paper
towels, a comb, a headband.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.109
Now let's get started.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.400
Mix the hair color according
to the package directions.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.520
If your hair is long enough, I want
you to put it up in a headband.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.340
You want all the hair
pushed away from your face.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.580
Next, using the tip of your tail comb
draw a small V into your hair line.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.940
Now I'm going to let you in
on a little insider secret.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.090
Keep a spatula with you.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.410
This is going to act as
your artist's palette.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.870
You're going to dip your brush
into the lightener mixture

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.240
and apply it to the spatula first.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.910
You do not want to apply
it directly onto your hair.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.000
When painting the highlights keep
the hair at a 90 degree angle

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.400
and keep it taut.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.880
You're going to hold the
brush like you would a pencil.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.550
Lightly sweep the section
closest to the scalp.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.450
When we get a little
further down the hair

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.780
strand you can lay your hair on top
of the spatula to get to the ends.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.470
Now, really important,
don't let that hair drop.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.330
Pick up a piece of cotton
as you're holding that hair

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.680
and place it underneath the hair strand.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.510
Let this section gently
rest on top of the cotton,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.180
rip off a piece of
plastic wrap and gently

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.230
lay on top of the painted sections.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.380
The plastic will act as a
barrier, but it will also

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.950
keep the heat from your scalp which
will assist in the lightening process.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.570
We're going to pull out another
section about two to three inches wide.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.320
You want to have some space
in between the highlights.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.130
Now, repeat the process that
you just did for each section.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.840
After about 10 minutes check
the progress of your highlights.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.150
Examine the strand
and look at the color.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.810
Does it look like it's
changing the desired lightness?

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.530
If not, that's OK.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.100
Just let it sit for
about another 10 minutes.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.780
If you're unsure you can wipe a
test strand with a paper towel

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.991
and check the shade.

00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:50.990
If you feel the hair has
not reached the desired

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.640
lightness then just reapply the
lightening mixture to the same strand

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.980
and continue checking about
every 5 to 10 minutes.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.330
But whatever you do, do not
exceed more than 90 minutes.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.600
Once you accomplish this
you're going to thoroughly

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.970
rinse the highlighting mixture from
your hair until the water runs clear.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.670
Shampoo, condition, and rinse.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.250
Now, most of the time
with lightening hair,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.700
it lifts but it does not give you the
desired tone that you are looking for.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.980
If this is the case, don't get nervous
if it's not exactly how you imagined.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.700
Now here's the insider's tip for an
exciting use for Natural Instincts.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.990
You can use it like a salon gloss.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.140
Apply it to towel-dried hair to
tone your hair in only 10 minutes.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.840
And with this trick you can
achieve so many great shades.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.890
You can do a lighter copper
on a deeper red base,

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.080
you can achieve mocha on
top of a rich brown base.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.170
That's it.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.930
It's that simple, that easy.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.850
You're the artist, and now
I'm teaching you how to paint.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.720
