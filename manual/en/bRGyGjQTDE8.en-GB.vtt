Hi I'm Jonny Lake from The Fat Duck
this is Edward Cooke, Sous chef at The Fat

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.670
Duck
lamb with cucumber is a flavor combination

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.570
we've been playing with for a number of years
we work a lot at The Fat Duck with flavor

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.180
pairings
we came up with some complimentary flavors

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.079
they were mint, caraway, caviar and green
pepper

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.499
this is salted, British caviar
all the eggs have broken down

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:39.739
I'm just going to pass it through a fine hemming
this is a saline gel with some charcoal

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.260
so I'm going to mix those half and half then
blend it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.579
that will give us our caviar oil
this is a fish stock that we've made into

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.800
a fluid gel
I'm just going to warm it through

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.699
what we're going to do is we're going to make
a mint butter

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.649
this here is double cream infused with quite
a bit of mint

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.140
I've taken that and put it into these beakers
I'm going to run it through a centrifuge

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.729
once we pass it off we're left with this mint
butter

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.140
so I'm just adding a little bit of the mint
butter in

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.329
and some final seasoning now
this is a quinoa cracker

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.650
what we've done is taken the grain quinoa
and just cooked it with water and salt

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.030
cooked it out a long way until all of the
starch comes out of it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.680
and then we spread it in an even layer on
a silpat

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.469
and then into the dryer
and you end up with something like that

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.219
if you've done it right it should puff for
us

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.860
and give us a really nice, light texture
these are just cucumber batons taken from

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.380
the heart of the cucumber
we're going to cook them sous vide

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.920
in the bag is a combination of olive oil,
green pepper juice and cucumber juice

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.161
so I'm just sealing that down now and cook
them in an eighty three degree bath for six

00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:02.700
and a half minutes
our cucumber batons are now cooked

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.630
we're just going to give them a sear now,
or a char really on one side

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:17.489
I'm just trimming off the ends of the cucumber
batons and cutting it two thirds down

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.870
finish with caraway salt
just a blend of taste of caraway and flor

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.569
de sal
so this is Cornish lamb

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.459
we've taken the loin and cooked it sous vide
in a sixty degree bath

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.069
we bring it to fifty six degrees and then
rest it for ten minutes

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.379
this is the end result of what we've done
with the lamb fat and skin

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.840
we cook it out in the oven between two heavy
baking sheets until we get this

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.980
it's almost like puff pastry
just to glaze it now with a little bit of

00:02:49.980 --> 00:03:01.980
icing sugar and we'll hit it with a blow torch
this is the fluid gel that we made earlier

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:12.200
little pieces of oyster leaf
in this mix here we have some lamb trotter

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.370
we've got some onion and some lamb sauce
these cubes here are lamb heart, lamb tongue

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.010
and lamb scrag
now we'll assemble it together

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:32.299
finishing with our quinoa cracker
this is tahoon cress

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.769
this is lamb consomme gelly that's been heavily
infused with mint

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:42.909
it's designed to be eaten throughout the dish
as a kind of refresher, almost a palette cleanser

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.800
this is a mint oil dressing
on top of the mint dressing we're just going

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.709
to put a single borage flower
we've got our lamb sauce finished with green

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.099
pepper and cucumber juice
and to finish it off we have our green pepper

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.670
and cucumber gel
and finally our caviar oil
