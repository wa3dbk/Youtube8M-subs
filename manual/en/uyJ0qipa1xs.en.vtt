00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In order to make money on the Forex market you have to buy low

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.500
and sell high, quite simple. Let’s have a look at the example:

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.500
How much money can you theoretically make by trading currencies?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.000
Let’s assume that you have 1,000 US dollars on your trading account.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.000
The current exchange rate of Euro versus the US dollar

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.500
is 1.25. In other words, for 1 euro

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.900
you get one dollar and 25 cents. You forecast

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.300
that during the day Euro would rise versus the US dollar.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.800
Based on this forecast you buy 800 Euros

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.700
for your 1,000 dollars. Your forecast is correct!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.700
Euro rises from 1.25 to 1.26 dollars.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.500
Being in profit you decide to close the trade and exchange

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.500
800 Euros back to 1,008 dollars. In effect,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.500
your profit from this trade is 8 dollars. Not that much, right?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.800
You raise a fair question:
Would it be possible to increase profits

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.800
In order to maximize your profit potential you can use leverage.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Leverage is a loan Tickmill provides you

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.000
to trade Forex. The size of the loan can differ but Tickmill provides you with up to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.800
500 times more funds than your initial capital,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.800
which also increases your profit potential 500 times.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.800
Great, right?, Still, please remember...

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.800
Increased leverage means not only more profit potential

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.100
but also more risks! Managing your risks is very important!

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.000
Let’s have a look at an example how to use leverage of

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.300
one to five hundred (1:500). You have the same 1,000 dollars on your account

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.000
and you estimate that Euro will rise versus the US dollar

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.800
therefore you decide to take the biggest possible loan from your broker 499,000 dollars.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, with the exchange rate of 1.25

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.000
you exchange all your 500,000 dollars to 400,000 euros.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.000
At the moment when exchange rate rises to 1.26

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.000
you exchange the 400,000 euros back to 504,000 dollars.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.300
As a result, you now have 5,000 dollars on your account

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.900
after returning the loan to your broker. So your net profit is 4 000 dollars.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
An incredible result after just one day of trading!

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.800
In this example we have looked at the scenario when your forecast

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
turns out to be correct. But what would have happened if instead of rising

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.200
Euro had fallen against the US dollar? In this case

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.400
your trade would be open until your losses equal your initial deposit,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.100
which is 1,000 dollars. At this point your trade will be

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.000
automatically closed and the broker takes back the loan. Consequently,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.300
a case when you can lose broker’s loan is almost impossible.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.000
Taking everything into account, you now have seen how leverage can increase your profits,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.000
if you make right decisions. At the same time, leverage can also work against you

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.000
if you make wrong estimations and don’t limit your losses.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.200
