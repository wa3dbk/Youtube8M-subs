00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.470
Now as you can see there are new maps

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.290
that I've added to the game.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.540
Well they're basically five maps.
There's this, this, this,

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.800
this and this one right here.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.890
This is the first map that I made. It was

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.190
based on Shadow Dance.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.520
The other four are based after the maps that are already

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.510
in the game but you play from the opposite
point of view, like

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.730
uhh, this one, it's basically Convoy Raid

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.200
but you play from the Pirates point of
view

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.670
which is actually pretty cool and uhh

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.670
Right lets test out my mod.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.990
Now aside from new maps, I've also added
new ships and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.990
new crew members. Well

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:33.859
lets see here, the ships aren't actually new
ships there basically ships

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.649
there in the game its just I've reactivated

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.250
them. Not that they weren't

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.810
active in the first place its just they were
not

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.049
available to the player so

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.420
let's play is a Civilian Galleon.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.420
Auto assign everything else

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.400
Black Hole! Caution recommended!

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.709
and here we are. Now I made the detail level

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.910
to be very very low because

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.129
of recording purposes but is actually
very cool

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.430
if you put it on very high detail. These are some of
my new ships that

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.970
I've put in. It's basically a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.580
weapons barge but I gave them all heavy weapons

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.129
so that outta.. although their health is

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.780
basically lower or still the same I gotta

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.019
re-check but

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.760
and they could also move now so they're now worth bringing.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.760
But they're weak, incredibly weak.

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.470
Sails Damaged!

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.470
Fire!

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.030
Enemy vessel destroyed! Sir!

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.660
Changing heading now.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.660
 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.299
 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:23.299
Changing heading now.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.920
Careful helmsmen. Asteroids! Fire!

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:43.599
Fire! Aye! Aye!

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.130
Setting course.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:00.130
One of our ships have has been destroyed Capt. Weapon bank destroyed.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.260
That was the mod and I will update

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.850
it as much as I can by update I mean

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.380
add new stuff into it. Have fun with it.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.690
