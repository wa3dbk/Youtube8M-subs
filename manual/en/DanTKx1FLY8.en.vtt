00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:04.970
Hi, I'm William Spaniel. Let's learn some game
theory.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.579
Today's topic is the prisoners dilemma and
the strict dominance solution concept.

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.959
I cover this in lesson 1.1 of my textbook can learn more about that

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.019
by clicking on the video description

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:14.729
in any case

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:16.230
here's the situation

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.830
two suspects are arrested

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.830
the police think that they're trying to rob
a store but the cops only have the

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.899
evidence to prove that the suspects were
trespassing

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.879
thus, to charge that the contacts with the
greater crime the police are going to need

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:28.919
one of the criminals rat out the other

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.669
and the way the police are going out was
that a confession is by throwing them

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.120
into the prisoners dilemma

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.730
which looks like this

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.490
each of the convicts is going to be
privately sequestered in interrogation

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.989
room and offered the following deal

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.040
if no one confesses to the robbery

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.920
the police are only to be able to charge
the prisoners with trespassing, and the

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.040
punishment for that is one month in jail
a piece

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.210
but if one confesses in the other one
doesn't

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.300
the police will be lenient on the rat
thanking him for his confession

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.630
and severely punish the quiet one that's
gonna be twelve months in jail for the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.529
one who kept quiet and the one who ratted
out the other guy

00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:03.170
is going to be able to walk free--he'll
spend no time in jail whatsoever

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.850
finally if both confess then the police can
actually punish them for robbery

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.270
and then that's going to result in a
much greater jail sentence than

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.080
trespassing and this time, it's going to be eight
months in jail apiece

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.640
instead of one had the only been able to charge them with trespassing

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.510
so the question looks like this

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.240
supposed to be used only one minimize
the number of months they spend in jail. we're making an

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.209
assumption here

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:26.909
we're supposing the criminals only
care about themselves for the moment. if

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.550
that's the case should they confess to
the police?

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.870
now we saw a lot of information in the
last two slides but we can condense it

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.810
into just this little payoff matrix
right here and this is what we call a prisoner's

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.600
dilemma

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.850
so we have two players: player one, player two

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.780
each of them has to strategies: they can either confess or keep quiet

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.130
and based off those strategies you
end up at different outcomes so if both

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.200
keep quiet then they both spend one month in
jail, so they both eagles get negative one right

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.960
there

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.380
if one confesses and the other one keeps quiet
the one one who confesses, in this case player

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.250
two, gets no time in jail and player one
gets twelve months in jail so that's a

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.160
negative twelfth and it's the reverse situation
over here

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.670
and finally both if confess then you end up
over where they both spend eight months in jail

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.760
and of course if you get confused about
the payoffs, then just notice that these are

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.079
color coordinated where player one is

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.809
blue and player two is red

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:16.139
now also in game theory we have the following
convention: we make player one a man and

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:17.480
player two a woman

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.060
the reason we do is so we can use
pronouns like he and she to differentiate

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.790
between the players without

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.049
creating any extra confusion

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.130
so that aside, let's actually solve this game

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.630
and the way we're gonna do that is by noting
how player one and player two should

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.719
respond

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.189
based off what the other player is going to do
so let's look at this for a second like this

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.450
this is just highlighting player one's payoffs here

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.290
supposed player one knew that player two
is going to keep quiet he can just

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.840
predict this. he saw into the future he
knew that players two was going to keep

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.989
quiet. What should he do?

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.999
well if we look at the payoffs on the screen here,
we see that he's better off

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:53.409
confessing than he is keeping quiet because
he spends no time in jail if he confesses

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.819
and one month in jail if he keeps quiet.
So 0 is greater than -1, he should

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.279
confess if player two keeps quiet.

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:03.659
now suppose player one knew that player two
was going to confess

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.400
think about what he should do here.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.989
Well, if he keeps quiet he will twelve months
in jail; if he confesses, he will spent eight

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.189
months in jail

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:15.369
so in response to player two confessing
player one is also better off confessing

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:17.610
if you string these two pieces of information together

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.690
whether player two keeps quiet or confesses,
player one is always

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.920
better off confessing

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.139
confessing always leads to a better outcome.
We say that player one's

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.769
confess strategy strictly dominates

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.199
his

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.410
keep quiet strategy and so in general
strategy x dominates strategy y

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.550
if generates greater payoff than y
regardless what the other players do

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.989
so in this case this is confess strictly
dominating

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:43.970
keep quiet

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.579
so keep quite as strictly dominated

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.419
now, rational players never play strictly
dominant strategies like keeping quiet

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.199
the reason for that is why would you want to
keep quiet when you could confess and

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.339
do better and so in general why would
you want to play y would you play x

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:58.430
instead?

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.760
and so in the future as we go through
these videos we are going to make sure

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.359
that

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.479
these players are never going to be playing strictly
dominated strategies--it just doesn't

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.329
make sense for them to ever do that

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.159
and so to finish solving the players'
prisoner's dilemma here we know that

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.149
player one is going to confess

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.389
so all that's left is to figure out what
players two is going to do here.

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.760
So imagine that player two knew that player
one is going to keep quiet

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.370
we can see that she's in the exact same
boat as player one is. If player one keeps

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.599
quiet she's also better off confessing
because 0 is greater than -1

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.849
but on the other hand if player one is
going to confess and player two could

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.050
see that in advance again players two
would also want to confess because

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.370
-8 is better than -12.
And so you end up starting out with four

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.340
different outcomes possible here but we
know that there's only one sensible

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.020
outcome

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.029
and that is for both the players to confess

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.800
now when you first show this to people
who are new to game theory, they will ask you "okay, that

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.040
doesn't make sense. Why they did this
outcome right here

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.550
when this outcome when they both keep
quiet is mutually better for them?"

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.370
And it's true this is a better outcome
for both the players collectively, right?

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.490
Because -1

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.130
and -1 is better individually
and collectively than confessing

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.319
and then you get eight
months in jail apeace

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.309
but the reason that this outcome isn't
sensible is because each of them can

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.699
individually do better by switching off
to confess

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.530
and so there isn't as stable sort of
solution here because they can always do

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.279
better by flipping their strategies and
going to confess

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:23.229
even if they agree to do is in the in
the time before they actually went

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.639
to the interrogation rooms

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.139
those sorts of agreements don't actually
withstand the test of time because as

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.580
soon as they get into the room and
actually had to confess or keep quiet

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.769
it's in their individual interest

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:37.199
to confess and not keep quiet

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.189
so that's why we think that this is the
only outcome that's sensible when both of

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:41.599
the players confess

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:45.490
so that is the prisoner's dilemma
and strict dominance in a nutshell

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.449
and in the next video we will start talking
about how we can

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.290
use the strict dominance idea

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.340
to get to even more complicated games'
solutions. Join me then.
