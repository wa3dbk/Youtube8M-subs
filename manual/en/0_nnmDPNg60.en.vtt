00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.330
Welcome back. Another lesson on polyrhythm.
This time we are going to add some sixteenth

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.270
notes and as well as 8th notes. Now this is
one that we are going to work in on, this…

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.840
believe it or not actually comes from Middle
East rhythm, but we are adapting it to a more

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.510
African percussion and I am going to play
the basic part and Anderson is going to play

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.670
a part he created to go with it. I kind of
just want to listen and he is already playing

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.870
a rhythm so what I do not want to do is overcrowd
that rhythm. So what I am doing is basically

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.230
listening for gaps may be in what he is playing
to where I can add something to kind of fill

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.469
those gaps. It is got to be like two puzzles
being meshing together. So here it is. We

00:00:50.469 --> 00:01:21.060
will play it for you to hear want he came
up with… Now, you can it reversed. That

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:51.110
is how you feel like a little . So you can
do this with the friend of yours. You play

00:01:51.110 --> 00:02:03.450
or have your friend play the basic… and
have your friend or you to listen to for where…

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.220
this drum isn’t playing or is playing one
beat and you try to place something in there

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.420
or double that beat, but keep it very simple
like we are doing once again and here you

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.590
can actually practice this.
