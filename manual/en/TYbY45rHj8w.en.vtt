00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.834
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME BACK.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.560
SO LAST WEEK AS WE WERE

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.460
WATCH ON THE SHOW, LAST WEEK

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:10.544
WE LEARNED THAT WHILE OUR

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:11.578
UNITED STATES SENATE WAS

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:13.313
UNABLE TO PASS EVEN THE MOST

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.516
BASIC GUN CONTROL MEASURES,

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:16.683
AUSTRALIA HAD A SUCCESSFUL

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.043
GUN CONTROL FOR ALMOST TWO

00:00:18.043 --> 00:00:20.476
DECADE, JOHN OLIVER VISITED

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.881
THERE TO FIND OUT MORE IN

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:22.581
PART TWO OF OUR THREE PART

00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:22.913
SERIES.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.555
&gt;&gt; IN 1996 FOLLOWING A

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.295
MASSACRE, AUSTRALIA'S

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.301
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT

00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:28.835
ENFORCED A NATIONAL BUYBACK

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.243
OF SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

00:00:31.243 --> 00:00:32.808
WHILE ALSO HEAVILY

00:00:32.808 --> 00:00:33.868
REGULATING THE PURCHASE AND

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:35.194
STORAGE OF OTHER FIREARMS.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.322
THE RESULT WAS DRAMATICALLY

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:38.688
REDUCED LEVEL OF GUN

00:00:38.688 --> 00:00:39.047
VIOLENCE.

00:00:39.047 --> 00:00:40.875
SO WHY CAN'T WE DO THAT

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.447
HERE?

00:00:41.447 --> 00:00:43.342
TO FIND OUT I SAT DOWN WITH

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:45.542
LONG TIME AID TO HARRY REID

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:46.208
JIM MANLY.

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:47.901
&gt;&gt; THE NRA IS STILL A VERY

00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:48.635
POWERFUL FORCE IN THIS

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.274
COUNTRY.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.648
THEY HAVE FOUR MILLION

00:00:50.648 --> 00:00:52.074
MEMBERS WHO ARE VERY, VERY

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.482
DETERMINED TO GET THEIR WAY.

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:54.981
&gt;&gt; AND HOW CAN A NATION OF

00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:56.148
300 MILLION COMPETE WITH

00:00:56.148 --> 00:00:57.440
THAT?

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.660
&gt;&gt; IT'S DIFFICULT TO

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.461
UNDERSTAND SOMETIME, ISN'T

00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:01.795
IT BUT THE FACT OF THE MAT

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.834
CERTIFICATE THAT I'VE GOT TO

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.208
THINK LONG AND HARD BEFORE

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:05.735
YOU SUPPORT GUN CONTROL

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.975
LEGISLATION BECAUSE YOU ARE

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.948
TAKE ON THE NRA CAN BE

00:01:08.948 --> 00:01:10.375
POLITICAL SUICIDE.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.781
&gt;&gt; AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:13.482
IS WORKING TIRELESSLY TO

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:15.342
REDUCE THE RATE OF POLITICAL

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:17.041
SUICIDE AMONG ITS MEMBERS.

00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:17.975
SURELY AUSTRALIAN

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.414
POLITICIANS WEREN'T STUPID

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.788
ENOUGH TO END THEIR

00:01:20.788 --> 00:01:22.482
POLITICAL LIVES FOR GUN

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:22.847
CONTROL.

00:01:22.847 --> 00:01:24.875
&gt;&gt; WELL, I DID.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.380
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.481
&gt;&gt; I DID.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.528
&gt;&gt; YOU DID WHAT?

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.487
&gt;&gt; I TOOK THE STAND.

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:33.298
I WAS PREPARED TO FACE THE

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.000
POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES, AND

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.035
WE DELIVERED GUN CONTROL.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.476
&gt;&gt; MEETS ROB BOREBICH FORMER

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.848
PREMIER OF QUEENSLAND,

00:01:40.848 --> 00:01:41.541
AUSTRALIA'S MOST

00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:42.241
CONSERVATIVE STATE.

00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:44.408
IN 1996 HE WAS INSTRUMENTAL

00:01:44.408 --> 00:01:46.269
IN ENACTING GUN CONTROL,

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:47.628
KNOWING IT WOULD COST HIM

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:49.255
HIS POLITICAL CAREER IN THE

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.361
NEXT ELECTION.

00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:52.462
&gt;&gt; WE PAID A HIGH POLITICAL

00:01:52.462 --> 00:01:54.429
PRICE BUT WE DID THE RIGHT

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.820
THING.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.356
LOOK, THERE ARE AUSTRALIANS

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.229
ALIVE TODAY BECAUSE WE TOOK

00:01:59.229 --> 00:01:59.887
THAT ACTION.

00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:00.981
I MEAN HOW MUCH SAY LIFE

00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:01.900
WORTH?

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.936
&gt;&gt; BUT JIM MANLY KNOWS THAT

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.641
THE TRUE PUBLIC SERVANT HAS

00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:08.076
NOR IMPORTANT CONCERNS.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.381
&gt;&gt; WHAT MAKES A POLITICIAN

00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:09.881
SUCCESSFUL?

00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:11.649
&gt;&gt; GETTING RE-ELECTED BY HIS

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:13.729
OR HER CONSTITUENTS.

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.629
&gt;&gt; RIGHT, YEAH.

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.329
THAT IS HOW YOU JUDGE

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.449
SUCCESS.

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.844
&gt;&gt; OKAY, THAT-- WELL,

00:02:21.844 --> 00:02:24.943
GETTING LEGISLATION DONE.

00:02:24.943 --> 00:02:25.863
&gt;&gt; IS SECOND.

00:02:25.863 --> 00:02:27.862
&gt;&gt; IS SECOND, YES.

00:02:27.862 --> 00:02:30.229
&gt;&gt; THAT IS SECOND.

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:31.589
HOLLY [BLEEP], THAT IS

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:33.049
SECOND?

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.068
&gt;&gt; IF I COULD REWIND THIS

00:02:35.068 --> 00:02:36.595
TAPE I WOULD SAY GETTING

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.968
LEGISLATION DONE AND GETTING

00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:39.228
RE-ELECTED BY YOUR

00:02:39.228 --> 00:02:39.954
CONSTITUENTS.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.136
&gt;&gt; BUT SERIOUSLY YOU CAN'T

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.807
REMIND-- REWIND THE TAPE

00:02:42.807 --> 00:02:44.135
LET'S GO WITH THE ANSWER YOU

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.807
GAVE.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.660
&gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T GET

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.687
RE-ELECTED, YOU KNOW, YOU

00:02:47.687 --> 00:02:48.915
JUST ROADKILL IN THE

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.455
POLITICAL PROCESS AND YOU'RE

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.040
JUST ANOTHER LOSER.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.667
&gt;&gt; TRAGICALLY NOT EVERYONE

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.016
UNDERSTANDS THIS.

00:02:56.016 --> 00:02:57.435
&gt;&gt; WHAT MAKES A POLITICIAN

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.374
SUCCESSFUL?

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.347
GO.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.980
&gt;&gt; MAKING SOCIETY A BETTER

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.798
PLACE.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.680
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO, ROB, NO.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.960
LOOK, WE CAN-- WE CAN

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.995
ACTUALLY REWIND THE TAPE.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.035
ARE WE ROLLING?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.936
WHAT MAKES A POLITICIAN

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.340
SUCCESSFUL.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.580
&gt;&gt; YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.680
GOVERN IN THE BEST INTERESTS

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.540
OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.360
SERVE.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.928
&gt;&gt; LOOK, ROB, I'M GOING OUT

00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:26.554
ON A LIMB HERE.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.694
I ALREADY TOLD SOMEONE ELSE

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.035
I CAN'T DO THIS WHEN I CAN.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.940
&gt;&gt; I HOPE YOU HAVE A LOT OF

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.240
TAPE.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.941
&gt;&gt; TRUE SUCCESS IS A

00:03:31.941 --> 00:03:33.408
LIFELONG POLITICIAN LIKE

00:03:33.408 --> 00:03:35.135
HARRY REID WHOSE WATERED

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.008
DOWN GUN LEGISLATION WAS

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.188
CAREFULLY DESIGNED TO

00:03:38.188 --> 00:03:39.228
PROTECT THOSE WHO NEEDED IT

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.961
MOST.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.461
&gt;&gt; HE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.715
AS THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER TO

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.509
PROTECT THE CAUCUS.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.421
&gt;&gt; THE CAUCUS NEEDS TO BE

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.476
PROTECTED, THE CAUCUS DOES.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.121
&gt;&gt; THEY NEED TO BE PROTECTED

00:03:51.121 --> 00:03:51.901
POLITICALLY.

00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:53.235
&gt;&gt; HOW MANY POLITICAL

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.575
CAREERS HAVE BEEN TRAGICALLY

00:03:54.575 --> 00:03:56.295
ENDED BY GUN CONTROL.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.421
&gt;&gt; WE'VE LOST SOME GOOD

00:03:57.421 --> 00:03:58.755
FOLKS OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.747
OF THEIR VIEWS.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.514
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.888
YOU HAVE A PERFECTLY HEALTHY

00:04:01.888 --> 00:04:03.562
POLITICAL CAREER AND THEN

00:04:03.562 --> 00:04:03.927
BANG.

00:04:03.927 --> 00:04:05.255
&gt;&gt; JUST LIKE THAT.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.395
&gt;&gt; WHICH MEANS FORMER

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.034
AUSTRALIA PRIME MINISTER

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.675
JOHN HOWARD HAS BLOOD ON HIS

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.047
HANDS.

00:04:10.047 --> 00:04:12.076
&gt;&gt; DOW EVER THINK ABOUT THE

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.048
INNOCENT VICTIMS OF YOUR GUN

00:04:14.048 --> 00:04:14.407
CONTROL.

00:04:14.407 --> 00:04:15.735
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE NO INNOCENT

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.442
VICTIMS OF MY-- THERE WERE

00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:19.922
NO VICTIMS AT ALL.

00:04:19.922 --> 00:04:21.082
THERE IS THE PHOTOGRAPH OF

00:04:21.082 --> 00:04:22.982
ROB, HE WAS INCREDIBLY

00:04:22.982 --> 00:04:24.622
COURAGEOUS SUPPORTING OUR

00:04:24.622 --> 00:04:25.287
LAWS.

00:04:25.287 --> 00:04:26.647
&gt;&gt; BUT POLITICALLY HE IS

00:04:26.647 --> 00:04:27.974
DEAD, BANG, JUST LIKE THAT.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.382
&gt;&gt; WE LOST AN ELECTION AS WE

00:04:29.382 --> 00:04:30.581
ALL DO AT SOME POINT.

00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:32.881
&gt;&gt; BUT HOWARD IS NOT ALONE.

00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:35.201
HIS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER

00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:37.269
TIM FISHER ALSO REFUSES TO

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:38.628
ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR

00:04:38.628 --> 00:04:39.988
THESE CAREER MASSACRES.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.773
&gt;&gt; OH, YOU DON'T LOOK AT

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.716
THESE FACES AND FEEL GUILT?

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.720
&gt;&gt; WELL, THEY ARE ALIVE.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.320
AND --

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.822
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE DEAD, THEY'RE

00:04:48.822 --> 00:04:49.454
POLITICALLY DEAD.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.760
&gt;&gt; I HOPE THAT THOSE WHO

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.262
TOTALLY VETO ANY MOVE TO

00:04:55.262 --> 00:04:58.163
BRING SENSIBLE, SEMI AUCTION

00:04:58.163 --> 00:04:58.894
AND AUCTION WEAPON CONTROL

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.235
TO THE SUBURBS OF AMERICA

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.575
ARE ALSO POLITICALLY DEAD

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.615
BUT PHYSICALLY ALIVE.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.749
&gt;&gt; NOT IN I COULD HELP IT.

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:08.809
NEVER AGAIN WILL A POLITICAL

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.502
CAREER END IN A SENSELESS

00:05:10.502 --> 00:05:11.522
ACT OF MEANINGFUL

00:05:11.522 --> 00:05:12.902
LEGISLATION.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.968
&gt;&gt; THE VERDICT IS JUST ALL

00:05:16.968 --> 00:05:18.688
OF THESE, ALL OF THEM ARE

00:05:18.688 --> 00:05:22.217
DEAD, POLITICALLY NOT

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.180
PHYSICALLY, PHYSICALLY THEY

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.314
ARE PROBABLY SAFER.

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.561
&gt;&gt; IT IS VERY DARK.

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:29.596
&gt;&gt; I MEAN AGAIN, JUST TO

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:30.297
REITERATE PHYSICALLY THEY

00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:31.632
ARE ABSOLUTELY FINE BUT IT

00:05:31.632 --> 00:05:32.792
MAKES YOU THINK.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.035
&gt;&gt; UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.108
SPENDING TIME WITH

00:05:35.108 --> 00:05:36.902
POLITICALLY DEAD AUSTRALIA

00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:38.201
POLITICIANS MADE ME THINK

00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:40.269
