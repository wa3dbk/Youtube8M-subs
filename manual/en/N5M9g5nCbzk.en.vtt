00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.930
Our asparagus is planted, we've covered

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.270
them up, and now we need to think about how
we're going to care for them during the first

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.000
several years. What we're interested in doing
is having the plants become well established,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.669
so we want to make sure we give them plenty
of water. Asparagus is going to need about

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.190
one inch of water per week, so if it rains,
fine. If it doesn't rain, you need to get

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.940
out there and irrigate them.\
We also want to keep all the weeds down. As

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.579
I said before, asparagus is not a very good
competitor of weeds, so we want to keep this

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.899
area clean cultivated, at least for the first
several years.\

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.920
One of the things we can do to help control
weeds, and to help retain moisture in the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.420
soil, is we can use some sort of mulch. We
can use straw mulch, we can use sawdust, different

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.280
things like that, but you want to consider
that what you use could impact any of your

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.990
subsequent weed control strategies.\
If you are going to mulch with an organic

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.700
mulch, straw mulch would be the preferred
thing to use to keep the weeds down.\

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.240
Typically, we're going to wait to mulch until
the spears start to emerge, especially in

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.240
a newly planted asparagus, but if you put
your mulch layer down thinly, we can go ahead

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.090
and mulch at the beginning of the year, right
after planting, and just continue to add some

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.180
more straw as we get more and more spears
to emerge.\

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.180
We're going to place the straw fairly loosely,
and not very deep, right over the bed. This

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.310
will serve as an effective weed barrier and
help hold moisture in around those crowns.\

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.550
With asparagus, we're interested in expanding
the size of that crown, so we're not going

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.890
to harvest in the first year that we plant
the crowns. The second year, we're not going

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.920
to harvest any spears at all, because we want
the energy, the photosynthesis from those

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.690
ferns, going back in to produce a larger crown.\
In the third year after planting is when we

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.140
can begin to harvest, and in that year, we
can harvest for 7 to 10 days, and what you

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.140
want to do is cut every spear that's coming
up during that 7 to 10 day period. In the

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.849
second harvest year, we can harvest for two
weeks. In the third harvest year, we can harvest

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.980
for three weeks, until we get up to about
four to five weeks of harvest.\

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.129
Growing asparagus in Maine is becoming more
and more popular. Asparagus is one of the

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.730
earliest vegetables we have to harvest out
of our garden. Typically, harvest of asparagus

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.159
is going to begin in the early part of May.
If you're in the southern part of the state,

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.209
or a warmer location, you might even be able
to begin harvesting asparagus towards the

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:20.730
end of April.}
