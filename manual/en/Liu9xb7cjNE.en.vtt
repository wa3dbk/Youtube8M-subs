00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.290
After you finish your design, you’ll likely
need to share it with others.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.201
A drawing layout organizes one or more views
of your design on a virtual sheet of paper.

00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:17.500
A layout usually contains a title block, one
or more viewports, and annotation.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.699
Let’s take a look at the steps for creating
a layout.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.380
The number of layouts in your drawing depends
on the template you used to create the drawing.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.720
You can edit existing layouts or create new
ones.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.520
I’ll create a New Layout by clicking the
Layout list on the status bar and choosing

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.160
Create New Layout.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.210
All new layouts include a default page setup
and viewport.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.940
The viewport controls which area of the design
to show and at which scale.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.190
For this layout, I’ll show you how to edit
the page setup, insert a title block, and

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.930
create your own viewport.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.360
I’ll start by erasing the default viewport.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.530
I use the Page Setup Manager to change the
output device and paper size for the layout.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.250
Now I’m ready to insert my title block.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.391
First, I’ll set the Title Block layer current
and use the Insert command to insert my title

00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:13.760
block.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.539
Next, I’ll define a viewport to display
my design.

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:24.590
I set the Viewports layer current and create
a new viewport.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.360
I’ll size the Viewport to fit inside my
title block.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.889
I can select my viewport to change the scale
at which my design is displayed, then choose

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:40.319
an appropriate scale from the list of predefined
options.

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.069
Once my layout is ready, I’ll click Print
Layout from the Layout visor.

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.869
Show Details allows access to additional settings.

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.810
I’ll accept the default settings and choose
PDF, then Preview.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.279
Finally, I’ll close the Preview window and
click Print to send my layout to the printer.
