00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.950
At my dayjob, people already know that I'm
watching ponies.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.180
And ever time they look like "There he is
again with his ponies, are you going to play

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.180
with them?"

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.430
*My Little Pony-Themesong

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:37.970
These are brushables, because you can brush
their hairs...

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:45.070
I don't do that, but I've got a friend who
sometimes comes to brush my ponies.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.610
Then we just talk in the meantime.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:01:37.210
I would say this is my proud, it is the "Flutterlion",
we put it just like the Flemish Lion and put

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:51.390
it on a flag.This one goes with us to the
meeting.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:22.980
It's this pony that I am going to impersonate.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:42.799
I will look a bit different.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.919
I hope everything fits.
