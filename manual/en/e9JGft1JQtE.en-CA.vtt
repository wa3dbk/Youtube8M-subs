00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; Last year, we introduced the All-New 7th Generation Golf and boy was it ever popular.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
&gt;&gt; It won almost every award available.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
&gt;&gt; Looking for something just a little bit more? We've got the Golf GTI with up to 220 Horsepower

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
&gt;&gt; and all the utility you'd expect in a Golf.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
&gt;&gt; Now, we've got the Super Golf. The 2016 Volkswagen Golf R.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
&gt;&gt; And it brings everything to the table.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
&gt;&gt; Starting with the 292 Horsepower Turbo Charged Direct Injection engine.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
&gt;&gt; We route that power through our latest 5th Generation 4MOTION all-wheel drive system

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
&gt;&gt; and your choice of 6-speed manual or our award winning

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
&gt;&gt; 6-speed DSG transmission. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
&gt;&gt; Drives like a manual, but gives you all the flexibility of an automatic. We think you'll like it.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
&gt;&gt; Now we fitted the Golf R with everything. Essentially, all you got to do is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
&gt;&gt; pick your colour and pick your transmission and you're off to the races. And by everything, I certainly mean that.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
&gt;&gt; 19 inch alloy wheels, standard.  Bi-xenon headlights, standard.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
&gt;&gt; Full navigation and infotainment system, standard.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
&gt;&gt; Leather interior and the best running gear you can imagine. Our dynamic chastity control gives you

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
&gt;&gt; manual control of your shock settings from inside the cabin 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
&gt;&gt; so you can dial up the settings to suit your driving environment. It's got a very unique body kit 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
&gt;&gt; that gives you a subtle but aggressive look.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
&gt;&gt; The only thing that's missing is a spoiler big enough to eat lunch off. But do you really want that? Come on, you're all grown up.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
&gt;&gt; You're ready for a Golf R. Coming this summer to Volkswagen Dealers in Canada.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
&gt;&gt; Volkswagen. Das Auto.
