00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.420
Happy Mother's Day mom. To show you just how
grateful I am for you being a wonderful mother

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.450
to me for almost three decades now, I'm going
to make you, wait for it, a traditional British

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.720
Mothering Sunday Simnel Cake.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.739
Being my mom for a really long time, cake,
yeah sounds even. This would make a lot more

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:33.120
sense mom, if you were British because this
is what British people make for their moms.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.790
I have all my ingredients here and I'm going
to consult my cookbook. And I've got my oven

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.970
preheated to 300 degrees. In a large bowl,
cream together the margarine and brown sugar

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.100
until light and fluffy. Well things are kind
of off to a little bit of a testy start because

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.950
I attempted to soften my butter in the microwave
and ended up just melting it. One cup of butter

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.010
into one cup of brown sugar. I don't have
an electric beater so this is going to have

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:13.850
to be my beater. Now mom I remember you once
told me that if I could read a recipe than

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.140
I could cook anything. Next up I'm going to
beat in four eggs one at a time. This is kind

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.860
of an alternative to an upper body workout,
at least for one side. If you have an arm

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.260
that's particularly flabby then you can just
get in a kitchen and beat some eggs. Workout

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:40.010
tips. Mom I'm not calling you fat. This cake
was invented in 1623 when an ungrateful daughter

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:49.049
had a change of heart and she thought to herself,
'Me mum's been a pretty good mum. Perhaps

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.549
I should make her a cake. What have I in the
cupboard?' And her last name was Simnel, cause

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.479
this is also known as a Siminel cake, so she
was like, 'I'm making me mum a Seminal cake

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:11.310
for mothering Sunday which is a part of the
Lent celebration in church. [Fast-forwarding].

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:24.840
My arm is very tired. Cooking is no joke.
Am I right? Next up we have one and three-fourths

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:33.510
cups of self-rising flour, emphasis on the
self-rising. Flour with a very healthy bit

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:43.209
of self-esteem that allows it to grow tall
in the oven without external validation. [Singing].

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:51.099
Mom you had me out of your belly one day a
long time ago and you put up with my shenanigans

00:02:51.099 --> 00:03:02.340
for so long. So now I'm making you a cake
and a song. Fadeout. [Fast-forwarding]. This

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.779
is where this cake gets kind of gross because
the original recipe calls for golden raisins,

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:15.569
dried currants, candied cherries and candied
mixed fruit peel, chopped. I don't know about

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.930
you, whoever you are, but I think that sounds
disgusting. Also it's May and the grocery

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.139
stores are not stocking candied fruit because
it's not fruitcake season. Although some places

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.349
it's always fruitcake season. I'm going to
stir in my golden raisins, one and three-fourths

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:42.029
cups, my can of cherries, not candied, two
tablespoons of lemon zest, two teaspoons of

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:48.059
allspice, which is a lot of allspice but nevertheless.
Now I guess I could have gone with some kind

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:53.669
of American Mother's Day cooking tradition
but the American Mother's Day cooking tradition

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:59.729
is to not cook at all and I can't exactly
show you how to make a brunch that we bought

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:07.089
out. Take half of the batter, I'm going to
pour it into my floured pan. [Fast-forwarding].

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:14.589
If that doesn't say I love you mom, I don't
know what does. And in it goes. So I got my

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:21.220
half of the cake in the oven. What am I going
to do now? Go watch reruns of Oprah? No! There's

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.220
more to be done. There's one ingredient in
this mothering day cake that I'd never heard

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.060
of before. Almond paste, and almond paste
is essentially blanched almonds and sugar.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.810
You have to roll this into some kind of ball
and then smear some on top of the batter that's

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:47.210
in the oven and then I'm going to put the
rest of the batter on top of it. Okay? [Fast-forwarding].

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:55.400
[Singing]. Rolling. Rolling out the almond
paste. Rolling out the almond paste. Rolling.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.050
Rolling. [Fast-forwarding]. So I'm going to
take the cake out of the oven, slap this layer

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.620
of almond paste on it, put the rest of the
batter on top of it and put it in the oven

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:15.830
for two and half hours and then stare at the
camera and count down the seconds. [Fast-forwarding].

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:24.180
I now understand why Mother's Day is the most
popular day of the year to go to a restaurant.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.360
Fact. Otherwise you end up making a fool of
yourself trying to make traditional British

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:37.900
Mother's Day cakes. [Fast-forwarding]. Oh
there's raw egg in that. Salmonella. Someone

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.610
call a doctor. Now for a montage of fun things
that you can do for two and half hours while

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:50.680
you wait for your Mother's Day cake to bake.
[Fast-forwarding]. Practice the recorder.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:06:03.510
Try out a new look. Call your mom. Play the
melody horn. [Singing]. Mother, mother, mother,

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:11.300
Mother's Day. Can you believe it's already
been two and half hours? So my cake is cooled.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:19.120
I don't know take a look for yourself. Doesn't
that look interesting? Now the way to finish

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:27.310
this traditional British Mothering Sunday
cake is that you take balls of almond paste

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.670
and you put them around the cake. Tradition
says that you make eleven of these balls to

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:39.620
stand for the eleven apostles in the Bible.
But Judas does not get his own almond paste

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.560
ball. Now I'm supposed to another layer of
almond paste on top of the cake but guess

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:53.060
who forgot. So Mother's Day is ruined. And
I'm done. So this Mother's Day Mom, I hope

00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:00.889
that this traditional Mothering Sunday Simnel
cake really shows you just how much I care.

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:09.139
You're my mom and I wrote that on a cake and
better yet if we turn it this way it spells

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:15.389
wow. Because when I think of you being my
mom all my life I think to myself wow. Happy

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:16.250
Mother's Day.
