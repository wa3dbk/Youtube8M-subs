00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.830
Welcome to this week’s Movie Math, where
it looks like even January is becoming a hot

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.810
month for movies!

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.169
Last year Ride Along was able to boast the
biggest debut for the month ever with forty-one

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:16.070
point five million, and this year Taken 3
was able to almost match that with a forty

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.680
million debut!

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.700
Hmm, perhaps the rumor that Batman v Superman
will be broken into two parts - with the first

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.260
hitting theaters in OCTOBER 2015 - isn’t
so crazy after all.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.590
Fox already has Channing Tatum’s Gambit
set for October 2016...

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.110
In fact, the upcoming The Wedding Ringer,
Fifty Shades of Grey and perhaps even Kingsman

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.310
The Secret Service are all expected to post
big numbers in January and February - further

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.400
proof that the old school rules of when and
what kind of movies you can release are quickly

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.190
fading away.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.810
And while Taken 3 might have come in about
ten million shy of Taken 2’s debut, the

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.920
second flick enjoyed an OCTOBER release - man,
big things are really beginning to happen

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.489
in October!

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.710
And still, this third entry is Liam Neeson’s
biggest opening since that second flick.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.420
A much needed rebound after A Walk Among the
Tombstones was greeted by a tombstone at the

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.510
box office.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.070
This also makes for a hot streak for Luc Besson,
as Lucy opened basically on par earlier in

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.520
July - much needed for the French filmmakers
as well who’s The Family, 3 Days to Kill

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.479
and Brick Mansions made for something of a
losing streak.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.020
Taken 3’s debut also proves that Neeson
and Besson’s particular set of skills can’t

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.430
be so easily duplicated, as not only did Kevin
Costner fail to match this franchise’s box

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.960
office performance but so did Pierce Brosnan’s
The November Man, Keanu Reeves’ John Wick

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.130
and even Denzel Washington’s The Equalizer.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.180
We’ll have to wait and see how Sean Penn’s
The Gunman does in March.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.490
Hmm, maybe Liam Neeson and his copycats should
team-up for some kind of highbrow version

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.580
of The Expendables?

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.150
Would anyone pay to see that?

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.240
Then Selma finally went wide this weekend
with surprisingly impressive results - and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.220
perhaps foreshadowed more surprises to come
during awards season...

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.539
The Martin Luther King Jr bio is from the
team behind 12 Years a Slave, yet when that

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.110
prestige flick went wide it only made it to
seventh place with a little under seven million.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.489
In comparison, Selma was able to take second
place with a little over eleven million.

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.680
But the real magic could happen next weekend
where the pick is beautifully positioned.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.690
Not only is it Martin Luther King Jr weekend,
but it could have the combined heat of its

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.409
Golden Globe nominations and wins for Best
Original Song, and possible Oscar nominations

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.980
- which will be announced Thursday morning
right before said weekend.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.040
Yep, that could be one heck of a perfect box
office storm.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.550
Elsewhere in the box office it was very much
looking like the calm before the storm, as

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.150
the glut of holiday flicks and awards contenders
just tried to tread water as we wait for those

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.810
Oscar noms.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.260
Turns out Liam Neeson is also capable of taking
down Middle Earth as the final Hobbit film

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.000
suffered its first big drop, falling fifty-six
percent to fourth place.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.069
But worldwide that burglar Bilbo was able
to steal second place from Guardians of the

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.840
Galaxy for the year.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.280
Can it reach a billion?

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.680
It doesn’t open in box office rich China
until January 23rd, yet Smaug only managed

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.700
to earn about seventy-four million there.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.470
Still, it’s a possibility...

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.650
Then Into the Woods and Unbroken remained
neck and neck while The Imitation Game continued

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.380
to show phenomenal staying power - dropping
just about two percent in its third week of

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.940
wide release.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.400
Inherent Vice expanded by about six hundred
theaters with far less impressive results,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.560
falling just outside the top ten at number
eleven.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.460
It was just beat out by The Hunger Games Mockingjay
Part 1 in its eighth week of release, and

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.159
Katniss is on the verge of surpassing Star-Lord
anyday now to become the biggest grossing

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.420
domestic film of 2014.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.390
Geez, with Guardians losing the domestic crown
and dropping a spot worldwide, plus lackluster

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.140
rating for Agent Carter and a poor reception
for the Ant-Man teaser trailer make for a

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.530
rare bad week for Marvel.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.769
But don’t worry, the new Avengers Age of
Ultron trailer drops tonight so it’s all

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:07.769
good.

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.040
As for this coming holiday weekend, Selma
might be well-positioned but its also got

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.170
a ton of competition.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.810
American Sniper goes wide and is expected
to battle The Wedding Ringer for first place,

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.779
while Paddington is also expected to do well
with the family audience.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.599
And Marvel won’t have to worry about Chris
Hemsworth demanding a raise, as Blackhat is

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.009
expected to debut far behind the rest of the
pack.

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.500
And that’s the weekend box office!

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.779
I’m Grace Randolph and we just did some
Movie Math - as always, thanks for watching,

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:45.509
and I hope you’ll go Beyond The Trailer
for these other top movies...
