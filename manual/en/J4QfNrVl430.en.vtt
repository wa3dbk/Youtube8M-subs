00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.530
This team is recruiting. 
We're looking for new members day by day.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.970
If you want to increase your portfolio

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.540
- We're the guys, man!

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.769
So if you're a character artist
- we are looking for you specifically

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:13.709
And

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.669
- the expertise that we need is
we need a character artist that can

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.470
- create high poly models, low poly models
normal maps

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.009
- and create 2048x2048 textures.

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.810
We're also looking for programmers.
If you have experience

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.670
in UnrealScript

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:40.670
That's phenomenal, but if you also have experience
in heavy C++, C# or even Java.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.460
Bulk of it transfers over to UnrealScript

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.860
- so it's really easy to pick up if you
have a basis in programming.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.630
And finally we're looking for environmental artists

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.770
- I mean, multiplayer is just around the corner

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.400
- Nothing is better than having a few new maps

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.050
- Ready for that time

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:14.140
And I guess prop modellers too and as Avalanche was 
just mentioning, guys who can make flash UI's.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.030
So I guess that's also a good idea.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.260
But we're always recruiting and...
SAVE ME FROM THE HORRORS OF FLASH! (echo) 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.930
Like you said in the beginning, he's a programmer
- not a flash guy. What are flash guys?

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.610
Are they called something? Flash artists?

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.040
Flashy?

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.770
Flash designers?

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.020
I mean, we could use all the help we can get.
We need a lot of prop guys.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.820
Because we're not really using UT3 anymore.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.680
So we don't really have access to a lot of those
static meshes that populate the levels.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.000
So guys who can make props, we definitely need those.
But I guess that sort of falls into the environmental artist category.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.220
Farewell from Fobby, Avalanche and from Havoc.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.769
www.renegade-x.com.

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:11.019
Goodbye!
That was lame.
