00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
Eco Sailing Project

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.620
The round-the-world sailing tour

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.577
Zero emission

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.940
By Martin,
Pierre, 
François
And Bérenger

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.820
This is a good idea 
En tabernacle!

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.620
While we leave Antigua &amp; Barbuda,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.060
it has been three months since we left Brittany.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.380
As we broke our camera, we decide on a technical stop in Saint Martin, in France.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.640
We berth in the beautiful bay of Marigot, overlooked by the fort Saint Louis

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.620
which was constructed by the French settlers and their slaves during the 18th century after the numerous British attacks.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.920
The island is quite unique because of its dual French and Dutch nationality and thus has two different parts.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.540
Originally a tropical paradise, Sint Maarten, the Dutch part of the island, and her Philipsburg capital

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.500
are unfortunately nicknamed «&nbsp;Little HongKong of the West Indies":

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.760
everything is free of tax, casinos pullulate and real estate promotion is in full swing .

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.800
In 1962, there were 4,000 inhabitants on this island, today it is over 40,000 inhabitants

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.940
and more than 2 millions of tourists every year.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.900
Almost daily, waves of thousands of tourists step off cruise ships

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.420
and invade the beach and the stores of Philipsburg.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.080
It's like Miami beach! Not really our cup of tea.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.140
The international airport attracts many of them.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.320
There is only here that you can see planes taking off and landing so close.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.520
It almost seems that the track jumps into the sea. This is impressive!

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.920
The opportunity to speak a bit of air transport:

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.100
a plane from Paris to St Martin, consumes 65,000 liters of kerosene.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.800
And it is estimated that every day, civil aviation uses 1.3 billion liters of kerosene.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.400
Needless to say that the environmental cost of this transport is huge!

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.580
Like at each stop, Amasia attracts the curious ones and we arrange tours of the ship and its facilities

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.960
working hard in our new job of ambassadors for green navigation.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.620
Awesome!

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.037
I wholeheartedly support you guys!

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.060
Without wind, we delay our departure and are reviewing the program of our next stops.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.180
We regretfully forget about Haiti and Jamaica and resolve to make direct course to Panama,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.840
ready to cross the entire Caribbean Sea.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.780
That's it, we leave the bay of Marigot!

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.580
Going to Colombia!

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.940
Bye bye France, baguettes and cheese!

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.340
Godspeed Eco Sailing Project!

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.420
Bye bye guys, have fun

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.220
We see the lights of the West Indies turn off gently and expect,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.500
the head full of dreams, to make up for it thanks to a wonderful stopover on the way:

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.660
Cartagena in Colombia.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.680
She's making many friends!

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.040
Pretty nice in the Carribean Sea

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.140
With 12 knots of wind, we're sailing quite fast

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.520
I am fishing, or at least trying to

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.109
I am cooking plantain bananas

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.960
I am preparing the new episode of the web-series

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.440
Such a man!

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.280
3...2...1

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.240
To be continued...
