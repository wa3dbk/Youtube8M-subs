00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:14.799
Find two angle beams

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.800
 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:34.366
Find four short black connectors

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:46.666
 

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:53.299
Place a black connector into the hole shown

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.833
 

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:03.899
Place a second short black connector in the next hole

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:11.233
 

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:30.866
Now connect the beam to the computer brick

00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:36.032
It should look like this.

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:40.033
Now prepare the second back leg

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:44.033
 

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:48.033
But place the black connectors on the opposite side of the bent beam.

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:52.033
 

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:56.033
Place a black connector into the hole shown

00:01:56.033 --> 00:02:00.033
 

00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:06.699
and a second connector in the next hole

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:15.633
 

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:25.066
Add the back beam on to the computer brick

00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:28.266
 

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:39.499
It should look like this.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.133
Step 4 complete - good work!
