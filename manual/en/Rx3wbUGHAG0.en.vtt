00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.370
This is James Bullock with WarriorSciences.com.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:08.080
Today we're going to cover the finger jab.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:16.810
Okay, with the finger jabs it's going to be
the same line of movement, or trajectory,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.290
as the palm strike.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:26.250
So I'm going to have my position -- once again
this position is a..."I don't want to engage",

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.260
or at least
look like I don't want to engage.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.199
We actually call it the deceptive posture
or passive stance, because it looks passive.

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:35.820
It doesn't look
like I want to engage.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.789
I don't want to stand like this, because it
looks like I want to fight.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:47.629
So from that position is where we try to throw
a lot of our strikes at first.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.100
The finger jab will just go from here -- you're
just going to relax your fingers -- and extend

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.489
like a palm
strike.

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.370
Notice how the fingers aren't hard.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.239
I'm not trying to do a spear-hand type thing.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.969
I'm not going to use two
fingers, four fingers, and be stiff because

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.350
I could jam my fingers really, really badly.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.030
We just want to create a reaction of some
kind.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.670
That reaction being either damage to the eyes,
or getting

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.330
them to turn their head so that you have an
avenue of escape, or setting up another shot

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.380
(a more powerful
shot).

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.500
It's just really quick and really annoying.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:29.460
If I have Jesse come over here...I'm going
to have my hands up here, and my hands just

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.780
shoot to his eyes.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.500
He's going to go ahead a close his eyes for
me, so that I don't accidently poke him in

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.500
the eye.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.500
So go ahead
and close your eyes.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.520
All it would do is it would just shoot.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.710
Whatever eye it hits, it hits.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.700
You're not going to aim for some eye.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.180
I'm not going to try to aim for the right
eye, or aim for the left, or try to equally

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.220
distribute my fingers.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.783
Personal protection and self defense can't
be that way.

00:01:48.783 --> 00:01:52.230
You can't have exact angles, or forty-five
degrees, or

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.230
weight distribution and all this other stuff.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.580
Just protect yourself, and keep the movements
as simple as possible.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.570
So it's just like a palm strike; palm strike
goes there...finger jab goes there too.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.800
This good for women especially if they're
smaller than their attacker.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.890
It's, "please don't hurt me.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.030
Please don't hurt me..." and then all of the
sudden you throw this to their eyes.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.239
And, of course, his instinct is to probably
cover his eyes and that sets it up so that

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.340
I can come in and smash
his face with something else, punch him in

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.340
the throat, or whatever I want to do.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.570
But it's just a straight-line shot; point
A to point B. The principle we want to keep

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.189
in mind is "Closest Weapon,
Closest Target" and also "Economy of Movement".

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.269
So I just want to go from here to here.

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.310
I may be talking, "I don't want any trouble.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.790
I don't want any trouble..."
and all of the sudden I throw to his eyes.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.290
It's a, "Hey, I don't have any problem; I
don't have a problem" and if I feel like he's

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.489
a threat at any given time,
then all of the sudden I throw.

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.489
Okay, thank you, Jesse.

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:56.109
So it just goes here, and straight to the
eyes.
