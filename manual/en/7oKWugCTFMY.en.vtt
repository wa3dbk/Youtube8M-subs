00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.720
What's up guys?

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.540
Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.190
Sorry we missed Washboard Wednesday this week
but we didn't miss it entirely.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.900
We just missed the timing of it.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.800
As you can see, I'm here on the set of ULTIMATE
ARMS, our new program, getting ready here

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.500
to release it in the coming weeks,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.900
and I wanted to make sure though that I didn't
miss entirely what you guys want and expect

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.900
and that's our Ab Workout.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.329
And today I've put one together for you using
a single Dumbbell.

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.329
That's right.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.050
If you are even working out at home and you
want something with a little bit of added

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.050
resistance.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.000
You don't even start you know, buying and
investing in all big machines to do this.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.410
If you have one single Dumbbell at home you're
going to be able to do all four of these exercises.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.390
Let me take you through each one, one by one.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.020
Alright the first exercise up here is pretty
easy and it's a great way for us to get a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.020
little additional weight.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.050
It's just a standard Weighted Crunch but the
way I hold the Dumbbell and the way I perform

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.960
the exercise is the key.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.160
Do what we call a Levitation Crunch.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.760
You try to levitate and push your shoulders
straight up into the ceiling.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.670
Push that Dumbbell straight up into the ceiling.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.000
You don't want to start pushing the Dumbbell
forward because as you do, all you're doing

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.850
is making the exercise easier.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.870
The weight of the Dumbbell is actually creating
forward momentum to get you up off the ground.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.380
If you try to go straight up, remember guys
our Physics, you're pushing that Dumbbell

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.940
right up against gravity,

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.350
that's what's going to be the toughest, and
that's what's going to be most productive

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.350
for you.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.400
The next exercise here we have is our Leg
Raise starting from below but you'll see the

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.060
positioning that I've established is a bit
of a rotated position, pre rotated.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.100
I have my Dumbbell here to create a little
bit of added resistance to pull me in the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.580
direction opposite that my legs want to take
me.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.210
This, right away is going to increase the
activation of our Abs because we know they

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.720
control rotation, at the same time it's going
to involve our Obliques.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.340
So we've got an opportunity, as I press both
the leg and the Dumbbell up together, to work

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.250
both from the top down and the bottom up,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.750
but include the all important rotation and
Obliques in the exercise.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.160
Ok, next we can take this Dumbbell and we
can actually do one of my favorite exercises

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.040
and that's the Ab Wheel Rollout, minus the
Ab Wheel.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.560
You see if you take the Dumbbell and you position
it like an Ab Wheel, all that matters now

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.560
is that you get your grip pressure and the
way you hold the Dumbbell correct.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.370
And that's going to allow us to do this great
exercise.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.290
So as you see me demonstrate here, all I'm
doing is really changing the pressure that

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.819
I'm applying through my forefingers and through
my thumb.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.360
As I roll out, I want to take all four fingers
off and literally push the Dumbbell away from

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.360
me with my just my thumb.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.660
That allows the Dumbbell to spin inside of
my hand and not get slowed down or dragged

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.879
down by friction.

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.270
But as I come back, what I want to do is then,
grasp with the four fingers and then release

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.291
my thumb from the back side.

00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:45.670
So that now, I'm able to actually roll the
Dumbbell back.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.240
If you grip too hard in both directions, you're
going to wind up not allowing the Dumbbell

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.599
to spin or it's going to feel like it's roughing
your hands.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.470
To do this exercise properly, you just want
to get the feel of it.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.100
Practice a few times and you'll get it.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.470
And now you're able to do this great Ab exercise
without actually even needing an Ab Roller.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.800
Of course we can still take advantage of the
rolling situation here, by turning our body

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.430
around and now positioning the Dumbbell under
our feet.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.319
So here I'm doing a Sprinter Tucked variation
of it.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.680
I look like a Sprinter, one leg back, one
leg up, right.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.390
We're mimicking the athletic movement of a
Sprint but we're doing it here with a Dumbbell.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.470
We're driving forward with one knee, we're
driving backwards with the opposite one.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.400
Now the great thing about this exercise is,
again it's another lower Ab targeted movement

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.110
because we're working on bottom up.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.040
And we can even get a little bit of bottom
up stability because we have to balance the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.280
positioning of this Dumbbell under my foot.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.650
You might find that it rolls away from you,
again manage the pressure in your foot.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.960
Become a little bit more, Coordinated and
Athletic.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.880
It's another benefit of the exercise.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.390
But the bottom line is you're able to train
your lower Abs the same way you did through

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.110
the top down with the Rollout,

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.510
now you can do it in reverse Rollout situation
and still using just that single Dumbbell.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.290
So there you have it guys, there is a workout
you can do at home with just a single Dumbbell.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.269
Or if you want to do it in the gym, by all
means go for it.

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.930
It's a new way to train your Abs, again using
a little bit of extra resistance and not needing

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.930
a lot of equipment.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.970
And guys, this is what ATHLEANX is all about.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.300
You can do all of your workouts, whether you're
at home or you're in the gym, it doesn't matter

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.300
to me.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.409
Matter of fact we have a program, you need
NO any equipment at all, ATHLEAN XERO.

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.299
Ranging to hard programs that utilize a lot
of equipment in the gym, it's up to you, want

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.620
level you're at and how far you want to push
yourself.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.300
And we're talking about programs guys, I mentioned
it before, ULTIMATE ARMS is on the way.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.300
Sooner than you think.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.280
Keep an eye on here, our channel and of course
if you're on our email list make sure you

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.940
stay tuned, because we'll be notifying you
very soon when that's available.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.800
In the meantime, I'll see you guys back here
for more videos.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.550
Let me know, if you try this video, let me
know if you thought it helpful, leave your

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.550
comments and thumbs up below.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.430
And we'll be back here again in just a few
days for yet another new video.
