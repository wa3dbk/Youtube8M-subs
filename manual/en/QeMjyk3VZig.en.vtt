00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
so were here today eating at luv burger

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.475
which is an all vegan restaurant in Samara Costa Rica

00:00:04.613 --> 00:00:07.653
we just ordered their very famous luv burgers

00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:11.248
and i thought it would be appropriate for me to talk to you about the benefits I get from being on a plant based diet

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.006
aka being vegan

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:23.827
# 1 is health

00:00:23.906 --> 00:00:26.386
before i went vegan i was much heavier

00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:30.928
and by me making the choice of going vegan

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:34.634
and combining that with great fitness regime

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:38.052
was one of the best things that could have happened to me

00:00:38.508 --> 00:00:42.508
plant based diet was one of the best decisions I've ever made

00:00:46.434 --> 00:00:47.474
# 2 is the planet

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:49.965
there is a lot of research out there that shows

00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:51.965
 

00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:52.465
that being on a plant based diet

00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:54.169
leaves a positive footprint on our planet

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:56.017
and that is truly what i believe in

00:00:56.332 --> 00:00:59.452
luv burgers motto is that with one vegan burger

00:01:01.346 --> 00:01:03.906
you actually save 600 gallons of water

00:01:06.604 --> 00:01:08.844
versus ordering a regular burger

00:01:08.844 --> 00:01:11.905
speaking of veggie burgers looks what just came

00:01:20.722 --> 00:01:21.222
# 3

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:22.909
is animals

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.221

00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:28.391
and different info you can find

00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:30.614
about the cruelty

00:01:30.614 --> 00:01:32.458
and the way we tend to treat our animals

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.060
and the factory farming a

00:01:35.204 --> 00:01:37.284
honestly i won't go into detail

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:39.153
but that is something i believe in

00:01:39.153 --> 00:01:40.910
and proud to say i don't contribute to

00:01:43.044 --> 00:01:44.004
