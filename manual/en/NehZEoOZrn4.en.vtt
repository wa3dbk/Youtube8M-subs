00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
one, two, three, four!

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.960
Rev up your engines!

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.760
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.660
today I'm going to show you how to
replace a bad thermostat on your vehicle,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.680
now thermostats are pretty simple
devices, when engines cold,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.000
the spring keeps them closed, so hot
water stays in the engine and warms up

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.510
faster, then once the engine heats up, the
spring heats up, it opens the valve and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.920
lets water go into the radiator to cool
the engine, but like any other mechanical

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.070
part, they break eventually,
they either break where they shut closed

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.170
and the engine overheats, or they stick
open the engine runs to cool, and then

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.420
the check engine light comes on, in this
case it's stuck open, then when I hook up

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.360
the scan tool, it says P 0128 coolant
thermostat cooling temperature below

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.229
thermostat regulating temperature, so
we're going to put a new thermostat in,

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.549
we'll follow the lower radiator hose that
comes up to the engine here, and this is

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.090
the thermostat housing, it has big bolts
on it you take off, in order to remove

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.950
the thermostat, but first we'll stick a
pan under there to catch any drips of

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.580
the antifreeze that comes out when we take it
off, we'll just get a wrench, this is a 12

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.009
millimeter, stick it on, take the bolts
off, and to make the job easier,

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.829
I'll take the radiator hose off, you
loosen the clamp, then just pull the hose

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:40.299
out of the way, that makes it easier to
get the assembly out of the way, and

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.530
here it is, here's the thermostat, it's
broken into two pieces, the other piece

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.579
we got to pull off the inside, so we know
it was stuck wide open, now even though

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.810
the thermostat is simple, you can put it in
backwards, the way you put it in is, the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.369
short end goes towards the hose, and the
deep end goes towards the engine, if you

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.579
put it in the other way, that's backwards,
you want to make sure you have it in the

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.909
correct direction, and if you look
closely this one, you see there's a

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.200
little toggle switch here, that's to let
air go through the system, so you make

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.770
sure that the toggle switch is pointed
straight up to the top of the engine, so

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.420
the air can get out faster, now on this Toyota,
first you put the thermostat into

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.010
the housing on the engine, it has a
rubber gasket inside, and then you put

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.230
the top of the cover on it and bolt it on,
then you tighten all the bolts up nice

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.530
and tight, and slide the radiator hose
back on,

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:40.980
and then use pliers and slide the clamp
back on, then pour the coolant back in

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:51.209
the radiator, then start her up and turn
the heat on full blast, while the engine is

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.790
warming up, you pour coolant in the
radiator until it gets nice and warm and

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:05.610
all the air is out of the system, and
then you're done, so the next time your

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.900
thermostat goes bad, why not replace it
yourself,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.800
and remember if you have any car
questions just visit the Scotty Kilmer

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.160
channel and I'll answer them as soon as I'm done opening this coconut!
