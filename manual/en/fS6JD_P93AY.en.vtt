00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.220
Hey youtubers, it's Charlie.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.960
This week on The Walking Dead we learned the
freaking Governor is back and he's probably

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.210
been perving on the prison the whole time!

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.689
The worst of the flu is over, tyreese still
doesn't know about Carol and every Wednesday

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.500
will now be known as "Spaghetti Tuesdays".

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.890
So let's talk about our favorite moments and
then I'll do my review.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.760
So first thing's first, the freaking Governor.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.570
What has he been doing this whole time?

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.690
The teaser for the next episode kind of makes
it seem like he's been perving on the prison

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.250
the whole time just camping out in the woods
nearby.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.840
Maybe he's the one that was putting all the
rats in the fence.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.260
He's been gone for several episodes, but I've
got some behind the scenes info that explains

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.719
why he hasn't been on till now.

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.579
I'll talk about that right after my review.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.820
Number 2, the flu is almost over the episode
kind of implied that that the flu is over,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.280
but I think that people will still be recovering
in the next episode.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.390
And they'll be recovering emotionally.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.550
A lot of this episode was about not losing
hope.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.879
Rick and Hershel were talking about how things
will never be the same again and obviously

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.109
people are going to start breaking down, just
because of all the constant threats.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.590
How crazy was it when Hershel saw that Glenn
was starting to lose it and turned and the

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.070
camera just pointed right at that walker with
the bag on his face.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.460
And you just though, "Oh, I know exactly going
to happen..."

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.630
Do you think you would have had the courage
to fight the walker for that air bag to save

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.630
Glenn?

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.520
Of course we all would, Glenn is one of our
favorite characters.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.330
Next up, Carl is totally turning into bad
ass.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.900
You even saw Rick kind of smile at him while
they were stabbing walkers in the face.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.890
I think he's still trying to see him as his
little kid but Carl is really starting to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.490
turn into more of a fighter now.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.610
I'm really hoping that Carl-Fighter storyline
will dovetail with the Governor storyline.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.570
Wouldn't it be awesome to see Carl take out
the Governor?

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.820
Obviously Michonne is the one that should
do it, but Carl doing it would be so much

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.820
crazier.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.310
And can we talk about Tyreese?

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.119
Tyreese obviously still does not know about
Carol.

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.780
But it was really interesting watching Rick
start telling people.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.350
Obviously Maggie kind of had her doubts at
first but then she said, "No you did the right

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.350
thing."

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.590
And then after that none of the other characters
questioned Rick's decision.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.590
I think they all kind of understood that Carol
HAD to leave.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.680
But what is going to happen when Tyreese finds
out?

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.920
He's obviously probably going to lose it again.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.640
But he's mostly concerned with Sasha right
now.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.170
But I imagine his reaction will be similar
to the way that other people react when they

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.509
find out the Governor is back.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.850
So the big questions after this episode are
1, what has he been doing this whole time?

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.350
Has he just been camping out in the woods
being a total perv?

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.860
And two, how are people going to continue
dealing with all these constant threats.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.080
Obviously we have the flu, now we have the
Governor and there's the constant threat of

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.080
the walkers.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.170
So people are starting to break down emotionally.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.150
The next episode is called "Too Far Gone".

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.600
And kind of deals with that theme.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.040
Be sure to SUBSCRIBE to get my video.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.760
I'll post it right after the episode airs.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.470
But what did I think of the episode?

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.580
Overall I give it a solid B+, it was so intense
despite being so self-contained in this small

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.750
Cell Block A.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.190
The episode was called "Internment" so we
knew it was basically going to be focused

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.470
on this small group of characters that were
just slowly degenerate into walkers.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.150
Obviously Hershel's big theme was keeping
hope alive.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.410
But the minute we saw people start to turn
you knew it was just going to jump off a cliff

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.410
and go crazy.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.780
Raise your hand if you thought that Lizzie
was actually going to stab that walker in

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.010
Glenn's cell in the head.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.100
I could never have predicted she was going
to treat it like a dog and try to lead it

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.100
away.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.100
"Here boy, here boy..."

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.100
It was so amazing.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.572
But just like that intense theme song that
the Walking Dead has at the beginning of every

00:02:57.572 --> 00:03:01.460
episode that final teaser made me so excited
for next week's episode.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.600
I mean, it's just like the Governor was going
to turn around and wink at us.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.030
Don't you just see Michonne now just sharpening
her sword in her cell.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.720
Almost like she has Governor Radar.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.420
Now be sure to let me know what your favorite
moments were in the comments below.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.910
And let me know, what do you think the Governor
has been doing this whole time outside of

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.910
the prison?

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.911
The teaser for the next episode kind of implies
he's been in the woods the whole time, but

00:03:19.911 --> 00:03:21.950
we still have no idea what he's going to be
doing.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.050
Although there were a lot of explosions behind
him in the teaser for next episode.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.310
So clearly he's going to be blowing a ton
of shit up.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.590
For those of you wondering why we haven't
seen the Governor till now.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.100
Scott Gimple said that they basically just
got sick of using the character.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.440
Season 3 was all about the Governor.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.240
And they didn't want to just keep using him
and make Season 4 seem like Season 3 part

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.240
2.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.200
And something else you can get excited for,
Andrew Lincoln said that Rick is going to

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.780
develop a new way to kill walkers this season.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.380
He didn't say what it is, but I'm imagining
it has something to do with a cattle chute.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.180
If you've ever seen a slaughter house they
basically funnel cattle through this really

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.660
narrow opening so they can kill them one at
a time.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.980
And you know in this episode how Rick was
basically walking through that fenced in area.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.460
I have a feeling they are going to set up
something like a walker chute.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.320
So they can all just kill them one at a time.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.720
But let me know what you're theories are!

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.950
In addition to all my regular videos, I'm
posting 3 new Doctor Who videos as part of

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.650
my Countdown to the 50th Anniversary.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.370
I'll also be posting information on my next
Doctor Who Giveaway.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.570
I'll probably post that video on Friday.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.560
Because I'll be giving away DVDs for the 50th
Anniversary.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.260
