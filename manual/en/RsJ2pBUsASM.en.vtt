00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:06.376
[ Music ]

00:00:06.876 --> 00:00:10.176
&gt;&gt; Undergraduate applied social
science majors at the University

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.936
of Wisconsin Stout learn
the tools and perspectives

00:00:13.036 --> 00:00:16.846
of anthropology, economics,
geography, history,

00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:20.256
political science,
social work, and sociology

00:00:20.506 --> 00:00:23.446
to understand culture,
society, and human action.

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:26.896
Our students pursue careers
that involve critical thinking,

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:29.816
oral and written
communication, problem solving,

00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:32.096
and social research
and analysis.

00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:34.546
These abilities are well suited

00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:37.596
for a 21st century
information-based economy

00:00:37.756 --> 00:00:40.296
that demands a flexible
and skilled workforce.

00:00:40.816 --> 00:00:42.386
&gt;&gt; The reason why I think
students like the major is

00:00:42.386 --> 00:00:45.436
because people are interested
in society, and what's exciting

00:00:45.436 --> 00:00:48.876
about this major is that it
gives you tools to try to figure

00:00:48.876 --> 00:00:51.496
that out, right, make the
complex world less complex.

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.276
Our majors will be very good
by the end of their program

00:00:54.276 --> 00:00:57.226
at statistics, but also
qualitative skills,

00:00:57.686 --> 00:01:00.106
and any number of
jobs, these are very,

00:01:00.106 --> 00:01:01.436
very valuable skills for.

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:04.286
But, you know, just in
their own personal lives,

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:06.636
it's incredibly useful.

00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:09.276
&gt;&gt; I wanted something a
little bit more fulfilling,

00:01:09.396 --> 00:01:10.746
but still challenging,

00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:14.506
and applied social science
really does that for me.

00:01:15.156 --> 00:01:16.816
&gt;&gt; I started going to
school just with --

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:19.216
well, I can go to school,
get a four-year education,

00:01:19.216 --> 00:01:23.556
and then this degree program
came up, and I'm interested

00:01:23.556 --> 00:01:25.866
in -- got me interested
in graduate school.

00:01:26.146 --> 00:01:28.266
So if I want to go into law,
it has a good base for that.

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:31.156
If I want to go into journalism,
a good base for that,

00:01:31.156 --> 00:01:31.816
or if I want to go

00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:33.866
into countless other
graduate programs.

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.276
&gt;&gt; If you have flexible skills,

00:01:35.806 --> 00:01:38.076
then it gives you a lot
more freedom in your life.

00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:39.656
&gt;&gt; One big difference is

00:01:39.656 --> 00:01:42.526
that with an applied
social science degree,

00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:44.186
I'll have a lot more options.

00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:47.286
&gt;&gt; I'm going to study abroad
in South Africa next semester,

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:50.546
the first one from the school
to do that for this degree,

00:01:50.546 --> 00:01:52.406
so it's completely unique,

00:01:53.036 --> 00:01:54.446
and pretty much everything
you'll be doing

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:55.736
in this degree will be unique.

00:01:56.026 --> 00:01:57.536
&gt;&gt; Here's the great
thing about UW Stout.

00:01:58.156 --> 00:02:01.636
It has students excited
about taking what they learn

00:02:01.636 --> 00:02:02.716
and applying it to
the real world.

00:02:03.326 --> 00:02:05.426
And I haven't seen
this type of a culture

00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:07.576
at other universities,
not to this level.

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:09.786
&gt;&gt; I feel like I finally
found something that fits me.

00:02:09.786 --> 00:02:10.956
It's a good match.
