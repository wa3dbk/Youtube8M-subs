00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:01.556
-Hey there, apples.

00:00:01.556 --> 00:00:03.506
Have you ever seen
anything like this at the zoo?

00:00:06.711 --> 00:00:08.057
-[sneezes]
-Aaaah!

00:00:08.057 --> 00:00:10.708
Oh... oh...
-I sneeze glitter! [giggles]

00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:14.002
-Wow, all I can say is that marshmallow
should be arrested for glittering.

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:15.627
[laughs]

00:00:15.627 --> 00:00:17.485
Have you ever seen a
marshmallow sneeze glitter?

00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:19.156
And look at this guy.

00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:21.974
He jumped so high that if he had feet,
he'd be wearing Air Force Ones.

00:00:21.974 --> 00:00:22.965
[laughs]

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:24.567
You're an apple,
and that's fake and fruity.

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:26.053
Get it? Air Force Ones?

00:00:26.053 --> 00:00:26.849
Still an apple.

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.599
You're an apple.
Nuh-uh, you're an apple.

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.531
Apple. Apple. Apple. Apple. Apple.
Apple. Apple. Apple. Apple. Apple.

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:33.553
Speaking of air,

00:00:33.553 --> 00:00:35.531
our next video is full
of another type of gas:

00:00:35.531 --> 00:00:36.850
laughing gas.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.079
[farts, laughs]

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.169
Okay, now...

00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:43.398
Okay, now I...

00:00:43.398 --> 00:00:45.114
I have two fingers.

00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:46.928
-(Pear) Actually, you don't
have any fingers, Orange.

00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:47.949
-No fingers?

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.339
[screaming]
-Whoa, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay!

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.058
You never had fingers.

00:00:53.058 --> 00:00:54.358
-This guy's totally out of it.

00:00:54.358 --> 00:00:55.705
What's even better is the ending.

00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:59.095
Hey, hey Pear.
-Yes, Orange?

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:00.070
-Airbag.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.138
[pop!]
[Pear exclaims]

00:01:01.138 --> 00:01:03.739
Oohh, did you see that?
Right to the face.

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:04.646
He was all like,

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:06.177
"Oh man, this is hilarious.

00:01:06.177 --> 00:01:08.476
I'm gonna show this on the--"
Ooh, surprise airbag!

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:09.358
Now, I don't know about you,

00:01:09.358 --> 00:01:11.216
but I hate it when
surprise airbag happens.

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:12.887
You're just sitting there,
minding your own business,

00:01:12.887 --> 00:01:13.723
when all of a sudden--

00:01:13.723 --> 00:01:15.024
[pop!]
[Orange exclaims]

00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:17.230
Now, everybody's been
sending me this next video,

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.600
so let's just cut to the chase.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.340
So there's this news story about
this fruit that almost get killed,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.524
but that's not the good part.

00:01:22.524 --> 00:01:23.685

I'd hate to have him on my bad side.

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:50.806
He'd probably give me a fruit punch.
[laughs]

00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:54.428
So what do you get when you cross
a unicorn, an orange, and a rainbow?

00:01:54.428 --> 00:01:57.563
A fruit with a rainbow unibrow. [laughs]

00:01:57.563 --> 00:01:58.166
Lame.

00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:00.303
Not only that, you get our last video.

00:02:00.303 --> 00:02:02.439
Hey, Charlie, hey!
-You're not gonna see the rainbow.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.482
-Hey! Hey, Charlie, wake up!
It's a rainbow!

00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:07.594
-God, you guys.
This had better be freakin' important.

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:09.358
Is the kitchen on fire again?

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:12.191
-We have to go see the rainbow!
-Yeah, we have to go get the pot of gold!

00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:14.420
Come on! The pot of gold at
the end of the rainbow; let's go!

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.231
-Pot of gold. Sure.

00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:19.529
I'm going back to sleep now.
-No, Charlie!

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.340
You have to get up and
take us to the rainbow!

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.872
-Please stop jumping on me.

00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:25.752
-Yeah, I want my pot of gold, Charlie.
Let's go. Hurry!

00:02:25.752 --> 00:02:27.981
-I love rainbows and
puppies and kittens

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:31.474

clouds and bunnies and rainbows!

00:02:31.474 --> 00:02:33.766
-All right, fine!
I'll go with you to see the rainbow.

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:36.294
-Wow! Rainbows have magical powers.

00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:37.965
But you know what
else has magical powers?

00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:39.080
Our comment question of the day,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.031
which comes from a
user named Rockinrutabaga.

00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:43.654
-Um, like, if you were stuck
on an island with one fruit,

00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:44.862
who would it be and why?

00:02:44.862 --> 00:02:46.905
-So, if you were stuck on
an island with one fruit,

00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:47.973
who would it be and why?
