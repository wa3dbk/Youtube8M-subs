00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.400
As-salamu alaykum  ( hello)

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.500
In this video I'm going to show my Nail polish purchases from Hayat mall( located in the Riyadh, Saudi Arabia )

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.900
And some of the things from Amazon

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.780
First, I'm going to start with my purchases from Hayat mall, which is mainly nail polishes

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.619
First four bottles are Essie's nail polishes

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.070
I got them from Whites pharmacy it cost me forty Riyals for the bottle (about 11$)

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.550
First color is the First Timer, It is light minty one

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.000
And it's the same shade that's shown in the screen

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.700
The second color is Blank, and it is very pigmented

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.370
Third color is the Golden Nuggets and I loved the glitter in it, it is very elegant

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.370
And this is how it looks with and without a base colour

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.280
The fourth color is Midnight Cami
It is very shiny

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.719
that you can see the reflection of the window on it

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.070
Okay will start with OPI collection
I purchased them from Sephora that's located

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.910
The bottle cost me forty nine on Riyals( 13$)
The first can't find my

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.640
czechkbook

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.520
And this is how it looks 
The second and am very happy that I bought it is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.909
Polka.com 
Because of the variety of glitter  in it

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.299
Third color is Koala Bear-y 
I have to get it because it's Fuchsia

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.979
The fourth is Honk if you like OPI 
and this is it's swatch

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.390
The fifth Haven't is the Foggiest

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.380
I liked the variety of shades that's created

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.940
The sixth color looks lighter than it is

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.360
My Vampire is Buff 
And this is its own swatch

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.110
The seventh is Need Sunglasses 
It is summery yellow color

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.110
The seventh is Need Sunglasses 
It is summery yellow color

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.570
And peachy color from Bourjois 
Which is suitable for the summer

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.310
And a beautiful color from Revlon named Charming 211

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.660
Also an Hayat mall

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.860
the Turkish store,Flomar, opened
It sells nail polishes and makeup

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.620
the Turkish store,Flomar, opened
It sells nail polishes and makeup

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.080
but I only bought 9 bottles

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.929
And the bottle cost only 10 Riyals (3$)

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.100
The bottles has no name nor number

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.410
But most of the consistency of the colors need to be applied more than two coats

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.080
to get right shade
But it's okay you can put a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.830
basic

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.410
colour, then above the wanted color

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.410
just like this neon

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.000
 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.330
I also bought from Flomar a nail dryer spray

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.560
In 35 Riyals ( 10$)

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.250
The spray claims that it helps to dry the nail polish faster

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.250
So I tested it

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.290
I applied the nail polish

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.560
then started the timer
It took about 5 minutes

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.750
to be completely dry

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.370
I don't really recommend it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.710
because the nail polish dry by itself in 5 minutes

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.120
Now will start with the Amazon purchases

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.810
This is the glitter collection from Martha Stewart, it's contains 24 colors

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.890
Which is very useful for the nail  art

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.620
Which is very useful for the nail  art

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.130
Because it is very fine glitter and it doesn't melt with the polish

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.210
And this is another collection of Martha Stewart glitter

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.920
it has the 12 colors

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.560
This is how it looks in real life 
Of course  you can use it other than nail art

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.230
The other thing that I bought from Amazon
I wanted to tell you about for a while now

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.010
Some people claims this is a nail polish dryer

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.750
but

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.230
how the polish will dry if it's in a closed area,it needs air

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.540
and another conditions to dry

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.599
It is  actually used to remove glitter polish

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.900
acrylic nails, and gel nails 
that need to be soaked for a while

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.000
what I added is nail polish remover and my nail has a glitter on it

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.419
and just you know that glitter polish is hard to remove

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.570
So I didn't soak the nail for a good time

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.000
Because it dries the skin around the nail

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.100
And I've should applied some Vaseline before soaking it

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.639
And I've should applied some Vaseline before soaking it

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.320
The third thing that I bought from Amazon is a plastic bottle

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.650
You fill it  with Nail polish remover
And what's attract me

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.650
is the way it's pump the liquid

00:04:57.549 --> 00:05:01.009
The fourth is a Nail soaking tray to remove the dead skin and all that

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.059
The fourth is a Nail soaking tray to remove the dead skin and all that

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:11.059
The fourth is a Nail soaking tray to remove the dead skin and all that

00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:16.019
These two are nail polish holders

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:19.769
What  I like about it 
it is flexible

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:23.669
rubbery that suitable for any size of nail polish bottle

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.929
 

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:34.119
The last thing that I purchased from Amazon is an iPhone 5 tripod

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:39.289
I purchased  them separately
The gorilla tripod alone

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.999
and the glif  alone 
Which is where you secure your iPhone

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:49.599
It is a very easy to assemble

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.989
Also it is very flexible and it bends in very unexpected ways

00:05:53.989 --> 00:06:00.989
And holds the weight

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.660
This is the end of the haul 
And  all the  details and links of where I purchased them in the
