hello everyone Michael here once again
with the daily note 2 and 3 YouTube

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.490
channel and yesterday I showed you how
to do this you could

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.039
from the lock screen swipe left where the clock is

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.750
and it'll open up your camera app and you can
start taking pictures right away

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.930
well i wanna talk about everything else

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.019
about the lock screen for example

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.050
for the longest time I thought this page
itself couldn't be customized but

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.680
actually could change this home widget
this is just a widget here

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.370
this is the widget that
samsung provides and you can configure

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.980
it

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.850
by going to settings device

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.930
lockscreen and your configuring that
home widget by setting the clock widget

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.890
options

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.890
the personal message and the owner
information

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.660
however you don't necessarily need to
use that lock screen for example what

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.800
I don't like about that default lock
screen that Samsung provide it is

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.030
although it is beautiful I like the font

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.799
he need to pull down to see the weather
and I thought that it was an

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.100
unnecessary gesture just to see the
weather now most the you probably

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.390
already have done this you could swipe
to the left and then P just and a widget

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.780
for example let's at the music widget here

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.200
and in order to move this around you need

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.390
to first have it expanded so first expand it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.509
by dragging from the Middle downwards
and then you could long tap on it like

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.710
you would do any widget

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.259
and you can move it in place you could even
make it your new home screen widget for

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.170
example

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.430
if you just power on the device now
your home screen

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.890
is that music widget and once again
what i really don't like about this

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.780
widget is that I cannot see

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.070
weather on their maybe if you live in a
city where the weather system is pretty

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.899
consistent and predictable

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.009
maybe you wouldn't be much of an issue
for you but for me I always need to look

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.610
at the weather before heading outside

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.259
yes it does have big variations in it so
there are many lock screen widgets that

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.849
are available in the Google Play Store
Dr a little bit hard to find

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.200
this when you type widget it tries to find these for you and

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.230
they are different types a widget's it
is widgets that are specifically made

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.239
for Android 4.2 and higher

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.220
so there are many which is the here that
you can download

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.400
the two that I recommend is called
chronus

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.830
you could see that i have it installed and the
other one

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.160
is called the dashclock widget dash clock being one word

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.000
you can see that i have that installed
as well so let me show you what those two

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.900
look like

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.200
so after have them installed go to
your lock screen

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.580
and swipe ro rhw right and just

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.379
that plus button so this is chronus and let's just

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.269
say okay to that and then let's add
another one

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.560
the dashclock

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.010
and you that I customized this
widget a little you could

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.720
and extension and you could add all
these elements in here so I really like

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.209
that

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.400
so let's put the check mark on that

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.500
and now let's turn the screen on again
and you can see that this widget

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.010
that samsung provides is there but we
had these additional two widgets

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.500
so I liked this one because it is very
stylish has a nice gaphic

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.000
in there a however this one has more features in there it has

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.400
the temperature and you can add stuff
like your Gmail in there

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.000
so I think that is nice and if you like
one of these and you would rather have one

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.580
of these as

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.500
your homescreen just do a long tap

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.550
when it is expanded and just set that as
your home screen

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.700
so now you could have that

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.319
and obviously it doesn't really have
to be about time and the weather

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.150
could have your walking mRW has your
home screen for example maybe

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.500
you're that pedometer a lot and the first you want to see is maybe

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.890
is that pedometer so anyway those are just a couple widgets that i found that

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.099
could run on the Galaxy Note 3 as your
lock screen widget

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.060
and if you happen to find a cool one out
there definitely make sure you leave a

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.700
comment on how to get that widget that you found

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.770
so that's the end of today's video and for
more videos on the Galaxy Note 2 and

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.260
