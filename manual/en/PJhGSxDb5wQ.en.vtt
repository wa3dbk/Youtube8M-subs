00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.500
Separated and protected cycle paths 
are one reason for more people cycling. 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.070
But cyclists in the Netherlands can usually 
take a more direct route than motorized traffic. 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.100
And it has been that way 
in new urban development areas since the 1980s. 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.280
Houten is such a modern town. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.220
A cyclist going from A to B 
can ride in an almost straight line.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.100
This distance would be 2 point 3 kilometers 
taking about 9 minutes. 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.080
A private motorized vehicle would be forced 
to go around residential areas

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.010
and has to take a much longer route. 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.210
4 point 3 kilometers, taking about 10 minutes. 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250
But Houten was designed that way. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.030
Utrecht was founded by the Romans 
and its street plan developed in the middle ages. 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.200
How would it be in cities like that?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.180
The cyclist can still take a very direct route. 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.040
1 point 8 kilometers taking about 8 minutes. 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.210
A motorized vehicle going between the same points 
would have to drive a much longer route. 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.030
4 point 4 kilometers taking about 9 minutes. 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.150
So even in old cities the cyclist has the advantage. 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.500
How was this achieved?

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.050
The Dutch changed their cities considerably 
in the last 20 years. 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.030
Where now only cycling and public transportation is allowed, 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.110
the street used to be a 4 lane main artery. 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.000
Nowadays no private vehicle may drive here anymore.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.240
In addition: one way streets for motorized traffic 
make through traffic also more difficult. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.190
This does not apply to cyclists. 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.210
Cul-de-sacs create neighborhoods that have only very limited access. 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.200
The barriers for motorized traffic were deliberately 
placed to create such limited access areas. 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.240
Cyclists can always pass these barriers.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.180
Counter flow lanes for cyclists only, 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.120
create an even bigger imbalance 
between the two modes of traffic. 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.180
In favor of the cyclists. 
For them cities are far more accessible.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Once you start looking for them, 
the divisions are everywhere.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.190
No through streets for motorized traffic 
can be main routes for cyclists.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.260
A main through route for cyclists, 
but a one way street for motorized traffic.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.270
Sometimes residents have the key 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.000
to unlock the posts that keep unwanted cars out.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.230
Separation of modes even without separate cycle paths.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.000
One more reason for so much cycling in the Netherlands.
