00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.930
Hi, I'm Amelia and I'm going to talk to you
about ways to promote hair growth. You always

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.950
want to check your diet and make sure that
your diet is giving you everything you need,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.200
and if it's not, try taking a multi vitamin.
You also want to check your stress levels.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.650
Stress is a super important factor in our
life, and it affects every aspect of our body,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.070
and hair is an unnecessary component of our
bodies, so one of the first systems that shuts

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.360
down is hair growth. So, if you're under a
lot of stress, get that in check and start

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.570
taking your B vitamins. B vitamins are something
that our body does not produce. So you want

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.120
to make sure that you take those on a regular
basis so that way it will help promote the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.260
hair growth. Biotin is great. Biotin has been
proven to increase the growth of nails, but

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.249
they have not transfered that over to hair
yet, and they haven't checked that with hair,

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.940
but I would assume if it's making nails grow,
it's going to make your hair grow, because

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.869
they're made out of the same basic building
blocks. Also, something like Nioxin, even

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:03.579
if you're not thinning, Nioxin can help because
it actually helps stimulate the follicle,

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.890
it feeds it if you will, causing hair to grow
a little bit faster, possibly, and a lot healthier.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.180
You also loose less hair when you're on a
shampoo like that. Really though, that's about

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.710
it. Hair grows about a half inch a month,
so, you know, some people, their hair grows

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.780
faster, and some people a little bit slower.
It's just going to depend on your genetics.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.980
So, try those things and see how they work
for you, and anything else that you read about

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.610
on the market that's supposed to help your
hair grow faster, they're purely myths. The

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.800
mane and tale, horrible, that's for horses,
do not use that on your hair. It coats the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.440
hair shaft and attracts dirt and other stuff,
and you can always tell, I can always tell

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.800
if someone's been using it because it feels
like they've just constantly got a slime coat

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.970
on their hair. So, stop using that stuff,
nothing will make your hair grow faster except

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:00.990
genetics, diet and possibly biotin. So try
those items, and hopefully we'll see if some

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.750
of them work for you, and making your hair
grow faster and longer.
