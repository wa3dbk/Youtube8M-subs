00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Hot dog. Everybody wants a hot dog.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Gotta get me a hot dog. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Can't you fix me up a hot dog? 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
When nothing else will do

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
there's nothing that can get through 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
quite like a hot dog.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
When you're a kid

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
they tell you stories about animals.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
When you're a kid  

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
they show how animals are your friends.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
You learn that

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
eggs come from chickens.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Milk comes from cows. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Pigs will make you bacon

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but no one

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
will ever tell you how.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Do you ever wonder 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
where your food comes from?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Do you ever think about the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
places where your food comes from?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Well...

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Does it come from a freezer? 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Does it come from a can?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Does it come from a factory

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
from a blood-stained,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
saw-wielding man?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It comes from animals.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Hey!

00:02:44.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Don't worry, animals don't feel pain. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
'Cause we're not the same.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
We're not the same. 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Animals are our friends. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So why eat your friends?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Why eat your friends?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
You veggie people are crazy. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
You're trying to convert me. 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
You veggie people are crazy. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Stop trying to convert me,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
'cause I want a hotdog! 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
We're not trying to convert you. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
We're just trying to alert you.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
We're just trying to   

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
present the truth. 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And we're sorry

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
this disturbs you, 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
but maybe it should, because

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Animals are our friends.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So why eat your friends? 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Why eat your friends? 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
How can you make amends, 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
when you eat your friends?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
soy dog

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Animals are our friends.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Everybody try a soy dog.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Animals are our friends. 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
When you eat animals....  

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Don't eat animals.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
