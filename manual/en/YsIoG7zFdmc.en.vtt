00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.360
I'm asking God to come in my song. Come, come help me.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.180
In this nation, we are only 800,000.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.820
From 60 million, our people our culture, our ways are vanishing.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.760
St. Joseph's Indian School provides an atmosphere-

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.980
a sanctuary-

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.480
where our beliefs

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:07.300
and way of life can not be practiced, but honored and gracefully passed on to the generations.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.860
Living and following traditional ways

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.760
is different to everyone.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.380
It's in your heart,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.920
it's outside,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
it's what somebody sees but also what somebody doesn't see.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.680
Living your life traditionally might be

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.780
dancing at a powwow, might be speaking the language,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.180
might be taking part in Sun Dance or another ceremony.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.100
Living traditionally is different to each individual.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.640
People not learning the ways, it's not in their homes

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.340
too much anymore, so it's getting lost at a faster rate

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:54.360
because of the, you know, drugs, alcohol, and a lot of the socio-economic things that happen on the reservation.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.640
You know, a lot of the children are kind of being left

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.960
to raise themselves so they don't have that, that older generation to help them.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.280
Plains Culture and how it is being lost

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.520
is a very sad thing.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.560
We try to instill some type of culture in our students, as far as

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.380
so they can grasp onto a piece of culture, and that may

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.560
step them in the direction of living culturally

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.740
in their lives.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.340
Living culture in their lives.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.500
We all have to be involved and we all have to take the initiative

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.560
and we all do need to realize that the ultimate goal why were here

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.280
is because we're here for the children and we want them to progress and become

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.200
you know, just well-meaning citizens in our culture and our society so they can then

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.760
bring their children up.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.700
The kids nowadays don't have that sense of identity, they don't have that strong culture behind them.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.460
They don't have the language in their home, they don't have any of the culture in their home,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.440
and if they do have it it's particularly only in their schools and I think they loose that sense of identity,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.460
they don't know where they belong in the circle.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.560
And I hope that the kids will understand

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.700
that their culture is good, their culture should be something they are very proud of.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.980
And not just in that generality, but really connected to their heart.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.480
That's my job- to connect teaching to their mind and their heart so that as they grow,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.040
they'll continue to learn and continue to want to learn and be a part of their culture.
