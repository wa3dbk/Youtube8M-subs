Welcome to Metalworks Institute
keyboard tips. I'm Peter Kadar, and today

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.570
we're going to talk about boogie woogie and
blues piano basics. One of the things that

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.099
students seem to struggle with when they come
to see me, is left right independence and

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.940
being comfortable just grooving at the instrument.
I always recommend that everybody gets into

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.289
blues because blues is the basis of all of
the popular music that we hear in western

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:46.289
society. Rock, country, blues (obviously itself),
gospel music, r&amp;b, funk.. Everything comes

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.489
from blues, which means we need to get comfortable
playing the blues. So for beginning piano

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.769
students, one of the great things to do is
to start with a simple repetitive left hand-based

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:05.769
pattern. I often recommend something like
this. So we have three quarter notes, and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.630
two eighth notes. Go through an entire blues
progression. Now what I'll get them to do

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.640
after this in the right hand, is to add chords.
We'll start with whole notes. ... 2, 3, 4...

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.290
1, 2, 3, 4... So I'll get them to play through
an entire chorus of blues just doing this.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.460
Putting two different things together. Once
we get the whole notes together, we can start

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.460
to go through the different note subdivisions.
Half notes, here we go. Once a student is

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.840
comfortable with half notes, let's do quarter
notes. Then we do eighth notes. Here we go.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:14.439
So these are sort of swung. Now, up to this
point we don't have anything that really sounds

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.260
like what you would hear on a record. What
we do next is, we drop the eighth notes that

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.200
are on the down beat and only play the eighth
notes that are on the up beat. So the 1, AND,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.020
2, AND, 3, AND, 4, AND... So when I put that
together with this left hand pattern, we're

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.450
going to hear something you hear on a lot
of famous old records, and it sounds like

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.450
this. AND, AND, AND, AND, AND, AND... So I'm
just playing the off beats in the right hand.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.450
I still hear this a lot in country music.
Yeah... I'm Peter Kadar for Metalworks Institute
