00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:02.200
This message is brought to you

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.934
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:08.500
[music]

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.900
We can all be healthier
and improve our diets by

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.867
eating more fruits
and vegetables.

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:14.767
As with any food product,
you have to be careful in

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:17.500
how you handle and
prepare what you eat.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.500
It's as easy as washing
your hands before touching

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500
fresh fruits
and vegetables.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.233
Growers and processors are
responsible for preventing

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:28.433
bacteria in the soil or
water from contaminating

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:30.166
fresh fruits and
vegetables where they are

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.066
grown or processed.

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.734
With fresh-cut produce,
like bagged salads or cut

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:37.266
fruit, make sure it's
refrigerated or surrounded

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.633
by ice.

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:41.934
And, don't buy bruised
or damaged fruit.

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:43.800
It's a great place for
bacteria to hide and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.367
spread rapidly to the
rest of the fruit.

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:50.033
While shopping and
when checking out,

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:51.900
keep your fresh fruits and
vegetables separate from

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.100
meat, poultry and seafood.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.133
...And make sure you're
in the right line.

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.667
At home, store fruits and
vegetables that require

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:02.700
refrigeration
immediately in the

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.967
refrigerator-especially
anything that's pre-cut or

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:10.467
peeled. Use a thermometer
to ensure that food in

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:13.600
your refrigerator stays at
40 degrees Fahrenheit or

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.433
below.

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:17.200
We all know that we need
to wash our hands after

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.200
handling raw meat and we
should also wash our hands

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.934
after handling
produce too.

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:25.600
Cut away damaged or
bruised areas on fresh

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.567
fruits and vegetables
before preparing or

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:28.900
eating.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.967
And make sure you wash
the produce before you eat

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:33.567
it-even if you
plan to peel it.

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:36.200
If it's something firm
like a melon or cucumber,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.266
use a produce brush.

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:41.266
No need to use soap or any
kind of produce wash-plain

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:45.300
running water is fine.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.333
For precut, bagged items,
look on the package-if

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.066
they are labeled
"pre-washed" and "ready to

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:56.333
eat" there's no need
for additional washing.

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.266
If you're eating fruits
and vegetables raw,

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:01.100
keep them separate from
foods such as raw meat,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.200
poultry or seafood-and the
utensils used to prepare

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.400
them.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.033
This will help avoid
cross contamination.

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:10.133
Use separate cutting
boards for meats and

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:13.633
produce as well as for
raw and cooked foods.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.633
And finally, wash
cutting boards,

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:18.767
utensils and counter tops
with hot water and soap

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:20.967
between the time you
prepare raw meats,

00:02:20.967 --> 00:02:23.500
seafood and poultry and
any produce that will be

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.667
not be cooked.

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:28.967
For plastic or other
non-porous cutting boards,

00:02:28.967 --> 00:02:30.400
run them through the
dishwasher when you're

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.500
done.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.066
Keeping these common sense
tips in mind will not only

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:39.166
improve your diet, but
also help keep you safe

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:42.066
from any foodborne illness
possibly associated with

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:45.100
fresh fruits,
vegetables and juices.
