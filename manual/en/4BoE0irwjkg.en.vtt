00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:08.219
Hi, I'm dr.. Shook, and I'd like to talk with [you] today. Why I don't recommend the paleo diet for patients with Hashimoto's thyroid

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.819
the Paleo diet has really become a

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.910
I guess a cultural

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.209
Trend and Phenomenon over the last five to ten years [it] is a basically a diet that

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.650
Looks to our ancestry into how we ate

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.329
Before we were more civilized and before we had

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.659
agricultural ISm and before the Industrial revolution

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.590
Before we were farmers basically when we were more of a hunter and Gatherer

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.389
And it basically eliminates a lot of grains and a lot of things from the diet

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.930
And that and it can be a very very good diet for a person and it can help with autoimmune conditions

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.169
But I will just tell you I don't recommend that diet there are a lot of potential problems with with the Paleo diet

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.070
so

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.079
You know I can I can't go into an exhaustive list of why I don't like it

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.088
[but] let's just take a few things for consideration a lot of patients that have autoimmune conditions also have

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.949
digestive disorders a lot of autoimmunity and immune system issues are in the gastrointestinal tract and

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.839
If you don't know this, and it's the first time you've heard it. It's absolutely [true] [a]

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.400
very the majority of your immune system is actually in your gi tract a

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.479
Lot of the foods that we eat cause gut inflammation and not in every single person

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.868
but if your autoimmune 80 to 90 [percent] of my autoimmune patients have drivers or causes of their

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.249
Autoimmune problem that are dietary and [food-related] and even foods that you might think are good for you like you're eating

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.939
Asparagus for example, and you say, oh asparagus can't be bad for me

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.239
It could what we do in our clinic is we put people on an elimination program

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.530
Because we want to know what foods causing inflammation

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.689
But I'll tell you that with the current science the state of science today. What we are starting to do is have everyone

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.148
Order immune system tests for the different types of foods that they eat

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.160
We have like 200 foods that we can run

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.059
Testing on in a cooked and a raw form a lot of which are on the paleo diet to see if your immune system

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.749
Reacts to them and what that means is if your immune system [reacts] to that

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.250
You've got to get that food out of your diet

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.029
Or that's going to cause inflammation and that will that will tend to

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.860
perpetuate and push the autoimmune condition you have to you have to decrease inflammation and to decrease inflammation you have to get all of the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.659
the antigens or the triggers of the immune system [out] of the diet and out of the body an

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.609
Antigen can be a food which we're talking about here, but it can also be bacterial infections

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.230
Dysbiosis and overgrowth of getting back Bacteria in the gut it can be an h pylori

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.730
Which is a bacteria which can live in the stomach or in the Gi tract it can be a fungal infection like a yeast overgrowth

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.350
[it] can be a parasite

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.889
[I] mean it can be a number of different things that we have to identify

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.179
We have to kill that stuff or get it out of your diet, or you're going to have

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.439
Continual inflammation, so the Paleo diet though, it's good it it has a lot of [foods] in it that can feed

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.970
Sibo, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth a lot of patients [that] have thyroid problems or autoimmune conditions also have?

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.560
digestive issues

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.370
And those [digestive] issues

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.080
can come from a number of different problems it can come from [that] you being having a

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.910
Sensitivity to the food that causes an immune [response] which I'm talking about it can be that you have an overgrowth of Bacteria

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.480
That live and feed off of fadh maps now I do an entire separate video on fought on Fodmaps

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.969
but Fodmaps are a group of

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.800
short chain and medium chain basically it's different types of sugars and compounds that bacteria that those bad Bacteria in your gut the

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.940
small intestinal

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.499
Bacteria that overgrow they feed off of it, and they'll either what they're going to do is they're going to they're going to produce

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.160
Gases that are [either] going to ferment they're going to cause you to be

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.669
To be gassy and have diarrhea or you're going to cause constipation [you] can't have that with an autoimmune condition

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.559
The Paleo diet is full of Fodmaps full of Fodmaps

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.149
That's one problem it also has night shades in it night shades. Which are a group of

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:29.219
Plants that have compounds in them that can stimulate a leaky gut or a piper permeable intestinal tract

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:37.228
that is another video that I do but my point with this being that the paleo diet is not the right diet for everyone and

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.359
It might help you it might not and I want to let my patients and people that are

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.240
Considering a paleo diet no

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.259
Don't be defeated if you try something like that, and it helps you a little bit

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.249
But you're not better or you go through periods of feeling better and worse or you just feel worse all together

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.569
If there's a reason for it

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:01.139
Here's the diet the best diet let me tell you I can tell you exactly what the best ideas. It's a diet

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.658
That's right for you the diet. That works for you every single person [needs] [to] eat an

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.658
Individualized diet now we can get in the ballpark depending on what we know about your general health

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:19.709
But if you really what we do and I want to get people better. We want to get people better here and

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:27.778
so what we do we can order through Cyrex [laboratories] we can order a and I and I talked about it briefly a

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:30.460
200 food

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.710
Antibody sensitivity panel and basically what that what that panel will tell us is it will tell us

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.329
What foods you're reacting to right now and guess what we're going to do when you get that panel

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.059
We're going to get all those foods out of your diet. We're going to focus on healing your dot healing your digestive tract

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.139
We're going to focus on other priorities that you have metabolically and we're going to see what happens

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.899
They're going to follow up with you now. We're going to we're going to address

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.810
What's left and we're going to keep following up until we work through this problem?

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.119
We may in our clinic we [have] to order advanced

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.219
Diagnostic labs so that we can figure out what's going on if you don't do the right [test]

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:09.989
You can't figure out how to help somebody so you can just do diets

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.599
But listen you're talking about a process that can [take]

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.229
Years to work through to figure out what's going on and sometimes?

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:22.139
[you'll] feel better and then worse and then you're just you just don't know you [got] to order the tests to figure out what's going

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.198
On to come up with the right plan to help you restore your health

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:32.128
I'm dr.. Schaack. I just want to talk about why the paleo diet and really any diet. Is there's not one diet

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:34.169
That works just what diet is best for you?

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.549
I wanted to talk about diet a little bit because it comes up quite a bit. There's this growing trend

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.209
about Paleo with autumn in conditions, [and] yes

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:48.629
It can help it has helped a lot of people because a lot of people have problems with grains and Grains are highly associated with

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.629
With Hashimoto's but there are so many patients with Hashimoto's that have to have cross reactivity

00:06:54.909 --> 00:07:01.139
Basically there are a lot of foods that will react in your body like gluten does which is comes from wheat

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:05.249
And it's in other grains. So you have to look at those cross-reactive foods, too

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:09.629
You can't you can't [just] when you can try it and [see] how you do

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:13.768
But these these generalized diets are actually a lot of people think

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.278
That's going to be the thing that helps them that's going to be the magic

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:20.009
[Bullet] and that the fact is if you try it

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:26.068
and it doesn't work or you your symptoms wax and wane then then you just you're you're missing part of it and

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.110
Don't be defeated

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:35.039
I've just seen that way too many times where [people] become they become defeated and and they lose faith that they can ever get better

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:42.208
You know there is a way that you can best work with your body to help it heal

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:48.028
I'm doctor shook if you have any questions, let me know I appreciate you taking time from your day to learn more about your health
