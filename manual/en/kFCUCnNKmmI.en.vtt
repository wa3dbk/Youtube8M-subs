00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:06.120
I've been making inquiries
with other firms...

00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:09.791
...bigger firms to share
some of the cost.

00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:12.710
They all said no,
said they don't have it.

00:00:14.837 --> 00:00:16.547
We got PG&amp;E by the balls.

00:00:16.756 --> 00:00:20.927
PG&amp;E Hinkley, but nobody'll get rich
unless we pin this on Corporate...

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:23.221
-...in San Francisco.
-What do you mean?

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.683
PG&amp;E Corporate claims they
didn't know about Hinkley.

00:00:26.891 --> 00:00:28.935
They knew. They had to know.

00:00:29.143 --> 00:00:30.895
Show me the document to prove it.

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:37.986
Then they didn't know. If so, we
can't hit them with punitive damages.

00:00:38.194 --> 00:00:41.656
With punitive damages,
it's a sum of money that can...

00:00:41.864 --> 00:00:45.868
...have some effect
on these people's lives.

00:00:47.203 --> 00:00:48.579
So what do we do now?

00:00:53.126 --> 00:00:57.714
Let's assume there are documents
connecting PG&amp;E Hinkley and Corporate...

00:00:57.922 --> 00:00:59.590
...and they know about them.

00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:04.637
We take our 400 or so plaintiffs
and everything you've dug up...

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:07.307
...we file a lawsuit
to provoke a reaction.

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:11.519
See if they offer a reasonable
settlement, or throw more paper at us.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.604
Sounds great. Let's do that.

00:01:13.813 --> 00:01:15.023
There's a downside.

00:01:16.357 --> 00:01:18.818
PG&amp;E will submit a demurrer.

00:01:19.027 --> 00:01:21.279
A list attacking each complaint...

00:01:21.487 --> 00:01:24.324
...claiming that each cause
of action has no merit.

00:01:24.532 --> 00:01:26.701
And if the judge agrees with them...

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.371
...he'll dismiss our case.
PG&amp;E will have no reason to settle.

00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:32.999
Then it's all over.

00:01:39.047 --> 00:01:41.341
So basically it all comes down to...

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.636
...what this one judge decides.

00:01:45.803 --> 00:01:47.388
Basically, yeah.

00:01:48.598 --> 00:01:50.099
Jesus.
