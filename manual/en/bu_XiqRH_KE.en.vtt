I found this cornbread recipe on Savvy Brown's
website. And she actually adapted a recipe

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.930
from All Recipes. I've never been a huge fan
of cornbread because it's always been just

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:20.440
dry and crumbly to me, but this recipe is
sweet and it's the perfect texture.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.490
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Spray or
grease a 9 inch cake pan. I'm using a generic

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:35.850
pam with flour spray. Pour 1 cup of all-purpose
flour, 1 cup of yellow cornmeal, ¾ cup of

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.790
sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt and 3 teaspoons
of baking powder in a bowl. Mix it together

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.630
well
And, you want to make the equivalent of 1

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.370
egg with a powdered egg replacer. I am using
this brand today. This is what my health food

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:03.290
store had. Mix it well and pour it into a
bowl. Add 1 cup of non-dairy milk and ⅓

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.770
cup of vegetable oil or melted vegan margarine.
I'm using Earth Balance. And mix that together.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.380
Pour it into the bowl with your dry ingredients.
And here's where you really want to be careful.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.520
You wanna mix it just until the dry ingredients
are moistened. You don't want to overmix it.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:32.140
It's okay if it has some lumps.
Pour it into your pan and bake it for 20 minutes.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.030
You'll know it's done when you insert a toothpick
in it and it comes out clean

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.990
My dad was the first to try and approve this
recipe. And since then, I've taken it to a

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.249
potluck and everyone loved it. If you try
it, let me know what you think in the comments.
