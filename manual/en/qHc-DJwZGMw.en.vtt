Project: 19 Picnic Table with Built-In Drink Cooler

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Measure and mark off the hole for your drink cooler. Cut with saw. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Repeat for other cooler.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Sand all surfaces and all edges, including inside the rectangular cuts, until smooth. Remove dust.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Apply a light coat of Krylon ColorMaster primer to the wood. This will further improve adhesion and provided added durability. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Paint all structural pieces of the table with Krylon ColorMaster paint. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Spray surfaces evenly, using multiple light coats until you achieve the appearance you desire.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Paint the tabletop and benches with Krylon ColorMaster paint. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
To achieve a glossy finish, spray the tabletop and benches with Krylon ColorMaster acrylic crystal clear gloss. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Carefully drop both coolers into the rectangular holes and enjoy.
