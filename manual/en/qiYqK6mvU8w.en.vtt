00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.500
Hi, I'm Olga with Grocery Coupon Network and
today I'd like to talk to you about a really

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.429
cool new app called Ibotta.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:19.660
Ibotta is new on the scene and it's an app
available for smartphone phones like Android

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.190
and Apple phones.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.110
And it's a fun and easy way to earn real money
back on your favorite products.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.190
So real quickly a couple good things to know
about Ibotta is it's actually real cash that

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.870
goes into your PayPal account after you purchase
items that are listed as Ibotta offers.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.190
And this is you know, real cash goes into
your PayPal and into your checking accounts,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.840
not a coupon or a discount on a next purchase
so that's really nice.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.289
It makes it unique.

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.829
It's really easy to use and it works it over
24 major retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target,

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.960
Walgreens, CVS and they're adding new stores
all the time.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.580
And it's fast and easy.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.270
It's full of your favorite products.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.270
Its' secure.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.159
They don't have your e-mail address or anything
like that.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.390
So the first thing that you would need to
do in order to start using Ibotta obviously

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.280
is to download the app and we'll have that
information available for you.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.630
And let's take a look at it and I can show
you a little bit about what it looks like

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.150
and how to navigate it a little.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.399
So I'm just gonna pull up my Ibotta account
on my phone here and the first thing that

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:44.119
you'll see when you go into Ibotta is what
looks like shelves full of offers from Ibotta.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.880
So I have here you know cereal and pasta sauce
and all sorts of different things that you

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.880
can get.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.829
And you'll notice that under each one it'll
say an amount that you can earn.

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:03.579
And the way that you earn things with Ibotta
is by watching videos or learning facts or

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.200
other little things.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.009
So let me click on one of these.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.640
I'll click on this offer for Raisin Bran.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.950
You'll see there's two little things that
look like kind of tokens down here and each

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.669
one has an amount, $0.25 and you can earn
$0.50 back.

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.639
That's the max you can earn back on this product.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:30.579
So you'll see on the little tokens it'll say
something like you know get nutrition info,

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.199
so it'll give you the nutrition info.

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:36.890
You just hit you know read and earn and it
adds that one to your account.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.940
And this other one is a recipe that you can
make using raisin brand.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:48.940
So you just click on read the receipt and
now you have that offer loaded in Ibotta and

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.620
you can go and redeem it at the store and
then earn $0.50 back on that product.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.739
So if you wanted to see what stores you could
redeem this offer at, there's a little redeem

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.000
right over here in the corner.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.329
And here it lists out all of the stores that
I could go to, to buy that Raisin Bran and

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.220
get credited that $0.50.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.250
And if I click on one of the stores, CVS,
it'll show all of the products that I have

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.200
loaded right now that I could redeem at CVS.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.250
So you'll see Raisin Bran is on there.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:30.169
I also have corn flakes and pasta sauce and
diet coke and all sorts of things like that.

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:38.070
So once you have gone to the store and purchased
the product you would come back to your Ibotta

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.190
account.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:51.630
Click on this, all right up here and then
you would click on redeem and if I went to

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.670
CVS I go right back to that page and then
I would click on upload receipt.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.510
And when you click on upload receipt it'll
give you a little scanner and you're just

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:09.009
going to scan your register receipt, you scan
the whole receipt and it does account for

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.750
long receipts, you just take multiple pictures.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.320
And once you're done with that you scan the
particular item in and then you submit your

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.900
receipt to Ibotta and they will get back to
you within 24 hours and let you know whether

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.910
or not your offer was accepted.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:35.720
Now I've used Ibotta quite a few times at
the store and it's always worked out great

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.720
for me.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.850
I have had no problems using it.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.930
I also you know haven't had problems scanning
my receipt or anything like that.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.320
So just a few tips when you're using it.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.151
Offers can sell out so if you do have an offer
available in your Ibotta account that you

00:04:53.151 --> 00:05:00.650
would like to use I would suggest doing the
little activities to load the offers so that

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.970
you don't lose them because they will disappear
as people use them and the amounts of your

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.060
offers can change.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.510
So you know keep an eye on that.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.640
You can coupon as usual when you're using
Ibotta so you can use a manufacturer coupon,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.590
you can use a store coupon, whatever kinda
coupon you usually do at your regular store

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.600
you can still do while you're using Ibotta.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.210
It doesn't support any device without a camera.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.530
You can go to Ibotta's site to see all of
the different phones that are supported.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.780
There's also a like and dislike option on
items so if there's items that are loading

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.670
to your Ibotta account that you know that
you're not gonna use, you can give them a

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.670
thumbs down.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.340
Or if you really like an offer you can give
it a thumbs up and Ibotta will start customizing

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.860
the offers that are sent to you based on that.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.780
What else?

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:03.230
Let's see, oh one other thing that's important
to know, say there was a Capri Sun one in

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.440
there for Capri Sun juice boxes.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.870
I can do that offer once with Ibotta.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:16.620
So if I have, if I'm buying like two Capri
Suns I only get one credit back from Ibotta

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.770
for that.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:25.000
And at the same time I go to the store and
I'm buying my Capri Sun and I bought other

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.340
items and then I get back and I'm loading
my receipt and I see oh, Ibotta just loaded

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:36.800
a new offer for a new product that I happened
to buy at the store, can I still submit that?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:43.150
You can only submit it if you've already loaded
and the Ibotta offer arrived on your phone

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.210
before the timestamp on your receipt.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:53.340
So you can't go back and look for old receipts
and say, "Oh I just bought those Rice Crispies

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.340
two days ago.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.340
Can I still use it?"

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.990
They won't let you do that but it is a really
great app.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.960
I've had a lot of fun with it.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.090
I've earned like $15.00 back on it and I've
only used it four times so that's pretty good

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.500
because I'm couponing on top of that and saving
more money.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.750
So take a look.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:19.180
You can visit our grocery coupon website for
more information on Ibotta and links to download

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.180
the app.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.689
Hope you enjoy it.
