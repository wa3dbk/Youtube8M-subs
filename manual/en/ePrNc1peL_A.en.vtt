00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.140
 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.670
The art of centering, which
is the practice of coming back

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.586
into the present
moment, isn't something

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:28.710
you just do with your head.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.430
It's always something in
which the body and the mind

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.670
join together.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.950
So there's no state of
flow for the surfer,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.790
if they're just
watching a surfer movie.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.460
They have to be
on the surfboard.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.720
And same thing with
a skier, or a dancer.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.102
So just become aware
of your breathing.

00:00:46.102 --> 00:00:48.230
Be aware of your breathing.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.960
Don't change your breathing.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.192
It's like you're allowing
the part of your mind

00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:53.150
to rest on your breath.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.687
 

00:00:55.687 --> 00:00:56.395
Normal breathing.

00:00:56.395 --> 00:00:59.840
 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.210
The reason I have my
hands in front of me

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.770
is to let your hands,
let your awareness,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.965
become fully present
in your hands.

00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:12.310
 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.330
For the sake of this video,
I'm keeping my hands here.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.380
But your hands, if you're at
work, could be under your desk.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.862
And I'll show you in a
moment that you don't even

00:01:22.862 --> 00:01:23.820
have to use your hands.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.880
You could just use two fingers.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.540
As you're breathing
in, just gently

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.785
stretch your hands apart.

00:01:31.785 --> 00:01:34.320
 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.760
As you're breathing out,
press your hands together.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.835
And notice that
there's a subtle change

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:42.866
of sensation in your hands.

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:47.767
 

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:48.850
You could close your eyes.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.359
But again, closing our eyes
in a centering practice

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.650
is like saying, oh, I'm going
to do something different

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.820
than every day life,
whereas what we want

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.280
is to learn to center in
everyday life, anywhere.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.720
So obviously, don't be
sitting with your hands

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.169
doing what I'm doing
right now in public.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.220
But first, get the idea
of it, breathing in,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.320
stretch the hands apart, feel
the subtle change of sensation.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.320
Breathing out,
press them together.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.250
 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.720
Focus on the sensation in
your palms for a while,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.460
for four breaths, three breaths.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.440
 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.950
And then switch your focus.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.230
Focus on the sensation in
the backs of your hands.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.212
 

00:02:38.212 --> 00:02:39.980
But coordinate it
with your breathing.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.600
 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.940
You'll notice that
you're getting quiet.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.530
And if your eyes are open,
even though they're not

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.800
focusing on anything,
you'll notice

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.500
that there's an
ability to be taking

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.590
in your whole environment.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.990
Your ears are taking
in the sounds.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.980
And this subtle sensation
of change in your hands,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.075
coordinated with your
breathing, is the focus.

00:03:09.075 --> 00:03:11.940
 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.300
And your mind is simultaneously
open and spacious.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.460
Now suppose you don't want
people to see you doing this.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:28.460
Just watch my fingers,
breathing out, breathing in.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.470
Breathing out, breathing in.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.150
And I'm letting my awareness
sink into my hands.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.685
I'm feeling the space in here.

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:40.175
I'm feeling the sensation
on the inside of my thumb

00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:42.700
and the inside of my
fingers and index finger.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.100
And there is subtle
change of sensation,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.026
just with that movement,
coordinated with the breathing.

00:03:49.026 --> 00:03:52.400
And so this movement
can become something

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.730
you do, just with your arm
draped down under the table.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.450
And the conversation gets
a little too disturbing,

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.300
and you find yourself
getting too engaged,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.740
too pulled in in a
business meeting.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.320
Just sort of put your
hand down, out of sight.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.460
Put your breathing out.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.600
Hands, fingers coming closer.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.430
Breathing in,
stretching them apart.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.050
Three breaths.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.660
 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.500
Four breaths.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.020
 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.995
And you will feel
yourself quiet.

00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:32.870
And as the mind gets quiet, then
your own deeper intelligence

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.370
has an opportunity to step in.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.250
Your intuition clicks in.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.840
You see things
clearer and you can

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.240
respond in a more
appropriate way.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.100
So this is another
practice for centering.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.430
Sometimes you'll feel
almost like an energy moving

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.210
in your hand, or
between your hands.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.040
We don't really need that.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.061
All we need to notice is that
subtle change of sensation.

00:04:59.061 --> 00:05:00.560
So again, this is
something you just

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.320
practice until it becomes
an instant cue for lowering

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.720
your arousal level,
less emotion,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.450
less agitation because
of your thoughts.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.350
It's a good practice.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.340
I teach it to all my groups.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:29.002
