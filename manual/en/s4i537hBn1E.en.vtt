00:00:01.036 --> 00:00:03.726
[Lauren:] When I Live Central,
I just bleed bronze and blue.

00:00:03.886 --> 00:00:05.416
I love it here.

00:00:05.416 --> 00:00:06.926
I'm Lauren Capel
and I Live Central.

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:10.086
Living Central to me is
being involved on campus.

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:12.706
It's making UCO a part
of your daily life.

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.626
If I'm not on campus for class,

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:17.156
I'm there for a meeting
or an event.

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:20.176
Having this wonderful, beautiful
campus was the first thing

00:00:20.746 --> 00:00:21.726
that drew me to UCO.

00:00:21.776 --> 00:00:24.946
My mom and I got here
and I said, "Mom,

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:26.266
this is where I want
to go to school.

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.136
Look at this campus.

00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:27.796
It's beautiful."

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:29.186
[Anthony:] I think
that the environment

00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:31.566
of the campus is
very very beautiful.

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:34.756
I'm Anthony Anderson
and I Live Central.

00:00:35.416 --> 00:00:38.176
It's one of the best places
I've seen for a campus

00:00:38.306 --> 00:00:39.806
and it's eco friendly.

00:00:40.326 --> 00:00:42.936
It's probably one of the
best places I've been.

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:45.386
Just to see how well
it's taken care of,

00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:47.456
it just changes your attitude
about the rest of the day.

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:49.806
As a freshman, I never
thought I was going to be

00:00:49.806 --> 00:00:51.156
as active as I am now.

00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:52.996
I just really wanted
to play football.

00:00:52.996 --> 00:00:55.916
That's what my passion
was, but being part

00:00:55.916 --> 00:00:58.396
of Central helped me find
more passions in life

00:00:58.396 --> 00:00:59.486
which I really appreciate.

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:02.506
[Allex:] There's so many
different things going on here.

00:01:02.506 --> 00:01:05.496
I'm Allex Tarr and
I Live Central.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.346
The opportunities
are so abundant.

00:01:08.346 --> 00:01:12.856
It's just, from everything
from offering work study

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:15.696
and then our three-hundred
plus organizations.

00:01:16.036 --> 00:01:18.146
You can create your
own organization here

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:18.806
if you want to.

00:01:18.806 --> 00:01:22.946
I think the teaching staff
here at UCO is phenomenal.

00:01:23.256 --> 00:01:24.466
They will help you.

00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.776
You don't have to
make and appointment

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:29.356
to make an appointment,
to talk to their assistant

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:32.306
to their secretary and
then maybe talk to them.

00:01:32.476 --> 00:01:35.066
If you need to talk to
them, they're always there.

00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:37.296
[Ramsey:] The unity
amongst the students

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:38.996
and faculty is pretty
incredible.

00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:41.546
I'm Ramsey Payne
and I Live Central.

00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:45.216
Living Central to me means
just being surrounded

00:01:45.216 --> 00:01:50.306
by a great community of teachers
and professors and students,

00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:53.306
along with just the
opportunities

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:54.586
that Central has to offer.

00:01:55.046 --> 00:01:57.536
You're still a part of the
Oklahoma City metro area,

00:01:57.536 --> 00:02:01.416
so you've got everything from
the small town activities

00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:04.826
and going to get a burger, to
going to downtown Oklahoma City

00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:06.716
to the River Walk and
catching a Thunder game.

00:02:06.916 --> 00:02:08.836
It's just a lot of
fun on campus and off.

00:02:09.076 --> 00:02:13.676
[Desiree:] It's a great
place to be a part of.

00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:16.486
I'm Desiree Maw and
I Live Central.

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:19.146
When I found UCO, I just
said to myself, "Wow."

00:02:19.376 --> 00:02:21.986
Not only did I make the right
choice on coming to UCO,

00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:25.276
but I definitely see now, in
my Junior year of college,

00:02:25.276 --> 00:02:28.446
that the last two years have
just been amazing for me.

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:31.456
This is not only a
smart investment for me

00:02:31.456 --> 00:02:32.966
and for what I have
to live off of,

00:02:33.216 --> 00:02:36.426
but it has so many opportunities
that I can be a part of.

00:02:36.606 --> 00:02:40.136
Being someone who prides
themselves in the bronze

00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:43.526
and blue everyday no matter
what you're doing, where you are

00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:46.446
and just being prideful of that
is what Living Central means

00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:46.846
to me.

00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:48.346
How will you-

00:02:48.346 --> 00:02:48.936
[Ramsey:] How will you-

00:02:49.196 --> 00:02:49.546
[Lauren:] You-

00:02:49.546 --> 00:02:49.916
[Anthony:] You-

00:02:50.156 --> 00:02:51.606
[Allex:] How will
you Live Central?
