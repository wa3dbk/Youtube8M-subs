00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.889
so glenn beck apparently came new york
over labor day weekend and had a

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.420
miserable time

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.959
uh... but he says he can stand new york
anymore

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:14.239
all he talks about is one assumption
after another

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:19.369
he says people treated rudely ever said
anything to me never says they said an

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.340
unkind word at all

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.519
but he got the sense from their looks

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.650
he said he would do a barbecue place
that was minority l

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.679
and he was treated very chablis thought

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.760
uh... first he wondered if it was
because he was white

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.350
but he looked around and so there were
other white meat

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.870
julie poisonous four of the story in say

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.920
you thought of minority owned barbecue
place in new york was nutri whites badly

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.800
what why because they don't like
customers they'd like to go bankrupt

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.610
i mean come on man of the craziest
substance

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.820
if they're black well of course they
don't like was but it turns out my dot

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.840

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.100
isn't really white okay

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.469
and could be it's because they recognize
his glenn beck i think you're a raging

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:07.550
hassle

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.049
could that be etc

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.219
and finally they've been doing want to
you

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:13.220
he keeps talking about how

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.109
people spoke

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:15.100
curtly

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.290
and put down his

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.760
food and beverages roughly

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.540

american airlines

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.320
and i've got some quotes for it

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.280
first choice is quote

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.579

liberal american airlines apparently

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.860
line with the background and say you're
not logged

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.880
did the pilots say you're not well into
the flight attendants say you know no

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.939
he just didn't like the way the flight
attendant was looking at them

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.200
and didn't like the way he spoke

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.950
began began saving ru defense that no

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.310
my flight attendant merely barked a word
breakfast when he came to me went others

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.380
were politely asked that they care for a
t_v_ eat and given the choice is i was
