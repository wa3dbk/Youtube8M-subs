00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.760
I studied in Cuenca, Ecuador.  Amman, Jordan. Frieburg, Germany. It was a great

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.900
experience! With my language skills I did not

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.400
think by any means that i would be where
I am today. I know for a fact that I

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.480
improved phenomenally while I was there.
You're just immersed in language!

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.840
You really just have to learn it and be on your game the whole time.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.739
The Summer Language Abroad is a grant
offered through the CSLC. You can pick

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.790
really anywhere in the world to go and
study a language in an intensive

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.390
environment. One of the best parts about
the SLA program is that you you kind of

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.170
go on your own. It's not a study abroad
program where you go with a large group

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.830
of Notre Dame students. It gives you an
opportunity to really figure out who you

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.809
are. Before you leave you take a test
that kind of gauges where you're at with

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.379
the language and then when you come back you take the same test to see how much

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.720
you've grown. When you're actually
over there you do a blog to keep posts

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.310
on how you're doing, what you're learning and also to take pictures and put those up.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.030
Taking classes abroad is very different than taking classes here at Notre Dame.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.090
When you take classes abroad and you learn things about the language and then you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.210
go back home and you're able to use
those things it really just speeds up

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.320
the language acquisition process. When
you go abroad you can learn a lot from

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.869
your classmates and your teachers but
what's going to be important is being

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.830
out in the world and really knowing how
to interact that way. My last day there I

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.159
got on the train and this woman was in
the car with me and she just told me her

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.549
whole life story in German. It was
awesome! I've made the most of that

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.759
experience and I'm really happy that I
did. There's a lot of stuff that you

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.270
really can't get out of the textbooks.
You can stay at Notre Dame for four

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.859
years and study the language but there are some things that really are just going

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.929
to slip by if you don't get over there. I
didn't think I could achieve the things

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.920
that I achieved during my summer in Ecuador.  I absolutely see this as a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.749
part of my life in the future. I've been
striving for a career abroad or a career

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:05.249
somewhere where I can continually use my Spanish. Academically with my language I

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:08.600
mean I feel a lot more confident in my
classes at

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.210
reading and speaking. I mean after one
month I can go up to a Jordanian guy in

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.650
a shop and just shoot the breeze with
him. Without that grant, I mean, I

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.240
couldn't have done that. For the SLA
grant, part of it is to write a postcard

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.710
to the person who donated all the money
to your grant. Which is just really a

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.470
great way to thank the donor until I
tell them a little bit about what you're

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.810
doing and how important this trip has
been. For me words can't say how much

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.910
this trip has meant to me! Danke.  Shukraan. Muchos gracias a mi donor.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.630
Everytime that I talk about this grant to
anybody I am always pushing for them to

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.590
apply for it and I just can't talk about
without having a smile on my face.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.380
It was absolutely the best month of my life!
