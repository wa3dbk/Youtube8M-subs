00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.140
Vitamin C is critical to your child's good
health and strong body.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.680
And you'll be happy to hear that it doesn't
take a lot of meal planning to make sure your

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.170
child gets the recommended dose.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.670
We're Quality Catering for Kids, and we know
all the reasons Vitamin C is important:

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.840
--It strengthens blood vessels, which means
fewer bruises and scrapes.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.320
--When children do fall or get a nasty cut,
it forms scar tissue and helps wounds heal.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.640
--Vitamin C promotes healthy bones and teeth.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.370
--It strengthens the immune system because
it helps in the production of white blood

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.370
cells.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.810
Here are fruits with the highest sources of
Vitamin C--foods kids love.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.520
If you're not familiar with all of them, why
not experiment to see which one's your children

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.700
like most:
Cantaloupe

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.260
Citrus fruits and juices, such as orange and
grapefruit

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.040
Kiwi fruit
Mango

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.240
Papaya
Pineapple

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:08.190
Strawberries, raspberries, blueberries also
loaded with anti-oxidants

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.640
And Watermelon

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.960
Exactly how much Vitamin C do children need?

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.020
For children ages 2 and 3, about 15 milligrams
which is the equivalent of about a quarter

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.670
cup of cantaloupe.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.720
For children ages 4-8, about 25 milligrams.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.530
And for kids 9 to 13, 45 milligrams a day.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.340
For example, one whole orange provides a whopping
69.7 milligrams of vitamin C, more than what

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.299
a 13-year-old needs!

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.370
The good news is that you can incorporate
Vitamin C into your children's diet not only

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.580
at mealtime, but at snack time, too.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.100
Here are some ideas:
Three medium strawberries

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.100
One-quarter cup of pink grapefruit
One-quarter cup of red pepper slices

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.410
At Quality Catering for Kids, our typical
lunch provides an average of one-half to 100

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.260
percent of the dietary guidelines of Vitamin
C for children in the child care centers and

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.619
pre-schools we serve in Wisconsin and Illinois.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.820
