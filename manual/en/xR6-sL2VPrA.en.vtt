00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.580
pretty incredible study that was done by
axim while it was published in the

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.060
american journal of uh... preventative
medicine

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.140
as all know a lot of fast food chains
are trying to do something to revamp

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.730
their image like mcdonald's for instance
mcdonald's was ideal suffering a p_r_

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.990
nightmare after supersize me so they
wanted set provide healthier options for

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.550
people who want eve healthy uh... well
this study that was conducted indicates

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.360
that they have really done much there
are adn what nick muffins are doing much

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.940
for your health ob so let me tell you
how the study was done uh... that

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.640
researchers looked at eight different
fast-food chains between nineteen ninety

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.470
seven and twenty ten uh... ending judge
to using the u_s_ department of

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.519
agriculture is healthy evening in tax
and it's a hundred points scale based on

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.510
three different things were riding a
foods even intake each major food groups

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.460
and also intake of fat cholesterol and
sodium says you guys know hundred-point

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.790
scale

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.690
found was that al when it comes to uh...
whether or not they approved fast food

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.390
menus only increase their nutritional
value

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.110
find three points in the last fourteen
years from forty five

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.840
two forty eight

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.389
that movement in progress

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:11.009
as bush resentment for art i was
actually a little surprise about this

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.220
because you know mcdonald's has like

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.560
than the crap and you know they have but
i thought that the egg whites would make

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.909
a difference they don't make a
difference at all that you only save

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.060
about fifty calories which is the big
deal in fact uh... let me give you some

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.000
specific examples of how fast food
chains tried to you know switch things

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.530
up so with the atlanta lightweight
muffin it contains thirty four percent

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.810
of an adult's dehli sodium intake and
only fifty fewer calories in the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.340
original mc nothin ahmed also it comes
to the green wrapped chicken mcgrath

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.330
it's upto almost six hundred calories
and forty four percent of your

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.760
recommended daily fat intake

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.400
so small know that look

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.440
deeper the apple or something else on
the menu

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.310
you think it happens in our body got
that part of the amount for made

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.890
but he never treat me with the wraps
this a fried chicken and the profound

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.979
serrated is all the stars that's why i
order it this friday there was this

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.810
morning they are going to make them
seadrill dot t_ seo uh... psat and ap

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.970
croquet whatever wanna straight and act
like they install has the mark fuhrman

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.629
she is in the

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.260
whatever that hamas its

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.319
but you know that wiping sounds pretty
delicious you know it doesn't

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.770
now i really like my app

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.370
cyano idea both with indictment

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.230
everywhere quinnipiac like and that the
end with him

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.840
uh... this we really did

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.110
i have one of those for breakfast way
approaches such things that so when i

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.689
believe you is that picnic mulford
annotated she's pissed

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.759
makes sense for white car to relieve of
course setup

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.950
well the solution of ninety-one edward
on the sale of your

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.269
yes on the palestinian islamic dot also
came out with their own mail right and

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.040
was it

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.249
we'll sit down at the end of this

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:02.189
five to get the big investigator
leveraged uh... want to know that has

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:06.349
more sugar than a snickers bars there
literally better obviously goes by no

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.079
but look at mister becomes the president
a department of defense rebels were that

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.180
you could tell offended

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.219
if you have snickers bar ok five
prisoners bar is not practice

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.500
have excel heroes like at least a meal

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.690
anydvd filled more from it and you mind
i get hungry make the next seven minutes

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.960
so you make somewhat of a fair point
because a snickers fire has almost no

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.280
nutritional value unless you know you
count the peanuts as protein and even

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.530
know how much printing it out

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.540
but you know i use without mail you have
some rain

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.359
uh... and you know it

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.859
i guess you can consider that a male but
let so there is the worst possible thing

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.529
you can put in your body sugar speeds up
the aging process of course it's

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:50.839
horrible when it comes to developing
diabetes it's not good so i have

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.409
counter-argument cavemen didn't have
much sugar

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:54.949
delivery along

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:56.529
i appointed sugar

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:59.219
i repressed them one active men

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:00.479
creativity

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:01.189
uh...

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:04.659
on your own a lead making arguments like
this

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:05.839
most rational man in america
