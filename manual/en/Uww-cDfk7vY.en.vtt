00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.359
Good morning John, you may have heard that
we are in the middle of something of an environmental

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:05.359
crisis?

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.960
Climate change, Oil spills, Dead zones, Garbage
patches, Meltdowns, Mass extinction.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.309
The root of all these problems is people.

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.309
Us.

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.110
You and me and Jacques Chirac and everyone
watching this video and everybody they know

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.730
and everybody who's ever made a movie with
Kevin Bacon.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.720
The environmental crisis that we currently
inhabit, was created to satisfy the needs,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.230
or at least the whims, of humans.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.260
So the question becomes given the marvelous
beauty and tremendous value of these biological

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.960
systems that, as far as we know, are unique
in the universe, are we worth it?

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.019
Would the world be better off without us?

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.980
Is humanity and our culture our civilization
our technology just an asteroid bearing down

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.260
on the planet destroying everything in its
path?

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.269
Basically 'Should I feel bad for existing?'
is what I'm asking.

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.569
My suspicion is that most people don't spend
a lot of time worrying about this, but I do

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:56.589
and I've come to the conclusion, after years
of thinking about this, that we're worth it.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.239
I might be biased towards humans, being one
of them and all.

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.039
But in the same way that the complexity of
the natural world is beautiful and marvelous

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.600
and as far as we know unique so is the technological
world and the psychological world and the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.660
sociological world.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.140
There's something really marvelous about humanity
that is really easy not to notice when you're

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.280
inside of it all the time.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.330
I've heard people say 'Yeah, sure humanity
is the smartest, but cheetahs are the fastest,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.010
blue whales are the biggest and barnacles
have the longest penises.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.320
It's all completely subjective, it's about
what trait you choose to put value on.'

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.320
But I don't buy that.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.980
I think those people probably know that there
is something different, something special,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.980
about people.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.770
The scale on which our brains have allowed
us to create.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.410
Everything from tiny little ideas to the Burj
Khalifa.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.410
We create!

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.800
We've created cultures and atomic theory and
Bridget Jones's Diary and Star Trek and Honky

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.800
Tonk Music.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.750
All of these tiny units of seemingly ceaseless
complexity and order, it's extremely valuable

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.750
and unique.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.080
We are not an asteroid, even if in the end
and I hope we don't, we have the same effect

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.620
on the biodiversity of the planet.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.240
Witnessing the scale humanities achievement
and our creation and the interaction of that

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.310
with the natural world and the way that it
allows us to understand the natural world,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.129
that's the closest I get to spiritual.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.890
It fills me with awe and joy and wonder and
pride.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.010
Yeah, we have done things for which I will
never forgive us, but we create more than

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.010
we destroy.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.549
That's gotta be the goal, to destroy less,
and to create more.

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.239
To increase awesome and decrease suck, that's-
that's what I believe in.

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.390
That is what I believe, and that, I think,
humans ultimately are pretty good at.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.810
And are getting better at.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.879
John, I'll see you on Tuesday.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:36.879
Endscreen!

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:37.879
Few things going on.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.480
One: CrashCourse Psychology starring me, has
just launched on youtube.com/crashcourse,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.209
if you wanna check it out, we're going to
be using our minds, to explore our minds.

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.500
Two: I promise this time I'm coming back to
hankgames, cause it's been johngames for a

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.500
long time.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.480
Multiple videos per week, including pikmin
3 and hank and katherine play super mario

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.480
brothers U.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.879
Three: If you haven't heard already, DFTBA
Records, our merch company, needs a bigger

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:01.879
warehouse.

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.510
So we're leaving our old warehouse and moving
to a new one, and we would rather not take

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.819
all of our old shirts with us.

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.299
So we're selling them for ten dollars apiece,
which is about half of what they usually cost.

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.040
A bunch of them have sold out but there are
many more that are not sold out.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.200
There's a link in the description to all of
the things that are on sale, or just go to

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.200
dftba.com.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.499
If you've been holding back, this is the time.

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:21.499
Okay!

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.140
Thanks for listening to me rationalise why
humans should exist.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.140
Okay!

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.290
That's it, for real this time.
