Tyrone Spong

00:00:03.471 --> 00:00:05.805
Q:Tell us about the fight.

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:13.098
I broke my right hand in the first round and couldn't do what I wanted and so I lost.

00:00:13.098 --> 00:00:19.406
But I think I gave the fans an exciting show. I'm smaller than Jerome,

00:00:19.406 --> 00:00:40.653
but I was able to put the pressure on and I think we had a good bout. The bout itself was very good.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:18.303
Q:What was your strategy before the break?

00:01:18.493 --> 00:01:28.685
I didn't have one. I was going to go with the flow of the fight and keep the pressure on.

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:34.221
But because I had to fight with a broken hand early on, I had trouble concentrating.

00:01:34.221 --> 00:02:09.082
My cornermen asked me if I wanted to stop the fight and I said I wanted to fight to the end and I made it through three rounds.

00:02:49.894 --> 00:02:56.092
Q:How hurt is the hand?

00:02:56.092 --> 00:03:05.234
The doctor sais it's broken. I have no idea how long it will take to heal. As soon as this interview is over I will go to the hospital and have it checked.

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:30.266
Q:Lebanner was quite tough and wasn't knocked down the entire fight.

00:03:30.266 --> 00:04:02.878
In the third round I had an opportunity to KO him, but since I was fighting with one hand, it's too bad, but I couldn't do it. It was bad luck. LeBanner has a strong heart, and he fought smart. That's why he wasn't downed.

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:33.089
Q:When exactly did you get hurt?

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:48.688
Right at the beginning. At the second punch. I wasn't able to make a fist and so I knew immediately that it was broken.
