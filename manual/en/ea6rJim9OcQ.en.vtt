00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.430
Hello MyFarmers.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:35.460
We’re in the lambing shed which you might
remember from a few months ago when we had

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.160
lambing season and today it’s another hive
of activity, it’s shearing day Mark?

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.559
A really busy day, what’s going on?

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.640
What’s going on is we’ve got about 430
ewes in here and fattening lambs that need

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.660
their wool off.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.440
We’re taking the wool off for welfare reasons
– we don’t want them to get fly strike.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.489
It’s a very, very busy day – early start
for me and weeks and weeks of preparation

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.460
to get to this one point where we can get
all of the flock in and it’s been raining

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.070
a lot lately and they like to shear dry sheep,
so they all came in over the weekend and they’ve

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.360
all been put in here and this team of lads,
these New Zealand boys come in – they’re

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.970
the professionals they get it done and they’re
really good, really efficient, good with the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.709
sheep and it all happens in one day, hopefully
by mid afternoon we’ll get it all finished.

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:25.980
Okay, not that it’s a race because we’re
going to compare it to stuff we did with Simon

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.319
hand shearing the sheep and things but 430
– what time did these boys get here – how

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:32.319
quick will they get through?

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:37.420
They started about 7.00am and I imagine they’re
going to finish mid afternoon so I think they’ve

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.390
taken about a minute per sheep, they’re
going a little bit slow because they’re

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.390
horned sheep.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.119
These are the guys you want doing this kind
of job, they do it all year round, they follow

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.369
the fleece round the world so they’re the
experts and I just pay them and we know them,

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.470
they’re trusted and they’re good with
our animals.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.509
Is there any sort of special kit they bring
with them, you see they’ve got all the electric

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.330
shears you can probably hear that buzzing
away in the background and things but is there

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.819
any special kit they bring with them other
than their expertise?

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.099
They’ve got a little bit of a transformer
thing going on because this is actually a

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.240
trailer that comes behind their truck.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.800
They bring it in, jack it up, the wheels come
off and then everything just falls out and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.090
it’s ready to go.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.610
You’ll also notice that they’re wearing
special trousers?

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.370
The trousers actually help them to move the
sheep around and they’re wearing moccasins

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.269
as well and sometimes they wear a big strong
belt which helps to protect their back.

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.370
Rather them than me to be honest – it’s
hard, hard work.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.650
They’re worth every penny.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.849
They also bring a lady with them who wraps
and rolls the fleeces for us and they go into

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.000
these wool sheets here – they pack about
50 fleeces per wool sheet then pile them up

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.290
all nice and neat.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.540
It’s one of them days I really, really enjoy,
because there’s a lovely atmosphere around

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.920
the farm today, everyone’s coming around
photographing it and when it’s done you

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.180
can breathe a sigh of relief for the year
– finished.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.489
There’s a real buzz around I mean we’ve
sort of killed it a little bit for MyFarm

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.632
for the music and things – they’ve got
like heavy rock music and stuff going on so

00:03:02.632 --> 00:03:03.632
they can get a real pace going.

00:03:03.632 --> 00:03:10.400
It’s quite a well oiled machine – you’ve
got quite a few people here – there’s

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.489
a couple of your farm hands helping to bring
the sheep through.

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.909
I actually have one of my volunteers Andrew,
who only comes in this day – he will not

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:19.909
miss shearing.

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.359
He books a day’s holiday from his firm – they
let him have a day’s leave and he rings

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.556
us weeks in advance ‘can I come and do the
shearing’ and he’s been doing it about

00:03:27.556 --> 00:03:32.150
five or six years now and I just leave him
and he takes control of it – he’s in charge,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.389
so once I get everything in I hand it over
to the experts really.

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.599
I just oversee it from a distance.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.420
Are there any considerations, like what is
the worst thing that can happen – we talked

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.930
with Simon about nicking the sheep and things
and I’m guessing with the electric clippers

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.370
it’s a little bit more than a nick?

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.310
You can get a nick – we have antiseptic
sprays on hand and we can stitch any cuts.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.140
These are really good – these are expert
lads and if one’s nicked we are prepared

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.849
to deal with it but they’re going pretty
good.

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.010
They’re taking their time with them.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.709
They are taking their time because they’re
rare breeds and horned but they enjoy coming

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.760
here as well because they get to see different
breeds of sheep.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.250
Yes with the different things we’ve seen
- I’ve seen some of these guys with the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.080
Oxford Downs and they are big animals and
the MyFarmers voted for them.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.990
Does it make a difference which sheep you’re
shearing?

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.550
I think it does.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.660
The way they hold them in their legs with
the horns – it’s complicated for them.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.590
These guys are used to doing up to 700-800
sheep in one day but they’re all one breed,

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.330
so they’re uniform, they get used to it
and they get a routine.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.020
But I think this maybe sharpens up their skills
a bit as well as they do see different breeds

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.970
and even these shearers take photographs of
our MyFarm flock because they like the different

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:47.970
breeds.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.120
That’s the other thing with the welfare
thing about we don’t tail and dock and now

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.770
we don’t castrate our young lambs – I’m
guessing that makes it more difficult as there

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.770
are more bits to shear?

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.620
There are more bits to shear they’ve all
got long tails now, the ones that naturally

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.200
have long tails, and then we’ll have to
see next year when we do the shearing – we’ll

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.980
have our entire ram lambs so we’ll see what
difference that makes but I’m sure we’ll

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.270
cope – there’s lots of work goes into
this before the actual day and if we’ve

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.670
all done our work over the last couple of
weeks with dagging and getting them tidy,

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.480
all the lambs have come off now, they’ve
all been weaned it’s one of them days that

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.020
you really enjoy but you’re glad when it’s
over but you can see the atmosphere yourself.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.020
It’s a good atmosphere.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.020
It’s good fun.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.660
One last thing – what happens to the wool
– where’s it going?

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:41.150
Today we have a few ladies in who are sorting
some of the fleeces and we’re going to do

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:49.210
a little project where we may have some balls
of wool coming back into the shop for people

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.200
to knit with and we have a lady in our Stable
Block, Vanessa, she comes down and buys some

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.200
fleeces and then the rest of it goes off to
the Central Wool Board.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.250
The days of… the old thing in the old days
was that your wool cheque paid your rent for

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.370
your smallholding.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.140
I hate to say it but I just look on this as
a by product – I want it off them for welfare

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.630
reasons, I send it off and it barely pays
for the shearing.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.770
Not lucrative then?

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.750
It’s not lucrative at all and that was true
in the old days – it paid the rent on the

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:28.350
smallholding for a year.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:57.510
You’re a busy man Mark, we’ll let you
get to it.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:18.720
Yep, thank you very much, we’ll get on.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.370
Thanks.
