00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.219
in the seventeen hundreds, at the end of the eighteenth century there was a prison

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:26.000
up beside

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.890
Chrstchurch, up beside Cornmarket

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.049
and it was a debtors prisons and it was called the black dog

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.500
and there was a fella called

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.590
Olocher was lodged in the prison and Olocher was sentenced to be hanged

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.150
so the following morning when they went
into his cell to find him

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.040
they found he was gone ahead of them and he was dead

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.170
for he'd taken his own life with a
knife he'd found somewhere and he'd jsut

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.930
cut his throat

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.189
and bled to death. And so there was a hullabaloo

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:57.639
and there was an investigation. They wanted to know how he had killed himself

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:01.810
because he was sentenced to death the law was the law and that's all there was to it

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.540
they could not find what had happened

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.790
So the following night or a couple of nights after that

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.650
the steps, there used to be steps up from cook street up to thomas st

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.580
and was a sentry at the top of it

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.760
and the sentry was found on the ground

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.780
and he was paralysed down one side, and what he said was a black pig had

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.170
attacked them, a very large black pig
had attacked them

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.610
well the good man was taken away and another sentry sent in his place

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.610
and then the next thing is the sentry
that had replaced the man at the top of

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.610
cook street steps went missing

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.470
they went up to look for him and all they found was his rifle standin there

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.600
and his shirt draped around the rifle

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.320
and everything else belonging to him lying on the ground. So the story was

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.960
the pig most have attacked him

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.250
and must have devoured him as well

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.490
and on it went like that and the pig started to be reported  as

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.070
attackin single women around the city

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.740
and a woman was in a court one day and
she swore

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.590
that she had lost the shawl

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.050
to the Dolocher she said

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.290
And ever after that the black pig was known as the Dolocher

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.390
Now the fella that

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.460
cut his throat was Olocher

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.300
so they said it was the ghost of Olocher was going around the place And Olocher

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.479
 was now attacking women because he
had been sentenced for the death of a young woman

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:21.569
so they decided one night a crowd of men
in a pub they decided that they'd all turn

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.580
out and they'd kill every pig they could lay their hands on

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.520
all over the place place and by a
process of elimination they reckoned they'd get

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.689
the black pig

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.059
the dolocher

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:35.529
so they went out to kill the pigs and there was slaughterin and there was blood and there was screeching

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.620
roaring, poor animals being attacked and dispatched

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.929
and they were left lyin on the ground

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:43.049
But a really strange thing happened then

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.650
for the following mornin

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.019
when they came out

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.669
there wasn't a pig nor a carcass

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.610
nor any sign of the dead pigs to be found anywhere

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.059
up or down down the streets

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.200
so the thing got worse and worse and
worse and they searched and they searched and they

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.169
searched

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.619
But so intense was the searches

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:02.649
that the attack started to fall off

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.620
days started to grow longer

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.599
and there was more light

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.969
and the attacks fell away so they thought maybe they had killed the black pig and they had killed the

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.619
dolocher and there was no more about it

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:14.859
Until a woman

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.269
was going by fishers alley down by wood quay and she was dragged into the darkness

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.540
once the dark evenings had come again, and again it was a black pig

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.340
and then

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.310
this attacks from the dolocher started
again and people started to get worried

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.659
and frightened

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.369
and one wet and windy night

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:34.469
a blacksmith came in from out of town
and he was drinkin in winetavern

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.949
street . And when it came time for him to go home

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:40.730
the night was too wet and he got a lend of a coat but it was a woman's coat and he

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.109
draped it around his shoulders like that

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.620
and he was stepping out but it was still too
wet so somebody for a laugh

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.040
stuck a hat on his head

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.109
and it was a woman's hat he had on his head

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.689
so now he had a woman's hat and he had his head down like this against the

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.629
wind and the breeze, and the

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:56.960
wetness of the night

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.340
well he wasn't gone terribly far when a
black pig leapt out of the shadows

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.349
attack them and started to go at him

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.849
But if a blacksmith has anything he has
a fine fist

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.939
and he has an even bigger fist on the other side for a spare, so he clattered into the

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:12.900
black pig

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.489
out of self defense and down went the black pig on the ground, and when he had him on the ground

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.549
he gave him a couple of kicks

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.520
and the black pig was squealin and squealin and he started to shout sayin

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.689
the dolocher is here the dolocher is here

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:26.960
Well people turned out

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.400
And they didn't exactly rush up but they were happy enough that he was got

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.570
so they moved up a bit and then they were there and they took a few

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.009
kicks at him themselves, and when they were going to move him didn't they

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.949
find that the pigs skin, the black pigs skin fell off a man

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.880
they discovered that they knew him

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.750
and they discovered that he was
somebody with a hand

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.610
act

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.679
and part in the whole thing

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:50.500
For he was the sentry

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.569
that had stood on the top of the steps
of cook street

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.379
and he was the sentry that had owned the shirt and the gun that was left on its own

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:59.949
and when he had vanished

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.729
and he was also be said before he died
the man that gave the olocher the knife

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.039
that he used

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.479
to cut his own throat

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.399
on the night before he died

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:12.430
and he was also

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.030
for good measure the leader of a gang that gathered up

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.759
all of the pigs that were slain

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.600
and tucked them down around the corner

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.989
the schoolhouse lane

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:23.960
and sold them around the markets

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.729
then after that

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.440
and so he died and so ended the story of the dolocher

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.779
but to this day if you walk around this area at night

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:39.779
and the wind blows and the lights flicker, you might think the dolocher is still about

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:44.340
old

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.590
did
