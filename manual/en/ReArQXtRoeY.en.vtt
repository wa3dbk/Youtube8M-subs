00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.589
This event,

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.059
this special gathering of the whole
University is a tribute to what all of 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:09.159
you do everyday

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:14.230
to make Harvard, and the world a more
sustainable place.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.680
It's a tribute to the scientific
discovery taking place in our labs,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.720
and in our classrooms

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.700
a tribute to the strategists

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.320
and the policy architects

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.330
who work in our centers and out in the
field.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.390
And a tribute to the leadership

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.400
that thousands of you have shown,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.309
by living your lives with an awareness

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.700
that each of us has an obligation

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.790
to the future

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.450
of the planet.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.310
We at Harvard must be a model,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.640
as we demonstrate

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.290
our commitment to the future,

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.660
as we affirm our belief that the
discoveries of science can enable us to

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.760
change the world,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.440
and as we unite the knowledge and
passion of this community

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.520
in service,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.659
abroad, and essential goals.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.440
I can think of no better way to
launch our new greenhouse gas reduction

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.020
initiative

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.770
then with the person,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.980
the nobel prize committee called the
single individual who has done the most

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.610
to create greater worldwide
understanding

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.460
of what needs to be done to combat
global warming.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.700
Our distinguished alumnus and friend Al
Gore.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.700
(CLAPS)

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.030
We teach with what we do, as well
as with what we write,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.189
or what we say.

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.380
How we light our classrooms, how we heat
our water, how we build, and

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.739
ventalate our laboratories

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:05.490
all send powerful signals.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.339
But some of the most important changes
must take place at the individual

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:16.119
level, in the choices each of
us makes in our energy use

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:18.579
and consumption patterns.

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.889
Every person at Harvard student, faculty,
staff,

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.629
can contribute to the effort,

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.170
to avert the frightening outcomes

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.339
that sciences are predicting.

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:40.179
We are all teachers and we are all
learners in this endeavor we must do it

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.639
together.
