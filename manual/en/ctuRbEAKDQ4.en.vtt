00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
♫ Background choir music ♫

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.660
Look around you today.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.519
As you leave this place you are most
decidedly

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.159
not alone.

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.310
We can accomplish great things as
individuals but it

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.490
takes our entire community to do what's
necessary in this country.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.760
During our First Year Orientation,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.020
we were reminded that we are
not alone.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.860
We were told that none of us is as smart as all of us.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.180
We were told that some place in this audience were our lifelong friends

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.660
who would change our lives forever.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.280
[People laughing, talking]

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.379
I am best version of myself when I am at
Brandeis.

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.419
♫ Choir music ♫

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.760
There is much you take from your time here

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.540
but most of what you take is each other.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.880
♫ Orchestra ♫

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.700
Class of 2014! 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.440
[Cheers]

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.010
Today you are graduating from

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.470
one of the most prestigious institutions
in this country.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.880
Just by saying you have a degree

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.880
from Brandeis, people will think you are
really smart.   

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.920
[Audience laughter]

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.000
Remember what you like best about
yourself here at Brandeis

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.590
and stay in touch with that person - the
person you, became the person you are

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.890
still becoming. 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.500
Unlike any other school, Brandeis is
not just a diploma

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.040
on your wall or an artifact of your
Facebook network.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.060
It is a life philosophy.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.040
While every other school is the best four
years in your life,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.180
Brandeis is timeless.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.660
Calling this place home

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.960
in the deepest sense of the word and for
the rest of your lives,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.790
that - more than anything - is what it
means

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.750
to be a Brandeisian.  

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.720
God bless and Godspeed the Class of 2014.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.380
[Cheering]

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.560
God bless you.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:45.040
