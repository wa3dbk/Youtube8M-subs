Did you know that honey actually has smoothing
and brightening qualities? My name is Keeley

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.330
Selvage with Keeley Skin Solutions, and I'm
going to show you how to make a honey and

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:17.250
egg mask. You want to start with a small bowl,
I have one egg cracked open in the bowl. The

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.460
egg is excellent, if you want to use the whole
egg that's great for normal skin, if you have

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.819
dry skin you want to use the yolk only, and
if you have oily skin you want to use the

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:34.219
egg white. So I have my little whisk here
and I'm going to whisk away, whisk it good,

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.789
and you want to do it until it's blended well
but it's not frothy, we're not making merengue,

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:51.789
we're going to whisk it. And we are going
to add a little bit of vinegar. Vinegar has

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.289
excellent skin enhancing qualities, and we're
just going to use just a quarter teaspoon

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:08.920
of it, there we go, and then we're going to
use a teaspoon of honey; honey smooths, brightens,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.549
it's excellent to use for the skin, it's also
nourishing and moisturizing, so we're going

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:24.931
to put it in there, and I also like to add
a drop of lavender, it's just going to make

00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:32.710
it smell good, and lavender is great for dry
skin. If you have oily skin Bergamot is excellent

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:43.729
as well. So I'm just going to whisk it, there
we go, and it's a beautiful egg mask, but

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.909
it doesn't smell bad, it smells wonderful
like lavender. And you can put it on with

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.039
a facial brush that you can get at a beauty
supply store or you can actually take your

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.789
fingers and smooth it on too. Let it sit for
10 to 15 minutes, bask in a warm bath, what

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.820
have you, and your skin will be toned and
tight and refined. My name is Keeley Selvage

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.660
with Keeley Skin Solutions, and that is how
you make a honey and egg mask.
