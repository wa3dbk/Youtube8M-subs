00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:07.509
Some of the tools you are going to find invaluable
in growing garlic or just about anything,

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:15.170
is the garden fork, which is seen, excellent
for turning the soil over or harvesting the

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:27.510
garlic, you are going to use that. Incorporating
the cover crop. The rake for smoothing the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:40.300
bed out. Incorporating cover crop seed. This
giving you a nice surface to plant on to.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:50.190
The hoe, the Collinear hoe. The one I like
to use has a very small blade. It allows you

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:04.690
to work standing up, the long handle. You
just slice the roots when they are young.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.310
The earlier you can get weeds, before you
see them even. The quick cultivating is a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:20.600
lot easier than pulling out big weeds later.
And another thing I like to use, especially

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:30.360
in the garlic where the rows are close together
is what I call Little Bo Peep, but I am sure

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:41.070
it has some other name. It's nice for going
down the row. I use it to mark out the rows

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.210
so that I can plant in straight rows. Then
you come back later and it is great for getting

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:58.640
in between there. Then in between the plant
after the plant comes up. It goes nice and

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:11.800
deep. It will go 8 inches deep just by pulling.
Also has a little copper rivet that gradually

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:20.200
wears off and adds a little bit of copper
to your soil, which is essential micro-nutrient.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:29.490
Just over time using it, that wears off. It
provides about all the copper you really need

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.120
in your soil.
