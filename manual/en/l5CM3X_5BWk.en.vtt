00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The days of loud motorcycles with growling exhausts

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
may now be a thing of the past,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but eco-friendly motorcycles are a thing of the future.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Hailed as one of the most amazing inventions 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
by Time Magazine,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the ENV hydrogen fuel-cell motorcycle,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
developed by Intelligent energy and Seymourpowell's product design

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is a benchmark in alternative fuel sources.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Have a look at the video.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Intelligent Energy is an international power systems company

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that has created world-class hydrogen fuel-cell technology.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What exactly is fuel-cell technology?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It is an electro-mechanical device

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that converts hyrdrogen into electricity and heat.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Basically, this technology allows us to use hydrogen

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
as a clean power source.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Intelligent Energy's ENV motorcycle

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
is essentially a silent motorcycle

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that emits pure water vapor.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Its top speed is 50 mph

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and can run for 100 miles on a tank of compressed hydrogen.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The sleek ENV, which stands for Emissions Neutral Vehicle, 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is lightweight and responds like a mountain bike.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Intelligent Energy's fuel-cell technology

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is an incredibly important technology for our future.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Not only will it free society from having to use fossil fuels,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
it will also solve today's difficult environmental and energy supply challenges.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The ENV motorcyle is just the beginning,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and could represent a new era of hydrogen fuel-cell automobiles

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and other modes of transportation.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Through this power source, all of our motorcyles and cars

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
would essentially be zero-emission vehicles,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and it will be a step towards a cleaner and more sustainable planet. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
More importantly, the fuel-cell technology

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
is capable of powering larger objects,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
such as motorboats or small properties.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This might be our main source of energy one day.
