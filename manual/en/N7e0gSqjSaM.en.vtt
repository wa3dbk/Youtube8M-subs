00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.540
last month we talked about how the coke
brothers are finding florida state

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.760
university what they would do is they
would give flowers state university's

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.440
huge grants hundreds of thousands of
dollars

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.420
and they would specifically fund like
the economics department right and they

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.920
would do that so the economics
department would be simply pushed bear

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.500
specific ideologies

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.840
now part of the uh... rule

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.500
olds over in part of the world's in the
contract

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.609
albany

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.719
this you know signed it with the cult
brothers was at the cult brothers would

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.489
have the ability to basically screen all
of that candidate candidates for

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.750
professors right consult if

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.129
the university's thinking about hiring
someone in the economics department

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.319
they would first have to check with the
cookout is insignificant others think

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.949
about it

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.700
now does this candidate support the free
market

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.620
izzy a capitalist what you think about
taxes

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.050
that kind of thing then we talked about
this what we all agreed it was egregious

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.499
and disgusting

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:00.290
a florida state university basically
backed up

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.990
uh... and defended themselves al when he
came to the situation they said look we

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.049
need the funding

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.909
we wanna keep up professors on board we
don't want to cut programs and this is a

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.960
great way duit right along

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.120
marvelously corrupting you poor future
baton absolutely appeared at the end it

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.150
let me just notice

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.430
they denied that there's any corruption
involved they denied that uh... you know

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.800
the coke brothers are trying to
influence their economics department

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.870
they deny all about but of course
they're gonna deny that okay and they're

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.150
taking hundreds of thousands of dollars

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.400
in you know in money from

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.619
uh... are hundreds of thousands of
dollars from the coke brothers

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.610
and they have to the fact that there's
no way in hell they didn't like it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.880
well we took the hundreds of thousands
of dollars in

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.420
you know were allowed to companies to do
and how they want we sold out they're

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.330
never going to say that

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.700
so um... the chronicle of higher
education the ag give us an update on

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.130
this story today and add a published
article called not just florida state

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.460
and in that article they list other
universities in the u_s_ that are

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.320
influenced by the cup brothers and those
universities include at clemson

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.969
university george mason university

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.010
utah state university and west virginia
university

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.160
in some cases these universities
received up to it figures in donations

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.480
from the coke brothers

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.969
this is realistic eachother yes cell
that slam sanctified

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:24.309
if i have the opportunity to wear a
t_-shirt from one of these universities

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.589
i would probably turn it down not
because i just like the students isle of

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:29.769
students write but because

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.799
in these universities are allowing
themselves to get corrupted add by the

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.639
influence from the cockpit if it were
closing

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.610
sir okay to be specific i can wear that
but

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.379
but this is our first look at it wasn't
so schools

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.050
was not only know so far carrasco c_s_

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.890
uh... that would that we know so far and
as i mentioned some of the schools are

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.590
getting

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.090
and eight figures for instance i george
mason university has received uh... a

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.000
total of ten million dollars from the
charles g coke foundation okay and in

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.340
the contracts as i mentioned a specified
that the coke brothers need to screen

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.179
the professor's before they get hired

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:11.209
the administrators abuse university say

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.399
any

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:15.859
but it doesn't matter it's not like
they're gonna turn away professor that

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.010
doesn't agree with their ideology which
is absolute

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.510
bullshit what is creating a humanitarian
thing remove exactly and it's like

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.100
having the hiring process like

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.299
we're going to underneath an interview
for this and for this position

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.749
but no one i have used in the job anyway
support of the interview

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:35.299
it's both of them but it's obvious that
one of those basic absolutely on the

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.009
screen handsomely why would they care to
screen

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.369
at all in favor of plan on influencing

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:43.759
um... the decision made by the
administrators in the uh... econ

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:44.620
department

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.180
you know so there's no question in my
mind difficult brother to try to

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.310
influence the schools why would they
spend

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.200
millions of dollars in doing this

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.830
you think they're just doing it for
finding gain shits and giggles that's

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.010
not the way it works okay they want free
george mason teamster double-dip

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.939
fifty cell and look at my office and
made this point out that this is one of

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.179
our employees he made a point about how
this is a vicious cycle of cake

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:12.239
the coke brothers support politicians

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.010
that are willing to cut funding for
higher education

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.870
those politicians get elected okay they
cut higher education funding

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.159
okay they privatize are public schools

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.819
and then the coke brothers as citizens
universities are desperate for money

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:30.060
income the cult brothers and say that i
got this money you know they here wave

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.050
it in their favorite up on them

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.490
uh... is activated but one day this
money

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.640
under these conditions as they know what
they want to support my people are

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.170
things with the support from the from
government to go but i have everything

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.690
bill because it will be in this

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.530
governor to do that because they're not
controlling that he was doing to make

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.240
you do that if they do that

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.259
rather like and i want that bother about
butts

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:51.360
take the place of

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.969
where government was helping

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.270
particular institutions or or

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.099
unique any organizations that have any
any governmental they want to be that

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.519
that the the thing that's going with the
with the dems duro that's a great racket

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:09.899
what to do it idea i can't think
everything yeah let's not let's get rid

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:12.199
of the governments or corporations can
take on

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.240
and that's already happening in every
single aspect of american culture at

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.639
this point so

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.099
you know all we need to stand up and
fight against this and in the second i

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:21.240
if i found out

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.720
