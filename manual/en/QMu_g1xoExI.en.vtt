00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.400
Today well be taking a look at the Yakima
DoubleDown Ace 4 Bike Carrier for both 1-1/4-inch

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.660
and 2-inch hitches, part number Y02451.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.579
Here at the shank of the bike rack youll notice
the adaptor for 2-inch hitches.

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:18.600
To remove the adaptor, using the included
Allen wrench well remove the Allen bolt here

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.620
at the bottom of the shank to remove the adaptor.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.300
Now our shank is ready for 1-1/4-inch hitch.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.990
Today well be using a 2-inch hitch so well
go ahead and reinstall the adaptor.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.060
Now here at our hitch, well go ahead and slide
our bike rack shank into the hitch lining

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.730
up the hitch pin hole.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.069
Youll notice that the DoubleDown Ace has an
attached hitch pin.

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:44.409
This hitch pin has a ball at the end giving
you the confirmation when the pin is installed

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.320
that its locked into place.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.839
Now here on the back of the shank on the mast
of the bike rack, we can then turn the knob

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.739
securing our anti-wobble device to the hitch.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.440
Here on the knob youll notice Yakima used
one of their SKS lock cores to lock and unlock

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.510
the knob.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.290
When the knob is locked, the knob will turn
freely although will not turn the anti-wobble

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:59.130
device preventing the bike rack from being
removed 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:13.750
from 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:29.060
the hitch.
