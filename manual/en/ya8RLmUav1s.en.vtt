Sawasdee-krub!

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.400
Hey there Food Tube. It's me, Dheeradon.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.139
You remember me? I'm the winner of

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.400
Jamie Oliver's search for a cocktail
star over at Drinks Tube.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.220
Yeah!

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.160
Today I'm in Food Tube land. I'm from
Thailand so

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.509
today I'm gonna be cooking you guys a
very authentic

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.740
Thai dish. It's called the tom-kha-kai.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.140
A very, very aromatic soup

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.820
with Thai essential herbs. You need to try it.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.989
Tom-kha-kai. Tom means soup. Kha means galangal.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.289
and kai means chicken. First

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.390
lemongrass. For this recipe we might need like

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.770
3 lemongrass sticks. Roughly chop them.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.850
Click out the tough outer layers.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.859
The bottom part. Normally you guys would just like bruise it,

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.100
gonna show you how we do it in Thailand
slice them

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.400
really really really thin. Really, really pretty.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.220
Next, the galangal. Thumb size.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.040
Not my thumb size. Like a larger one.
This one's

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.799
looking good. Skin it. Galangal is in the
same family as

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.409
ginger. It gives like tangy, tangy, tangy taste.

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.540
You slice it into really, really thin
slices

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.229
then that's just about 1 cup of

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.290
coconut milk,

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.230
and then we need equal parts water. That should do it. We don't want to waste anything here.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.000
It's precious. We're going to put that

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.050
on a medium heat. Once it's on the heat

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.090
you're just gonna stir the broth, because you don't want the coconut milk to split.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.820
A pinch of salt. In goes

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.010
mister lemongrass and mister galangal.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.380
There you go. Give it a nice swirl.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.290
Next we're gonna prep the chicken. I'm
using chicken thighs.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.640
Use anything you like. Chicken legs,
chicken breast.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.270
But chicken thighs give you much more
robust flavour.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.720
Chop it into bitesize pieces.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.260
The soup is now just like gently gently boiling

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.170
not rapidly boiling.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.500
So now we put our chicken into our soup.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.750
Just give it a wiggle. Gonna wash my
hands

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.610
While the chicken is cooking

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.970
we're going to prepare our mushrooms. A big

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.050
handful. Chop in into whatever size

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.090
you guys fancy. If you wait till the
chicken is cooked

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.630
and then you put your mushrooms in then
the chicken would be overcoooked so

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.580
now gonna put my mushrooms in. I'm gonna put in my kaffir lime leaves

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.410
but this is a tip from a Thai dude. You
must

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.590
not chop your kaffir lime leaves. You see
the natural line there

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.350
that's where you tear it, and there.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.500
Just tear it, and then the flavour comes out

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.760
much more. Trust me on this one. Yeah.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.310
Let it simmer for about two minutes. It's looking really, really, really good. One final

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.930
thing before I take it off the heat

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.340
is to season it with fish sauce. Two tablespoons.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.320
Give it a little stir.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.980
Taste it. That's fine for me.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.100
So, we're gonna take it off the heat and
then

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.860
We're gonna put it in a bowl. This smells
really, really, really good.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.640
Here's where the lime and chilli comes in.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.550
So, catch any pips and seeds.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.660
Finally you can't live without the chili.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.910
I'm putting seeds in yeah, but you guys can leave the seeds out

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.190
if you're not like into hot food that
this is, Food Tube.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.360
Really like spices though. The colours are really, really good. The greens, the reds.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.640
Really really nice, and then final touch.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.700
Some coriander. A handful.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.900
Roughly chopped.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.200
And there you have it guys.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.120
The authentic tom-kha-kai.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.240
It's so good. It's so so good. You get the spiciness from the chili,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.510
counteract with the er, coconut milk so please try!

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.470
