RS Video Community tips for new players

00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:12.184
So, you've just started playing RuneScape. Big, isn't it?

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.832
But with these few pointers, we hope to make your first days
on RuneScape a little bit easier, however you choose to play.

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:21.354
We're members of RuneScape's YouTube community, and these are our tips.

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.371
First things first - check your connection

00:00:31.592 --> 00:00:34.024
Always make sure you have a good internet connection.

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.001
You wouldn't want to log out when fighting a tough opponent!

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.121
If you don't want to get lost, check your world map.

00:00:45.156 --> 00:00:50.320
By clicking on the world icon, you can open up
the map. This map displays the whole map of RuneScape.

00:00:50.355 --> 00:00:54.548
By double clicking, you can set a marker. After the
marker has been set, now it will appear on the minimap.

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.884
This way, you'll never get lost again.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.098
Want to get around quickly? Activate your Lodestones.

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:10.006
Try to activate all the Lodestones you can. Not only are they free teleports,
but most of them don't have any requirements, so it's an easy way to travel.

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:12.802
There are seven free to play Lodestones in the following locations.

00:01:12.837 --> 00:01:13.978
There's one in Lumbridge,

00:01:14.013 --> 00:01:15.113
Al Kharid,

00:01:15.148 --> 00:01:16.338
Draynor Village,

00:01:16.373 --> 00:01:17.545
Port Sarim,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.552
Falador,

00:01:18.587 --> 00:01:19.641
Varrock,

00:01:19.676 --> 00:01:20.689
and Edgeville.

00:01:20.724 --> 00:01:25.229
Those are the free to play Lodestones. None of these have any requirements.

00:01:25.264 --> 00:01:27.512
Now for the remaining eight members' Lodestones.

00:01:27.547 --> 00:01:28.607
There's one in Ardougne,

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:29.552
Catherby,

00:01:29.587 --> 00:01:30.585
Yanille,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.856
Seers Village,

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:32.864
Taverley,

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:33.824
Burthorpe,

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.175
Lunar Isle (this one requires you to complete Lunar Diplomacy),

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.062
and the Bandit Camp (this one requires Desert Treasure).

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.078
Remember: your basic tools are on your toolbelt

00:01:45.095 --> 00:01:50.367
New players are supplied with basic tools on
their toolbelt, which will help you get started.

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:56.126
The belt includes tools such as pickaxes, hatchets
and various crafting and fishing tools.

00:01:56.161 --> 00:02:02.534
Back in my day we didn't have no fancy toolbelts.

00:02:02.614 --> 00:02:09.293
We had to carry everything in our inventories, yeah...

00:02:10.928 --> 00:02:14.821
Now it's time to use those tools: kill cows and tan hides.

00:02:14.856 --> 00:02:17.994
When starting out, try killing cows and tan their hides.

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:22.018
Not only do you get combat experience while doing this,
you also earn a nice amount of money.

00:02:22.053 --> 00:02:28.050
A good place to kill cows in free to play is at the farm
north east of Lumbridge. Then go to Al Kharid to tan the hides.

00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:33.958
For members, it's suggested to kill cows at Taverley. Just north
of the bank, there are some cows and a tanner next to it.

00:02:34.812 --> 00:02:38.907
Now sell your hard earned items, head to the Grand Exchange.

00:02:40.135 --> 00:02:46.564
If you need to purchase a specific item, then head on over to the
Grand Exchange, which is located just north west of Varrock's west bank.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.573
The Grand Exchange is home to about anything you
could ever need to finish a quest or just train a skill.

00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:57.413
So now you're ready to go on an adventure

00:02:58.414 --> 00:03:07.029
Hello, most of you aren't beginners but if you are... do quests,
it's as easy as that. They give some pretty sick rewards.

00:03:07.064 --> 00:03:13.228
"For slaying the fearsome Elvarg I give you a Rune Platebody."

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.788
"Thanks."

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.854
And then once you're done with all the quests, there shouldn't
be a thing on RuneScape you won't know about. Happy questing!

00:03:21.588 --> 00:03:25.326
There's more to do than skilling and questing

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:28.719
Don't be afraid to try new things in RuneScape.

00:03:28.754 --> 00:03:31.494
So if you don't like one thing, you may like something else.

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:36.557
There's Smithing, Fletching, Prayer, Melee Combat,
Range, Magic, Agility, Thieving,

00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:41.513
Hunter, Mining, Fishing, Woodcutting, Castle Wars,
Soul Wars, Duel Arena, Mobilising Armies, wh-what?

00:03:41.448 --> 00:03:43.202
I think they get it.

00:03:43.437 --> 00:03:44.432
But I didn't name everything yet...

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.345
There are loads of different things to do in RuneScape.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.972
Keep your variety open and have fun with whatever you want to do.

00:03:50.867 --> 00:03:54.542
Keep your account secure

00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:59.694
When you first start out, you should head over to the
Stronghold of Player Safety near Edgeville.

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.685
It will teach you the best ways to keep your account and personal details safe.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.469
While you're down there, you might find some nice rewards.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.748
If you still need help, then head over to our help pages.

00:04:16.791 --> 00:04:21.204
You can get more tips and advice by visiting the official RuneScape forums.

00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:34.389
also be sure to check out the new RuneScape Support YT
channel. Links to both of these can be found in the description.
