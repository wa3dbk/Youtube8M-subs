When you're buying a catfish, what you're
looking for is, again, something like any

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.980
fish, something that doesn't smell too funky.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.750
You really want it to be nice and actually
have virtually no smell at all.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.199
They are bottom feeders, so when gutting them,
you may get a little bit of a smell.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.100
But, honestly, your fish should always be
nice and clean.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.690
It should feel smooth, never too slippery.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.250
Some of the stuff on catfish, though, you
will get, like, a little bit of his goo.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.190
That's just stuff you can scrape off with
the back of the knife.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.220
That's really not a big deal.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.310
What else you're looking for is something
that has really nice gills.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.850
You can see that those are rally pink and
reddish and really beautiful.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.240
They really have some nice color to them.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.710
That's always a good indication.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.790
Also, with their eyes, you want to make sure
that they're somewhat clear.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.969
If they're a little foggy, that's OK.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.680
You just don't want them to be gray or completely
opaque. you want to see the pupils.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.150
You want to see some nice black, rich, pupils
there.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.650
That's pretty much what you're looking for
with catfish.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.250
Great ways to prepare catfish; traditionally
corn meal, deep fry, nice po-boys, catfish

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.009
po-boys, stuff like that.

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.500
Always really really good.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.730
You can also saute it in a pan.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.090
Oil, butter, some herbs, things like that.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.330
When it comes to catfish, I'm kind of a fry
guy.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.650
I kind of like it nice and crispy and really
nice and juicy on the inside.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.979
That's some ways you can prepare it.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.240
Good places to purchase fish are places, kind
of like having that old school neighborhood

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.970
butcher, some sort of fish place that's, like,
a nice market where they can get fresh fish

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.810
and they sell it.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.720
Every city's got a good one, or more than
one, really.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.429
And you can do... you're just going to look
for a good fish monger.

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.390
If you're not sure, you can always, pretty
much, do Google searches of where you can

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.060
get fresh fish and some places should pop
up.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.700
Just try to avoid pre-cut stuff that's sitting
in a supermarket, frozen, or flash frozen.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.370
You really don't know how long it's been there
or how old it is.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.700
You're better off really trying to get in
a place where, like I said, getting to know

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.080
your neighborhood butcher, getting to know
your fish monger is someone who, the more

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.019
you get to know him, the more you'll know
how frequent their fish is moving and what

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.879
you're really looking for.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.180
That's really, pretty much, one of the best
ways to do it.
