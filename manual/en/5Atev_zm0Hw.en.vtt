00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:05.340
hello everyone and welcome to the mine
versus mine video demonstration for our

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.739
cool new build in a box plugin

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:12.919
build in a box add special ender chests
which went activated will allow players

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.150
to quickly and automatically construct
a building

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.130
using these chests buildings can be
locked, unlocked

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.009
carried and then placed again

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.359
as you can see here i've created a basic
house

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.320
the first step is to create a build in a
box out of it

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.030
to create a build in a box make sure you
have an ender chest sitting on the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.780
ground

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.300
use a wooden axe to select the area
and then use the save command to save

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.300
your build

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.500
there is no limit on how many build in a
box items you can create

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.910
you can list available builds to see
what builds are available and to verify the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.650
recent build with the list command

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.610
now we have successfully created a house
build in a box, the build can be given to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.610
players using to give command

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.110
by default build in a box is configured
to slow you down when you are carrying

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.040
the build

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.920
as you can see here i have the slowness applied.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.920
this setting can be disabled in the
plugin configuration

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.280
when the chest is placed a preview of
the build will appear very briefly

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.979
if you're happy with the preview right
click to build box again to start

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.430
construction

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.529
construction times will vary based on
the complexity of the build

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:39.699
once the building is completed you will
receive a message letting you know

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:49.099
you can lock the build so no one can pick
it up by double right-clicking the

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:56.099
chest

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:01.809
to pack the build back into the box
double left click the ender chest and

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:08.809
demolition will begin

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.619
upon completion you will see an ender
chest on the ground containing your

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:25.469
build ready to be deployed somewhere else

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:29.059
it is important to point out that any
items you havein chests and furnaces will

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:33.329
be saved into the build however any new
blocks placed inside the build will be

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:40.029
left behind

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:47.029
as with all of our plugins nearly every
aspect of this can be configured

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.909
documentation can be found on the build a box bukkit page linked in the description.

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.239
that it for build in a box. we hope you
have as much fun using it as we did

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:11.239
building it.  If you like these videos
