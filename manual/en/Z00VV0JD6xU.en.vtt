00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.330
Hi, I'm Ken and we're here in the Crutchfield
video studio today with the AVN726E navigation

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.850
receiver from Eclipse.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.160
The three things I want to focus on in this
review are: navigation, Bluetooth and iPod

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.070
compatibility, and finally, the incredible
picture quality.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.690
First off, though, I want to mention the warranty.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.350
Any Eclipse stereo purchased from Crutchfield
comes with a 3-year manufacturers warranty,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.550
instead of the usual 1-year warranty.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.500
Now that's a statement of how well these stereos
are designed and built.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.280
Just register your stereo on Eclipse's website
within 30 days of purchasing at Crutchfield.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.190
Let's talk about the navigation system built
into this stereo.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.750
First off, it has all the standard features
you expect: text-to-speech directions, so

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.430
it calls out street names while your driving;
over 16 million points of interest, which

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.870
is actually quite a bit more than most nav
units; and the easy updates via SD card.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.470
Now let me tell you what sets this nav system
apart from other stereos with in-dash navigation.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.170
It's a flash memory based system and it has
a fast processor.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.840
So it plots your routes in the blink of an
eye and access those 16 million points of

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.960
interest quickly.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.670
By far the thing that this Eclipse stereo
has over all the other in-dash navigation

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.180
stereos, and most portable nav units too,
is the detail of the display.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.591
You see, this navigation system was designed
by a company that started out in the video

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:37.310
game business, and because of that expertise,
the map graphics are sharper and more detailed

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.540
than most.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.729
And you get unparalleled representations of
many major cities.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.100
The major landmarks and buildings are recreated
in 3D, so you can get a real visual guide

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.570
for where you're driving.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.510
Now we move on to Bluetooth.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.020
Hands-free calling is a stereo feature that
is in increasing demand as more states regulate

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.850
cell phone use in the car.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.409
So we're happy to see it on this stereo.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.740
You can make and receive calls, of course.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.759
And it also streams audio from phones or other
Bluetooth capable devices.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.290
That means you can use this stereo to listen
to music or podcasts stored on your phone,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.959
or even streaming music services.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.959
The included external microphone helps your
callers hear you, because you can mount it

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.180
wherever you want for the best audio pickup.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.650
iPod control comes in the form of a direct
USB connection.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.199
Just plug in your iPod's cable and you can
control your iPod from the stereo.

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:37.599
You can access your music and playlists just
like you would on the iPod itself.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.019
If you have an iPhone or want to play videos
from your iPod on the stereo, then you'll

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.749
need Eclipse's optional iPod video interface.

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:52.160
But either way, whether it's audio or video,
you'll bypass the iPod's digital-to-analog

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.579
converter, and take advantage of the better
converter in the stereo.

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:02.329
That means better sound from your music and
better picture from your videos.

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.120
Something I haven't talked about yet is this
stereo's high-caliber video performance.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.559
Picture quality is not an afterthought on
this machine.

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:14.120
Eclipse's well known for building stereos
that deliver top-notch sound.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.669
They put that dedication into the video aspect
of the stereo as well.

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:24.960
First off, it has a 7" QVGA monitor, plus
Eclipse doesn't use a D/A converter for the

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.469
video circuit.

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:32.400
So you'll get the best signal from your source,
whether it's a DVD, a disc filled with DivX

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.279
files, your iPod or other mp3 player.

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:39.530
And that means you get the best possible picture.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.040
And those are the highlights of the Eclipse
AVN726E navigation receiver.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.219
It combines great sound and great video playback.

00:03:50.219 --> 00:04:01.869
