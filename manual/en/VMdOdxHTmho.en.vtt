00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:11.170
So an easy way to do a nail design if you
don't have confidence in your hand-painting

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.160
skills, is to use tape.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.930
In the past year or so people have really
gotten into this and it's because it's a very

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:25.820
simple, easy way to do very clean, intricate
designs or something very simple if you wanted.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.250
Number one rule when doing a tape design is
to make sure that your base coat is completely

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.250
dry.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.870
It cannot be tacky whatsoever.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.040
The tape you want to be able to push it down
as hard as you can, because if you don't do

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.579
that, the paint that you put over it will
go under the tape, and it will leave a messy

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.830
line and nobody wants that.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.110
So make sure that your base coat is completely
dry, and then I'm just going to show you guys

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.360
a really simple way to do a nice striped look
on your nail.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.579
I use painter's tape.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.740
I find that's the best.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.390
I'm sure you can use masking tape.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.970
I wouldn't suggest duct tape, that would be
too much.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.640
Scotch tape even, would probably work.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.060
But we are just going to go ahead and cut
some really thin lines with this tape and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.060
then set them aside.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.290
And try to make them as even as possible.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.940
I'm going to go in a diagonal fashion across
my thumb.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:39.540
Let me just cut maybe, seven or eight of these,
as straight as you can.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.869
The great thing about using tape to do a design
is that if you're not good enough at using

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.420
your left hand when doing nail art, when you
put tape on it you don't have to worry about

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.420
that.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.810
You just paint over it, and the tape does
the work for you.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.630
It's very lovely.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.770
Okay, so now just take your tape and just
lay it over.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.560
Like I said, I'm going to do diagonal.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.560
Push it down.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.750
Make sure that you get all the way to the
edge of the nail and then, I just like to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.040
kind of squeeze in that crease right there.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.250
Just make sure you have it on there as good
as possible.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:56.150
Then another one right next to it.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.300
You know if you mess up, you can always just
take it off and put it back on again, simple

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.990
as that.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.760
You know I've also seen a lot of people use--
I'm not exactly sure what you would call them,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.810
but when you have a lot of papers in a binder
and you want to reinforce the holes on the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.810
paper?

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.569
Those little stickers, you can use those and
put them on your nails.

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.040
You can use any kind of sticker, I guess.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.730
Stars, whatever you want.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.840
Have some fun with it, get creative.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.680
I mean go to, not just an arts supply store,
but an office supply store.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.319
You can find lots of stuff to use on your
nails.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:49.830
Okay, so we have our tape down in our diagonal
fashion.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.379
Go over it again and make sure it's down as
much as possible, so that no paint will get

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.489
under there.

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.330
We should just wear it like that, huh?

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:15.130
So I'm going to use black to put over this,
because we're going for some '80's glam here.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:45.110
Then just go ahead and cover the nail, liberally.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:56.900
Sometimes you have to dab the paint on there
to get it into all of the creases, just like

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.190
stenciling.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:06.180
There you go, that looks pretty good.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.289
Now I wouldn't suggest waiting for it to dry,
you just go ahead and peel these off, one

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:36.789
by one and, voila!

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.379
Cover it with a nice top coat, and you have
a wonderful little striped design using tape.

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:42.679
It's as easy as that.
