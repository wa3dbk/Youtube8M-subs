00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.710
From the distant past comes a faint singing voice

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:38.340
Deep into my mind, a moving melody

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:49.280
Comes to you, reaching you, someday

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.810
For years, I stood here watching over the root

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.580
Even though I'd longed to hear

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.210
The Melody that you gave me

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.330
Aaahhh...

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:38.040
I have a feeling it'll soon disappear

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.560
It'll soon disappear...

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.620
Suddenly, my body has become cold

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.720
By the hands of the people, I crumble

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:18.110
To your crying figure, I can't hold my arms out, nor can I cry...

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.040
From long ago ancient times, the song that resonated within me

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.450
We'll meet again, someday, and sing together

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:46.780
This I wish, and close my eyes...
