00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.040
O2 XDA Guide.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:12.130
The latest in O2's long-running XDA series
of Windows smartphones is the O2 XDA Guide.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.099
It's a fairly plain looking device at first
sight, perhaps bordering on the ugly.

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:23.440
But underneath, the XDA Guide is a much more
interesting handset than you would expect.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.320
The main selling feature of the XDA Guide
is the integrated GPS and TomTom Navigator

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.980
7 software, complete with a set of maps.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.610
At the moment, the O2 XDA Guide has only been
announced for Germany, so the maps are for

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.710
Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.520
There's no news on other countries such as
the UK, but really it should be easy enough

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.250
for O2 to change the maps.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.380
It's a fully featured Windows smartphone,
with a 2.8" 240 x 320 pixel touchscreen display,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:06.509
3.2 megapixel camera, WiFi, UMTS (3G) support
plus HSDPA and HSUPA giving high-speed downloads

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:17.820
and uploads, a 528 MHz Qualcomm MSM 7225 processor
with a decent 256MB RAM, plus microSD expandable

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.100
memory and Bluetooth.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.050
A car kit and charging cable is included in
the standard sales package, along with a 1GB

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.530
memory card.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.110
The software is Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional,
enhanced with HTC's TouchFLO interface and

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.570
Opera Mobile 9.5 for web browsing.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.090
A "footprint" icon on the phone saves photographs
along with the GPS location data ("geotagging"),

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.310
and the O2 XDA Guide also features pre-installed
support for Google Maps and YouTube.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.420
The presence of an HTC ExtUSB port indicates
that this is an HTC handset.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.670
O2 fell out with HTC a couple of years ago,
so perhaps this is a sign that they have made

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.670
up.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.539
O2 say that the XDA Guide is an exclusive
design, but it does seem to be very closely

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.980
based on the HTC Touch 3G.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.489
There's no mention of physical size or weight,
although we think that the O2 XDA Guide measures

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.629
approximately 104 x 54 x 15mm.

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:29.180
The battery is a 1110 mAh unit which is the
same as most HTC Touch devices.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.430
O2 didn't give any pricing information, but
we do know that the O2 XDA Guide should be

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.139
available from mid-February 2009 from O2 dealers
in Germany.
