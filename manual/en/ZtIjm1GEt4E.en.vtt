00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.610
to say the new Acura NSX

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.900
is highly anticipated would be like
saying that dinner is highly anticipated

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.770
after he skipped

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.470
lunch and breakfast and maybe dinner the
day before here it is after not one but

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.490
two concept cars at previous Detroit
auto shows

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.789
we have the all-new reimagined Acura NSX

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.320
reprises a storied accurate nameplate
from the 1990s

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.950
and early 2000's let's take a look at
everything now like the original in a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.510
section both concepts that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.700
preview this car a mid-engine car very
low slung to the ground here

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.810
accurate shield like grill kinda gets to
its smallest point yet it's almost just

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.120
kinda pissed right here below the Acura
logo

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.110
you get around the side obviously huge
vendors cooling ducts here

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.710
they actually work the ones behind the
front doors here

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.430
final air into the mid-engine layout
these pillars kinda fun elaire

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.969
over the rear the trunk right there
let's talk about that engine its a v6

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.770
engine twin-turbocharged Acura says and
it's got three electric motors to help

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.799
it out one electric motor comes back
here

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.740
tour in the front seat get an
all-wheel-drive system its torque

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.359
vectoring

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:15.389
with electric motors up front an
electric motor in the back there's no

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:19.009
plugin system for this should rise much
like a conventional hybrid but actor

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:19.439
says

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.939
we'll have plenty of torque because the
ball that instant traction you get

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.969
from the beginning from those electric
motors will also have more than 550

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:27.709
horsepower

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:32.399
massive wheels here 19 inch front wheels
20 inch rear wheels

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.329
carbon ceramic brakes your cross drilled
rotors speaking a carbon

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.369
a carbon fiber floor pan for this car

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.950
a lot of high-strength steel aluminum
body panels elsewhere around it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.779
la to sue because these days like the
BMW i8 Audi r8 have actual kinda parts

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:50.849
bin pieces from their respective
automakers

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.289
how the same situation here fairly
inviting interior actually

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.159
more so than what you necessarily expect
seeing the outside in the car

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.149
fairly been a-pillars really do help
with visibility more than you think

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.349
a fairly large side mirrors I gotta say
for a car

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.200
that's as Los long is this you expect
this to be

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.319
the heart courtesy out oven I'm
pleasantly surprised by the fact that

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.400
it's not necessarily that difficult now
a lot of authentic materials Acura says

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.849
things like

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.849
real leather around the upper doors the
dashboard this center tunnel here very

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:20.620
kind a big

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.930
serb okie Center tell but actor says its
functional there's a lotta cooling and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.140
other stuff that goes on underneath here
which is why it has to be this high

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.690
push-button transmission right here for
the dual-clutch 9-speed

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.580
a automatic transmission there's an IDS
integrated dynamic system here that's a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.400
system that actor as in a few other
models and adjust various drive tray

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.330
most look at this giant knob

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.349
it just sits right here underneath the
starter button

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.750
so that you can really turn things at
the moment so this is said to have a

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.799
look at a smaller button

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.769
similar system in various other Honda
products actually Acura is Honda's

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.890
luxury brand rather than the two screen
system in a lotta Acura cars

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.160
is gonna have capacitive touch controls
up on the left here

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.860
we've never been big fans a the way that
system works but it's reasonably fast

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.959
otherwise soap

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.750
hopefully it kinda works out the same
obviously in a supercar not a lot of

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.360
storage areas here

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.690
really along the center tunnel here but

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.160
no couplers you'll notice now they're is
a little port right here

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.069
which Acura says there's gonna be kinda
cup holder thing that fits

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.980
into the glove compartment will have to
integrate a couple days in kinda plug it

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.530
in here

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.319
and have a couple cups although if you
have a second cup it meant you had a

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.940
passenger and that would mean that

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.560
this would really kind of encroach on
them yeah figure that out

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.690
bian ERA are both as good as signals any
is how crowded this sorta super car

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.760
segment has become

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.530
unisex will obviously I could buy its ok
at Ford's all-new GT

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.290
we don't know about pricing for any the
US cars yet but Acura says the

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.019
intersection start somewhere in the
hundred and fifty thousand dollar or so

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.930
range so stay tuned for more on power or
driving impressions all that closer to

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.420
the cars

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.690
on sale date in late 2015

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.740
that bro
