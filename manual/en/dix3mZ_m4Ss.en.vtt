00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:05.290
If you're looking for a festive starter, then this molten camembert sticks 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:12.290
will be just right for you

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.890
This is a festive starter, we're going to make some oozing melted cheese sticks

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.030
from our camembert, and then serve them with some oranges which we're going to turn into a sort of spicy relish.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.940
So to start with let's get the relish on the go, we need a shallot.
Yep

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.930
And very very finely peel and dice that, and over this side I'm going to cut our oranges into segments.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.830
So what we need to do is take the top off, the bottom

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.440
and then cut around the pith

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.000
to get rid of both the skin and all the white bits, because that's the bitter bit

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.110
So are we making what are essentially posh cheese sticks?
Posh cheese sticks
Yeeaah

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.660
Shot of oil into the pan, just enough to soften our shallots

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.190
and then you can put all your dice in there.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.770
Now because that shallot is nice and fine, it won't take long at all.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.800
Just finish off our oranges, make sure you get all the juice out of there as well.
And if you missed any of this, you can watch it in our skills video on the website

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.920
That's very true

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.100
How to segment, zest and skin

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.180
Whilst I'm finishing off this, Barry do you want to get all the panne-ing ingredients ready...
I would love to!

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.979
We're going to cover our cheese in breadcrumbs

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.100
So the usual flour, egg, breadcrumb 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.590
Ok
And then season the egg really well with salt and pepper

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.970
What I've also got is a pan of oil coming up to temperature here, we're looking for 180 degrees celcius

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.259
If you haven't got a deep fat fryer, this is the alternative... Just keep an eye on it.

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.450
What if you haven't got a temperature probe?

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.600
You can test it with a piece of bread, put it in and it will just start to fizz when it comes up to temperature

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.399
It takes about 30 seconds to turn into a crouton

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:38.660
And then you know it's ready

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.630
If it takes longer and absorbs too much of the oil, then it's still too cold. If it goes black too

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.140
quickly, then turn the heat off because you're getting too hot.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.299
Now that the shallots have softened, I'm going to add in all of our orange segments and the juice into the bowl

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.970
And then we're going to add all our other flavours. Now this is relish

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.119
So you want sharp and sweet, ok? So about a tablespoon of white wine vinegar

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.090
That's the sharp bit, sweetness comes naturally from the orange but also about a tablespoon of white sugar

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.159
And some spices. Now we've got two spices

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.719
Allspice

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.900
so it's a berry, little pinch of that

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.109
it's quite strong. Two cloves

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.289
so they can go in there. 
When you say allspice, does it mean it has all the spices?

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.709
No no, allspice is a berry

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.609
Pinch of cinnamon as well, and then we just leave that to bubble away until it reduces right down

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.349
to a sticky sticky mess.
In the meantime

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.230
camembert. Ok, so a French cheese, very very oozy and gooey in the middle

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.180
That's what we want.
Is that why we're picking it, because it's an oozy cheese?
I love it, and it melts really really well so we'll fry it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.110
You'll have crispy outside breadcrumbs and almost molten cheese in the middle

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.150
Would brie work as well?
You could use brie... You can use which ever cheese you want

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.120
It's completely up to you. But certainly a brie or a camembert, soft cheeses are better. Traditionally

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.510
you'd cut it into wedges

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.889
you'll get little triangles. But what we're going to try and do is make cheese sticks

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.639
and then if you can go through the process of flour, egg and

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:00.329
breadcrumb. And then to make sure that nothing leaks out when we fry it, we're going to have to 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.059
do egg and breadcrumb again. So it's flour, egg, breadcrumb and then egg and breadcrumb.
Ok.

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:07.099
Because our oranges are really soft and don't have the pith, they break down perfectly

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.179
Final ingredient, little bit of marmalade

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:12.859
in there as well. And as soon as that's mixed in

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.630
We can let the whole thing cool down. It's going to be served cold like a relish

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.899
So we'll put that into the bowl and let that setup

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:24.420
to serve with later on. In the meantime we can start to fry some of our cheese sticks

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.409
Lower them very carefully into the oil, away from yourself so you don't get any splashes 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.540
It's 180 degrees celcius
Look at that!

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.229
And they need about two minutes, roll them every so often so they don't catch on the bottom

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:39.669
And then we'll have our molten cheese sticks.
YUM!

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.539
There we go, that's all it needs... A couple of minutes, golden on the outside. Just dry them off in some kitchen roll.

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:48.049
Ben, you look nervous.
Nervous?
Yeah

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.930
What are you worried about?
These are always a bit worrying because you've got to make sure the casing keeps the cheese in as it melts

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.499
They look fine to me!
A little bit of our watercress going into a fantastic pot you saved there

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:01.559
Two of our molten cheese sticks, and some of that relish that already cooled down.

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:08.559
Now that is a starter to be proud of. It's our baked camembert with a spiced orange relish... SORTED!

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.919
Dig in, have a dunk!

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.149
Mmm they're so good!

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.429
That is going to be really bad for me, isn't it?

00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:23.639
Love that relish

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.139
and of course, if you cook any festive recipes at home we want to see photos of them.

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.400
