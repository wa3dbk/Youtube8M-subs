00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.990
Hey Vsauce I'm Jake and I'm on a couch in
San Francisco slowly slipping into a coma

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.910
after eating this bacon and egg cheeseburger
that was sandwiched between two donuts. I

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.230
can burn those calories by seeing how fast
I can go in the 100 meter scroll which might

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.660
be slightly better than people in pizza slice
costumes becoming pizzas .com and here are

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.359
30 more things you can do online now, guys...DONGs.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.320
See the population statistics for the country
you live with World Population Meters. The

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.129
website tells you how many people died, how
many were born and the total number of people

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.050
in every country, giving a net growth per
day and year in real time.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.110
But Here is Today, a really interesting site
that compares today to as far back as we can

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.129
date, putting into perspective just how small
right now is.

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.969
Lets live in the past and the present by playing
old handheld games online at Pica Pic. They

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:57.390
have ones like the Game&amp;Watch Donkey Kong,
Bartman, and a personal favorite of mine the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.410
Tiger Electronic's The Terminator.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.970
Then get even more old school and use steam
power to play YouTube videos like your grandpa

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.270
had too (what did you say, Jake? Nothing,
grandpa!). Tweak the cranks to get the best

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.780
quality and see how long you can keep it at
its peak. Just watch that pressure gauge because

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.880
you don't want a leek...

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.670
spin.com...

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.630
Peter Norvig might have created one of the
longest palindromic sentences at 17,826 words.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.990
You can read it either forward or backward
but let's translate it...badly.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.880
Bad Translator takes text and runs it through
multiple different languages giving you a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.149
ridiculous result. So let's paste this palindrome...250
character limit...well...ok..so instead lets

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.369
take this description of the Taco Bell Dorito
Loco taco with the hopes that this shout out

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:55.369
will get me free Taco Bell, and translate
it back and forth 18 times until we get...this....mmmmmmm

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.270
For a different kind of translation, type
this into Google Translate, go from German

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.909
to Filipino and listen to some sweet beat
boxing.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.620
There are more software easter eggs at The
Easter Egg Archive which cover everything

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.450
from movies, to videos games, to music.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.000
And if you've ever wondered geographically
where people in America pronounce words differently,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.450
these maps show you just that.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.300
If your ear hurts
we can go explore it with the Interactive

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.910
Ear that gives you a look at how the human
ear actually works. You can navigate each

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.260
part in depth or take a journey through to
see what happens at each step.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.690
Then continue on that path to find out what's
inside your head with Brain Maker. Type in

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.500
your name and see what is on your mind. I...uh...well...

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.940
WTFshould I do with my life? No, no...

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.310
I'll just go get Killed By Tetris, a game
where you have to avoid being crushed by the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.970
tetris blocks as this cool little ninja dude
jumps off of walls and rolls onto blocks.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.190
Or you could play Onomastica, a clever word
game where your character interacts with certain

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.430
words and letters to move forward, or downward
or upward.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.600
For a more puzzling experience there is Za-ha-da,
a challenging riddle and puzzle game that

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.650
has you put the answers into the URL to get
to the next page. It gets increasingly difficult

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.280
so...

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.510
after rage quiting, go on a Duck Adventure,
an interactive story where you choose the

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.760
path of one duck and the life he leads by
making life's big choices for him.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.720
Then lets go to masswerk.at/jakeisreallycool...oh
man, that page doesn't exist, it's just a

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.200
404 that lets you play space invader.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.500
If you need some privacy use privnote dot
com where you send messages that can only

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.390
be read once before they self destruct.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.580
Or try the Passive Aggressive Password Machine
if you feel like you should change your password.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.470
Or not.... just do whatever I guess....

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.310
Because I'll be wasting my life away on the
great website PartyCloud where you are your

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.590
own DJ. Pick two songs, sync them together
then mix to your hearts content with different

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.260
effects, loops and filters.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.200
As those sweet jams play in the background,
watch what google searches are happening,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.180
right now.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.250
And I heard a rumor that you cant do simple
maths under pressure but that is baloney because

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.880
you're smart and according to your mother,
you are very handsome. You can do addition,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.160
subtraction and multiplication all while the
time limit gets shorter every round.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.760
For something more relaxed test your knowledge
with what the movie where you guess the film

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.620
by only one screenshot.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.350
And if Pac man were a horror movie it would
be called FPS-MAN and go something like this...

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:39.350
Then grab a friend and play Cube slam, the
latest google chrome experiment that is like

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.530
air hockey pong... but if your friends are
too afraid of your incredible video game-ability,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.130
play against the computer.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.760
Now lets fly around space, exploring and reading
messages that people all over the web have

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.870
left and you can leave your own, but once
you do, you explode.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.470
Enjoy your death with a killer whale...that
follows your mouse.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.210
and find some new music in obscure genres
like electroswing with PlaylisTunes.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:11.210
I'm going to listen to a rainstorm with raining.fm
and pass out. And as always, thanks for watching.
