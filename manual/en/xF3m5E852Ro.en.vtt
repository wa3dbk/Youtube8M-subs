00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.700
People get bubbly around the end of the year.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.700
Or during weddings.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.700
Or on their birthdays.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.240
Or really anytime, because champagne seems
to be EVERYWHERE NOW.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.640
What's up with that?

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.990
From the end of November until early January
is great for sparkling wine sales.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.270
Traditionally champagne, which is the most
famous type of sparking wine, seeing sales

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.440
peaking around holidays related to romance
and celebration.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.510
Like New Year, or Valentines Day.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.250
There are also peaks at Christmas and Thanksgiving;
during wedding season, and every Sunday when

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.140
we have brunch at my house.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.770
Bubbly beverages are super popular, but who
decided bubbles meant pleasure?

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.820
It seems kind of weird if you step back from
it all and think about it right?

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.829
Carbonated water was created for sailors in
1767 by an English chemist to mimic the effervescent

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.340
mineral waters of Europe, but became popular
around the continent after the French Revolution

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.880
as a holy-water replacement for secular rituals.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.880
Bubbly beverages, like sparkling wine, contain
bubbles because of the yeast microorganisms

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.420
which ferment the liquids by eating the sugars
and pooping out alcohol and carbon dioxide

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.420
gas.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.190
True champagne, from the Champagne region
of France, is notoriously finicky to create.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.979
They want to get JUST the right mixture of
bubbles, sugars and sweetness.

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.280
Once it reaches the perfect balance, the vintners
move the frothy liquid into the tightly sealed

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.590
bottles which are twice the pressure of a
car tire -- five and a half regular atmosphere..

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.909
This forces the extra CO2 to dissolve into
the liquid and combine with water to become

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.520
carbonic acid… for a while.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.870
When you pop the cork, the unstable carbonic
acid comes out of the solution, causing the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.549
CO2 to come out of solution in an endothermic
reaction (that is to say, it cools itself)

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:49.979
AND VOILA!!

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.049
Celebration time, c'mon!!

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.649
The vapor is over the mouth of the bottle
is that endothermic reaction creating a pocket

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.770
of condensed water vapor, it's like seeing
your breath in the winter.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.600
So the bubbles themselves are just tiny pockets
of dissolved carbon dioxide, left over from

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.280
the yeast fermentation.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.020
And they’re important because they affect
how we experience the flavor and aroma of

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.290
an effervescent drink; it's like a tiny fountain,
stirring the champagne and adding tiny particles

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.490
of goodness to the air around the glass.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.360
Eventually, the air pockets dissolve, as does
the amount of CO2 in your champ, causing the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.100
bubbles to slow.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.100
But what is it that makes a bubbly drink so
enjoyable?

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.190
Other animals HATE bubbles, because they're
a sign of food spoilage, but the NIH studied

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.000
bubbly water to see what makes it cool, what
makes it poppin', and they found an enzyme

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.200
on the sour receptors of our tongue called
carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA-IV); the bubbles

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.760
stimulate the sour buds and somatosensory
system.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.611
The somatosensory system normally activates
for temperature, pain, touch and taste; so

00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:56.220
you'd think sour buds, and pain… that doesn't
seem good, but for some reason the dual activation

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.740
of the buds and the nerves creates a pleasurable
sensation for the brain; even though we probably

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.000
SHOULD experience it as pain and sour.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.560
Scientists with the NIH think it might be
because the bubbles are made of carbon dioxide,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.510
and so they trigger CA-IV differently.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.650
Normally the enzyme helps us convert carbon
dioxide and water to bicarbonate and protons

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.840
so the body can balance the acids and bases
in the bloodstream… so this was an unexpected

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.840
tickle.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.900
Sort of like how spicy foods trigger pain
and we like those?

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.580
Do you like your beverages with bubbles?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.580
Without?

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:36.750
How are you celebrating your 
new year?!
