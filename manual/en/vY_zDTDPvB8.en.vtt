In this video, we're going to go over how to

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.130
create a photo collage.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.539
As mentioned in the previous video, it's a
simple project that'll get you familiarized

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.490
with using layers in a hands-on exercise sure
to be a lot of fun.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.640
In this example, I want to print out a regular
sheet of paper, so I'll set the size as 8

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.170
1/2 x 11 inches, and I'll set the resolution
as 300 DPI.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.260
Next, to select a background, click on the
swatch beside color and select a color you

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.510
wish to use as your backdrop.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.030
In the organizer palette, select all of the
images that you want to use, and drag them

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.200
into the layers palette.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.040
Each image will be added as a seperate layer.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.670
To move an image, select the pick tool from
the tools toolbar, and then click on the layer.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.710
Select the image, and move it to a new position.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.659
By click a second time, nodes will appear
on the corners and the center of the image;

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.689
this will allow you to resize it by dragging
the corners, or rotate it by dragging the

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.450
rotation handle that's in the center.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.759
When the collage is complete, it's important
to save a version as a PaintShop Pro image

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:21.759
file.

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.159
In this way, your layers will remain intact.

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.479
From the File menu, select Save As, and select
PSP image as the file type.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.049
Next, if you want a version that can be printed
or shared online, go back to file, save as,

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.310
and select jpg.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.399
When saving a multi-layer project as a jpg
file, you will always get a warning message,

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.179
and this is because a jpg can only contain
a single layer.

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.770
Simply click yes to continue, and your image
will be saved.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.549
In our next video, we'll show you how to use
layers to create a dymamic image.

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.429
It's a more in-depth look at using duplicates
to manipulate various components of one image,

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.130
and how to seamlessly blend those layers together.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.849
