00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.150
Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitale.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.820
On this episode of Laura In The Kitchen I
wanted to share something really quick, but

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.330
it's so delicious and totally worth having
on your Brunch table, if you are having guests

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.529
over - if you have guests staying overnight
for a holiday, or just a weekend or whatever,

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.090
you want to put together a really nice Brunch,
this is definitely something I think is a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.260
really good one to have on that table, and
it is my Maple Glazed Bacon.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.450
Now, it is an incredible combination of sweet
and salty, and we are going to pop it into

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.450
the oven.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.310
We're not going to get bacon grease everywhere,
so it's easy, it's easy to clean up, it's

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.360
just, and it's incredibly awesome.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.990
You'll need like four ingredients, very simple,
starting off with some bacon.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.280
Now what I have done here; this is some thick-cut
bacon, and what I've done I've taken a baking

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.690
sheet, and lined it really well with some
aluminum foil, and this helps, because when

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.890
the maple syrup tends to burn a little bit,
because it is sugar in it, especially, because

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.680
I am adding some brown sugar as well - maple
sugar, brown sugar, and a little bit of cayenne,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.680
it helps with clean up.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.431
Now, I've got a wire rack here.

00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:17.780
You want to make sure your rack is oven-proof
safe, and I have just laid my bacon on top

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.820
of my wire rack.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.350
That ensures that the bacon gets crispy all
around, that the air goes around the bacon,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.610
and gets crispy all around.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.650
It doesn't stay - if you were to put the bacon
on the baking sheet by itself, the bottom

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.729
would be soggy.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.630
So, there's a great tip there.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.450
Now, what I have here is some maple syrup,
a touch of brown sugar, and just a small pinch

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.799
of cayenne pepper, because in all things,
life and food, balance is key, and for me,

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.869
I need a little something hot with the sweet
and salty, so it's just a match made in heaven.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.520
I've got my oven preheated to 400F, and what
I am going to do now, is pop my bacon in there

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.170
for ten to fifteen minutes, or until it's
a lightly-golden brown and starting to crisp

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.200
up a bit, and I'll take it out, and in the
meantime, we'll get going on making the glaze,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.630
which takes like four seconds.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.709
While the bacon finishes up in the oven for
just a couple more minutes, I am going to

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:11.069
take my maple syrup, brown sugar, and cayenne;
I'm going to put them in a small saucepan,

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.140
and just cook these together long, just long
enough for the brown sugar to kind of melt

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.220
in there, and it's only going to take, like,
once this starts to get - once it comes to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.780
temperature, and starts to boil a little bit,
it will take one minute, literally.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.040
It takes no time at all.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.980
You just want the brown sugar just to dissolve
a little bit, so it's not like chunky, going

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.350
onto the bacon.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.080
So, I am going to let this do its thing for
literally a minute.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.020
In the meantime, I am going to grab my bacon,
and get going on the last step.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.960
The bacon was in the oven for twelve minutes
to be exact, and now that's going to vary

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.570
just a little bit, depending on how thick
your thick-cut bacon is.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.240
Now I am going to take my mixture, which literally
took one - as soon as it started to boil,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.360
it took less than a minute, and it was good
to go, and I am going to generously paint

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.150
this on my bacon

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.830
And this is definitely going to add lovely
color and flavor to the bacon.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.190
I just do a couple of layers of it, until
I run out.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.260
It's going to be so delightful.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.650
Serve this along, maybe Eggs Benedict, or
maybe with - I wouldn't put, if I was doing

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:34.260
Eggs Benedict, I would maybe do, instead of
doing Canadian Bacon, I would maybe do something

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.040
like this, or you could serve this on the
side, and serve homemade English Muffins with

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.070
poached eggs.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.140
That would be just lovely.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.830
Pop this back in the oven for five or six
minutes or until it is beautiful golden brown,

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.760
and crispy, let it cool slightly, and then
you're ready to serve, and I'm ready to dig

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.820
in!

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.130
My bacon went back in for about six minutes
after it was glazed, and I mean it looks magnificent.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.540
It's golden brown, it's crispy, but it's not
overly cooked so that it's like crumbles,

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.480
it's just perfection, and look at that.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.850
If you come close, you can see the glaze on
the bacon.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.060
Mmmm,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.010
The best bacon ever!

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.299
Mmmm!

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:24.692
By the way, if you see underneath the rack,
the kind of burned pieces of sugar and maple

00:04:24.692 --> 00:04:30.280
syrup, that's why, excuse me, that's why I
like to line my baking sheet with aluminum

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.280
foil.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.840
That way, you don't have to sit there and
scrub, scrub, scrub for hours, you just kind

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.030
of rip it up, and throw it out, and you are
good to go.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.530
This is the best bacon in the world, and it's
a great side dish to pretty much any Brunch

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.080
