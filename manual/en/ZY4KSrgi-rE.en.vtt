00:00:00.335 --> 00:00:02.557
- [David] Hey guys, it's
David from TheUnlockr.com

00:00:02.557 --> 00:00:04.617
and today we're actually updating our

00:00:04.617 --> 00:00:08.404
how to set up ADB USB drivers
for Android devices procedure.

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:11.528
A lot of things have
changed when setting up ADB

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:13.794
so we figured we'd update this and make it

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:15.596
a little bit easier for everybody.

00:00:15.596 --> 00:00:18.513
(futuristic music)

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:21.711
Okay, so the first thing you need to do

00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:24.057
is you need to download the Android SDK.

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.071
So we're gonna click on that link there.

00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:30.206
And then we're going to
click on the EXE version.

00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:32.623
And wait for that to install.

00:00:34.348 --> 00:00:37.264
Okay, so once that downloads
we're going to click it,

00:00:37.264 --> 00:00:41.014
hit yes, hit next and
then it's gonna tell us

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:45.601
that it needs the software
developer kit for Java

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:49.483
so we're gonna click on that
thing in the middle there.

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:53.066
And then the JDK, or
the Java Developer Kit

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:58.625
is right here, so we're
gonna click download.

00:01:06.887 --> 00:01:11.087
And then we want the JDK
for our version of Windows.

00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:14.742
So either Windows 64-bit or Windows 32-bit

00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:19.468
which is X86, so you download
the one directly for yours.

00:01:19.468 --> 00:01:21.896
So for me I'm using a 64-bit.

00:01:21.896 --> 00:01:25.896
Hit accept and then click
on 64-bit Windows one.

00:01:29.034 --> 00:01:29.867
Hit save.

00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:36.557
And wait for that to download.

00:01:36.557 --> 00:01:40.724
Okay, so once that's downloaded
we're gonna click run.

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.846
And then follow the steps, just
keep hitting next basically

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:00.111
until it installs.

00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:03.554
Okay, and then once that's
done it'll say setup complete,

00:02:03.554 --> 00:02:05.637
hit close and close that.

00:02:08.535 --> 00:02:11.800
We can hit back on our Android SDK setup,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.271
hit next again, now it
should say that it found it.

00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:15.836
Hit next.

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:17.888
And we're gonna change this in here

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:19.697
because it's just very long.

00:02:19.697 --> 00:02:23.864
Delete everything inside
here between that and that

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.803
so it just shows C colon
slash Android hyphen SCK

00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:32.609
and hit next, then hit install.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.944
Now wait for it to finish.

00:02:37.944 --> 00:02:40.369
Okay, once the SDK manager is up

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.547
we're going to check off a few things.

00:02:42.547 --> 00:02:44.569
We want the tools folder, so that means

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.583
everything inside of the tools folder,

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:49.008
the SDK tools, the SDK platform tools,

00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:50.484
it should automatically have checked

00:02:50.484 --> 00:02:53.155
the latest version of Android
so in this case it's 4.0,

00:02:53.155 --> 00:02:55.499
but whatever the latest version is

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:57.957
just check that in
everything inside of it.

00:02:57.957 --> 00:03:00.263
You don't need to check any
of these one's beneath that,

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.336
we're just gonna go down.

00:03:02.336 --> 00:03:04.839
And scroll all the way
down to the very bottom

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:07.104
and make sure that
Google USB driver package

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:09.689
is also checked, so it
should be a total of

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.114
about eight packages, but depending on

00:03:12.114 --> 00:03:15.207
what version of Android you're
looking at when you do this.

00:03:15.207 --> 00:03:17.049
So just make sure those are checked

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.969
then we're gonna hit
install eight packages.

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:23.969
Hit accept all and then hit install.

00:03:26.113 --> 00:03:29.780
And wait for it to
install all these things.

00:03:38.228 --> 00:03:41.765
Eventually the Android SDK
will say done loading packages

00:03:41.765 --> 00:03:44.647
so we can hit close and
then we can actually

00:03:44.647 --> 00:03:46.913
close the Android SDK.

00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:49.290
Okay, now on your Android device

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.290
you're going to go into the settings

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.669
and then if you're using
most Android devices

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.268
it's gonna be applications in here

00:04:01.268 --> 00:04:03.771
then development then USB debugging

00:04:03.771 --> 00:04:05.749
and we're gonna check that on.

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:07.812
Now on Ice Cream Sandwich devices

00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:10.032
you go all the way down to the bottom,

00:04:10.032 --> 00:04:13.782
it's developer options
then USB debugging on.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.477
Once you've done that we
can then plug in our device

00:04:20.618 --> 00:04:22.535
to our computer by USB.

00:04:25.695 --> 00:04:27.793
Do not mount the storage, just leave it

00:04:27.793 --> 00:04:29.530
plugged in like that.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.090
Okay, with the device plugged in

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.562
it should've automatically started

00:04:32.562 --> 00:04:34.162
downloading drivers, et cetera

00:04:34.162 --> 00:04:36.696
so we're gonna check to
make sure everything worked

00:04:36.696 --> 00:04:39.243
by opening our Windows Explorer

00:04:39.243 --> 00:04:43.162
then clicking on our C
drive then our Android SDK

00:04:43.162 --> 00:04:44.810
we downloaded et cetera.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.417
Then platform tools.

00:04:46.417 --> 00:04:48.638
Now inside here in any blank area,

00:04:48.638 --> 00:04:50.735
like down here for instance,
we're gonna hold shift

00:04:50.735 --> 00:04:53.818
on our keyboard and then right-click.

00:04:56.507 --> 00:05:00.294
And that should give us our
normal right-click settings,

00:05:00.294 --> 00:05:02.649
but also you'll see open
command window here now

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:04.214
that normally isn't there.

00:05:04.214 --> 00:05:06.233
We're gonna click that
and that'll bring us

00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:10.263
a command window that
already has this path in it

00:05:10.263 --> 00:05:12.490
so we can start using programs inside here

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.240
like ADB for example.

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.247
Okay, so the next thing we're gonna do

00:05:19.247 --> 00:05:21.422
is we're gonna check to see
if ADB can see our device.

00:05:21.422 --> 00:05:25.505
So we're gonna type the
letters ADB space devices

00:05:26.654 --> 00:05:27.762
and hit enter.

00:05:27.762 --> 00:05:30.193
If a serial number comes up like this one

00:05:30.193 --> 00:05:33.400
then you're all set, ADB is set up,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.460
you have the drivers that you need

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.185
and you can just continue from here

00:05:37.185 --> 00:05:38.462
with whatever you need ADB for.

00:05:38.462 --> 00:05:40.764
Now if a driver or a
serial number does not

00:05:40.764 --> 00:05:43.197
show up here, it just says
listed devices attached

00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:46.657
and it's blank, then
there are a few things

00:05:46.657 --> 00:05:51.078
we can do to kind of force
it to find our USB drivers.

00:05:51.078 --> 00:05:52.609
So that's what we'll do next.

00:05:52.609 --> 00:05:54.508
Okay, so there are two
ways we can manually

00:05:54.508 --> 00:05:56.859
install these drivers if
it didn't automatically

00:05:56.859 --> 00:05:58.792
install it and we weren't fortunate enough

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:00.435
to have that work.

00:06:00.435 --> 00:06:02.864
One of the ways, and
the way I like the best,

00:06:02.864 --> 00:06:05.297
is using a program called PDA Net.

00:06:05.297 --> 00:06:08.504
So now normally this program is used

00:06:08.504 --> 00:06:11.098
to wire tether the internet from your

00:06:11.098 --> 00:06:13.356
phone to your computer,
but it also can be used

00:06:13.356 --> 00:06:15.867
to install ADB drivers kind of forcibly.

00:06:15.867 --> 00:06:17.917
So what you're gonna do is
you're gonna click on this

00:06:17.917 --> 00:06:19.970
link here and you're
gonna download the latest

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.784
version of PDA Net.

00:06:21.784 --> 00:06:23.882
Then once that's completely installed

00:06:23.882 --> 00:06:26.595
you're gonna unplug your device,

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:28.481
plug it back in and then
we're gonna go back up

00:06:28.481 --> 00:06:31.731
to step number eight and then basically

00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:37.220
just type ADB devices again
into the command prompt

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.536
and see if that works.

00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:41.664
If the serial number comes
up then then we're good.

00:06:41.664 --> 00:06:44.424
Now if that still doesn't
work you can go down

00:06:44.424 --> 00:06:46.429
to the next step which
is to basically manually

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:47.652
install the drivers.

00:06:47.652 --> 00:06:49.590
So you're gonna look
for your devices drivers

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.922
here or Google them and see
if you can find them yourself.

00:06:52.922 --> 00:06:55.430
Then you're gonna go to device manager,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.567
you're gonna look for
your device, your phone,

00:06:58.567 --> 00:07:01.734
so I'll show you what that looks like.

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:11.246
Okay, so in your control panel

00:07:11.246 --> 00:07:13.996
you can just type device manager.

00:07:20.587 --> 00:07:23.505
And then look for yours, so
we're gonna click on that

00:07:23.505 --> 00:07:24.701
and then here we are.

00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:26.726
Now we can hit update driver software.

00:07:26.726 --> 00:07:28.414
Then you're gonna click browse my computer

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:30.485
for driver software.

00:07:30.485 --> 00:07:32.746
And then you're gonna basically browse

00:07:32.746 --> 00:07:36.073
to wherever the USB driver is
that you downloaded earlier

00:07:36.073 --> 00:07:39.692
from either this section or from Googling.

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.706
Wait for that to completely install

00:07:41.706 --> 00:07:43.604
then unplug your device, plug it back in

00:07:43.604 --> 00:07:46.611
and again try ADB
devices in command prompt

00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:49.373
and hopefully by that time
it should have worked for you

00:07:49.373 --> 00:07:50.682
and you should be all set.

00:07:50.682 --> 00:07:52.203
So there you go.

00:07:52.203 --> 00:07:55.120
