00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:11.179
Well this is a tricker rhythm in 5/8 I Don't
remember the name of it right now. How is

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.320
that. But, you know what we call this look
at my hiny because the lady that your remember

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.170
this rhythm is called look at my hiny rhythm.
Sing this look at my hiny, look at my hiny,

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:56.270
look at my hiny, look at my hiny. Now play
it. Look at my hiny, look at my hiny, look

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:16.710
at my hiny. 1,2,3,4,5, it is in 5s. There
is 5 there is 1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2. Show you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.090
another way to play a five. These are the
fun things you could do in dumbek so it is

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.730
cool in doing dumbek with those. Count five
1,2,3,4,5, now instead of counting to five

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:39.040
count to three one time and then count to
two another time. 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,1,2.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.700
What you are doing here is you got five beats
and you could subdivide them you could play

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.340
three and two or a two ending on three. If
you say it to yourself it sounds different.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:04.820
Try this 1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3.
Now say to yourself 1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:36.790
1,2,1,2,3. Now go backwards and do 1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,31,2,1,2,3.
so you got a five beat measure there. The

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:45.870
easiest way to remember this is to go 1,2,3,1,2.
look at my hiny, look at my hiny, look at

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.000
my hiny.
