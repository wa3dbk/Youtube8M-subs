Hi, my name is Kip and I'm here on behalf
of Expert Village. In this step of making

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.530
homemade cinnamon rolls we are going to combine
our ingredients. Now if you are going to combine

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:19.250
your ingredients using the help of a kitchen
aide mixing bowl such as this with the dough

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.250
hook. Then I don't worry about beating the
egg before hand, I just combine it all together

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.640
and go ahead and mix the dough. If you are
not going to use something, some type of power

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.820
dough mixture then you want to make sure that
you break the egg and beat it well before

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.250
you combine all the ingredients. There again
I'm going to use the help of a kitchen aide

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:54.750
and a dough hook. So we would start by adding
our mix and it is slightly warm from scolding

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.230
it. To scold milk you just simply put it on
the stove and watch it very carefully and

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.690
just as it starts to boil and stir it constantly.
You don't want to burn it, you just want the

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:17.640
edge of burning then remove it from the heat.
Add your salt, add your sugar, add your shorten,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:35.531
add your egg,
add your yeast. There again often times it

00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:41.999
is not a bad idea to actually take a small
dish as such as this one and add your yeast

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:45.179
and a little bit of the warm milk and a little
sugar to that and stir that up. Let that get

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:51.509
all foamy. There again especially if you are
not using a piece of equipment that would

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.319
give you a little bit of hand cause that dough
hook would also help to warm the dough. Also

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.969
to help it to rise. Now, when it comes to
the flour you are not going to want to put

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:09.340
all the flour in there, hold back a half a
cup or so. It is not really precise so I can

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.840
just take this bowl and dump a good portion
of this in. I'm going to say about that much

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.420
out of it, there may be about a cup, let me
put a little bit more in there. We would use

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.720
that as we beat the dough if it looks too
sticky you can add a little bit more flour

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.880
to it until it has the consistency that we
are looking for. So this point we are ready

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:43.080
to actually take our kitchen aide and dough
hook and begin to mix out dough.
