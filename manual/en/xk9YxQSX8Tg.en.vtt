[music}

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.950
I wanted to improve my skills. I wanted
to give myself more

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.440
opportunities and I know that the tools
that I

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.320
develop here are going to allow me to
advance in my career. I'm smarter than I

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.250
think I am.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.300
And they enforced that in me to the point
that increased this level of confidence that

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.980
without them I couldn't have achieved. I

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.130
really couldn't have achieved. It's been a great experience. It's amazing how well you

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.990
can communicate

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.590
well with all the skill and practices
that we've learned in our program.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.739
We really tailor the services the
education to the students;

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.620
we have a very diverse a group of
professors that bring

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.899
life experience and bring also education,
academic experience

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.150
into the classroom. I have been in love with
social work

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.430
since I took my first social work class in
the seventies

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.600
and I love working at CSUN because

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.930
of really the diversity of every

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.400
type folks in terms of every type of
culture that we have here

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.630
and we bring that diversity together and
try

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.390
help you learn how to take that out in
the world

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.720
for people to help those who are in
need of help.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.119
You can now be doing therapy at one
moment, you can be doing research in

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:22.670
another,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.800
statistics, you know science-based and
evidence-based

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.880
practices. It's really amazing and

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.630
the faculty, they're so diverse and
everyone is an expert in their field and

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.320
we were able to benefit greatly from

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.770
all in their knowledge and experience.
We became this

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.619
very tight family where we not only

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.899
talk to each other on Saturdays,
but talk to each other throughout the week.

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.340
In social work, you not only start as
a cohort,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.959
but you take your classes together and
you take the same classes

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.179
in a certain order. What I like about it
is, it's a real challenge to

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.160
teach. When I walk into the room, you all know each other;

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.050
the other thing I like about it is once
you get to know each other we can get a

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.599
great

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:09.110
discussion going because once you know
each other you can take more risks with

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.619
each other

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.280
and really challenge one another as well
as collaborate and agree with one

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.600
another.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.890
All the skills that I have actually learned in social work is something that I'm able to apply

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.050
in my day to day job.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.750
It's something it's useful. It's like an
investment not only for myself but an investment

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.800
for my community

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.020
and the people I service. The master social work program is

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.750
pretty unique probably among every
every discipline because

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.569
we learn to work and live with a code
of ethics

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.670
by the National Association of Social
Workers. So

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.840
it's a way of life, it's a way thinking, a
a way of

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.570
looking at people and a way of being more
compassionate and understanding

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.000
and it doesn't just affect your profession
and the job you do,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.300
it affects your life. I'm Patrick Muro,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.340
Human Services Administrator with the
Los Angeles County Department of Public

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.510
Social Services

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.020
and today I graduate with my Master of
Social Work.
