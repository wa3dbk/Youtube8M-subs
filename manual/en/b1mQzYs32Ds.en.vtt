00:00:00.161 --> 00:00:02.301
[music]

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.268
This is an overwhelming experience

00:00:05.548 --> 00:00:07.600
when you come out here for the first
time.

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:11.033
You just really feel as if you're
on the edge of the earth.

00:00:11.075 --> 00:00:14.066
There's no other place like it in
Texas.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.800
[music]

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:20.481
I'm the fitness writer for the
Austin-American Statesman,

00:00:20.525 --> 00:00:23.833
I'm working on a story for my column
about what it's like to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.748
mountain bike in Big Bend Ranch State
Park.

00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:26.746
Ready to go?

00:00:27.073 --> 00:00:28.560
Ready to go. Let's go.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:31.066
I'm a little nervous, I guess (laughs)

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:33.340
It's jagged and rough

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.500
and just seems Wild West to me.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.000
But it's beautiful too.

00:00:38.915 --> 00:00:42.066
The whole route, we're doing 108 miles
over 4 days.

00:00:42.328 --> 00:00:43.095
and camping out at night.

00:00:43.373 --> 00:00:44.256
[wind]

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.435
Big Bend Ranch State Park is the
biggest state park that we have

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:52.235
in the state of Texas. It's 310,000
acres and about

00:00:52.276 --> 00:00:56.135
388 miles of road, trail, route.

00:00:56.801 --> 00:00:58.603
We have a lot of trails.

00:00:58.768 --> 00:01:00.101
(laughter)

00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:03.035
Big Bend Ranch State Park is a very
big place

00:01:03.076 --> 00:01:05.035
and there are a lot of opportunities.

00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:06.500
Yeehaw!

00:01:07.243 --> 00:01:09.705
Sweet, guys, look at that view of the
Chisos in front of you!

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:11.703
[music]

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:16.410
It is challenging in places, it's
smooth in places.

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:17.501
This is awesome!

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:20.713
What I love about Big Bend Ranch is it
has a little bit of everything.

00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:22.713
[music]

00:01:22.755 --> 00:01:24.713
Oh, look at that, you got it.

00:01:24.755 --> 00:01:25.935
(laughs)

00:01:26.868 --> 00:01:28.733
About a mile and a half left.

00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:34.635
Getting out on a mountain bike just
lets you cover more ground.

00:01:36.136 --> 00:01:37.268
[music]

00:01:37.936 --> 00:01:40.766
It's about all there is to do out
here. If you don't like the outdoor

00:01:40.808 --> 00:01:42.766
stuff you might as well go back to the
city.

00:01:47.036 --> 00:01:53.568
[music]

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.120
When you're on a mountain bike, you
don't have to go but 100 yards

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:02.855
and you can probably find something
that's pretty technical.

00:02:02.896 --> 00:02:04.855
[bike rattling]

00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:07.960
Some of those spots on our main road
are kind of challenging.

00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:13.233
There's parts where I walk, and I hike
my bike and it's okay to do that.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.073
[music stops]

00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:15.646
[crash]

00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:17.320
You okay?

00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:18.538
I think so.

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:20.616
I'm going to go do it again.

00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:21.638
Okay. Good idea.

00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:24.978
[music]

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.978
[wind]

00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:32.288
[bike rattling]

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.288
Woohoo!

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:44.261
Oh yeah! We're gonna make it!

00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:48.805
We survived our first day on the
trail. It was very challenging.

00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:50.671
Can I get a tow from here?

00:02:51.288 --> 00:02:53.656
Now I feel pleasantly pooped out,

00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:56.071
and I'm going to sleep well tonight, I
know.

00:02:56.113 --> 00:02:58.071
[crickets]

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.413
It was awesome.

00:03:02.456 --> 00:03:03.571
[fire crackling]

00:03:03.656 --> 00:03:05.905
A lot of people think it would be
crazy to come bike in the desert.

00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:06.853
[bike tire]

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.555
But it's very magical to me.

00:03:09.635 --> 00:03:10.470
Check out the view!

00:03:10.818 --> 00:03:14.650
I think in the next 3 to 5 years this
will be the mountain biking Mecca

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.790
of Texas if not the southwestern
United States.

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:21.661
Woohoo!

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.440
[music]

00:03:26.481 --> 00:03:28.975
It's very very beautiful.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.146
Prickly stuff and tarantulas
everywhere. (laughs)

00:03:34.188 --> 00:03:37.616
This is kind of like what I pictured
Texas to be when I was a little kid.

00:03:37.658 --> 00:03:39.616
Another day in paradise.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.356
It's just nice to see that there are
still wide open spaces.

00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:45.858
