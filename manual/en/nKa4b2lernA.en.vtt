00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.920
today we're going to demonstrate the

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.500
many versatile uses of black Rub 'n Restore速.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.420
so I've already removed the

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.820
pressure seal and thoroughly stirred it.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.610
I've got my cellulose sponge here.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.470
you can see there's no green scrubby

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.300
on the back, and to create an easier

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.630
sponge to use i'm going to cut it

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.650
diagonally which creates these wonderful

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.349
sculpted edges that can make your your

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.530
project a lot easier to work with.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.440
so putting on my glove. I'm right-handed,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.179
so I should probably just stick with

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.929
that, eh? and we're going to work today on

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.359
this bumper. this is in my car and our

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.549
service vehicle, and it's got a lot of

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:53.829
Rub 'n Restore速 stains on it that I

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.319
didn't get to very quickly and what

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:58.269
better way to fix them in with some more

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.170
Rub 'n Restore速! now with any sort of color

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.210
change, which is, you know, we're trying to

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.000
cover those spots, will probably

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.760
take a couple of coats and want to

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.240
thoroughly dry each one in between.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.360
now with plastics, which is usually what

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.200
you'll see on exteriors of vehicles, we

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.150
would recommend a plastic primer for

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.360
really good longevity. not all plastics

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.400
are the same, so it's kind of a crapshoot

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.280
you know, if you have to use a plastic

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.180
primer or not, but we recommend it as a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.550
disclaimer. this product also works

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.800
really well on rubber. rubber is more

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.060
porous and permeable than plastic and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.440
that's why this product also works well

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.330
on leather and vinyl because, those

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.940
materials are very porous

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.600
and permeable. you can see how great, you

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.130
know, this plastic is different than this

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.660
plastic.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.960
but already we've we've accomplished a

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.730
vast improvement.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.250
just a few more layers. you want to avoid

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.170
applying this product in direct sunlight

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.050
because this surface will be hot and the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.390
product will dye, or I'm sorry, dry. the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.630
dye will dry very quickly, and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.160
you won't be able to polish out

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.780
your streaks and get a nice even finish

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.360
like this.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.500
so my second demonstration will be my

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.450
shoes. these are my favorite shoes they

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.310
have at least a hundred thousand miles

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.120
on them and probably about 30 coats of

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.190
Rub 'n Restore速 over the years. oops, dripped on

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.630
my bumper. we don't recommend a dramatic

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.670
color change on shoes just because shoes

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.220
take so much use and abuse and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.500
encounter water and dirt and that sort

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.180
of thing, and if you do a color change

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.070
you'll constantly be touching them up

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.110
and the color will tend to flake off in

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.120
the creases where your where your foot

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.390
bends, but if you're working in the same

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.440
color family

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.330
this is a great product. it's like shoe

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.680
polish on steroids.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.930
it's much, much better for a leather or

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.590
vinyl, not for nubuck or fabric or you

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.290
know like your converse. those are those

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.760
are like a canvas. you wouldn't want to

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.680
use that, this product on those. so you

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.440
can see that I've dyed my bumper, I've

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.940
dyed my shoes, and I'm gonna get a little

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.880
wacky here, hold on to your hats boys and

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.930
girls I'm getting my paintbrush and a

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.870
purse that was destined for the donate

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.049
pile and i'm just going to get a little

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.010
wacky

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.080
now of course you wouldn't be doing this

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.420
on your purse but the purpose is

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.000
made, the point is demonstrated that you

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
could do polka dots or your initials or

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.540
patterns and filigree on any leather

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.180
or vinyl surface, be it your jacket, your

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.970
sofa, your bumper.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.650
I mean if you want to do it, you can do

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.470
it ,and if you don't like it, get on it

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.290
right away with some, preferably before

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.060
it'd dry, but you can even scrub it out

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.620
if it's dry sometimes, and strip it out.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.600
and bear in mind if you're going to do

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.580
patterns like that especially on a

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.440
surface like a purse or a pair of shoes

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.630
that take a lot of use and abuse and

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.570
where and flex that you will probably

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.040
have to touch it up so don't get too

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:58.280
complicated with it. so thank you!
