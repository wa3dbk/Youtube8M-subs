When my hair gets greasy or oily I like to keep it off my face,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.240
but look stylish at the same time.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.120
Hi guys! I'm Shalini, a hair stylist

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.200
and today I'm gonna share three easy hairstyles

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.420
that will get you through those dreadful second and third hair days

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.020
and as an added bonus,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.020
they only take a few minutes to do!

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.200
Divide the hair into two sections, one on the right and one on the left.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.640
Tie the rest up into a ponytail.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.550
Twist the section around.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.160
Make a slight opening and pass a section through it.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.180
Place it around the rubber band

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.300
and secure it under the ponytail with another rubber band.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.400
Repeat the same on the other side.

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.899
Now here's a small tip,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.100
Use a little bit of baby powder or talcum powder

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.300
with a big fluffy brush.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.540
Now dab that on the roots and massage gently.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600
This will absorb the grease and oil instantly.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.080
Use a strip of cheese cloth, or tissue paper

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.180
and push that into your flat brush or paddle brush.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.220
Run it through your hair thoroughly.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.860
This will instantly absorb all the dirt and grime, leaving you with cleaner hair.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.320
With the help of a comb,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.220
neatly tie all your hair up into a ponytail.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.820
Twist it around forming a bun and secure it with bobby pins.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.580
Twist the front section for a little bit of volume.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.480
Dry shampoo is another great option for greasy hair.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.120
Spray it on the roots, section by section and massage it gently

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.120
so it doesn't leave a white residue.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.840
Back comb your hair in sections.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.170
Secure it all away, making a pouf.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.580
Take a section on the right.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.320
Twist it around and secure it at the back.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.460
Repeat the same on the other side and you're good to go.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.360
Tug on the section gently for a little bit of volume.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.940
So there you have it,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.920
three perfect hairstyles for days when you're feeling lazy

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.120
or just didn't have the time to wash your hair.
