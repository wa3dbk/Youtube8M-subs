00:00:00.092 --> 00:00:01.184
- Hi, I'm Ben Bowlin.

00:00:01.184 --> 00:00:02.344
- And I'm Scott Benjamin.

00:00:02.344 --> 00:00:04.669
- And we're here at the High Museum of Art

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:07.445
for a very special episode of Car Stuff.

00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:07.850
- That's right.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:08.641
Today we're gonna take a look

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.534
at the 1936 Stout Scarab.

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:16.259
(upbeat jazz music)

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.524
- Okay, we're here in front of

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:33.962
the famous Stout Scarab.

00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:35.448
This was built by William Stout

00:00:35.448 --> 00:00:37.944
as part of his Stout Car Company,

00:00:37.944 --> 00:00:41.868
and, weirdly enough, this
thing has a rear engine.

00:00:41.868 --> 00:00:42.309
- That's right.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.168
The engine's way back here,

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:44.606
and that's for a reason
we'll tell you about

00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:45.822
when we get up to the
front of the vehicle.

00:00:45.822 --> 00:00:48.300
But, for now Ben, let's talk
about the styling a little bit.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.788
- Oh yeah.

00:00:48.788 --> 00:00:49.902
Believe it or not, people thought

00:00:49.902 --> 00:00:52.666
this was a really ugly
vehicle when it came out.

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:53.780
- Yeah, it's hard to believe, isn't it,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.511
when you look at this,

00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:56.998
because this, to me, seems
like a beautiful design.

00:00:56.998 --> 00:01:01.498
(upbeat jazz music)

00:01:03.683 --> 00:01:05.831
It's become an Art Deco icon.

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.027
- [Ben] Yeah, it's a masterpiece.

00:01:07.027 --> 00:01:09.647
This was built to have
the shape of a scarab,

00:01:09.647 --> 00:01:11.961
and it's not just the
outside that's unique,

00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:14.922
this has a very special
purpose, right Scott?

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:15.781
- That's exactly right.

00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:17.598
It has some unusual features inside

00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:19.020
that were way, way ahead of its time

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.471
just like many of these dream cars.

00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:22.445
- The front seats rotate completely.

00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:23.026
- That's right.

00:01:23.026 --> 00:01:25.289
The backseat lays down like a couch.

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.043
- Yeah, and there's a table that folds out

00:01:27.043 --> 00:01:28.668
in case you want to play cards

00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:31.187
with anybody else in
your rolling living room.

00:01:31.187 --> 00:01:31.791
- Yeah, that's right.

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.022
You can hold drinks on there, or whatever,

00:01:33.022 --> 00:01:34.926
but the idea was that this is built

00:01:34.926 --> 00:01:38.135
for someone who's on the go
and wants to have a party.

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:42.732
(moves to upbeat
electronic keyboard music)

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.648
- And this has a very low floor pan

00:01:48.648 --> 00:01:50.758
to maximize the amount of room

00:01:50.758 --> 00:01:54.384
inside the vehicle
because William Stout had

00:01:54.384 --> 00:01:56.787
this idea that he would make

00:01:56.787 --> 00:01:58.110
a living room on wheels.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.005
- Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:00.270
Now that is what Chrysler thought

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.163
they would do in 1984 when they came out

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:04.040
with the Chrysler Minivan.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.605
(moves to upbeat jazz music)

00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:08.804
- Yes, ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:08.804 --> 00:02:10.162
we are standing in front of what could

00:02:10.162 --> 00:02:13.668
arguably be called the
world's first minivan.

00:02:13.668 --> 00:02:14.783
- That's right except this one was built

00:02:14.783 --> 00:02:16.025
with an all-aluminum skin.

00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:16.768
- Uh-hmm.

00:02:16.768 --> 00:02:18.161
- Had a tubular steel frame.

00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:20.669
- Oh yeah, and it had
these lace-wood interior

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:22.770
so that it would be easier to clean.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.281
- That's right.

00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:25.007
You remember how we mentioned
that it had a rear engine?

00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:26.963
Well, that's so that there
was plenty of room up-front,

00:02:26.963 --> 00:02:28.470
here, for the driver.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.326
- And as odd as the Scarab may seem today,

00:02:32.326 --> 00:02:34.288
we have to remember that a bunch

00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:36.470
of the features in this vehicle

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.048
later became features in production cars.

00:02:39.048 --> 00:02:40.928
- [Scott] Yes, but decades
later, as is the case

00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:42.624
with many of these dream cars.

00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:44.063
- Now you want to know one feature

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:48.545
that I wish they had
kept is the scarab here

00:02:48.545 --> 00:02:49.787
in the front.

00:02:49.787 --> 00:02:52.550
Look at this, and tell
me that doesn't look like

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.648
the super-hero car of some
crime fighter in the 1930's.

00:02:56.648 --> 00:02:57.449
- Yeah, it seems like it.

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:58.703
I mean, that's the scarab
beetle right there,

00:02:58.703 --> 00:03:00.642
and that's the namesake of
the vehicle, itself, right?

00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:01.107
- Yeah, like,

00:03:01.107 --> 00:03:04.885
♫ Da na na na na na na na na na, Scarab ♫

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:05.416
- Oh.

00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:05.920
- No?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.265
- No.

00:03:06.265 --> 00:03:06.895
- I thought it worked.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:07.693
- No, it didn't work.

00:03:07.693 --> 00:03:09.209
- Thanks so much for watching.

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.906
