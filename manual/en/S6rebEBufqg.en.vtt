00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.870
Let's talk about how to hold the accordion.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.090
First of all, when you pick up the accordion
it's really important that you try not to

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.160
touch these keys, the white keys, or the buttons
that are in the bottom, the base notes.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.820
It's important that when you pick it up you
pick it up from the actual casing of the instrument.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.120
Let's look at this little one here.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.220
I'm going to pick it up using the two straps.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.160
I'm going to make sure when I pick it up that
the strap is not accidentally over the keys,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.860
also very bad for the keys.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.960
I'm going to put it on.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.510
The straps that I have on this particular
accordion are made by a company called Hohner.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.399
Hohner is an outstanding company that services
accordions, and they happen to make these

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.930
particular back straps that have an awesome
connection in the back that snaps together

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.110
and sort of holds everything into place for
the accordion.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.250
I'm going to turn around and I'm going to
show you that.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.090
This is how it snaps together.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.970
That offers a balance in the accordion so
that it takes all of the weight off of your

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.970
lower back.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:27.200
Next, I'm going to unsnap the top of the accordion
and also the bottom of the accordion where

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.039
there's also a connection.

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.259
Then there's a leather strap on the side which
offers guidance for your left hand.

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.479
There's a connection on top that allows you
to tighten this or loosen this.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:51.039
That puts your left hand in place for all
of the base notes over here, and it leaves

00:01:51.039 --> 00:02:03.100
your right hand free to play all of the other
notes over here.
