00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.300
Where is it?

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.440
I know what just happened. I went to the bathroom.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.500
Thank you for the hologram leopard by the way - an unexpected pleasure

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.220
and my bedroom was completely missing.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.120
Just tell me where you put it.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.780
Hang on, I know what the problem is.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.440
Is this the first time he's brought a girl home?

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.300
Are you laughing?

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.460
You are, aren't you.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.840
What's so funny?

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.120
Blimey.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.480
That's some...

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.500
That's quite a selection.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.500
Dear God, that woman is made of legs, that's the most legs on any living human!

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.180
Okay, not the first then.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.480
This is the Doctor we're talking about.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.700
He's in a codependent relationship with a screwdriver.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.260
I mean if he had to choose between an enormous, complicated machine he could fix with a tool kit and a girl, who would he go with?

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.020
Yeah, you're right.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.140
Both of them, using the same tool kit. So, what do we do?

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.920
I give in.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.580
I'm going to go find my damn bedroom. Do your worst, can't wait to see your next trick.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.720
Who the hell are you?

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.960
You, from tomorrow night.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.400
Okay, where have you put it? Where's my bedroom?

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.580
This isn't funny, I'm exhausted, where is it?

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.240
You think you've got problems? We've got to share a bed.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.040
Oh dear God
