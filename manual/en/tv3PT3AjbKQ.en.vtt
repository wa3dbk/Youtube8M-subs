00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.370
Today, we're going to show you a fun twist
on a summer classic, lemonade.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.129
How about some grilled rosemary lemonade?

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:17.770
This is a really easy recipe and a really
tasty spin on the original classic.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.460
We've got here, about a dozen lemons that
we've cut in half.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.259
We're simply going to put these over a direct
fire on the charcoal grill.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.930
We're going to let these cook for about seven
to eight minutes.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.040
Let them get nice and caramelized.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.410
Might as well grill a few rounds while you're
at it, so you can have a nice garnish in each

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.550
glass.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.550
This is going to only take us about seven
or eight minutes to do on the grill.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.120
And then, we're going to let the lemons cool
off a little bit while we're doing that simple

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.120
syrup.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.291
So, we're going to let these guys cook a few
minutes and we're going to head inside and

00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:01.890
start the simple syrup.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.960
We've got our lemons off the grill and we're
now inside making our simple syrup.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.499
It's a simple recipe, just as the name "simple
syrup" says.

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:13.909
It's one part water, one part sugar.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.870
So, we're going to go ahead and turn our stove
on.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:26.979
We've got one and a half cups of water and
we're going to pour into that, one and a half

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.050
cups of just white sugar.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.850
Get a wooden spoon, stir that up, let the
sugar start to break down.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.219
And what's going to make this a unique simple
syrup, is we're going to take two of the lemons

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:46.609
that we grilled.

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.079
We're going to set the lemon, we've already
juiced them.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.850
So, this is just going to be the skins.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.979
That's going to pick up some of that lemon
and some of that grill flavor.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:05.189
And then, we're going to take about three
or four nice pieces of rosemary.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.250
Kind of break them in half and just stick
those in there.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:16.110
You want to bring this up to a boil and then
drop it down to a simmer and let it simmer

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.080
for about ten minutes or so, so all the flavors
in the lemon and rosemary can really incorporate.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.459
Once you get it into a simmer, about ten minutes,
then you're going to pull it off and you're

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.060
going to strain it because you don't want
any of the floating pieces of rosemary in

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.060
there.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.060
And then you're going to let it cool down.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.590
Put it in the refrigerator and then, we'll
be ready to make some grilled rosemary lemonade.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.510
We're just about ready to wrap up the grilled
rosemary lemonade and enjoy a nice, quenching,

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.580
refreshing drink.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.670
So, we've poured our simple syrup and a little
water into a pitcher with some ice.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.890
Because a good lemonade needs to be really
ice cold.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.560
And then we've juiced our lemons which we've
grilled.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.360
You can see it kind of has that tannish, charrish
look that you get when you're caramelizing

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.280
those lemons on the grill.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:13.030
We're going to just simply pour this into
the pitcher.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.330
Get our wooden spoon, give it a nice stir.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.629
Make sure you incorporate the lemon juice,
the simple syrup, the water that we put in

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:24.829
there.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.519
Now, the fun thing about these is how you
can garnish them.

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:43.469
I like to pour a couple of glasses...and 
one of the fun things about this drink is

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:45.260
this is a great drink for kids.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.490
Also a great drink for adults.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.680
You can make this a cocktail by simply adding
some rum or some vodka.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.060
Makes a great base for a margarita as well.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.810
So, we're going to take a piece of rosemary,
stick it in each glass.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.629
We're going to take a couple wedges of our
grilled lemon.

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.569
There you have it.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:16.500
A simple, refreshing summer drink puts a new
spin on an old classic.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.769
And it's a pretty darn good spin.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:21.840
Grilled rosemary lemonade.
