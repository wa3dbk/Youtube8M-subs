00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.160
right I'm in a nice moist little area
under some trees bit of a rockery going

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.559
on and a plant that you could put under
here is Cyclamen no effectively there's

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.750
two sorts of Cyclamen, there's coum and
hederifolium. Hederifolium are the autumn

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.189
flowery months and Coum are the spring
flowering ones they have these little

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.630
heads a pink that come up before the
leaves are showing and then the leaves

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.590
follow on afterwards which is spotted a
bit like a leopard but there they are on

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.320
a beautiful little flower and then
naturalized quite easily

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.950
now I'm flat planting header of foliage
but I'm planting both at the same time

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.370
it doesn't make any difference
they'll flower when it's their time to

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.649
flower now they look fairly uninspiring
a bit a bit like a small wisdom seed

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.170
potato but if you want to know about the
plant in the cup-shaped

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.559
you'll see some remnants of roots on the
bottom and the growing tip comes out at

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.300
the top and and that's it really you
plant them in a low depression probably

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.949
about half inch of soil on the top and
these just swell and they disappear the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.339
beauty of these is they just disappear
you forget you've planted them and then

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.119
suddenly you see these little pink
flowers and it gives you a shock it's

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.479
fantastic so all I'm doing is a small
depression because bear in mind they

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.780
want to be about half an inch above the
core and probably about two inches apart

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.860
it's more than enough they're just going
to swell up and actually flower for you

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.750
half an inch of soil on the top and
that's really all it takes there is

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.299
nothing more to do than that but next
spring or in the autumn time these will

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.170
actually look stunning so that's the
Hederifolium planted I'm going to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.899
plant Coum in a minute
and that will give me flowers next

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.470
spring these Hederifolium won't give
me flowers until next autumn but I'm a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.570
gardener so I'm an optimist that can
wait

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.920
because these little pink flowers that
will grow and naturalize and spread

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.490
through the rock raid through the border
I tell you what all of these little

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.840
surprises give you a real lift and
suddenly you'll turn around the you've

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.280
turned into a real gardener.
