00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.740
To make this tuna rice

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.300
the first thing that we must prepare is the areh

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.940
An areh is made of coconut milk

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.600
that is boiled with a little salt

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.880
We have to keep on stirring them until it thickens

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.178
Then we can go on to prepare 

00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:26.238
the rest of the ground spices

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.560
they are shallots

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.640
garlic, turmeric, ginger

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.144
and just enough chilies

00:00:32.144 --> 00:00:36.004
There will also be other spice base that we add 

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:39.124
into this ground spice that we are about to saute

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.100
I bought this tuna from the market

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.680
already smoked

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.640
But I’m still going to give some lime juice

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.380
and let it still for about 10 minutes

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.040
Later on, I will just shred the meat

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.980
To prepare the rice

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.320
we cooked the washed rice in hot boiling water

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.780
and stir it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.340
Put in bay leaves, lemon grass and pandan leaves

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.720
that has been tied like this

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.720
to give some aromas into the rice

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700
Then we add in the salt

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.160
As the rice becomes half-cooked

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.040
we must give it a slow stir

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.620
so that it doesn’t burn at the bottom

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.980
While waiting for the rice to cook, we prepare the spice

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.120
First, grind the turmeric

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.540
followed by the gingersliced

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.280
garlic, shallots and red chilies

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.860
Grind them until they become smooth

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.560
then take the smoked tuna

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.260
Now, tuna has got such a tough skin

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.700
so that we only use the meat

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.440
We shred the meat like this

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.500
We saute the ground spices

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.260
until their colour becomes brownish

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.580
Once we smell the aroma of the spices

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.000
then we add in the bay leaves

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.860
After that, we add in the shredded tuna

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.700
and mix until they are blended

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.680
and that the spices are well absorbed into the tuna

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.240
Add in salt

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.560
mix a little

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.100
and add in the tomato

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.605
and the spring onion

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.500
Mix again

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.540
Cook the tuna and the spices until the water is reduced

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.880
Add some thai basil to give some aroma and taste

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.440
Turn off the heat, and remove

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.500
Prepare the cooked rice

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.560
and some banana leaves as cover

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.580
On a banana leaf, place the rice in the middle

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.640
then press to make a hollow shape like this

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.560
The add the in the spiced tuna on top of the rice

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.840
and pour some areh that we’ve made before

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.040
Now that the rice is ready to be covered

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.160
press each side so they become solid

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.520
Then roll and cover tightly

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.640
Fold the ends like this

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.900
and pin in a bamboo stick on each side

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.820
The steamer that I’ve prepared before

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.320
have now given off its steam

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.640
which means that the water is well boiled

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.840
Now we are ready to steam the rice

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.640
until they are all well cooked

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.180
