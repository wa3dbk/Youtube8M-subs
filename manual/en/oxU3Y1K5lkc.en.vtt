00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:04.429
Welcome to Kinder Playtime!

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.020
Welcome Kinder Playtime friends!

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.840
Today we're going to have a little
competition...

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.200
...to see who is the strongest engine of them all.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.030
Let's see the contestants!

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.670
First we have Thomas: the famous blue
number one engine who loves to help his friends.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.119
Next we have James: a little cranky most of the time. Can he use this to his advantage?

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.559
Next is Henry: the green number three
engine. Come on, give him a round of applause!

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.500
Here comes Arthur: a very brave red engine. He is ready for some action!

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.760
Next steams Hiro: recently refurbished and brought back to life. Does he have what it takes?

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.460
Proud and arrogant, Spencer is next. Can he be the one to take the crown?

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.320
Here comes Gordon: the cheerful blue
number four engine. Come on and give him a cheer!

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.040
Bashful Toby is next. He is very different from the other engines. Can he win?

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.360
Stephen The Rocket has come to take the win. Can he live up to his name and become the rocket he is?

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.180
Thomas' best friend, Percy, is next! Small and friendly, he's just as capable of winning it all.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.540
Connor has come from a far-off land to bring pride to his friends!

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.380
Caitlin is ready for action - can she do
it?

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.560
Here's how it works: each train will head
off to see who can push the others off the tracks.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.740
Push their opponent off the tracks or back to their sides grants that train a win!

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.960
Lose the match and it's to the junkyard
for them!

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.150
Good luck! First off, we have Thomas
versus James!

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.130
James takes the win! Poor Thomas!

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.280
Next it's Henry versus Arthur!

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.880
Arthur takes the win! Better luck next
time, Henry!

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.780
Here comes two proud engines: Hiro and Spencer!

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.739
Spencer easily defeats Hiro. Bye, Hiro!

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.720
Who will when against Gordon? Could it be Toby?

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.640
Toby fights for the win!

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.540
Next up: Stephen The Rocket versus Percy!

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.340
Sthephen rolls right over Percy! Sorry, Percy. You lost.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.260
Connor and Caitlin's turn! Who will win this round?

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.420
Wow! Connor knocked Caitlin off the track!

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.879
Congratulations to all the semifinalists. Here we go! Red clashes with James and Arthur!

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.000
Arthur struggles, but takes the win!

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.560
Does Spencer have what it takes to defeat the rectangle-shaped Toby? Let's see...

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.560
I can't believe what I'm seeing! Toby takes the win!

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.940
What about Stephen The Rocket and Connor? Will Connor knock Stephen off the track?

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.300
No! Stephen pushes Connor back to his side, no issues.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.159
Welcome to The Finals! This is it! Can Arthur pil-drive Toby back to where he came from?

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.379
Of course not! Toby seems unstoppable!

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.250
Here's the final run! It's Toby! It's Stephen The Rocket! Only one can win!

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.720
I cannot believe my eyes! Toby has won! When it looked like Stephen would win, Toby succeeded.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.580
Congratulations, Toby!

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.220
Wait a second! Who is that? Its Lightning McQueen!

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.720
And he wants to challenge the winner of
the Thomas &amp; Friends Strongest Engine Competition.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.440
Can Toby win against Lightning McQueen?

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.240
Well, it looks like it was an even match

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.850
Toby and Lightning McQueen just could not win against each other.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.790
That's okay! It's fun to share our
successes with our friends.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.450
Thanks for watching!

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.240
