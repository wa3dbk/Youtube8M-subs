00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.433
THOMAS:
Hi, I'm Thomas Allen Pauly,

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:16.500
I'm an equestrian artist,
I've been painting horses

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500
since 1978.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.900
My studio is called
The Fine Art of Racing,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.733
it's located in the historic
Andersonville in Chicago.

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:27.833
(♪♪♪)

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:30.567
THOMAS:
In 2006 I was chosen
by Churchill

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:32.167
to be the official
portrait artist

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:35.100
of the Kentucky Derby
that year,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.667
and I did a painting
of Barbaro

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:41.500
and they made prints of it,
made 10,000 prints of it,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.900
and people were just lined up
waiting to have me sign them.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.533
(♪♪♪)

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.833
THOMAS:
The brushes have
a tendency to just bounce

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:58.467
and dance all over my canvas,
where before I used to labour

00:00:58.467 --> 00:00:59.867
with my paintbrushes.

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:02.867
This time I just put it down
and boom,

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:06.200
I go to the next colour,
put it down, boom,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.233
it's almost Impressionist,
it's making me paint looser,

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:11.933
which is something that I've
been wanting to do for years.

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:16.467
(♪♪♪)

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:19.467
THOMAS:
I can put the paint
exactly where I want it to go,

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:23.067
or drag it and make
a very nice sharp line,

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:24.767
where before
my other brushes

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:26.867
weren't permitting me
to do that.

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:30.967
(♪♪♪)

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:33.567
THOMAS:
These brushes are
very very easy to clean.

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:37.200
You just, especially since
I clean up with water,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.100
I just put it in there

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.733
and it just falls
right off the brushes,

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.767
and what's really really
nice about it is that

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:47.500
it retains its shape,
unlike the other brushes

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.400
where they would
just split apart

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.333
I can just put these here
and they dry very very fast.

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:57.767
(♪♪♪)

00:01:57.767 --> 00:01:59.233
THOMAS:
The painting that
I was working on today

00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:01.267
is a horse called Zenyatta.

00:02:01.267 --> 00:02:03.933
She was a World Champion mare

00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:06.933
that won numerous
Breeder's Cups,

00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:09.733
and this painting is done
in Santa Anita

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:12.433
when she won
the Breeder's Cup Classic.

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:13.900
It's going to be auctioned off

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.933
the day before the
Breeder's Cup in November,

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:19.033
and it will benefit

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:21.067
the Permanently Disabled
Jockeys Fund,

00:02:21.067 --> 00:02:25.267
which is a foundation
that I do a lot of work for,

00:02:25.267 --> 00:02:27.433
I do a lot of
their graphic arts,

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:31.533
and it's really
a benefit that is dear to me.

00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:38.267
