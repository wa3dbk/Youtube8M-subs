00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.740
Alright so here we are doing some night work
on a ’95 Jeep Grand Cherokee.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.520
We’re replacing the back shocks.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.860
Basically in this video we’ll show you how
to replace the back shocks on any Grand Cherokee

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.430
from ’92 to ’98 I believe.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.090
Anyway, so we start just by loosening the
nuts.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.119
This is an 18 millimeter.

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.700
I believe the other side is a 15.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.140
You’re twisting them off.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.140
These ones are pretty rusted on there.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.989
The one up here, there’s only one you got
to worry about; it’s an 18 millimeter as

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:38.989
well.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.410
What I’ve done, because these are rusty…if
you can see this…is I’ve taken my ratchet

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.149
and I’ve also attached a wrench onto the
end of it to kind of give me more leverage.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.280
So when I grab the wrench it kind of extends
my reach a little bit so I have more torque

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.379
on the bolt.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.590
Works out pretty well.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.010
I’ve already gotten it loosed up.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.760
So that’s what we’re doing right now.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.020
We’re releasing all the bolts.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.520
As you can see this thing is pretty hashed.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.060
It’s all rusted up.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.010
That’s what you get for living in those
southern states.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.290
What I’ll do on the bottom here is line
my 15 millimeter wrench up with that side.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.070
And I’m just letting it rest against the
ground so it will do all my holding work for

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:31.030
me and I can just press this forward and just
keep on ratcheting it as the wrench holds

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.400
the other side of the bolt steady.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.610
Right here you can see a considerable difference
in quality of shock.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.369
That one’s brand new and the other one’s
just freaking rusted.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.100
Anyway, so that’s the shock out of the vehicle.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.560
It’s just got these little nut head that
it sits in and then this little notch right

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.630
here that it also sits in.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.329
Pretty straight forward.

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.000
So when you’re installing it, it’s relatively
simple.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.729
You know, the top part, just because there’s
a sleeve on it, think about it as if water

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.009
was running down it wouldn’t go inside the
sleeve.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.090
The sleeve is here to protect it from, you
know, being like a cup and holding water up

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.120
and down.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.800
So as the car goes up and down it protects
the whole shock.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.090
Anyway, make sure the nut is on the inside
of the vehicle facing away from the tire.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.640
And the top has a washer on it as well.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.540
So make sure the big washer goes inside of
the nut.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.319
That’s how you install a shock on a Jeep
Grand Cherokee.

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.660
Probably one of the simpler shocks I’ve
done.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.460
Anyway, I do throw up videos on YouTube every
week or so, so if this helped you make sure

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.680
to “like” and subscribe.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.319
Just one last look at these awesome shocks.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.310
They’re the exact same on both sides.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:12.450
So it’s pretty simple to put on 
and off.
