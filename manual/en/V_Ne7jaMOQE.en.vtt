Hey everyone welcome back this is DHTV and
today I have a quick tip on how to fix your

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.240
lock button on your iPhone iPad or iPod Touch
Lets get started.

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.690
So if your lock button ever breaks or starts to become unresponsive, your not totally screwed. There is actually a way

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.410
you can use a setting to create a digital
lock button. So open up your settings application,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.740
you then want to scroll down to where it says
"General" and then were going to scroll down

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.930
to "Accessibility" and from here were going
to pretty much scroll down all the way to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.120
the bottom and you want to find "Assistive
Touch". So we will open that up and turn Assistive

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.100
Touch on. Basically this is going to create
a digital button. This can do various things,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.720
I showed you in another video how to create
a digital home button with it. If you do have

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.160
the broken lock button, what you would do
is tap on "Devices" from here and then tap

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.829
on "Lock Screen". So basically from this section
or basically anywhere on your phone, we will

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.959
just go to our home screen here. You can move
this where ever you want, it wont bother you

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:10.689
while your playing games. You can put it anywhere
on the screen and as soon as you need to lock

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:16.459
your phone you just tap on it click "Devices"
and then click "Lock Screen". Now obviously

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:20.679
your going to need to use your home button
and swipe to unlock but as you can see here

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.020
the digital lock button is still available
to you. You can do various things through

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.649
that. Now if you want more information on
Assistive Touch and a full tutorial I will

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.340
link you with that in the description down
below. So, definitely check that out if you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.249
want more information on this feature. For
lock screen problems basically click "Device"

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:44.249
and then "Lock Screen". But if your phone
does die or it turns off for some reason,

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.259
you will need to plug it up to your charger
and that should give you the ability to bring

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.340
it back to life. Obviously it needs to have
at least enough of a charge to turn it back

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.829
on. It will turn on automatically but you
still have to use this. It's just a temporary

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.799
solution to lock your screen. Anyway guys,
