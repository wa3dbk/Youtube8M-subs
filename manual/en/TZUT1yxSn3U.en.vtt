00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.490
Hello Quilters! We're going to show you a
quick method to get good bobbin tension on

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.630
your longarm machine.
Tension adjustments are usually made for the

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.330
top thread in order to allow the machine to
run decorative threads.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.050
There are times however, when it may be necessary
to make adjustments to the bobbin tension.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.380
If you use a fine and smooth thread in the
bobbin, you may need to tighten the tension.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.010
If you use a very heavy thread in the bobbin,
you may need to loosen your bobbin tension.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.199
Adjusting your bobbin tension is done by turning
the large screw on the bobbin case.

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:41.199
To loosen, turn to the left (counter clockwise).
To tighten, turn to the right (clockwise).

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.229
Think of the tension screw as the face of
a clock. Each adjustment should be about a

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:51.929
quarter turn or 15 minutes.
We recommend the TOWA bobbin gauge, as it

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:55.769
gives us a numerical value for what the tension
is set at.

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.839

bobbin gauge.

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.979
If you don't have a TOWA gauge, there's a
quick tension test you can do.

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.000
Place the bobbin case in the palm of your
hand and grab the thread tail in the other

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.969
hand. Lift the bobbin up. If the bobbin comes
off your hand, the tension is too tight and

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:21.859
we need to loosen the tension. If the bobbin
doesn't stand up, the tension is too loose

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:27.100
and we'll need to tighten it.
The correct tension we want is when the bobbin

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:35.420
stands up and spins freely within the case.
If the bobbin tension is too tight, your stitches

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.420
won't look pretty and your top thread may
break. If the bobbin tension is too loose,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.579
you may see looping on top.
When your tension is just right, you will

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.929
have even stitches.
If you find that the tension is still uneven

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.939
after you've made adjustments, slide a pin
between the tension spring and wall of the

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.920
bobbin case and dislodge any lint that may
be hiding out.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.819
By making simple adjustments to your bobbin
tension, you will be able to use a larger

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.080
variety of threads.
