Baptiste,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.570
The Marauders are showing no signs of surrender. we got to put an end to this.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.839
Daylight's coming.

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.939
Have you ever saw a good sunrise? No.

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.939
Well, here it comes.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.670
well if you ask me, I think Zorin's behind this.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.130
we can"t risk that.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.080
but just to be safe

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.900
i have something to give you

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.830
Yeah?

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.390
What?

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.930
You want me to kill Zorin?

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.220
Yes,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.760
just so nothing can go wrong

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.950
C'mon it won't bite.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.280
Alright.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.700
looks like it's the end of the line for you.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.700
We shall see.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.950
Yeah, really good.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.609
Nice job, for a pistol.

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:10.609
I know

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.439
I try.

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.769
I practice every day.

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.680
we need to get into the chopper.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.680
we can't keep that colonel waiting.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:37.049
We can't keep the colonel waiting.

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.230
we wouldn't want that.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.159
Huh

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:57.159
(sigh)

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.709
(Engine powers up, chopper blades whip air)

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.129
not bad

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.109
Not bad.

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.239
The credit goes to Ortiz here.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.049
without him

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.189
Zorin would still be alive in he would
keep coming back

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:40.919
well As standard orders say,

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.399

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:26.729

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.229

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:51.229
