HTC One X+.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.270
Expected Q4 2012.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.750
An update to the original One X launched earlier
this year, the HTC One X+ is a quad-core Android

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.610
4.1 smartphone that offers a number of improvements
all around plus a slightly refreshed design

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.020
to keep the One X+ competitive.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.910
On the front is a 4.7" 720 x 1280 pixel LCD
2 touchscreen with a Gorilla Glass 2 coating.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.480
On the back is an 8 megapixel camera with
LED flash and 1080p HD video recording, plus

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.810
there is a 1.6 megapixel 720p capable camera
on the front for video calling.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.579
The One X was one of the fastest smartphones
on the market, the One X+ boosts the processor

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:08.329
speed from 1.5GHz to a 1.7GHz NVIDIA Tegra
3 AP37 CPU with 1GB of RAM, which HTC says

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.720
is up to 67% faster than the previous version.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.270
Internal flash storage has been upgraded to
64GB from 32GB (although there's no microSD

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.319
slot) and the battery is now a 2100 mAh unit
compared to 1800 mAh in the original, which

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:31.950
HTC say can power the phone for up to 50%
longer.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.139
All the expected Android features are here
including 3.5G support (but not LTE in the

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:43.590
standard model), WiFi, GPS and GLONASS position
systems, Bluetooth and the One X+ is also

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.520
NFC capable.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:55.479
The HTC One X+ measures 134 x 70 x 8.9mm and
weighs 135 grams.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.719
Shipping with Android 4.1 out of the box,
the HTC One X+ eliminates the need to fiddle

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.219
about with upgrades.

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.740
HTC also confirm that 4.1 updates will be
available for the original One X and the One

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.370
S "soon".

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.720
HTC say that improvements have also been made
to the camera, and the One X+ also features

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.650
the well-regarded Beats Audio system.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.470
HTC Sense has also been upgraded, and expect
to find a number of other enhancements here

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.440
and there.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.950

shipping in Europe and North Asia during October

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.120
2012, South Asia in November and there will
be a North American version at some point

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.120
as well.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.909
No guidance was given on price, but we would
expect it to retail for around â‚¬550 when

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:44.709
it hits the shops.
