00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.170
I'm going to show you how to make an Icord.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.170
For this you're going to need double pointed
needles.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.080
So, I've got four stitches cast on to this
double pointed needle.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:24.529
For the first row, I'm going to knit them
like normal, one, two, three, four, now if

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.099
I were going to knit this in rows I would
then turn it around and do something on the

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.099
back.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.270
However, do not turn it around, what you're
going to do is, you're going to slide it with

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.579
the same face facing you to the other end
of the same needle and insert this needle

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.809
and knit the four again.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.590
But, this time, your yarn is going to be coming
from the fourth stitch instead of the first

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.590
stitch where it should have been coming from
had you worked at the back.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:01:03.289
So, again, knit one, two, three, four, do
not turn, do not do anything just slide it

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:09.370
down, switch the blank needle to your right
hand and knit the four again.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.050
So, when you pull the yarn from that fourth
stitch around to knit the first, what you're

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.960
doing is sort of, making a little tube.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.080
That's why it's called a cord.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.140
And, here it is again, there's the yarn coming
from that fourth side, you're going to pull

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.070
it tight here when you knit the first stitch,
which then sort of pulls the back together

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.640
and makes it round.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.920
And the I in Icord, short for idiot, which
is no longer really proved terminology, but

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.090
the idea behind idiot cord was that this was
so simple that anyone could learn it.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.490
So, if it's confusing you, don't worry, just
practice you will get it.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.750
Finish the row, slide it down, I'm showing
you on bulky yarn but you could use any size

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.610
yarn and really any number of stitches up
to a point.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.450
Smaller numbers of stitches are what we usually
see.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.819
That's an Icord, there's the back, there's
the front, it's nice and round.

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.209
But, an Icord by itself is only so useful,
there's a way to do an attached Icord.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.909
I'm going to show you here on this piece of
garter stitch.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.870
So we've got garter stitch in the middle with
attached Icords on the side which is a little

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.270
more complicated.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:36.290
So, here I am working across one side of my
garter stitch and I've got a three stitch

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.659
Icord on both sides.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:44.069
So, because I want the yarn to be coming from
here, when I knit that stitch on the other

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:52.939
side, I'm going to pass the yarn to the front
and slip these three stitches over.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.999
Then when I turn it around I'm ready to knit
this first stitch with the yarn that's coming

00:02:57.999 --> 00:02:58.999
from over here.

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:07.709
So, I'm going to knit nice and tightly, two,
three and that sort of pulls these three stitches

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.170
around to make an attached Icord.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:22.090
Let's just shoot over to the other side and
see if we can do it over there.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:30.900
You can do attached Icords on the bottom brim
of hats, on the cuffs and necklines of sweaters,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.940
you can do them hanging down from earflaps
as low tassel holders.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.739
So here we are.

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:45.209
Now this time, what we're going to do is we're
going to leave the yarn in the back and we're

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:55.201
going to slip these three stitches over and
we're going to purl these stitches so that

00:03:55.201 --> 00:04:00.389
we can maintain the stockinette stitch of
our Icord and the yarn is coming from here

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.930
which is good, that means it's going to pull
this closed.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.840
So this time, we're going to purl three with
the yarn coming from all the way over here,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.549
but working the first stitch.

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:22.110
And then I'm going to move the yarn and continue
to knit my garter stitch.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:29.560
I'm just going to pull this stockinette tube
shut and I'll be working this one as illustrated

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.560
before.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.850
So that is how to do an attached Icord.
