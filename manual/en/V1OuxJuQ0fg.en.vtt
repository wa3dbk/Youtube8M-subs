00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:22.130
Have you ever wondered why so many of our
Easter stories present a risen Christ who

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.800
is unrecognizable even to his best friends?
Mary, thinking she has encountered a gardener

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.960
or the two disciples on the road to Emmaus
who spend an entire afternoon in Bible study

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.960
with the risen Jesus and see only a stranger.
Or Paul, who sometime later on the road to Damascus

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.600
overwhelmed by a strange light and voice cries
out, "who are you?"

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.350
Such Resurrections stories are needed so we
understand that it is a strange business,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.350
different from the ordinary everyday, we need
to realize that Jesus Christ comes to us in

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.320
disguise in our times, perhaps only visible
to those who have eyes to see or ears to hear.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.590
We are called to have a framework of interpretation
if we are to understand Easter in our own

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.979
time. I, I call it Gospel clues. So we turn
to the story of Mary and she has her Easter

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.170
moment when she is named in love by Jesus
or to the disciples en route to Emmaus who

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:48.389
discover Christ when bread is broken and a
meal, an ordinary meal is shared. We need

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.119
to put on Resurrection glasses so that we
see the ordinary events of our lives in a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.819
new way almost in a third dimension, a fourth
dimension. It's almost like looking at a

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:06.819
3-D picture with our eyes slightly out of
focus and then all of a sudden a busy patchwork

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.119
of colour and dots emerges into a new and
underlying image. Listen to this poem by Jane

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.460
Hirschfield, "Meeting the Light Completely,
and she says:

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.810
Even the long beloved was once an unrecognized
stranger

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.070
Even so, the chipped lip of a blue glazed
cup,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.860
Brown field of a yellow curtain might also,
flooding and falling ruin

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.580
our hearts.
A table painted in roses, an empty clothesline

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.580
Just this way, the found world always surprises,
That is its nature and then as lovers have

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.020
always said
"What fools we were not to have seen".

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.860
Which is what I am feeling right here at the
Christian Resource Centre at the heart of

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.860
Regent Park, what fools we are not to see
the presence of the Resurrected Christ here

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.360
where there is shelter for the homeless and
food for the hungry. And I remember the words

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.650
of Jesus where he said, "in as much as you
do it for the least of these, you do it to

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.130
me", not "for" me, not "because of
"me but "to" me. When we engage in that

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.660
kind of work and connection with other people
we will have a Resurrection moment. Surely

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.660
when a meal is shared as it is here we are
discovering Emmaus made real here in Toronto.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.820
Or, when people are included, respected and
honoured and named, surely this is Mary's

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.320
story brought into our own times. For you
see, Easter is not an event that happened

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:08.020
simply a thousand, two thousand years ago.
Easter is a verb. Easter is an action that

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.800
keeps repeating itself over and over. The
poet Gerard Manley Hopkins maybe said it best,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.800
"Oh God, Easter in us and be a dayspring
to the dimness in us."

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:28.479
"Oh God, Easter in us and be a dayspring
to the dimness in us." That's my Easter

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:36.169
wish for you, for me, for all of us. Have
a blessed and real and very present Easter.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.580
Amen.
