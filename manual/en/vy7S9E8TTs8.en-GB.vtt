00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.029
Keying; 6 letter verb. Abbreviated from Chroma
Key. Meaning; The act of cutting out a green

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.619
screen from an image using a number of complex
algorithms inside a piece of editing software.

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:18.621
In our case, PhotoKey 7 Pro, the most powerful
piece of keying software you can get! And

00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:23.290
because our clever programmers deal with all
the complex math, all you have to do is drag

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.340
in your green screen image and let PhotoKey
7 Pro go to work!

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.419
However, knowing that sometimes green screen
images require more detail and attention for

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.730
a successful cut out, PhotoKey 7 Pro features
a number of great, easy-to-use, professional

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.850
tools that have been designed for the challenges
that can arise when making green screen photography.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.850
In this tutorial, I’m going to show you
my essential Keying techniques in PhotoKey

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.850
7 Pro and how to easily deal with some of
the problems when editing green screen images.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.390
Introducing our lovely PhotoKey Bride, Emma.
You can download this image for free over

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.339
at the Learn page of the PhotoKey website,
or alternatively, it can be found in the installer

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:00.190
files of your software. The image contains
three of the most difficult elements to deal

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.780
with when shooting green screen Photography…
Green screen light spill, tricky translucent

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.680
textures and those really annoying stray frizzy
hairs! A right ol' pain to deal with in editing,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.370
but perfect for the purposes of this tutorial.
So we’ve imported our background image already

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.860
and checked the box here at the bottom to
hide it, we'll bring it in later. Next let’s

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.020
bring in our foreground image and you can
see that PhotoKey 7 Pro will automatically

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.820
remove the green screen backdrop. Great job
PhotoKey 7 Pro! However, you can see that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.170
with a few small tweaks, this cut out will
be well on its way to absolute perfection.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.360
So, firstly, let’s select KEY from the toolset
and take a look at the important adjustment

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.310
fields over in the toolbox. The Auto Chroma
Key field is my first area to dive into when

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.350
starting any new cut out.
You have the ability to switch between several

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.600
views when making adjustments; Result, which
will show you the full colour image. Matte,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.500
which depicts transparent areas as black,
solid areas as white and any translucent areas

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.810
as grey. Status is a more detailed version
of Matte, showing every translucent pixel

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.840
in the image as a midtone grey. I usually
make my adjustments in the status view and

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.670
then check the changes in the results view
giving me technical accuracy as well as creative

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.600
control. We can see that we still have a lot
of alpha detail from the green screen in the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.870
background... Go to Clip Background and move
the slider. You’ll see the grey pixels turning

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.840
to black which means they are disappearing.
Great! Go too far, however, and you’ll begin

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.820
to eat into your foreground alpha and make
our Bride look like she is dissolving! I’d

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.831
advise using the status view to make this
adjustment and ensure accuracy. Next go to

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:50.290
‘Clip Foreground’ and pull the slider
across. What you'll see is grey pixels turning

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.280
white… or in other words, the transparent
pixels becoming solid. Once again…Fantastic!

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.160
This is exactly what we want it to do. Let’s
switch to the Results view and look at her

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.480
headwear, though. We can see that by moving
the Clip Foreground slider all the way to

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.780
the left, we have turned her lovely transparent
veil into a solid area. This will look very

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.349
odd when we bring up our background image
and can be addressed with some further refinement

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:21.099
provided by the ‘Clip Rollback’ slider)
Clip Rollback will intelligently tidy up the

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.630
edges of our cut out and is just perfect for
transparent areas like transparent materials

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.690
and areas of stray hair.
Should you then wish to, the ‘Erode/Expand’

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.801
adjustment can be used to make finishing touches
to the edges but do be warned. (2.00) This

00:03:34.801 --> 00:03:39.230
only requires the lightest of touches or you
may end up creating your very own abstract

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.900
Picasso. Use the Gain and Gamma sliders to
tidy up any remaining background alpha aaand,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.640
there we go… (Toggle between status and
Result view) A great clean cut out.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.800
All we need to do now is address these areas
of green that you will have noticed around

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.450
our bride's hair and dress. This is caused
by Spill, every green screen photographer’s

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.319
absolute nightmare, and is the result of light
from the green screen reflecting back onto

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.220
the subject. It’s always good practice to
address spill when setting up your lighting

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.190
and green screen; more information can be
found over on the Learn page. But, hey, we

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.989
all know that Spill happens, and never fear…
PhotoKey 7 Pro features the new and powerful

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.560
Spill Simulation Pro which will make short
work of any unsightly green areas in your

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.550
foreground. Select the Spill Suppression from
the toolbox, and you can see that automatically,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.330
the spill suppression already gets to work
and does a great job. However, with particularly

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.620
bad cases of spill, you will need to adjust
the sliders to achieve absolute perfection!

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.100
Make sure you’re in Result view so you can
see the image in full colour and slide the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.620
‘Hue Range’ over to the far extremes.
You can see that moving the slider to the

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.210
left makes the green a little more prominent.
Moving the slider to the far right, turns

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.020
our PhotoKey Bride a funny shade of magenta,
however, if we slowly move the slider back

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.560
from here towards the centre we start to see
that the magenta hue fades and the green spill

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.449
is gone! Any minor tweaks can be made by adjusting
the Balance and Hue Balance sliders and I

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.840
always check the Luminance levels in the spill
replacement that can cause a blocky feel to

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.710
any areas of fine edge detail.
Light wrap is a great way of adding an extra

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.520
level of realism into the blending between
your foreground and background images, allowing

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.820
you to simulate ambient light wrapping around
your subject. I’m going to stick with the

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.970
default blend mode, Lighten, and move the
slider until I have a nice subtle halo of

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.919
light casting around our model. Lighten is
the mode that is the most useful over a broad

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.600
range of images so I end up using this one
the most. I would, however, encourage you

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.880
to get to know the other blending modes by
selecting them from the drop down menu and

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.200
pulling the slider to the far right and then
the far left and looking closely at the edge

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.390
of your foreground image for the differences.
There we go… Keying done! Other refinement

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.160
options are in the Key Toolbox for you to
utilise but the ones that I have covered in

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.759
this tutorial are, in my workflow, the essential
elements when working with PhotoKey 7 Pro.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.780
