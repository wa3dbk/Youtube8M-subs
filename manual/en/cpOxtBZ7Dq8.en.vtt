00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.620
&gt;&gt; Serena: 1 ... 5, 6, 7. And 1, 2, 3 .. 5,
6, 7. And 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ...

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.680
&gt;&gt; Nick: Hi, welcome to Dance Papi. I'm Nick,
this is Serena. We're from Salsa Vale Todo

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.900
and the Salsa Rueda Festival. Today we're
going to show you a Cuban salsa move which

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.540
is called Sencillo.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.800
So, Sencillo begins with an outside turn,
and you're going to switch your hand on the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.940
7 of your Guapea, so it looks like this. 1,
2, 3, 5, 6, I'm going to switch my hand on 7.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.940
&gt;&gt; Serena: So, notice it's the leader's right
hand, and the follower's right hand, thus

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.820
we are cross-handed.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.160
&gt;&gt; Nick: So, leaders step in place, and on
3, leaders, you're going to lift the hand

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.030
up and to your left. And that's going to be
your right hand. So, we're going to step,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.110
1, 2, 3, so notice I picked it up, and it's
going to my left slightly, elbow is still

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.160
down, and my hand is slightly facing her.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.340
&gt;&gt; Serena: Followers, this is our lead to
turn on 5, 6, 7. So on 5, 6, 7 we crossover

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.740
on our left on 5, we step in place 6, we face
our partner on 7.

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:16.350
&gt;&gt; Nick: And leaders while she's turning,
you're going to simply step in place to make

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.909
sure that she keeps the time. From here you
go into an Enchufla, just like you've learned

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.719
in a previous video, but notice you're now
doing it in cross-hand. Doesn't matter, it's

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:33.439
exactly like the other enchufla that you've
learned. Switch sides by 3. 1, 2, 3.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.900
&gt;&gt; Serena: OK, so here on 5, 6, 7, followers
are going to walk behind the leader, actually

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.440
we're going to end up where the leader is
now.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.239
&gt;&gt; Nick: Leaders, you're going to pass in
front of your follower, and you're going to

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:51.619
end up where you follower is now. So, you're
going to step on 5, we're going to cross on

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.329
6, and you're going to face each other on
7.

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.819
&gt;&gt; Serena: And notice that he switched hands,
moving the follower's hand from his right

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:04.719
hand to his left, so now leader's left is
connected, and follower's right is connected.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.260
&gt;&gt; Nick: And from here, you're going to do
just a simple Enchufla, just like you learned

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:17.969
in a previous video. 1, 2, 3, together, 5,
6, 7, of course Dile Que No, 5, 6, 7.

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:23.209
And now we'll show you the whole thing, all
the way through, switching on 7. 1, 2, lift.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.549
&gt;&gt; Serena: I do my outside turn.

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.629
&gt;&gt; Nick: Enchufla, pass in front.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.240
&gt;&gt; Nick: Enchufla, together, Dile Que No.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.900
And we'll show you from the other side.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.340
Here we go, from Guapea we go. 1, 2, 3, switch
the hand on 7.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.260
&gt;&gt; Serena: Outside turn, I turn 5, 6, 7.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.900
&gt;&gt; Nick: Enchufla.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.620
&gt;&gt; Serena: Switch hands.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.500
&gt;&gt; Nick: Enchufla.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.830
&gt;&gt; Serena: Come together...

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.080
Dile Que No.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.980
&gt;&gt; Nick: We're going to do Sencillo to music.
Remember, leaders switch hands on 7.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:15.160
&gt;&gt; Serena: 5, 6, 7. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. 1 ... 5,
6, 7. And 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.340
And 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And 1, 2, 3 ...

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.340
&gt;&gt; Nick: OK, we're going to switch sides,
and show you from the other side.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.880
&gt;&gt; Nick: Here we go.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:33.300
&gt;&gt; Serena: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. 1, 2,
3, 5, 6, 7. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.040
And 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. And 1.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.140
&gt;&gt; Nick: Thanks for watching guys, that was
Sencillo and we'll see you next time on Dance Papi
