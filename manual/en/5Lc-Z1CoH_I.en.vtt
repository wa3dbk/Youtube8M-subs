Kuru Kuru Yume Land game is today's toy.

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:10.907
Wow!!

00:00:10.907 --> 00:00:12.648
They look like rooms!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.447
All this stuff was inside.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.650
OK, let's make Baikin Castle first.

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:24.580
Alright, I'll put stickers on the bakery.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.479

(Everest is the mountain of butts…)

00:00:30.608 --> 00:00:38.008
Baikin Castle

00:00:38.358 --> 00:00:39.613

00:00:53.967 --> 00:00:58.992
I was supposed to meet Anpanman here…

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:00.833
I wonder when he'll get here…

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:01.858
Let's go!

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.783
Uncle Jam, are you baking any bread today?

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:12.808
Yes, I am, but Anpanman, aren't you supposed to meet Melonpanna-chan today?

00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:15.375
Oh no, you're right! I gotta go!

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.491
I'm going on a trip!

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.783
But I'm not going to Baikin Castle!!!

00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:27.933
I'm Anpanman

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.833
Ferris wheels are fun!

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:34.375
Oh no, it's too fast, let me off!!!

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.983
Baikinman, bring me a cookie!

00:01:37.983 --> 00:01:42.370
No! Now I'm getting ready to defeat Anpanman!

00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:45.280
We put them all together, now I'm going to turn the crank…

00:01:47.558 --> 00:01:50.360
Wow! Look at all of them go!

00:01:56.816 --> 00:02:00.580
We're going backwards! This is scary!!!

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:07.690
He's riding with Melonpanna… I'm going home…

00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:12.180
Anpanman's Kuru Kuru Yume Land was lots of fun!
