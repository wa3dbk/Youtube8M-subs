00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.910
My name is Shaun Goodman I’m the Project
System Engineer for the SMAP Project, Soil

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.740
Moisture Active and Passive.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.320
Working with my team to develop the spacecraft,
to develop the mission, how best to do the

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.090
testing for the system.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.730
Any technical issues we might have encountered
or things that we feel need to be addressed

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.300
to increase the success of the mission.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.970
It’s looking at the top five centimeters
of moisture in the soil, and that’s important

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.420
because that layer of moisture is part of
what controls our climate.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.670
Water is everything to all of us.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.399
So once we conduct this mission and gain some
information about soil moisture, we’ll be

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.870
able to better-forecast climate we’ll be
able to better to forecast droughts and floods.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.670
Those are critical elements of course for
farming, for food.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.860
It’ll also help us understand how carbon
interacts with the planet so that we understand

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:06.810
better what climate change might be impacted
by carbon uptake or carbon dioxide uptake.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.850
When I started to understand that spacecraft
are robots, I thought well this is great it

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.350
could work, I got the job offer, I thought
who turns down a job offer at NASA and two

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.510
I get to work with robots and space it’s
the best thing I ever could have imagined.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.280
When I was younger there weren’t a lot of
ethnic role models for me.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.110
I certainly didn’t know any; I didn’t
know any other African Americans that were

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.590
in science at all.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.680
Because society had been limited right in
opportunities at that time, there weren’t

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.720
a lot of people I could reach out to or look
to for that kind of example.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.960
Over time that certainly changed and I can
feel it now, I imagine people like myself

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.000
are people who can help mentor, I certainly
mentor from a variety of different backgrounds.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.590
But it’s easily the best job I’ve ever
had.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.829
It’s a great atmosphere to work in, the
people really care about the things that they

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.540
do, they’re technically oriented.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.220
You feel a responsibility to the American
public.
