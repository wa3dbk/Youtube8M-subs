00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
It's time for 'Food Adventure Program for Awesome People'

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.820
The inky edition

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.660
Because squids are inky and we get a squid on a stick

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.360
it makes sense

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:15.880
Clever :)

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.940
Ok let's go get some...ridiculous, delicious street food

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.940
Na na na na na na!

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.940
It makes sense!

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.940
Ok squid on a stick, squids are inky

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.200
My joke is good, it's legit and this is legit

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.920
DAMN! 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.920
We came here as nobody

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.280
Now there's a line

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.120
See we're trendsetters here in Korea

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.400
We dictate the tastes of the people

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.400
No we don't, we just got lucky

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.820
Thank you

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.680
Ohhhh yes

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.680
Spicy

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.620
*Giggling*

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.620
You gotta be careful when you eat though

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.140
You got two sticks here that could stab you in the eyehole

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.220
Murder you!

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.700
Be careful and why did I say eyeholes

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.180
Because Leigh says eyeholes all the time

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.440
And damn you for ruining my vocabulary Leigh

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.300
They just cover a giant wet squid in egg

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.020
Rolled in flour and just deep fried it for 2 and a half minutes

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.120
Oooohhhhh... mmmmm... oh yeaaahh

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.720
Alright I know some people back home are gonna be like "That's the grossest thing ever"

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.400
You really get used to eating the entire squid in Korea to begin with

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.160
And this is delicious!

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
It's like tender, perfectly cooked

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.240
I used to hate squid before I came to Korea but this is some of the 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.240
 best squid I've ever had in my entire life

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.520
Forget about calamari with the squirted lemon and all that

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.200
That has nothing on this

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.820
This is glorious

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.980
You take a couple bites, your teeth go right through it easly

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.660
I don't like raw squid but this is I'll have in a heartbeat

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.180
You know what this actually tastes like?

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.680
What?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.640
Getting KFC

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.800
Like that deep fried battered chicken except you just replaced it with squid 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.140
Squid tastes like chicken

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.620
Heeey Leigh...I know you wanna try some squid 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.240
I do

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.840
What is the name of Junsoo's new song? 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.260
For one squid leg

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.960
No

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.620
Ding ding ding ding ding! You got it! I pick my nose sometimes

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.700
Tell her that she's won a piece of yours

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.760
But that's mine!

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.700
Simon's licked his fingers a million times 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.220
Let me just say

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.920
This is not date food  

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.480
There's nothing sexy about this

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.060
I'm dirty, I'm messy, this is falling all over the place 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.820
You cannot maintain your dignity

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.980
What are you talking about? So sexy

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.140
So that's it for this week's 'Food Adventure Program for awesome people'

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.240
If you wanna know how to get to this awesome palce

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.320
Click on our blog link, right here, we're gonna give you a map about how to get here

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.100
You're gonna love it 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.300
I feel like there are so many new exchange students right now that just came to Korea

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.300
Now is the time of year to experience something new

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.940
And you know what? I bet you it won't be here in the summertime

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.160
Cause you never know, things always change, it'll probably be an ice-cream stand by then so..

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.800
Get your squid on people!

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.820
While you can

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.920
