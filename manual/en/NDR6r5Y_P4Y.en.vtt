00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:18.110
CREWS WORK TO REMOVE THE DEBRIS
BUT PROGRESS IS SLOW DUE TO

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.500

Jeff Barber
MU Extension Architect “We can see some

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.710
scratches on the
outside of it that indicate that it had debris

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.370
on it, or
was actually impacted by debris and so whoever

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.460
was in there had one heck of a ride.”

HAROLD NOIRFALISE TOOK SHELTER

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.820
IN HIS SAFE ROOM JUST MOMENTS
BEFORE THE TORNADO HIT.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.969
TWO YEARS AGO WHEN THEY BOUGHT
THE HOUSE, HAROLD AND HIS WIFE WERE

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.380
NOT HAPPY WITH THE SAFE ROOM…IT
TOOK UP TOO MUCH SPACE IN THE

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.380
GARAGE.

like it

a little bit more.”

SW Missouri Home Builders Association
“After being through an event like we have

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.679
been in Joplin, I would venture to guess that
there

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.750
are people that will say, this will never
happen to

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.369
me again.”

that with small adjustments could be made

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.200
into a
room that you could walk into and trust to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.450
ride out
the storm.”

Claire Adrian
Tornado Survivor“We were very much aware

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.979
that the house
was coming down around us, however I always

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.150
felt safe.”
SAFE ROOMS TYPICALLY COST

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.580
BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE-THOUSAND
DOLLARS.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.229

(SOT) “You really can’t put a price tag
on it and

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.210
it’s an impact that we really can’t measure
until

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.210
after the storm.”
