00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.380
Howdy, folks.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.380
It's Barry here from My Virgin Kitchen.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.910
I'm in the Videojug kitchen and today it's
part of my playlist 'Good Food Good Times'.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.140
Nice amazing, unintimidating recipes that
you're going to love.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.060
Today it's a quinoa chili served bunny chow
style, which is hollowed out bread.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.389
I'll show you that later.

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.529
Let's get on and make it, and I really hope
you give it a try.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.320
[music]
This recipe couldn't be simpler.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.939
So first thing you need is a nice, hot pan,
so we're going to chuck some olive oil in

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.480
there first of all and we're going to soften
up our red onion.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.520
So I've got some red onion that I've chopped
up.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.800
It's just one red onion like that, nice and
fine, so we'll get it in there.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.230
The onions going to cook away nice and soft,
about five minutes.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.940
So just work it round that high heat, get
it really softened and break down.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.050
So what we'll see here is we've got a lovely
color on there, and with color, folks, comes

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.050
flavor.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.780
Now that's a really important life lesson
for you, but anyhow, we must move on.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.780
Here is some nice chopped garlic.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.390
I'm just going to push that in there.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.630
It's only going to take about one minute or
so just to brown through, so that's why the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.470
onion got priority.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.470
Some mild chili powder.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.000
About a teaspoon of that, but feel free to
ramp it up and make it as strong as you like.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.519
This is going to be quite a mild chili.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.289
And again, cumin.

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:09.450
About a teaspoon of that, maybe a heaped teaspoon
if I'm feeling a little kinky today.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.000
So let's just stir it through, get it nice
and coated on there.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.619
Let it stain the onions and the garlic.

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.189
Just about a minute on there and then we're
going to chuck a load of stuff in this party.

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.859
If you're going to try this recipe, guys,
don't forget all the ingredients and the method

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.890
are down below in the description box, so
give it a try.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.920
Right folks, the color in there is looking
good, the smell is like a boudoir of flavor

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.450
heaven, you're in it with me.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.450
Let's carry on.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.450
We're going to get some tomatoes in here.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.399
This is a tin of chopped tomatoes.

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.600
Not just one, but two.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.860
Good heaped teaspoon of oregano.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.639
mix that through a little bit.

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:45.179
Good times.

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.170
And you see that's really soothed it down
now.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.421
The onion and the garlic is thanking it.

00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:50.779
It's a little bit cooler now.

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:52.810
The flavors are so good in there, I'm loving
it.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.560
Here is a tin of mixed beans in water.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.310
I'm going to tip a little bit of the water
in there to give it something to simmer off

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.409
later on.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.409
Mix that through.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.409
It's really cool.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.990
Nice texture in there, that's what that's
going to add.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.319
We need to add some more veg in there.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.549
The tomatoes did their thing but we've got
some chopped courgette here.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.030
This is one courgette here that I've chopped
into sort of half and then half again, so

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.320
it's kind of like a triangle or a happy face.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.850
So in that goes, like so.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.110
It's going to really soften up in there.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.110
It's going to be so good.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.140
In here I've got a bowl of peppers and also
sweet bell peppers that have been chopped

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.140
and deseeded.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.750
If you want to ramp it up a bit, you could
use scotch bonnets, you know, for that extra

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.750
kick.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.750
But these are just going to go in.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.170
We're going for a nice, kind of sweet feel
on the chili.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.830
So I'll mix this all through, get it all nice
and coated in there.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.080
So all we do is simply season it, so a good
sprinkling of salt there.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.240
Nice big chunk of salt crystals going on,
and then an extra grinding of pepper in there.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.750
I hope you'll agree it's a little bit of a
color fest going on in that pan.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.950
The good news is you get to now just chill
out for about 15 minutes, so if you're enjoying

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.590
this video, don't forget to give it a thumbs
up, comment, share and subscribe to both my

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.670
Virgin Kitchen and the Videojug food channel.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.420
We've got something to do with a bunny in
a bit, involving the bread, but as I say,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.150
just subscribe and chill out for a bit.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.590
Okay, so that's had a good 15 minute simmer
and it's time to add in our quinoa.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.120
Now if you don't know what this is, it's kind
of like the buzz thing at the moment.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.120
It's like a posh couscous.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.530
Let's just push this in like so.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.530
Oh my goodness.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.420
I've already precooked this, by the way.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.060
Just simmered it for 15 minutes in some water
so it really expands.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.440
Some sweetcorn on top like that, nice yellowy
mountain.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.120
Just going to push this down, work it all
through.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.370
Good times.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.980
So this really doesn't need much cooking time.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.600
All we're doing is warming through the sweetcorn
and the quinoa.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.760
So get it all nice and coated, warm it through,
we'll work on our bread and then it's time

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.760
to serve it.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.310
We've got a loaf of bread and effectively
what we do is cut it into thirds, hollow that

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.310
out and serve it.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.170
Now apparently this is like a South African
tradition from years ago where they used to

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.410
serve curry in there.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.180
If you're South African or you know more about
bunny chow, let me know more below.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.180
I'd love to know.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.620
I need a life lesson from you guys.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.650
Let's cut this up.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.310
So I'm just cutting this bread through, and
it's really important that the loaf that you're

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.070
using is both uncut but also has got a flat
edge there.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.410
All I'm going to do is just hollow out the
bread in, like, little lumps like this.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.410
And don't feel generous.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.180
Don't give it to the birds in the garden.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.630
You get to keep this bit as well.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.410
It's going to be great because we're going
to dunk that.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.450
People used to dunk that in their curry apparently,
so we're going to dunk that in our chili as

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.450
well at the end.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.450
So hollow this out.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.740
Leave a little bit so it doesn't seep out.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.880
Give it some walls.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.930
Good times.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.500
Right, it's time to serve it up, and it just
came to me that the hollowed out bread acts

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.410
as quite a good mobile phone holder, so if
you're interested, you know, you could stock

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.340
that and maybe make a business plan out of
that.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.790
But anyhow, let's get on with our chili.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.280
We're going to just ladle it straight in there.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.680
Oh my goodness, this is good.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.570
I really like sort of rustic food.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.750
I really like just getting my hands on stuff
and I kind of just want to go 'argh', caveman

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.950
on it, but I'm not going to do that right
now.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.710
I'm going to carry on filling this up.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.440
The colorfulness in there is looking good.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.830
The smell, the flavor and the texture when
you bite into it, you're going to love it,

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.100
and it's going to be so worthwhile.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.810
How easy was this to make?

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.810
How easy was that?

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.810
So good.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.430
I can't wait to eat this but we need to add
a little bit more, jut a little bit of finesse

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.430
on there.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.430
Some grated cheddar cheese.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.430
I live near Cheddar, actually.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.430
That's a random fact for you.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.340
A little bit of coolness from some sour cream.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.340
Just a little dollop there.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.400
Sprinkling of chopped coriander.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.910
So I hope you'll agree guys, I've just stuffed
in a little bit of scraps of bread there to

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.400
refer back to that bunny reference.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.540
It is looking amazing.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.960
I can't wait to eat it.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.900
I really hope you have a go too, and if you
do, don't forget to send me a picture at My

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.090
Virgin Kitchen and of course Videojug food,
and we'll love to see what you come up with.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.100
I'll see you again next time.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.120
