00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.440
As a life-long gamer, sometimes it's hard
to separate expectations of what a game should

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.980
be from what a game can be.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.180
Allow me to clarify: Just because I expect
a game to work a certain way, doesn't mean

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.930
it should or indeed that it's the best way.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.180
With that said, despite still having many
positive aspects, Dungeon Hunter 3 by Gameloft

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.090
is a dangerous example of how many could come
to see 'gaming'.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.160
iOS gamers will remember Dungeon Hunter as
one of the premier Dungeon-Crawling Action-RPGs

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.800
for the platform.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.890
Unfortunately the latest entry in the series
has broken this chain, removing 'Dungeon-Crawling'

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.990
and arguably 'RPG' from the proceedings to
leave players with a gorgeously rendered fantasy

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.060
twin-stick action title.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.460
To explain the game's current iteration, one
has to explain how the game operates under

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.590
its 'free to play' banner.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.170
Players are free to create two characters
from a pool of four different classes (more

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.100
slots can be eventually unlocked), sharing
experience, gold and in-game currency between

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.110
them all.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.960
The upshot of this is the opportunity to earn
free experience and gold for trying out new

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.010
things, but the heavy downside is that 'levels'
and 'gold' are merely barriers for unlocking

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.409
new items rather than the usual vehicle for
customizing your character.

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.459
Unfortunately the 'freemium' model of gameplay
has been merged with Dungeon Hunter 3, removing

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:31.249
the usual item drops and customized character
development (through skills or talents) for

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:35.490
items and a limited handful of skills that
are made available and must be purchased and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.009
upgraded separately.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.530
Worst of all, items also take time to upgrade
- merely earning the cash required to pimp

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.399
out your gear isn't good enough and items
you may need to clear the next arena are left

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.840
unchanged until a set period of time has expired.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.149
These artificial barriers exist only for one
reason - to tempt you to dip in to the store

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.100
to purchase gems or coins to jump the queue.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.149
It's entirely possible to not open your wallet,
but you'll have to pay with your own spare

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.460
time in lieu.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.979
I may sound like I'm speaking as though it's
all doom and gloom, but you'd be completely

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.510
wrong - what makes the freemium model such
a sting is just how incredible Dungeon Hunter

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.780
3 feels as an action title.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.950
It's genuinely hard to compare the quality
of detail to presentation and the sheer volume

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.260
of unlockable arenas to anything else in the
genre.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.810
Sure, there are obvious problems such as sticky
controls and inconsistencies for using certain

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.900
weapons, but it's still head and shoulders
ahead of what's available.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.030
As such, Dungeon Hunter 3 is, if nothing else,
a budget gamer's Christmas wish - it's not

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.560
a true Action-RPG, but for a game that asks
for nothing it rewards you with plenty of

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.099
monster-mashing fun.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.319
However, its frustrating and obvious wallet-grabbing
moves can become tiresome, especially when

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:56.799
giving in adds no depth to the shallow gameplay
offered.
