00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.420
NBC is rolling out all their new Fall 2013
series at this year's TCA Summer Press Tour,

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.190
and Celebied's sharing the scoop on our favorites,
courtesy of our TCA correspondent Tim Holland.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.289
First up, The Michael J. Fox Show premieres
September 26th at 9pm.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.280
Fox, who has Parkinson's disease in real life,
stars as a former New York City anchorman

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.330
who is driving his family crazy now that he
left his job to spend more time with them

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.119
and to focus on his health.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.800
Luckily for them, the station wants him back.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.190
Fox's comic timing is as sharp as ever and
the pilot script is witty and touching without

00:00:37.190 --> 00:01:07.280
being too sentimental.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.030
Next up is The Blacklist, which premieres
September 23rd at 10pm.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.000
James Spader stars as Raymond Reddington,
an ex-government agent who landed on the FBI's

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.590
10 most wanted list.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.500
But after years in hiding, Reddington gives
himself up to help the Bureau catch a notorious

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.500
terrorist.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.300
The action-fueled pilot is stuffed with satisfying
twists and turns, and Spader gives an eerie

00:01:29.300 --> 00:02:10.140
performance that constantly keeps viewers
off balance.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:53.819
Lastly, NBC's most anticipated new fall drama,
Dracula, debuts on October 25th.

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.989
Jonathan Rhys Meyers is perfectly cast in
the vengeance-seeking title role, but unfortunately

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.079
the script plods along and fails to quicken
the pulse as any vampire-centric show should.

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.249
Let us know which fall NBC newbies you're
most looking forward to, and stick with us
