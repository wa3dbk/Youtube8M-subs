00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
[intro music]

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.560
Hello! So today I'm going to teach you all how to make your very own "half circle skirt".

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.440
Now what is the difference between this and a "circle skirt", you ask?

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.540
Well, you use *half* the amount of fabric.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.460
What I've found with full circle skirts is that when you're wearing them out and about and if there's

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.560
like, a *little* bit of breeze that day, your skirt just *woop!*

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.558
Blows right up!

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:35.693
And you flash everyone.

00:00:35.693 --> 00:00:36.557
So you always have to wear shorts underneath.

00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:38.716
And you have to hold it down all the time.

00:00:39.394 --> 00:00:43.714
So I've actually found that HALF circle skirts work a LOT better.

00:00:43.714 --> 00:00:46.800
And I actually like the shape of them a lot better. They're still quite full skirts,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.520
But they're not as big and dramatic as full circle skirts.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.640
So anyway, I'm going to teach you how to make them today!

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.070
First things first, we need to make a pattern!
Now these are the two pieces of fabric that

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.140
you will need to cut out.
First, we’ll work on the skirt.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.329
To make a pattern for the skirt, you will
need to make some measurements!

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.399
The first measurement is your waist, divided
by pi (which is 3.14).

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:13.070
As an example, my waist is 30 inches, divide
this by 3.14 and you get 9.55.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.530
So, my first measurement is 9.55 inches.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.590
So I’m going to draw this out onto my pattern
paper. From the corner of the paper, I’m

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.710
first drawing a bunch of marks 9.55 inches
out, then I connect those dots into a quarter-circle

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.990
that looks like this.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.750
Then you need to make an outer circle measurement.
First, figure out how long you want your skirt

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.420
to be. I want mine to be about 19 inches.
Then subtract from this whatever width you’re

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.799
going to use for the waistband. I want a 3
inch waistband so I subtract 3 inches, which

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.500
gives me 16.
Then, add your inner circle measurement. Mine

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.979
was 9.55.
This gives me a total of 25.55.

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.369
You should also add about ½ an inch for the
hem, so I’m just going to round this up

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:53.759
to 26 inches.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.429
Then, also from the corner of the paper, I
draw this outer circle measurement.

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.039
Then, I cut my pattern out.

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.410
and it looks
like this! 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.160
Next, fold your fabric in half, right sides
together.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.900
And yeah, I know the clothes I’m wearing
are pretty weird here – they’re my comfortable

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.750
sewing clothes, don’t judge me.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.700
Now, place your pattern piece on the fabric, with one straight
edge on the FOLD of the fabric.

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.370
Pin the piece of paper onto the fabric, and
then cut around your pattern.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.459
When you unfold it, you should have this half-circle
shape.

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.000
Now we also need to cut out a waistband from
the remaining fabric.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
To make your waistband, take your waist measurement and add 3 inches.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And this is the length of your waistband.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Then, decide how wide you want your waistband to be,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And double this measurement.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And this is your waistband width.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Now, this is a slightly different

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
method of making a waistband then what I've shown in my videos before,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.680
So, right sides together, place the waistband 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.540
onto the inner circle of the skirt like this.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.439
Line up the edges like this, and then pin
the waistband on. Then, attach the waistband

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:08.439
to the skirt by using a straight stitch, just
like this.

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.999
Then hem the unsewn edge of the waistband.
Fold the edge of the waistband over ½ an

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:27.999
inch, just like this, and then sew right along
the length.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.370
To finish off the waistband, fold it down,
with the hemmed edge lining up with the stitches

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.849
that you made when you attached your waistband to your skirt.
Pin this together, and sew around the waistband

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.659
to completely attach it to the skirt. Make
sure you’re catching the fabric of the skirt

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.480
underneath your stitches. You
should also use a thread that matches your

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.760
fabric – I didn’t, but that was so you
could all see where I was stitching in this

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.200
video.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.150
Then, you’ll notice that you have raw edges
on either side of your skirt. If you want

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.290
to finish this off professionally, you can
either overlock these edges, or, if you have

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.219
room to do this 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.930
fold this edge in once, then twice,

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.749
then sew over the top. Do this on both sides
of your skirt.

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:09.790
Now, fold your skirt in half, right sides
together, just like this.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.230
Line those edges up and pin them together,
then, get your zipper and line it up next

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.730
to the skirt.
Make a mark where the zipper ends. Below this

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.460
mark, you will do normal-length straight stitches,
but above this mark you will need to do what

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.750
are called basting stitches. These are very
long stitches used to temporarily hold your

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.970
fabric together.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.680
From your stitching, you will have created
a seam that looks like this. Fold the seam

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.690
open. You can also iron the seam here to hold
it open. Then, place your zipper onto your

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.550
seam like this, so that the teeth of the zipper
line up with the middle of your seam.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.720
Then, you will need to sew your zipper onto
your skirt like this.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.250
If you have one, a zipper foot, which looks
like this, makes sewing zippers really easy.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.330
Then, carefully cut through those basting
stitches that you made earlier, in order to

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.949
free your zipper!

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.740
Now all we need to do is to hem the bottom
of the skirt. I always hear that you’re

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.730
supposed to let a circle skirt hang for a
day or two before hemming the bottom, because

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.890
the grain of the fabric will cause the hem
to drop in certain spots and not others. Or... something.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:20.890
But, this is the skirt 2 days later, and there really isn't a noticeable difference. If there is, even

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.150
out the bottom with a pair of scissors, and
then continue on.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.010
Now, onto the hemming.There

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.100
are three methods you can use for hemming
the bottom of your skirt.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.810
If you have an overlocker, go around the entire
outer-circle edge with the overlocker, then

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.750
fold the overlocked edge up inside the skirt,
and sew across it using a straight stitch,

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.620
all the way around the outer circle. 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.780
So you can get yourself some pinking shears. These special
scissors prevent fabric from fraying. When

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.160
you’re cutting out the outside circle on
your skirt, use this scissors instead. Then, when

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.150
hemming, simply fold the edge over about 1
inch like this, and using a straight stitch,

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.840
stopping every 10 inches or so to readjust,
carefully sew all the way around your outer

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.600
circle.
Method 3 is if you don’t own pinking shears

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.900
– you can make something called a rolled
hem. This is when you fold the fabric over

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.900
once, then twice, then like in the other methods,
sew along all the way around the outer circle.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:24.160
And hopefully you should now have a finished
half circle-skirt.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.140
Thank you so much for watching!
