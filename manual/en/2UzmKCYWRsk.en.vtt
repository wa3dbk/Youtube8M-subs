00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.599
Afghan soldiers and civilians often remark
that the country needs more military aircraft.

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:20.570
Slowly but surely, this need is being met.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.230
"The power that the Afghan military once had
was lost.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.919
So we started again at zero.

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:48.640
But thank God, we now have powerful, experienced,
and very well-trained personnel.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.379
Helicopters are considered essential in the
fight against insurgents in Afghanistan's

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.649
rugged terrain.

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.220
And large transport planes will greatly enable
nationwide logistical support.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.429
As the Afghan military is now leading the
fight, with foreign forces drawing down into

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.170
training and assistance roles, an empowered
Afghan Air Force is necessary.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.010
"The fact is that every country and community
demands—and it is a justified demand—to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.330
have a strong national security force, including
an air force.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
But building up the air force has taken time.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.830
"It's growing up in small steps right now.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.430
We have choppers, we have Cessna 2-8s, and
right now, the biggest airplane we have right

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.450
now is a C-130."

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.470
Captain Shinwari has wanted to be a pilot
since he was 10 years old, and now he and

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.420
another Afghan will be the first to fly the
C-130.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.220
"I was always thinking like, it would be really
fun to be the youngest Afghan Air Force pilot

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.500
and fly the biggest airplane"

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.390
At the moment they are still in training,
but expect to fly with an all-Afghan crew

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.490
by the end of May.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.570
But the helicopters already fly operations
with all-Afghans.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.270
"Most of the missions are done by Afghan crews,
alone.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.090
Like, right now, in helicopter, we are all
doing the missions by ourselves—all Afghan

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.140
pilots."

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.220
The Afghan helicopters, MI-35 gunships and
MI-17 transports, are used heavily in operations

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.950
around the country.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.610
At a recent exercise in Kabul, Afghan air
capabilities were demonstrated.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.370
In some cases, attack helicopters provided
overwatch while insurgents were engaged on

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.370
the ground.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:34.140
In other cases, the transports dropped fast-roping
troops close to enemy compounds.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.450
Servicing aircraft in Afghanistan is challenging.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.260
For example, helicopter maintenance teams
must respond to both hot and cold climate

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.590
areas, which exist in Afghanistan simultaneously.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.990
"Our workshop is equipped with cold and hot
weather equipment and we have an equipment

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.230
laboratory.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.010
We fix any problem with the aircraft body,
if necessary."

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.260
At the moment 13 countries are contributing
to the NATO Air Training Command initiative

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.069
in Afghanistan, with 2017 as the target date
for a self-sufficient Afghan Air Force.
