00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.890
Chapter 7: Whirlpool Galaxy (M51)

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:09.440
Galaxies are collections of millions to billions
of stars gravitationally bound together. Galaxies

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.170
come in different shapes and sizes, and fall
into three broad categories: spiral (shaped

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.289
like a pinwheel), elliptical (like a ball,
sometimes round and sometimes squashed) and

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:28.810
irregular, with no obvious shape or structure.
Our own Milky Way galaxy is a spiral.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.500
Spiral galaxies are especially dramatic when
seen from different orientations, as they

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.030
have similar proportions to a compact disc!
A spiral galaxy viewed edge-on is a long thin

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.030
line with a bulge at its center; viewed face-on,
as with the Whirlpool Galaxy, its sweeping

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.700
spiral arms become clear. By observing other
galaxies, we can learn more about the history

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.879
and structure of our own Milky Way.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.960
Figure 22: The Whirlpool - visible image.
In this Hubble Space Telescope image, horizontal

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.920
lines fill the spiral arms that are made up
of many millions of hot bright stars and the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.630
glowing gas of active star-forming regions.
The spiral pattern is created by a pressure

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.170
wave that moves around the galaxy's center,
(a bull's-eye texture) triggering the collapse

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.890
of gas clouds to form the next generation
of stars. Tracing the main spiral arms of

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.329
the Whirlpool Galaxy, you'll find a confetti
pattern at eleven o'clock, a small companion

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:37.000
galaxy. It is classified as an irregular galaxy
because it lacks well-defined structure.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.049
The next three images of the Whirlpool Galaxy
are at the same scale as the visible light

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.840
image.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.900
Figure 23: The Whirlpool - infrared image.
In this Spitzer Space Telescope photo, the

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.009
spiral arms are again clear. Most of the infrared
light in the spiral arms comes from huge dust

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.670
clouds made up of hydrocarbons similar to
soot. The infrared glow from the companion

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.950
galaxy by contrast comes from the light of
old, red stars. It contains little dust and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.000
gas, and no new stars.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.060
Figure 24: The Whirlpool - X-ray image. In
this picture taken by the Chandra X-ray Telescope,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.340
a bull's-eye texture represents the centers
of the Whirlpool and its companion galaxy.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.090
Much of the diffuse glow is from multi-million
degree gas heated by supernova remnants, like

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.930
the Crab or Kepler's Supernova, that pepper
the galaxies. The maximum X-ray emission is

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.910
centered on the core of each galaxy where
a giant black hole is residing. As gas and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.890
stars approach and fall into the giant black
hole, huge amounts of X-rays are generated.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.590
The giant black hole at the center of the
Whirlpool has a mass of more than a million

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.599
Suns. Almost every galaxy, including our own
Milky Way, has a giant black hole at its center,

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.450
but we don't yet know why. Throughout the
image you can also feel pinpoints of the X-ray

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.000
emission. These sources are called X-ray binaries,
where a neutron star or black hole is closely

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.299
orbiting a normal star and feeding off the
star's atmosphere. As the gas tumbles toward

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.400
the neutron star or black hole, it heats up
and radiates X-rays.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.870
Figure 25: The Whirlpool - radio image. Radio
waves are generated by electrons caught up

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.099
in the magnetic fields that weave through
the spiral arms of the galaxy. this image

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:41.299
was taken by the VLA and maps out the location
of the strongest magnetic fields found within

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.989
the spiral arms and in the nuclei of both
galaxies.

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.280
Galaxies are in constant motion. Even though
they are huge distances apart, gravitational

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.130
attraction can pull galaxies together at hundreds
of kilometers per second. Over millions and

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.590
billions of years, collisions happen. What
if two galaxies, each the size of the Whirlpool,

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.659
collide?

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:05.490
Let's find out!
