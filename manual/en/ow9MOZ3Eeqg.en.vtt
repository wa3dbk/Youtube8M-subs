Plasmas Oscillations and plasmons explained

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.070
So my name is Karl Berggren.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.450
I'm gonna talk today about Plasma Oscillations
and Plasmons, and I want to start out by just

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.639
giving some physical insight into what's going
on with this systems and then I'm gonna do

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.199
a little bit of back of the envelope algebra
to derive the plasma frequency.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.511
Derive might be too strong a term because
really, if you want a proper derivation, you're

00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:31.009
gonna have to go to another source, you're
gonna have to look into a textbook or another

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.340
online resource.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.350
But plasmas are very interesting these days
and plasma oscillations are interesting because

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.399
this particular type of surf ace plasma has
recently got a lot of attention in terms of

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.469
making nano optical devices and so, that's
one of the reasons people are more interested

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.890
in this area.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.570
So, what's a plasma first of all?

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.340
Well, we're mostly gonna talk about metals
and metals as a type of plasma as a gas of

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.340
charged particles.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.399
And a metal and metallic plasma, it's a neutral
plasma so that on the average there's the

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.970
same number of positive and negative charges
not like I’ve drawn it.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.780
In a metal, you have positive charges or screened
nuclei that have the core electrons to still

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.810
bound them, and then the negative charges
are free electrons that move around.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.130
And if you think about what happens in such
a neutral system is you can realize that even

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.790
on the average it's gonna be neutral maybe
over some short-length scales.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.421
So if we just draw a box in here, you may
have a little bit extra negative charge and

00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:44.780
a little bit extra positive charge, so that
there will be occasionally some charge separations.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.450
So let's draw some charge separation happening
here.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.979
And the charge separation gets at really what
goes on in the plasma, in the plasma oscillation,

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.689
because once you have a charge separation
you have a Coulomb force.

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:08.160
Now in the plasmon, the positive charges because
their nuclei are quite stationary, the electrons

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.001
move so in this sytem the force is going to
act to pull the negative charge towards the

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:21.540
positive just because electrons are so much
lighter, so much more mobile.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.340
And as it moves, it's gonna pick up kinetic
energy.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.640
In fact, when it passes the positive charge,
it's actually gonna have the maximum kinetic

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.110
energy and then it's gonna start slowing down
because the Coulomb forces is now gonna be

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.480
opposite inside and so it will just come out
here, turn around eventually come back and

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.900
there you get the oscillation.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.770
Okay it comes back and goes through.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.450
Now the oscillation, you can think of oscillations
in terms of exchange of energy.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:03:03.430
So the exchange of energy here is between
an electro-static energy and a kinetic energy.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.180
So actually, the exchange happens twice per
oscillation period.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.450
So you start out with electro-static potential,
you then transfer the kinetic potential, then

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.550
back to electro-static potential and then
back to kinetic, and then you complete the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.550
cycle.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:29.160
Back to electro-static, so you go through
two exchanges of energy in a single period.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.540
So that's the basic physical picture of charge
separation followed by oscillation, and of

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.650
course that oscillation is not gonna last
forever.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.220
There will be a little bit of decay or loss,
and so there will be a little bit of slowing

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.810
down and it will damp out eventually.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:57.580
Now, in a more mathematical sense, you can
look at the stored potential energy in the

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.970
electro-static system.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.930
But to do that, first you need to make a guess
at the amount of charge and the separation

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.940
of the charges.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.360
And so, we'll just guess the electron charge
because these are free electrons that are

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.240
moving.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.370
And the separation, the one that's the most
logical is just the average separation of

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:24.380
particles in the system we call "S" and that
will be the cube root of the inverse density,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.950
or the particle density.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:35.190
So, if you remember a little bit of your electricity
and magnetism, the potential energy stored

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.630
between two separated charges is going to
be just coulomb’s constant, times the charge

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.780
squared, over the separation.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.810
And if you remember your harmonic oscillator
Physics, so this is from classical mechanics.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.430
And by the way, I'm assuming that you remember
electrostatics and classical mechanics if

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.430
you studied those.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.070
If you haven't, you need to catch up on that
area to understand this.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:14.040
But in that case, the harmonic oscillator
energy is one-half and we call that Omega-P,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.660
that's gonna be the oscillation frequency,
and X squared, so that's the standard form

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.600
for the kinetic, for the energy stored in
the oscillator.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.480
Not an X, that should actually be an S, S-squared.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.370
So, seen this as equal as a little bit odd
because it's clearly not a truly harmonic

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.150
oscillator because the force acting on this
goes like one over the separation squared

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.180
and it's not proportional to the separation
as it should be in a harmonic oscillator,

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.310
so that's where this derivation is really
quite rough.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.340
But it gives you the correct form, and it
gives you the correct physical insight.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.900
And the results of a little bit of algebra
is just that the plasma frequency scales with

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:08.370
the square-root of the free carrier density
squared, charge squared, and divided by the

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.370
mass.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.000
And this is actually the effect of mass, not
the electron mass.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.960
But at this point, we've ignored all sorts
of other factors so like Colomb’s constant

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.960
has disappeared.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:25.420
And so in fact I'm gonna replace that equality
with just a little proportional to symbol.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.280
So it tells you that the plasma frequency
which is typically in the ultra-violet for

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:36.930
metals, it goes up with the free-particle
density in the plasma.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.480
So that's plasma oscillation.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.170
Now what's a plasmon?

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:47.090
Well, plasmon is a single quantum of a plasma
oscillation.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.920
So just like a photon is a single quantum
of electro-magnetic oscillation, a single

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.200
plasmon is a quantum of a plasma oscillation.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.620
The difference between electro-magnetic oscillation
and plasma oscillation comes down to this

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.250
exchange of energy here.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:08.120
So in a conventionalelectro-magnetic oscillation,
you're exchanging energy between electrostatic

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:14.270
potential and magnetic potential, magnetically-stored
energy.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.130
Whereas in a plasma oscillation, you exchange
energy between electrostatic and kinetic.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:24.060
And of course there's also some magnetic fields
formed by the current here.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:29.810
But it's the presence of this kinetic energy
that's really quite different from what you're

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.550
accustomed to thinking about in free space
for electromagnetic field.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.020
And this also relates to the concept of kinetic
inductance which we've talked about in another

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.250
one of these videos.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.419
So with that, we'll finish for today.

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:45.930
If you have any questions, please feel free
to leave them below and I'll do my best to

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.259
answer them.
