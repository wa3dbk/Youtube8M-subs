00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.760
and the star count

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.300
i prefer thirty

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.689
the galaxy core size large, medium, small

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.960

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.990
or use the galaxy dust if you prefer
which can also be set to your own custom

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.990
color

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.719
and lastly we have the battery

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:14.930

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.209
fourty - fifty frames per second

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.549
balanced runs at about thirty three
frames per second and power savings

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.999
