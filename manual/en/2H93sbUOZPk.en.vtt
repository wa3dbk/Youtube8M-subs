00:00:00.698 --> 00:00:03.115
(rock music)

00:00:04.618 --> 00:00:05.798
- Hey, Donnie Smith here,

00:00:05.798 --> 00:00:06.924
and I've just got a quick Q and A.

00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:08.391
I have a question on my Youtube channel,

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:09.914
my DIY Auto body and Paint channel,

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:11.748
and I was going to answer this question.

00:00:11.748 --> 00:00:14.011
It's a good question, comes from Simon.

00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:15.108
It says, "Hey there, I
just can't understand

00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:19.721
"why it's not possible to apply
body filler to etch primer?

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:21.782
"What happens when you do?

00:00:21.782 --> 00:00:25.564
"Is it just a question of bad adhesion

00:00:25.564 --> 00:00:28.939
"or does it react somehow
with the etch primer?

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.853
"Cuz to me, it sounds even
worse to apply body filler

00:00:31.853 --> 00:00:34.745
"direct to metal since
it is porous material

00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:38.231
"and simply the moisture
in the air would get

00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:40.766
"trapped under the filler as well.

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.738
"In my mind, you need to apply
something that chemically

00:00:43.738 --> 00:00:48.079
"merges with the metal,
like acid helps etch primer,

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.272
"or something that transports any moisture

00:00:51.272 --> 00:00:54.344
"to the surface or otherwise
away from the metal.

00:00:54.344 --> 00:00:55.590
"Good vids by the way,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.902
"this is not a critique, just wondering."

00:00:57.902 --> 00:00:59.102
And that is a good question.

00:00:59.102 --> 00:01:01.947
And the short answer to this is,

00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:04.141
you know, if you're wanting
to apply body filler

00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:06.787
over a primer, like
you're mentioning here,

00:01:06.787 --> 00:01:08.943
about the only primer that is recommended

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:10.550
on the technical data sheets

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.217
by most primers is epoxy primer.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.931
So if you're wanting
to seal that metal off

00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:18.265
and then apply some body filler,

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:20.210
that would probably be the way to go.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.860
And to another one of your concerns

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.238
about applying body filler to the metal,

00:01:24.238 --> 00:01:25.913
you know, it's designed to do that.

00:01:25.913 --> 00:01:27.326
Most of the premium body fillers

00:01:27.326 --> 00:01:29.407
have zinc in them and that zinc

00:01:29.407 --> 00:01:32.010
is that provides corrosion protection.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.703
So it has zinc in the body filler

00:01:33.703 --> 00:01:36.157
that is designed to go directly to metal.

00:01:36.157 --> 00:01:38.977
Now, why can't you put it over self etch?

00:01:38.977 --> 00:01:41.964
You know, to tell you
that, I'm really not a,

00:01:41.964 --> 00:01:44.166
you know, I'm not a scientist or chemist,

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:45.803
or don't know all that.

00:01:45.803 --> 00:01:47.714
I just know that most
technical data sheets

00:01:47.714 --> 00:01:49.415
say not to do that,

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:51.259
but I really don't know the reasoning.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.314
To me, in my mind, I'm
just thinking that acid's

00:01:53.314 --> 00:01:55.325
going to react with the body filler.

00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:57.776
And either cause an adhesion
problem, like you mentioned,

00:01:57.776 --> 00:02:00.082
or cause mapping, where
it kind of lifts the edges

00:02:00.082 --> 00:02:02.775
and you'll be able to see
what looks like scratches

00:02:02.775 --> 00:02:05.285
after it's been painted and everything.

00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:09.452
That's not an absolute answer,
that's just my opinion.

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:13.128
But me, you know, it
just says not to do it,

00:02:13.128 --> 00:02:15.163
so you know, I try to follow
those recommendations.

00:02:15.163 --> 00:02:17.779
It's kind of like, you know,
if you drink and drive,

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.688
you know, you're going to get arrested,

00:02:19.688 --> 00:02:21.575
or go to jail or whatever.

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:23.419
And we both know that every
time you drink and drive,

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:24.564
you're not going to go to jail,

00:02:24.564 --> 00:02:25.970
but if you do it long enough,

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.299
you're probably going to get caught.

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.775
And I think this is the same way.

00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:31.554
I think it's a good idea just
to follow the recommendations

00:02:31.554 --> 00:02:34.560
because they do have the paint makers,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.053
or whoever is...

00:02:36.053 --> 00:02:38.359
They test these products and they know

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.240
how they work best and how they don't.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.355
And you know, I think it's best just

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:43.388
to try to follow those recommendations.

00:02:43.388 --> 00:02:45.611
So I hope that helps answer your question.

00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:47.182
What I would do, you know,

00:02:47.182 --> 00:02:48.615
if I did want to prime that bare metal

00:02:48.615 --> 00:02:52.144
before I applied body
filler, I'd use epoxy.

00:02:52.144 --> 00:02:54.819
Thanks for watching and we'll
talk to you in the next video.
