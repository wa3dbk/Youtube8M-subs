00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.610
Welcome back, everyone.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.870
This is the second part of our Ghost Recon:
Future Soldier review, so if you haven’t

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.680
seen the first part, make sure you go back
and watch that first, as I cover the single-player

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.860
campaign.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.790
Ghost Recon has always had a solid single-player
experience, and with Advanced Warfighter,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.680
the game became a real contender for the best
shooter online, but with the rise in modern

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.621
military games this generation, does the latest
installment still have enough to go toe to

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:41.870
toe with its competitors?

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:50.000
So, first off, Ghost Recon: Future Soldier
features a class system consisting of rifleman,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.590
engineer, and scout.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.470
Each have two different tracks to follow,
so riflemen use assault rifles or LMG’s,

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.530
while engineers use shotguns or PDW’s, and
scouts use sniper rifles or submachine guns.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.040
Each class also has unique abilities and equipment
to vary gameplay.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.880
While riflemen are mostly just about dishing
out damage, engineers can reveal the positions

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.010
of players and hack faster, and scouts have
the ability to turn almost invisible and dish

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.060
out deadly hand-to-hand kills.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.220
Unlike in some other games, where classes
are just kind of suggestions, Future Soldier

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.159
really makes them useful for winning a match.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.920
If you don’t have a couple of each class,
you’ll have trouble winning.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.130
Future Soldier features four different multiplayer
modes, each offering a different type of objective

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.850
for teams to complete.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.330
The first, and most popular mode is called
conflict.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.229
It’s one of the more unique takes on the
“capture the objective” game modes.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.860
Unlike in, say, Battlefield 3’s conquest
mode, where the objectives remain in place

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.970
and give you points, conflict features one
objective that shifts after it’s completed,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.190
and points are awarded for completing an objective,
not just holding it for a certain amount of

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.190
time.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.810
In addition, these objectives actually give
different rewards.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.950
Resupply points allow you to stock up on ammo
and equipment, EMP’s temporarily knock out

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.159
enemy electronics, and sensors reveal the
location of enemy players.

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.130
Conflict is definitely the mode I like to
spent most of my time in.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.730
Decoy is probably the most interesting mode
included in the game.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.950
While one side works to capture three objectives,
the other team defends.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.980
However, only one of these objectives gives
the attacking team info on the final target,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.950
while the other two give nothing.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.530
This mode can rely on a little bit of luck,
but sending a few people to each target can

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.560
help to limit this.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.940
It’s a really fun mode to play with a group
of players with headsets.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.880
Saboteur is just a “grab the bomb” mode,
and it’s probably the most forgettable,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.250
while Siege is for hardcore players who don’t
like respawning and love that “all or nothing”

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.250
style of gameplay.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.830
Now, the biggest issue I had with Ghost Recon:
Future Soldier’s multiplayer is that the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.610
servers have been very spotty, both on the
360 and the PS3, which I used to record this

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.090
section of gameplay.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.790
Lag can be an issue, and the game uses a peer
to peer system.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.540
The issues do appear to be getting better,
but this is worth mentioning.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.129
The last mode in the game is Guerilla mode,
and this is a cool twist on the horde mode

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.430
present in games like Gears of War.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.950
The difference is you actually infiltrate
the areas first in Future Soldier, and then

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.670
set up your own ambushes for enemies.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.690
It’s a lot of fun, but I’d recommend playing
it with a friend.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.760
Ghost Recon: Future Soldier is a fantastic
game in all three of its modes.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.230
From the stylish single-player to the often
pulse-pounding online play, this is an awesome

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.110
tactical shooter, and one of my favorite games
so far this year.
