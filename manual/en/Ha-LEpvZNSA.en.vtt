00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.260
[Michael Collins] How is the quality of the tv?

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.280
[Bruce McCandless] Oh, it's beautiful Mike, it really is.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.300
[Collins] Oh, gee, that's great! Is the lighting halfway decent?

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.310
[McCandless] Yes, indeed. They've got the flag up now and you can see the stars and stripes

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.380
[Alan Shepard] The rim is still way up there from the looks of things.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.410
[Fred Haise] And, Ed and Al, we've already eaten in our 30-minute extension and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.430
we're past that now. I think we'd better proceed with the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.450
sampling and continue with the EVA.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.490
[Edgar Mitchell] Okay, Fredo.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:45.210
45. 47.52.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.250
3000 feet. 52. 52.
