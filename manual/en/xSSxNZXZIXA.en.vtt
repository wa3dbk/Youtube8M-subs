Welcome to TV Repair Made Easy, brought to
you by ShopJimmy.com.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.230
Visit www.shopjimmy.com to search the hundreds
of thousands of TV parts in our inventory.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.470
The Main Board typically manages your accessory
inputs and outputs and houses the TV tuner.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.990
Philips and Magnavox Main Boards are called
SSBs.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:40.870
SSB part numbers are 12 digits long, and typically
begin with 3138, 3139, or 3104.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.430
Part numbers are located on a label on the
tuner, or on a barcode label on the board.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.890
Tuner labels contain multiple 12 digit part
numbers.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.470
The correct part number will be located next
to the letter S. Barcode label numbers may

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.840
only contain a partial SSB part number.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.000
It is very common to only find the final 5
digits of the part number on a barcode label.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.390
Please have your TV model number handy when
searching partial SSB part numbers on ShopJimmy.com,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.460
as it may be needed to differentiate between
items.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.940
ShopJimmy has found that most replacement
SSBs will need to be configured after installation.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.520
This may require pressing the TV or remote
control buttons in a specific order, accessing

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.280
the TV service menu, or uploading new firmware
via a USB flash drive.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.590
Please make sure to check the notes on any
relative ShopJimmy product pages for further

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:40.520
information or instructional downloads.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.730
Search your part number on ShopJimmy.com to
find a compatible replacement.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.579
Typically, your part number will match the
ShopJimmy Item Number.

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:55.680
If searching your part number directs you
to items that have slightly different part

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.010
numbers, take a look at the product details
to confirm that your part number is in the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.670
Substitute Parts field.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.899
As long as your part number is found in the
Substitute Parts field, this item will be

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.149
a compatible substitute and will work in your
TV.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.670
If your part number is out of stock, be sure
to check the Substitute Parts field on the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.340
product page for compatible replacements.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.380
These substitutes are guaranteed to replace
your original board, even if the part numbers

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.550
on the board do not match.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.129
