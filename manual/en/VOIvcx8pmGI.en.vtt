00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.780
Hi guys!

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.870
This is Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay Tutor
and this is the introduction video to my paid

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.600
tutorial series, Nautical Anchor Cane.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.219
Now, this is what are we gonna be making in
the tutorial.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.919
It is a polymer clay cane in the design of
a nautical anchor.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.880
And you can use this kind of design in all
sorts of cool projects.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.110
And I've got a bunch of different sizes here.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.640
You can do it large, or you can… because
it's such a graphic design you can go right

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.910
down to a tiny nail art cane size.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:46.440
I'll bring it up for you to take a look at
how tiny this detail will go to.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.940
It's like that… look at how tiny that is
compared to my nail.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.050
So, it's a great design for using in all kinds
of different projects.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.440
Now I've got a bunch of different ways I’ve
used this particular cane.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.540
I've got back here…

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.320
I've used it on a rope necklace that I tied
a big knot in.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.070
And took a… this is actually a bracelet
connector that I hung a bunch of little pearls

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.340
and crystals on, and a bead that I made with
the cane.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.520
I used a large bead or a large cane here.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.660
And a bunch of smaller ones around the edges
which it looks really cool.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.340
And the neat thing about this necklace is
that it can be undone

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.060
and worn in different lengths.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.680
So you could do this… wear it in a bunch
of different styles.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.720
Also I did kind of a neat little rough top
on here with a real rustic kind of boat type

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.900
clip on there, so it has a real cute look
to it.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.510
So that's that one.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.340
Now this one has a bit of a similar look.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.180
I used a… actually it's a necklace finding
that I got at Michael's, but you could also

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.569
use these sections for a bracelet, it's just
about exactly the right size.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.820
And then I added a bunch of different things
to the side here.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.020
I have some… these are some old, they look
like pirate coins.

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:23.849
They're from an old belt I had actually.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.430
Which is funny, and I thought they would be
really fun to bring in that sort of nautical

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.550
look and a different colored metal 'cause
it has a kind of a brass look to it, the ends

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.859
on here are brass, and then I also added silver
wire to the beads.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:44.700
I've put some resin on the top of them, some
UV Resin, so they have a nice glossy look

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.420
to it, and these are just cane slice beads.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.660
On this side I added some glass pearls in
a navy color to bring in

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.000
the navy from the cording.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.260
And then down here, I used an old key chain…
brass key chain,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.760
and then I hung a bunch of charms on it.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.020
Anything that had to do with a nautical theme.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.879
So I put another brass… or a glass pearl
to bring that in.

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:21.099
This is a new charm I got from Michael's,
it has a nautical steering wheel thing.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.880
This is an old brass anchor from a key chain.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.459
My sister had a huge key chain collection
when I was a kid, my dad was a fisherman so

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.700
he got her this anchor.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.930
Then this was an earring.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.610
It was a pearl… or mother of pearl earring
that to me look like either a fishtail or

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.360
a sail, so I thought it had a very nautical
look.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.900
And this is an old piece of beach glass that
I wired up in the silver wire.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.529
So, I've got different colored metals, different
types of things on here.

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:54.369
I've worn this necklace a bunch already and
it gets lots of comments,

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:56.940
it's quite a fun one to wear.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.620
Also, I've got… what else have I got here.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.459
I've got a pair of earrings where I put the
little cane slices into the earrings.

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.469
I've put some charms at the bottom.

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:16.360
And these are some links made by Tierracast,
and I got these at Shipwreck Beads a while

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:23.530
ago and they're really neat, these Tierracast
findings; they have kind of a cone they are

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.590
meant for putting those Rivoli crystals in.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.851
But I think they make great fillers for polymer
clay you can get them with a link just on

00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:39.051
one side or on both sides so that they become
a link, so this becomes a charm or earrings,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.570
or whatever you want.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.990
And then, what else have I got here.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.440
I've made one of them into a button I drilled
a couple of holes into it, made it into a

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.370
bit of a domed button which it suits beautifully.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.310
These smaller size slices I've put some resin
on them they're just like little resin buttons

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.310
or…

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.000
I forget what they call them, but they use
them in scrapbooking.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.970
You could just, it's like a little gem you
could put it in a scrapbook and it's got quite

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.350
a nice shiny little look to it.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.230
And then I've got a couple of more drilled
beads here.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.920
And lastly, I just wanted to mention that
even the scraps from this tutorial look awesome,

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.780
this is a Natasha bead.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.930
I haven't quite decided what to make with
it but this is from the scraps of this cane,

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.230
and I think that it has a lot of drama to
it because of the colors and the way the shading

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.140
and everything was done in the cane.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.060
So I think you're gonna really learn a lot
in this tutorial and we'll see you in the

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.000
next video of this series.
