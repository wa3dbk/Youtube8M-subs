Welcome to the "West Wing Week," your guide to everything

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.166
that's happening at
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:11.467
But first, a brief message from

00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:15.033
America's move to raise a
healthier generation of kids.

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:16.000
Secretary Vilsack:
Spring is here.

This week,
April 9th to the 15th,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.200
or
"The Interpreter's Lounge."

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.633
On Friday morning, April 9th,
the Presidential motorcade

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:37.467
departed for the Prague Castle.

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:39.800
As you will recall from last
week's installment of your

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.000
"West Wing Week," the President was in Prague 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.700
to sign the new START treaty, and meet with many of our regional allies.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.533
The President:
I have a lot of gray hairs.

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.767
I used to look much younger.

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:51.533

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.734
Narrator:
After meeting with the Czechs,

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:56.667
President Obama headed back to
Washington, D. C.

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:58.934
That afternoon when the
President returned, he made a

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:02.300
statement about the mining
tragedy in West Virginia.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.867
The President:
I want to offer my deepest condolences to the friends

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:09.100
and the families of
the fathers and the husbands and

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.700
brothers, nephews and sons who
were killed in this accident.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.967
I'm also in awe of the courage
and selflessness shown by the

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:20.000
rescue teams who risked their
lives over and

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.600
over and over this week.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.533
Narrator:
On Sunday, April 11th, President Obama, Secretary Clinton,

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.500
and Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel crossed Pennsylvania Avenue

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.133
to the Blair House, where
a series of bilateral meetings

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:32.433
were held in the runup to the
Nuclear Security Summit.

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:37.200
Secretary Clinton:
But it's such a huge deal, and it has taken --

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.500
The President:
So far today I've already

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.767
met with Prime Minister Singh of
India, as well as the President

00:01:44.767 --> 00:01:51.700
of Kazakhstan, and now we're
meeting with the President of

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.600
South Africa, I'll be meeting
with the Prime Minister of

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.133
Pakistan after this meeting.

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.033
Narrator:
On Monday, April 12th, the President went to the

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:01.433
site of the Nuclear Security
Summit, where he held more

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:03.400
bilateral meetings with
Jordan, Malaysia,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.567
Ukraine, Armenia, and China.

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:08.233
President Obama then greeted the
leaders of 46 nations, the

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:11.066
largest summit ever held in
Washington, and gathered them

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:12.900
all for a working dinner,
getting started on

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.100
the important work at hand.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.734
On Tuesday, April 13th, the
President reconvened

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:20.633
this august group.

00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:21.667
The President:
You know, you've met Jan.

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:23.467
Jan:
Yeah, I --

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:24.600
The President:
Good morning.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.500
It is my privilege to welcome
you to Washington and formally

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.200
convene this historic summit.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.300
Narrator:
The main focus was

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.400
on nuclear proliferation and securing nuclear materials.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.033
The President:
Two decades after the end of the cold war,

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:42.767
we face a cruel irony of history
-- the risk of a nuclear

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:48.400
confrontation between nations
has gone down, but the risk of

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.734
nuclear attack has gone up.

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:54.600
Narrator:
Meanwhile, in the Caribbean, the First Lady and Dr. Biden

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.233
made a surprise visit
to Haiti to see the rebuilding

00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:00.100
efforts made since a massive
earthquake struck Port-au-Prince

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.467
and the surrounding areas.

00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:04.066
And, to underscore the
commitment of the United States

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:06.633
to help rebuild the
shattered nation.

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:08.900
The First Lady went on to
Mexico, where she made her first

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.934
official solo international
visit.

00:03:10.934 --> 00:03:13.567
First Lady:
This is my first solo international trip.

00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:15.800
Mexico is really a natural
first step for me.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.533
I mean, the relationships that
our countries have with one

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:23.300
another are deep and broad.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.934
Narrator:
The President finished a long day of talking

00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:28.300
with a news conference ending
the Nuclear Security Summit.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.467
The President:
This evening I can report that we have seized this opportunity

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:34.200
and because of
the steps we've taken as

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.000
individual nations and as an
international community,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.567
the American people will
be safer and the world

00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:42.166
will be more secure.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:44.400
Narrator:
The President squeezed in one last bilateral

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.900
meeting with the Germans, just
to make it a full ten,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.166
before leaving for the 
White House.

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:51.400
On Wednesday, April 14th,
the President spent

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.266
a sunny day inside.

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:55.066
He held a meeting with the
Vice-President and members of

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:59.834
Congress from both parties, and
talked about Wall Street reform.

00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:03.800
The President:
I think all of us recognize
that we cannot

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.967
have a circumstance in which a
meltdown of the financial sector

00:04:07.967 --> 00:04:10.367
once again puts the entire
economy in peril.

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:12.834
Narrator:
And then he met with this year's winners of the White House News

00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:16.000
Photographers Association Eyes of History Annual Conference.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.367
The President:
All right. Group picture?

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:20.333
Let's see if they know how to
arrange themselves properly.

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:22.000
(laughter)

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Speaker:
I do.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
The President:
Do you recommend

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.667
that we say cheese?

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:29.433
Speaker:
Cheese!

00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:31.133
Narrator:
On Thursday, April 15th, President Obama flew to

00:04:31.133 --> 00:04:33.867
Cape Canaveral, Florida, to take
a look at a commercial rocket

00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:38.800
processing facility and visit
the Kennedy Space Center.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.266
A Speaker:
Heat tiles for when the stage reenters to survive

00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:44.333
the heat of reentry.

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:46.533
Narrator:
He then outlined his vision for NASA, one that

00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:49.800
unlocks our ambitions and
expands our frontiers in space,

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.734
ultimately meeting the challenge
of sending humans to Mars.

00:04:52.734 --> 00:04:56.066
The President:
So this is the next chapter that we can write together

00:04:56.066 --> 00:04:57.900
here at NASA.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.200
We will partner with industry,
we will invest in cutting-edge

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.433
research and technology, we will
set far-reaching milestones, and

00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:11.066
provide the resources to
reach those milestones.

00:05:11.066 --> 00:05:14.734
And step by step, we will push
the boundaries not only of where

00:05:14.734 --> 00:05:17.567
we can go but what we can do.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.400

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.100

Secretary Vilsack:
That's what they call
"West Wing Week."
