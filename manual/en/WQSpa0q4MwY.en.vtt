Coach Rudy, I've won championships both as
a coach and a player, and we always play twenty-one,

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.120
either if we're out at the park, or before
practice, whatever. Let's talk about how to

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.519
play twenty-one. You start the game either
at the top of the key, the free throw line.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.401
That's the first shot of the game. If, wherever
you shoot that first shot from, the free throws

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:25.810
for the rest of the game come from that position.
So, first shot goes, either from the free

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.150
throw, the top of the key. That shot is worth
two points. Alright, if the shot goes in,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.260
it's worth two points; if it misses, guys
are underneath, they rebound, you must clear

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.340
each rebound. Which means you must take it
out beyond the three, or at least to the free

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.360
throw line in order to have your basket count.
Once you've cleared the ball, shoot the shot,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.940
it goes in, that's worth two points. Now you
go to the free throw line or the top of the

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.180
key to shoot free throws. Each free throw
you make is worth one point, alright. When

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.960
you make three in a row, somebody from underneath
may check you in a one-on-one situation. If

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.550
you make the next shot, that's worth two points.
The goal of the game is to get to twenty-one.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.200
Now, a couple notes. You might want to encourage
everyone to play defense. You don't want to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.780
be the only guy playing defense while everyone
underneath is waiting for rebounds, alright.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.130
So, the offensive guy gets the ball, shoots
the ball, scores the ball. He gets to eighteen,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.270
he makes two free throws, nineteen and twenty,
but he misses the third free throw. That means

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.090
he goes back to thirteen. It's called dropping
back. So, if you, if you miss on the free

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.250
throw that would win the game, then you bus
back to thirteen, and you must start back

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.170
from there, alright. Twenty-one, it's a fun
game, free throws are worth two at the beginning

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.200
of the game, during the rest of the game they're
only worth one. If you make three free throws

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.310
in a row, someone from underneath may check
you in an one-on-one. If you miss the free

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.780
throw that would put you in to twenty-one,
you go back to thirteen.
