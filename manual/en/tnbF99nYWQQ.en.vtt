00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:03.433
The President:
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:08.767
I just concluded a constructive
meeting with BP's chairman,

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:15.533
Carl-Henric Svanberg, and
I raised two issues at the meeting.

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:21.100
First was the containment of the
oil that is still spewing into the Gulf.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.934
As I mentioned last night, my
administration has directed BP

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:27.233
to mobilize additional
equipment and technology,

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:29.166
and in the coming
days and weeks,

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:33.300
these efforts should capture
up to 90% of the oil that is

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.567
leaking out of the well.

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:37.033
Now, that's not good enough.

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:40.433
So we will continue to press BP
and draw on our best minds and

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:44.900
resources to capture the rest
of the oil until the company

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.600
finishes drilling a relief well
later in the summer that is

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.033
expected to stop
the leak completely.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:56.233
The second topic revolved
around the issue of claims.

00:00:56.233 --> 00:01:00.900
As I traveled across the Gulf I
heard growing frustration over

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.934
the pace at which
claims had been paid.

00:01:03.934 --> 00:01:07.767
And I also heard concerns about
whether BP will make resources

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:12.467
available to cover legitimate
claims resulting from this disaster.

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:16.266
So this discussion
today was essential.

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:21.066
Currently, under federal law,
there is a $75 million cap on

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:25.834
how much oil companies could
under certain circumstances be

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:29.700
required to pay for economic
damages resulting from a spill

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.266
such as this.

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:34.266
That amount obviously
would be insufficient.

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.500
That's why I'm pleased to
announce that BP has agreed to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.600
set aside $20 billion to pay
claims for damages resulting

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600
from this spill.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.633
This $20 billion will provide
substantial assurance that the

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:54.734
claims people and businesses
have will be honored.

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:57.867
It's also important to
emphasize this is not a cap.

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:02.633
The people of the Gulf have my
commitment that BP will meet its

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:04.967
obligations to them.

00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:08.700
BP has publicly pledged to make
good on the claims that it owes

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.400
to the people in the Gulf, and
so the agreement we reached sets

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.834
up a financial and legal
framework to do it.

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:21.367
Another important element is
that this $20 billion fund will

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:25.433
not be controlled by either
BP or by the government.

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:28.100
It will be put in
a escrow account,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.100
administered by an impartial,
independent third party.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.734
So if you or your business has
suffered an economic loss as a

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:40.600
result of this spill, you'll be
eligible to file a claim for

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.667
part of this $20 billion.

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.333
This fund does not supersede
either individuals' rights or

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:51.066
states' rights to
present claims in court.

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:54.000
BP will also continue to be
liable for the environmental

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.667
disaster it has caused, and
we're going to continue to work

00:02:57.667 --> 00:03:00.633
to make sure that
they address it.

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:04.767
Additionally, BP voluntarily
agreed to establish a $100

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:08.700
million fund to compensate
unemployed oil rig workers

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.667
affected by the closure
of the deepwater rigs.

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:17.100
We've mutually agreed that
Ken Feinberg will run the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.934
independent claims process
we're putting in place.

00:03:19.934 --> 00:03:23.467
And there will be a three-person
panel to adjudicate claims that

00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:25.400
are turned down.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.667
Every effort will be made
to expedite these claims.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.200
Ken has long experience
in such matters,

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.600
including running the fund that
compensated the victims of 9/11.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.633
And I'm confident he will ensure
that claims are administered as

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:43.467
quickly, as fairly, and as
transparently as possible.

00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:47.133
BP's liabilities for this
spill are significant --

00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:49.100
and they acknowledge that fact.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.633
We will continue to hold BP and
all other responsible parties accountable.

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:57.533
And I'm absolutely confident
BP will be able to meet its

00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:02.066
obligations to the Gulf Coast
and to the American people.

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:06.166
BP is a strong and viable
company and it is in all of our

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:08.934
interests that it remain so.

00:04:08.934 --> 00:04:11.567
So what this is about
is accountability.

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:16.367
At the end of the day, that's
what every American wants and expects.

00:04:16.367 --> 00:04:19.100
The structure we're establishing
today is an important step

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.500
towards making the people of
the Gulf Coast whole again,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.133
but it's not going to turn
things around overnight.

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:28.467
And I want all Americans to know
that I will continue to fight

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:31.934
each and every day until
the oil is contained,

00:04:31.934 --> 00:04:35.133
until businesses recover, and
until the Gulf Coast bounces

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:39.100
back from this tragedy,
as I know it will.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.066
One last point.

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:47.700
During a private conversation
with Chairman Svanberg I

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:55.500
emphasized to him that for the
families that I met with down in

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.600
the Gulf, for the small business
owners, for the fishermen,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.300
for the shrimpers, this is not
just a matter of dollars and

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.900
cents; that a lot of these
folks don't have a cushion.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.867
They were coming off
Rita and Katrina;

00:05:13.867 --> 00:05:16.567
coming off the worst economy
that this country has seen since

00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:23.934
the Great Depression, and this
season was going to be the

00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:27.533
season where they were
going to be bouncing back.

00:05:27.533 --> 00:05:28.934
Not only that,
but this happened,

00:05:28.934 --> 00:05:31.100
from their perspective, at
the worst possible time,

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:37.734
because they're making their
entire income for the year in

00:05:37.734 --> 00:05:43.633
the three or four months during
which folks can take their boats

00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:47.567
out, people are coming
down for tourism.

00:05:47.567 --> 00:05:51.166
And so I emphasized to the
chairman that when he's talking

00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:55.834
to shareholders, when he is
in meetings in his boardroom,

00:05:55.834 --> 00:05:58.967
to keep in mind
those individuals;

00:05:58.967 --> 00:06:02.433
that they are desperate;
that some of them,

00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:05.266
if they don't get
relief quickly,

00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:08.734
may lose businesses that have
been in their families for two

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:11.400
or three generations.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.934
And the chairman assured me that
he would keep them in mind.

00:06:15.934 --> 00:06:21.033
That's going to be the standard
by which I measure BP's responsiveness.

00:06:21.033 --> 00:06:24.700
I think today was a good start,
and it should provide some

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.700
assurance to some of the small
business owners and individuals

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.633
down in the Gulf who I was
visiting with that BP is going

00:06:33.633 --> 00:06:35.700
to meet its responsibilities.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.100
But I indicated to the chairman
that, throughout this process,

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.734
as we work to make sure that the
Gulf is made whole once again,

00:06:45.734 --> 00:06:49.600
that the standard I'm going to
be applying is whether or not

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.266
those individuals I met
with, their family members,

00:06:53.266 --> 00:06:55.734
those communities
that are vulnerable,

00:06:55.734 --> 00:07:02.667
whether they are uppermost in
the minds of all concerned.

00:07:02.667 --> 00:07:04.600
That's who we're
doing this work for.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.433
All right.

00:07:05.433 --> 00:07:06.900
Thank you very much, everybody.
