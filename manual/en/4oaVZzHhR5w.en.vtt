00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.930
- Something really
exciting came in the mail.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.290
I got my very first bread machine.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.450
So I guess after
homeschooling for a decade,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.700
I'm officially a homeschool mom, maybe.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.000
'Cause I finally got a
bread machine in the mail.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.430
This was a bread machine
that we had featured over

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.220
on Free Homeschool Deals last week

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.220
and it was 50% off on Amazon
and I thought, my goodness.

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:26.640
Getting a decent-sized bread machine,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.500
I believe it's supposed
to do up to two-pound loaf

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.100
and it was $47, so I let myself do it.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.090
I have never had one, I've
never even used a bread machine.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.480
But of course I've heard stories about it

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.030
so I'm gonna do an unboxing here

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.530
and we'll see what I got.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.680
So packing paper of course.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.730
(papers crunching)

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.510
Oh this is something I
ordered with my bread machine

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.050
and I read really good reviews on it.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.640
It's called The Bread Lover's
Bread Machine Cookbook.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.540
And of course for my viewers who are doing

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.520
Trim Healthy Mama along with me,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.070
there's not gonna be too
terribly much that I can do.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.960
But I might be able to
make homemade Ezekiel bread

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.270
in this bread machine so
that would be fabulous

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.240
and we'll just learn
and find out together.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.760
So I got this, I think it was $12,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.300
supposed to have over 300 recipes.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.960
And my mad scientist goal
is to also train children

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.700
in how to make bread because
they can just make us

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.610
a loaf a day or two, or three.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.610
And then this, I'm not
too sure what I needed.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.040
Again, brand new for me.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.530
But
(thuds)

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.780
lovely Amazon told me

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.863
that

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.733
I would need this yeast.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.700
So along with my bread
machine, I got the book

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.370
and the yeast and thought
that would be a good start.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.100
So this is

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.350
quick rise yeast for bread
machines and traditional baking.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.830
Again, I'm clueless, I have no idea

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.170
but maybe that'll work for us.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.760
Bubble wrap, kids will love that.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.500
And then, hey Zyon, since
I have the baby on me,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.100
can you help me, come over here.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.958
Oh and Zyon's got his SKrafty shirt on,

00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:19.730
SKrafty i Homeschool in
Minecraft, we're big SKrafty fans.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.580
Go ahead and pick that up and
set it on the table for me.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.433
This will be a box the
little kids can play in.

00:02:28.432 --> 00:02:33.410
Let's see
(papers crunching)

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.461
what is in here.

00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:36.486
(thuds)

00:02:36.486 --> 00:02:37.319
Okay.

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:43.387
(vocalizing)

00:02:43.387 --> 00:02:48.387
So,
(paper crunching)

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:58.744
Okay, thank you Lord for scissors.

00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:03.040
Zyon I may just have to have
you pull it out for me again.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.993
It's called a Breadman 2lb
Horizontal Bread Maker.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.250
Oh, pull, pull, pull,
I'll try to be helpful.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.326
Okay, set that on the table
so they can see the picture.

00:03:15.326 --> 00:03:16.500
(thuds)

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.970
Okay, pictures of bread
on here look lovely.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.030
It says, makes spread from
scratch in one easy step.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.060
Well, I like that.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.060
13-hour display time, oh delay timer

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.793
lets you wake up to fresh
bread, that would be great.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.290
Crust color selection, looks like

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.663
we can choose from
light, medium, and dark.

00:03:42.564 --> 00:03:46.770
Audible beep for fruit and nut add-ins.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.350
Three horizontal loaf
sizes, so we can do a pound,

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.790
a pound and a half, or two pound.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.770
Eight functions, basic
rapid cycle, whole wheat,

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.780
sweet, French, quick bread,
dough, and bake only.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.930
One-hour keep warm recipes included.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.403
Well, for $47, I am thrilled.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.930
This a bread machine that was a closer

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.640
to a hundred besides that markdown.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.645
Now in the description
below, there will be a link

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:19.710
to the book and the yeast
and the bread machine,

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.403
and anything else I
think might be important.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.700
And let me know if you, here's
the little instruction guide,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.730
Breadman instruction
manual and recipe guide.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.290
If you already make bread
and you are so experienced

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.810
at this or believe me,
anyone who's opened a box

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.840
and at least plugged a bread machine in

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.230
has more experience than I do.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.450
So please chat it up in the comments

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.940
and tell me what I should do.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.740
So that's some styrofoam, whew.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.503
Okay Zyon, you're my hefty lifter.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.106
Just put it, you don't
have, just put the whole bag

00:04:55.106 --> 00:04:57.306
on the table, sweetie
and I'll open the bag.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.003
Thank you.

00:05:00.003 --> 00:05:03.200
(plastic crunching)

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.062
Okay.

00:05:04.062 --> 00:05:05.390
(thuds)

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.290
Wow!

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.580
My $47 of fun continues.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.493
So, here's what it looks like
coming out of its wrapper.

00:05:14.493 --> 00:05:16.680
Inside, Jaden, you wanna show them

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.463
what the inside looks like.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.203
So,

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.253
whoop!

00:05:24.238 --> 00:05:27.417
We got some little loaf
attachments for in there and,

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.680
I bet this week we will fire this puppy up

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.083
and get it figured out.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.063
So,

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.510
that is our Breadman
unboxing and I see up here.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.600
It looks like, if I,
you can get this Jaden,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.160
it has basic, fast bake,
French, whole wheat,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.010
sweet, quick bread, dough, and bake only,

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.540
program button, has a
start and stop switch,

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.720
that's where I choose the
crust color, and I imagine

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.560
that's where I'll choose
my loaf size, and a timer.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.370
So we are gonna have a
whole lot of fun with this.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.240
And again, this is the,
what was it called,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.313
Breadman 2lb Horizontal Bread Maker.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.310
Whew, so educate me in the comments below.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.200
Let me know what I should
do, what I need next.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.490
All I have so far is this,
little thing of yeast

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.980
and I don't think I can
get too far with that.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.830
And also let me know if you've
made Ezekiel bread homemade,

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.040
and how that has worked
in the bread machine.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.410
Because obviously doing Trim Healthy Mama,

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.670
I eat a lot of Ezekiel bread
and my husband likes it also.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.730
So that would be super if
somehow it works with this

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.610
and if not, the kids will have fun

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.173
making their own bread also.

00:06:41.173 --> 00:06:44.034
So, talk to us in the comments.

00:06:44.034 --> 00:06:45.497
Buh-bye.

00:06:45.497 --> 00:06:47.914
(calm music)
