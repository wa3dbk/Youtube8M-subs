BECAUSE FOLKS REALLY AREN'T
FINDING JOBS HERE AT STATESIDE.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.133

&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TOPICS

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.800

TO CONDUCT AN EFL CLASSROOM IN
EFFICIENT AND PRODUCTIVE MANNER

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:25.266
WHERE TEACHING THEM WAYS
TO CREATE LESSON PLANS

00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:28.800
FOR ADULT LEARNERS AS WELL
AS WITH YOUNGER LEARNERS,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.667
KINDERGARTEN LEVEL AND UP.

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:31.834
&gt;&gt; WOW.

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:34.200
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE DO NOT NEED TO
BE NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.967
TO TAKE OUR TRAINING PROGRAM
AND GO ABROAD TO TEACH.

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:39.600
ONE OF OUR MAIN OBJECTIVES
IS TO MAKE SURE

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.100
THAT OUR TRAINEES HAVE
THE CONFIDENCE TO DO THIS.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.934
&gt;&gt; ARE THERE ANY OTHER BENEFITS
TO TAKE IN THE TEFL PROGRAM HERE

00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:48.133
AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY,
LONG BEACH AS OPPOSED

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.834
TO ANOTHER UNIVERSITY OR ENTITY?

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:55.066
&gt;&gt; OUR TRAINEES WILL
COME A WAY WITH 160 HOURS

00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:56.367
OF SPECIALIZED TRAINING.

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:59.066
NOW INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS
NOWADAYS IS A MINIMUM

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:00.633
OF 120 HOURS.

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:03.867
OUR TRAINING REALLY IS
SET APART FROM A LOT

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:05.867
OF THE OTHER TRAINING
PROGRAMS THAT ARE OFFERED

00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:07.800
OUT THERE FOR THREE MAIN WAYS.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.200
THE FIRST THING THAT
IS VERY PRACTICAL ALONG

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.200
WITH OFFERING ALL OF THE
LATEST LEARNING THEORIES

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.233
AND TEACHING METHODOLOGIES,
WE REALLY BRING THOSE BACK

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:20.533
TO THE PRACTICAL
APPLICATION IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.600
IT'S ALSO AUTHENTIC.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.200
WE MAKE SURE THAT OUR
TRAINEES HAVE PRACTICE

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.667
WITH ACTUAL ESL STUDENTS
HERE ON CAMPUS.

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:30.967
&gt;&gt; OH, FANTASTIC.

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:35.500
&gt;&gt; IN FACT THEY WILL BE EXPOSED
TO ONE ON ONE, SMALL GROUP

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.033
AND ENTIRE CLASSROOM FULL OF
NON-NATIVE SPEAKERS OF ENGLISH.

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:42.934
AND FOR THEIR FINAL
TEACHING DEMONSTRATION,

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:43.934
THEY'LL BE IN FRONT

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:46.900
OF A CLASSROOM FULL
OF ACTUAL STUDENTS.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.467
THIS PROGRAM IS ALSO EFFECTIVE.

00:02:49.467 --> 00:02:53.000
WE HELP OUR TRAINEES
CREATE AN EFOLIO.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.800
AND ON THIS EFOLIO, IT WILL HAVE
SAMPLES OF THEIR LESSON PLANS

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.900
AND OTHER MATERIALS
THEY'VE CREATED IN CLASS.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.033
IT ALSO INCLUDES PHOTOS
AND VIDEOS THAT WE'VE TAKEN

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:11.400
OF OUR TRAINEES IN ACTION WHEN
THEY DO THEIR PRACTICE TEACHING.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.367
SO IT'S--

00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:13.967
&gt;&gt; WOW THIS E-- IT'S
CALLED AN EFOLIO?

00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:15.266
&gt;&gt; EFOLIO, RIGHT.

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:18.200
&gt;&gt; MY NAME IS BRIAN AGUILAR
AND I JOINED THE TEFL PROGRAM

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.500
IN THE SUMMER OF 2011.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.033
THE THING I ENJOYED THE
MOST REALLY WAS JUST THE FUN

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:28.600
INTERACTION THAT WE HAD IN THE
CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT AS FAR

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.233
AS THE GAMES AND ACTIVITIES
THAT WERE INCORPORATED

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:33.433
WITH THE TEACHING METHODS
THAT WE WERE LEARNING.

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:36.166
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU ENJOY THE
MOST ABOUT THE PROGRAM?

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:39.200
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
ABOUT THE PROGRAM I ENJOYED.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.600
IF I HAD TO PICK A COUPLE,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.433
I WOULD SAY THE CONVERSATION
LABS WERE REALLY AWESOME.

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:47.633
ESSENTIALLY IT GAVE US A CHANCE
TO INTERACT WITH STUDENTS

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:50.867
THAT WERE IN THE PROCESS OF
LEARNING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE

00:03:50.867 --> 00:03:53.400
SO IT REALLY KIND
OF GAVE US A FEEL

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.133
FOR WHAT WE COULD GET
INTO WITH THIS FIELD.

00:03:56.133 --> 00:03:59.767
&gt;&gt; I GOT AN OFFER TO TEACH
ENGLISH IN JAPAN FOR ONE YEAR.

00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:01.066
&gt;&gt; FANTASTIC.

00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:04.000
&gt;&gt; YEAH. SO, AND THIS PROGRAM
HAD A LOT TO DO WITH IT.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.400
I MEAN IT HELPED ME BUILD
MY RESUME AND REALLY STAND

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.433
OUT PROMOTE OTHER PROGRAMS.

00:04:08.433 --> 00:04:11.533
&gt;&gt; I RECOMMEND IT TO A LOT OF
PEOPLE BUT CERTAINLY PEOPLE

00:04:11.533 --> 00:04:15.300
WHO ARE TRYING TO TRAVEL,
ESL IS A REALLY GOOD GIG

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.266
TO GET YOU PRACTICALLY ANYWHERE
IN THE WORLD, ALSO JUST PEOPLE

00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:21.700
THAT ARE INTERESTED IN
LANGUAGE LEARNING IN GENERAL.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.567
I FOUND THAT THROUGH THE PROGRAM
I WAS ACTUALLY LEARNING HOW

00:04:25.567 --> 00:04:26.934
ENGLISH LEARNERS LEARN.

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:27.734
&gt;&gt; OH, WOW.

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:28.834
&gt;&gt; AND THAT'S REALLY VALUABLE.

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:31.300
I'M ACTUALLY, IN TWO
WEEKS, ABOUT TO LEAVE

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.834
FOR TAIWAN FOR MY FIRST--

00:04:32.834 --> 00:04:33.433
&gt;&gt; WOW.

00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:34.100
&gt;&gt; ESL EXPERIENCE.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.300
&gt;&gt; AWESOME.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.166
&gt;&gt; I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS
PROGRAM TO ANYONE WHO HAS

00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:42.567
THAT TRAVEL BUG, JUST WANTS
TO TRAVEL THAT WANTS TO TRAVEL.

00:04:42.567 --> 00:04:44.734
THAT EAGERNESS. I KNOW A LOT OF COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE IT.

00:04:44.734 --> 00:04:46.467
I HAD IT THROUGHOUT
MY COLLEGE YEARS.

00:04:46.467 --> 00:04:47.533
&gt;&gt; SURE.

00:04:47.533 --> 00:04:49.100
&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST THAT EACH
DAY I NEED TO SCRATCH.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.100
&gt;&gt; RIGHT, RIGHT.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.500
&gt;&gt; AND THIS IS DEFINITELY
AN OPPORTUNITY

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.100
THAT WILL HELP YOU PURSUE THAT.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.133
&gt;&gt; I JUST WANT TO
SAY THAT THIS KIND

00:04:56.133 --> 00:04:59.333
OF PROGRAM REALLY OPENS
THE DOORS TO OPPORTUNITY.

00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:01.200
IT OPENS THE MIND
TO NEW EXPERIENCES.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.333
IT OPENS THE HEART TO NEW WAYS

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:05.834
AND NEW WAYS TO LOOK
AT THE WORLD.

00:05:05.834 --> 00:05:08.033
&gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU'RE A
RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATE,

00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:09.900
A SECOND CAREER PROFESSIONAL
OR SOMEONE

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.700
WHO JUST LOVES TRAVELING THE
WORLD, CONSIDER THE TEFL PROGRAM

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.934
