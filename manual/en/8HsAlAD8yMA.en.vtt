00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:01.670
Hey guys.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.836
Thanks so much for watching.

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:05.160
Today's video is going
to be a hair tutorial.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.360
And I'm going to show you how
to get this bubbled pony tail.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.600
So let's get started.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.870
So the first product I'm using today is
Pantene Pro-V's Texturizing Sculpting

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.640
Wax.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.460
You don't need too much of this product,
because a little does go a long way.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.020
I'm going to be working it
into the palms of my hands.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.200
And this is going to help
slick back any flyaways,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.830
and keep my hair tamed
for this hairstyle.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.660
Then grabbing my paddle brush and
brushing out any lumps and bumps,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.680
then securing it with an elastic band.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.540
Now if you don't have one that
matches your hair color, don't worry,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.280
this next tip will help you
out with that situation.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.560
Take a small section of
hair behind your pony tail,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.880
wrap it around, and then secure
it with a couple of bobby pins,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.430
depending on how thick your hair is.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.210
For the next section, use your thumb
and place it at the middle of your ears,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.180
then bring them together and meet them
at the center of the back of your head

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.160
and secure with another elastic band.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.070
Now we are ready to
make our first bubble.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.450
Lightly tug on sections of your hair
loose from the second pony tail.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.590
And there you go.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.500
Then we are going to be repeating
the same process as we did up top,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.910
by taking a small section of
hair behind the second pony tail,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.970
wrapping it around a couple of times
and securing it with a few bobby pins.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.920
And once again, gently tug on
small sections of the hair loose

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.970
to create that bubble effect.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.690
Now the rest of this a tutorial will
depend on how long your hair is.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.770
That will determine
how many more ties you

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.650
need to add to the end of your ponytail.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.110
Now my hair is fairly long, so
I just needed two more sections.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.330
Now the only thing left to do
is make you were last bubbles,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.080
and set the hairstyle with
a flexible hold hairspray.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.540
I'm using Number 1, by Pantene
Pro-V, spraying it just

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.190
at the crown of my head,
slicking back any of my flyaways.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.940
And we are good to go.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.930
Now I know summer is winding down, but
it's still pretty steamy out there,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.590
and an easy way to
keep cool and sheek is

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.550
by pairing this easy up-do with a pop
of color through your accessories,

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.020
like these earrings from BAUBLEBAR.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.210
Hopefully you enjoyed this tutorial.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.680
And I'll see you guys in the next one.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.075
Bye.
