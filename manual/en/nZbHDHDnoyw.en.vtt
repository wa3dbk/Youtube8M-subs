00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.790
- Today on The Slanted Lens, we're going
to show you how to freeze action with

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.170
strobes; not a high speed sync but
freezing with actually mono blocks and

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.310
normal flash mode. I'm going to use a
trampoline, my Baha B4's and a warrior

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.743
princess to illustrate this principle.
Let's get started and see what we can do.

00:00:13.743 --> 00:00:16.309
♪ [music] ♪

00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:31.382
First, to understand how to freeze action

00:00:31.382 --> 00:00:34.850
with strobes it's important to understand
how strobes work; and more importantly how

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.250
your strobes work. They're all very
different, you need to figure out how

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.370
yours works to apply these principles.
Strobes are simply a flash of light; most

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.960
things that flash it's immediate, because
to our eyes it happened so fast we think

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.610
it just happens all at once, that's really
not the case at all. Strobes have what is

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.440
called a flash duration, the amount of
time it takes for a strobe to come to peak

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.030
power and then the to tail off. Flash
duration on a chart is like a shark's fin,

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.690
it makes a shark rise up and then a slow
fall off kind of a tail. T-5 records the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.760
amount of time that the flash duration is
above 50%. T-1 represents all the time

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.750
that the flash is burning from the time
its above 10% to back down to 10%. So

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.030
consequently a T-1 gives you a much better
idea of the flash duration because 50% of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.380
the light is happening underneath that 50%
mark, so what's happening in the long tail

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.420
off and that can cause burn on your
subject. So when you buy your strobes,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.910
look at a T-1 flash duration rating, that
will give you a true idea of just how long

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.400
flash duration is.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.540
Nowadays, and the Baha B4 has this,
there's modern technology that is called

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.690
IGBT technology. It basically acts like a
switch, that turns the flash off quick and

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.710
cuts it and gives you a very spiked flash
duration. It cuts a little bit of the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.980
power out, but that spiked flash duration
is very short and allows you to stop

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.970
action much easier. So there's something
else you should check out when you're

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.960
buying your mono blocks, do you have IGBT
technology. For our photoshoot today, I'm

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.820
gonna do three things to freeze the
action; first, I'm gonna dial the power

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.670
down to 50% on my Baha B4; it's going to
reduce the flash duration as I dial the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.830
power down. Now not all mono blocks will
do this, like the Einstein it actually

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.730
lengthens the flash duration when you dial
the power down. So it's important if

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.020
you're going to apply this principle that
you look at the manual for your mono block

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.910
and see if shortening the power actually
reduces the flash duration, on the Baha B4

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.910
it does.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.330
Second, I'm gonna shorten
my shutter speed until I

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.550
get a clip from the shutter speed on the
image. So I'll start out at 30th, 60th and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.880
I'll keep dialing it faster and faster
until finally it clips the frame; and then

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.410
I'll step back one step and that will be
my shutter speed. Third, I'm gonna use the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.390
oldest trick in the book; maybe not the
oldest trick in the book, but it's

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.710
certainly the second oldest trick in the
book. It's simply a matter of I'm going to

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.790
shoot at peak action, everything that goes
up has gotta come down. So there's that

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.410
moment when it's going up, when it just
pauses and then it starts to come back

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.690
down. Now I may not be able to hit that
exact moment every single time, but I can

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.590
be very close to it. If I can shoot at
that moment I'm gonna be far more likely

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.800
to freeze the action because the subject
is not moving near as fast. So there you

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.380
have it. Dial your power down, get the
fastest shutter speed you can and shoot at

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.120
peak action. Let's apply that to our
warrior princess and see what we can do.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.720
I've got a trampoline set behind the wall
that she's going to jump on. She doesn't

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.230
have to get very high to look really good,
it's just below the surface of the wall,

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.120
she just takes a little jump to get up in
the air, pulls her legs up underneath her

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.450
and it looks like she's way up in the air.
It also sets me up so that she's going to

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.260
go up and then come back down; I don't
want her jumping over the wall towards me

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.680
because now my focus is changing. I want
her to go straight up and straight down, I

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.800
can keep a plane of focus, I can find the
peak action, is a perfect time to shoot.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.870
Okay, let's look at our lighting break
down and we'll get started shooting.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.690
My first light is a Baha B4 with a
reflector on the camera left side. It's

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.300
going to open up the smoke a lot more than
this image shows. It'll open up the smoke

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.940
on that left hand side. My second light
will be a strobe set up on the camera

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.500
right side deep in the background. We
actually put it on the roof in order to

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.840
light the smoke from behind. That's gonna
give us a nice rimless smoke on the right

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.700
hand side. So two lights in the background
for my smoke; camera right, camera left.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.180
This next image shows our third and our
fourth lights. Up front we have a medium

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.390
soft block with a grid as our key and for
a rim light we got a Baha B4 with just a

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.800
reflector on it. It gives us a nice little
rim on the cape and on the side of her

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.120
hair. There's a few other things that are
going on in this shoot. First we've got a

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.090
fan on camera left side that's going to
blow up underneath her cape. We tied a

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.350
rope to the cape, it catches the wind
underneath the cape and becomes like a

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.010
sail, it kinda flows behind her. We're
also using two smoke machines; we've got a

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.450
Rosco Vapour Plus in the background. It's
loaded with stage and studio fluid and

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.270
it's pointing right through a fan. That
fan dissipates it, kinda throws it out

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.530
into the air and and makes it a lot
softer. We have a second Rosco Vapour,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.780
it's going to be on the camera left side.
So we have one on the camera right, one on

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.710
camera left. I use the stage and studio
because our neighbors are complaining that

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.180
the smoke is packing into their yard and
their house and they're just complaining.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.640
So we use the stage and studio, it gives
us a big burst, but then dissipates very

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.830
quickly and doesn't flow into the
neighbor's yard. It also goes through a

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.640
fan to kind of break it up and gives us a
nice wall smoke behind our subject matter.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.120
For a few of the shots we had an air
cannon behind, we blew some leaves and

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.400
materials towards her back just to give
another dimension of stuff exploding

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.510
around her as she jumps over the wall. So
here's a few of our images before we did

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.752
our retouching.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.000
The last step is to take the image into
Nik software and work on it. You know,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.320
first, I'm gonna add a bleach bypass
later. I love bleach bypass, it takes a

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.090
lot of the color out. I can control some
contrast issues in bleach bypass. Then I

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.080
added a light blue colorizer layer. I then
added a contrast layer and last of all I

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.120
added the Vignette. So there's our final
image. So this was shot for Dynalite. It's

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.420
going to be an ad that'll run in
PhotoDistrict News. I guess I should say

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.550
an ad that's already ran, at this point,
in Photo District News, so check that out.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.550

freezing action and you can apply it to
