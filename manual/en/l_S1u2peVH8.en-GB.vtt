00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.040
Hey guys this is impaKt and in this short
video I'll be talking about what you CAN do

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.340
to recover from a first blood in lane - in
other words, how to deal with an enemy that

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.770
is ahead.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.200
In the clip that I'm running right now we
don't really give out first blood. It was

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.460
the second kill of the game, but at the time
kills are already worth pretty decent chunks

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.869
of gold, so it's even more beneficial for
Jinx in this case.

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.510
In the last video about how to deal with first
blood I talked about aggression, I talked

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.050
about abusing your enemies early, but this
time you don't need to be aggressive. Hell,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.950
most of the times it's a bad idea unless you
have a really strong combination of laners.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.650
If you gave a kill away, you're gonna have
to put a lot of things aside and start playing

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.660
SMART. And this is exactly the keyword I want
you to remember - SMART.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.930
There isn't just a magical play that you can
pull off to recover from that kind of disadvantage,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.300
there's no secret way to do it. What you CAN
do is start THINKING about the lane. You want

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.820
to take a look at your own summoners and cooldowns,
at your enemies' summoners and cooldowns,

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.110
you're going to look at everyone's items and
you're going to take each of the duo's power

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.250
into consideration as well. You NEED to know
at what point in the game your champions are

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.170
strongest. So in this case, we're playing
Sona Varus and Varus dies at level 4. So what

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.830
exactly can we do? Well for starters Sona
is pretty beast at level 6, and her ult synergizes

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.530
INCREDIBLY well with Varus, so that's a starting
point - reaching level 6 and playing safe

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.000
until then. What else do we need? As Sona,
I'm going to need resistances in order to

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.140
withstand their damage and take as much as
I possibly can so Varus can deal free damage.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.480
I don't have a lot of gold, so what I'm going
to get is Doran's Shield for both the extra

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.450
HP and HP Regen. You also need to take every
single drop of XP you possibly can so you

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.680
don't reach level 6 too late, and the last
and KEY part of the recipe is: wait for the

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.960
enemies to make a mistake. EVERYONE makes
mistakes. ALWAYS. There is ALWAYS something

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.159
you can do in Solo Queue. So in this case,
Thresh tries to ult both me and Varus and

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.700
doesn't take Varus flash into account. Since
I was actually caught in The Box, they focus

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.280
me down. They use everything on me, both jinx
and thresh. I even get ignited in the end,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.200
but remember what I said about itemization:
you need to expect the enemies' damage. Since

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.200
they were already ahead, they get cocky. They're
pretty sure they can kill us easily, and it's

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.280
this overconfidence that you need to exploit.
Jinx lines up with thresh which allows me

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.730
to land the perfect crescendo on both of them,
granting Varus the perfect opportunity for

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.840
his own ult, and if I wanted to I could've
even used Diminuendo power chord on Jinx for

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.190
the reduced damage.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.670
Now, remember that this video is just an example
of what you CAN do. But the key point is:

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.961
you need to know when your combo is strongest,
you need to exploit that as well as your enemies'

00:02:53.961 --> 00:03:00.060
over confidence, and you NEED to recognize
when a mistake is made by your opponents.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.810
You NEED to capitalize on those mistakes.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.099
