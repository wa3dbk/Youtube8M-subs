00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.321
Tracer is the newest addition to MT family, and this is it's best feature, in terms of looks

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:33.271
Handguards also looks very good, but their practicallity is limmited, due to the distance from grips

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.880
MT-09 Tracer is highly expected in Greece, as it takes the place of TDM, a best seller in its class

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.359
...even though it has nothing in common

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.920
Tracer is highly expected in Greece, because of its price and overall package

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.300
Even though we pointed out a few black spots, months ago

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.140
when we tested in Spain, in its world launch

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.596
the price and the technical characteristics are enough to overpass all the negatives

00:01:12.876 --> 00:01:14.876
It may costs almost 10.000 Euro, but it’s worth every cent

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:25.699
On our dyno, the Yamaha 3-cylinder showed 104,7 hp/ 10.300 rpm

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.100
and 8.2 kg.m of torque for 208 kilos, measured with full tank

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.990
these numbers help it to accelerate in 3.4 sec from 0 to 100 km

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.936
a decent performance for a motorcycle of this category

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.440
Having a fuel consumption of 6.5L per 100Km, you could say it’s fast an efficient in the same time

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.360
It’s a sporty motorcycle that you can explore it’s limits with fare safety,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.358
But if you puss it too much the rear shock absorber will show it’s limits

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.400
The rear shock absorber isn’t made to go extremely fast, but chassis stiffness and fork stability compensate for the rear suspension

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:31.776
Testing in all road conditions, from twisty roads to filtering the heavy traffic of Athens

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.320
we analyzed all  aspects of the new Tracer, which we thoroughly unfold on this month issue

00:02:40.256 --> 00:02:42.936
Top fuel consumption we measured was 9l for 100Km, while abusing the throttle…

00:02:42.936 --> 00:02:45.816
It’s because Tracer tempts you to go faster and faster

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.660
While measuring brake distance from 150Km to 0 from tire failed, we traveled a lot with it and had no other problems, what so ever

00:03:44.988 --> 00:03:48.948
Tracer doesn’t excel somewhere specifically, but on average it’s good in everything you through at it… that’s way it’s going to be a best seller…
