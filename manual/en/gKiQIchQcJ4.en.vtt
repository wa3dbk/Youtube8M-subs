Today we are learning how to kick a soccer
ball high and far. This OSA video is sponsored

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.360
by our parent company BelieveinitApparel.com.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.680
This style of kick can be used for clearing
a ball up the field, hitting a long ball over

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.730
the top, corner kicks, goal kicks and any
reason you need height and distance on the

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.160
ball.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.450
Before you learn how to kick high and far
I recommend fist being able to Chip a ball

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.660
properly. Learn by watching this Online Soccer
Academy video here.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.840
The chip is for high, soft floated passes.
Kicking for distance and height will be a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.480
similar technique. If you can do the chip
with confidence, it will make kicking high

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.070
and far easier.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.070
Key Point #1 - Line up behind the ball and
a tad to the side.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.790
Key Point #2 - Your shoulders should face
your target on your approach and follow through.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.320
Turn your shoulders and the ball will go where
your shoulders told it to. Think of your shoulders

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.000
like the scope of a gun. If the scope is off
you aint hitting your target son!

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.290
Key Point #3 - Your plant foot should be 1.5
to 2 steps away from the ball when you make

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.870
contact. This allows your foot to be formatted
properly for your swing.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.870
Key Point #4 - Turn your kicking foot to the
side, rotate your foot down and make contact

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.140
with the ball just below the base of your
big toe.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.190
Key Point #5 - Strike the lower part of the
ball but not directly under it. For a chip

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.460
you strike underneath the ball. Doing this
will get your plenty of height but not as

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.320
much distance. By striking on the lower part
of the ball you will still get height but

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.399
a lot more distance.

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:21.300
Key Point #6 - Have a low back swing and a
low follow through.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.089
A lot of players look like this when they
make this type of swing. By coming down on

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:31.190
the ball all that power you created in your
backswing is going down in the ground. You

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.350
don't want that.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.850
With a low back swing, now all your power
is moving forward in the direction where you

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.279
want the ball to go.

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:45.109
If you follow through high on your swing this
will cause the ball to not go up as high as

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.109
it should when you kick it.

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.499
You want a low follow through.

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:56.499
Key Point #7 - It's about technique, not power.
Don't be all Hulk like on your swing!

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.490
You should be smooth. The best players make
this look easy because they relay on technique

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.429
not pure strength.

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:13.199
Key Point #8 - Make sure you lean back when
you follow through. Do not be hunched over

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:18.770
the ball.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.809
That was a lot of key points. Before we get
into the exercise I want to tell you about

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:26.929

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.089

Message me when you do and I'll tell our shipping

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.599
and sticker too!

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.270
Now for an exercise we can do to practice.
You will need as many balls as you have, 4

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.109
cones and a lot of space. Please don't do
this in your backyard and break your parent's

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:53.649
windows!

00:03:53.649 --> 00:04:00.649
Start off by taking a few swings without the
ball. Get your body use to how this will feel.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.669
Once comfortable get the ball out and take
some swings. Don't worry about accuracy or

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:15.399
distance yet. Focus on technique. You could
even start with chipping the ball a few times

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:18.470
and then progress to height and distance.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.390
When you feel confident with your technique
set up four cones as a square target up the

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.410
field. Try to kick the ball high and far and
make it land in the square.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.040
Repeat until you master it or feel tired.
Make sure you are good and warmed up and don't

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:41.040
do this for an hour. I don't want you pulling
anything!

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.450
Some things that could be going wrong.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.380
If your plant foot is to close to the ball
then you can't get the proper swing. You will

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.640
end up using the inside of your foot, not
rotating your foot down like I talked about

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.570
in Key Point #4.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.510
If you aren't getting much height check your
backswing. Most players have a high back swing.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.990
Don't kick your leg out when you step to the
ball. Instead take a step to the ball and

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.160
let your back leg trail behind you.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.520
Increase your kicking leg speed as your technique
improves. Technique equals power. When your

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.040
technique is solid then you can add more pure
strength to your swing. Do this by increasing

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.880
the speed at which you swing your kicking
leg to strike the ball. This will equal greater

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.000
distance on your kicks.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.290
