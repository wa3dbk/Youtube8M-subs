00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.810
 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.840
Minecraft actually began in the form of
another game titled RubyDung

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.960
not much is known about the game
other than that it was influenced by a

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.080
city-building freeware game called Dwarf
Fortress

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.689
while Notch was working on RubyDung he found another game titled Infiniminer

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.700
Infiniminer was an open source
multiplayer block-based sandbox

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.310
building and digging game

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.840
sharing many similar features with what
would later become Minecraft

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.989
the name Minecraft came about when a user
in an IRC chatroom with notch

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.000
suggested itbut originally Notch wanted to call it Minecraft: Order of the Stone

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.600
this is the first ever version and released
video of the game

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.199
then only titled as Cave Game only four
days later on May 17th 2009

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.780
the very first alpha version of the game
is released to the public

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.119
this image is believed to be the first
ever in game creation shared by a user

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.729
only 49 minutes after the game was released

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.740
and two and a half hours after release
the very first in-game sprite art in the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.240
form of an 8-bit Mario was created and
shared

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.009
if you're even slightly involved in the
Minecraft gaming community it's very likely

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.939
you've heard about Herobrine

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.900
it's a creepypasta story about the
character in the game which looks

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.990
exactly like the protagonist Steve

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.270
with the exception of the eyes which are
completely white

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.409
different sources state that Herobrine either
started on 4chan or the minecraft forums

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.479
sometimes in mid to late 2010 since then
it's achieved an enormous popularity

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.020
with a large following creating various
mods texture packs skins another game

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.990
content to bring Herobrine to life

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.649
it got so popular that even the game's
creators and developers started making

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.810
little hints and easter eggs towards it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.770
for example in several patch updates
they've added a line "Herobrine Removed"

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.829
or in the Xbox 360 version of the game
there's a loading screen note that reads

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.000
"We think 4J Studios has removed Herobrine, but we're not too sure"

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.400
however like almost every other creepypasta story

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.790
it's all a work of fiction there's
nothing in the source code of the game

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.030
to indicate Herobrine's existence

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.180
and Notch has officially said himself that
Herobrine is not

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.830
in the game and that there are no plans
for a future implementation

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.920
the creeper is a very iconic creature in
Minecraft

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.370
but it was actually created by mistake the
creeper came about when the length and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.110
height of a pig model was accidentally
inverted resulting in a tall midsection

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.450
with small legs

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.870
Notch liked the look of the model and added a
green texture to it

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.370
and so the creeper was born all the
creatures in the game

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.530
are genderless even the main
protagonists Steve is neither male or female

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.069
or both the name Steve was actually just
suggested as a joke by Notch

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.650
but the name stuck with players and has
been widely used ever since

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.290
if you want to be accurate Steve should
be referred to only as

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.700
The Player

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.319
Minecraft is pretty huge I mean like really huge

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.510
it's so huge that you could say it's
infinite and no one would be the wiser

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.640
however that is technically not true

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.019
the map itself might be infinite but the
part of the map the player can interact

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.120
with and walk-on

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.730
is not one block in Minecraft equals 1
meter and if you stand in the center of

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.000
the world you will have approximately
thirty

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.900
million blocks in any given direction
that's sixty million meters in both the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.440
z and x axis

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.190
that equals 3.6 quadrillion

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.709
square meters seven thousand times
larger than the surface of the earth

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.379
beyond this edge world generation is
drastically simplified

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.950
you'll fall right through blocks and the
game will most likely crash

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.189
there's been some ridiculously amazing
and obviously time-consuming minecraft

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:04.709
creations over the years

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.830
here are a few examples the city King's
Landing from the TV series Game of Thrones

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.930
a computer inside Minecraft using
redstone

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.190
one of the large cities from the Lord of
the Rings universe

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.930
Mirrors Edge a scale model of the
Starship from the TV series Battlestar Galactica

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.479
an original Minecraft world called
Imperial City

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.750
when you create a new Minecraft world
you do not only create 1 world

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.930
both 3 the default world or dimension

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.290
is called The Overworld then by using
portals you can travel to two other

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.330
dimensions

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.759
these were in the beginning supposed to
be representations of heaven

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.080
and hell however only the latter made it
into the game in the form of

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.139
The Nether the third dimension which was
originally going to be called Sky

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.540
Dimension turned into a world called

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.830
The End the home world of the endermens and if you've played Minecraft you

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.660
should know it's anything but heaven

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.270
if you open up the texture
for Zombie Pigmen

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.590
you'll find a hidden message written on it
the message is a thank you note from

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.389
Notch to the original creator of the
skin

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.509
and while speaking of textures 3 of the
pictures featured on paintings in the game

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.960
are from the game Counter Strike

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.150
part of Minecraft's success is believed to
be the cause of the games constant updates

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.320
new content is added frequently which
keeps the game alive

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.630
but because of the constant updates
there're bound to be ideas that never

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.259
made it into the current version of the
game

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.570
and sometimes you just have to wonder
why

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.720
for example Gears was a block that was
supposed to be added to the game

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.789
but for unknown reasons they never did and
most likely was replaced by redstone

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.410
it's not know what function Gears would
have had but the files has since been

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.380
completely removed from the current
versions of the game

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.419
another feature was lanterns just like
torches you could hold the lantern in

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.479
your hand but unlike torches

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.490
you did not have to place the lantern
ford it to shine

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.620
meaning you could walk around at night
with the lantern equipped

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.130
and be able to see just fine Emerald ore
was never supposed to be in the game

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.539
but was changed from the previous idea
of Ruby ore

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.139
at the last stages of implementation
because a developer had trouble

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.360
spotting the difference between Ruby ore

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.690
and redstone the texture of Ruby ore can
still be found the game files and it's

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.470
unknown whether or not they will be
used in the future

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.060
also in the texture files of game
there seems to be textures

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.770
for a chair and a table leading many
players to believe

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.740
furniture was at some point supposed to
be added to the game

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.530
but don't worry many of these dropped
or on hold ideas and features can

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.000
still be added today by using mods
