00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.220
A tiny personal computer that is worn on the
ear and can be controlled with the blink of

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.610
an eye or the click of a tongue is being tested
in Japan. The 17-gram (0.59-ounce) wireless

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.679
device has bluetooth capability and is equipped
with a GPS, compass, gyro-sensor, battery,

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:25.599
barometer, speaker and microphone. Wearable
computing is thought by many commentators

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.880
to be the next big thing in technology, with
products such as Google Glass at the forefront.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.870
The device, known at the moment as the "Earclip-type
Wearable PC" has a microchip and data storage,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.350
enabling users to load software, said engineer
Kazuhiro Taniguchi of Hiroshima City University.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.080
Its designs are based on traditional "ikebana"
flower arrangements. "We have made this with

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.910
the basic idea that people will wear it in
the same way they wear earrings," Taniguchi

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.510
told AFP in a recent interview as he showcased
a black prototype. The system, which developers

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.200
are hoping to have ready for Christmas 2015,
can be connected to an iPod or other gadget

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.600
and would allow the user to navigate through
software programmes using facial expressions,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.400
such as a raised eyebrow, a stuck-out tongue,
a wiggle of the nose or by clenching teeth.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.810
The device uses infrared sensors that monitor
tiny movements inside the ear, which differ

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.180
depending on how the eyes and mouth move.
Because the user does not have to move either

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.580
hand, its developers say it can serve as "a
third hand" for everyone from caregivers to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.750
rock-climbers, motorbike riders to astronauts,
as well as people with disabilities. "Supposing

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.409
I climb a mountain, look at the sky at night
and see a bright star up there, it could tell

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.450
me what it is," Taniguchi said. "As it knows
what altitude I'm at, which direction I'm

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.460
looking and at what angle, it could tell me,
'The bright star you are seeing now is Sirius'."

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.460
Using a smartphone to connect to the Internet
would mean you could be automatically put

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.920
in touch with people in faraway places who
are doing the same thing as you. "This could

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.200
connect you with a person who is looking at
the same star at a remote place at the same

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.940
time," enabling the people to swap impressions,
Taniguchi said. A second version of the device

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.860
might be pressed into use to help relatives
keep an eye on elderly family in greying Japan.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.980
The earpiece, which could also function as
a hearing aid, could monitor the wearer's

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.870
health, including their pulse and body temperature,
while logging how often they eat and sneeze,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.101
offering early warning of the onset of illness.
An onboard accelerometer could tell when the

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:49.320
user falls and instruct the smartphone to
pass information to relatives, or call an

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.739
ambulance based on GPS data. Tests are being
carried out in Hiroshima, with the aim of

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.540
commercialising the device from April 2016.
