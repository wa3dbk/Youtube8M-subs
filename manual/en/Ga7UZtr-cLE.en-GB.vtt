00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.330
This video tutorial will show you how to apply
texture to your 3D model

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.039
Let's open a project where texture has not
yet been applied.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:19.060
Our project consists of several scans and
one fusion. The texture frames which were

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.199
captured during the scanning will be used
in the texturization process. That’s why

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.979
it is vitally important for the model to be
aligned with the scans.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.320
Simplify the geometry of the model before
applying texture.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.780
Use the Mesh simplification algorithm in the
Tools panel.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.750
Now our 3D model consists of the optimal number
of polygons, simplification was done without

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.070
loss of detailization.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.970
So now let's open the Texture panel.
We'll choose the model from the list above.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.800
In the lower section we choose the scans that
the model was created from. Please note that

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.010
the model and the scans must be aligned.
There are two main modes of texturing: atlas

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.560
or triangles maps. They differ in how the
texture data is stored. Let’s choose Atlas.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.700
Now we click on Apply and wait until the process
has finished.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.899
Once that is done, we can adjust Brightness,
Contrast and other parameters of the texture.

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.880
Sometimes it is useful to switch off the Lightening
in 3D Control to evaluate the quality and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.549
smoothness of the texture.
Let’s see the result - the algorithm divided

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.299
the surface into the minimal number of the
correlating parts.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.400
Now let’s choose the other way of texture
mapping.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.080
Choose texture size.
Below is the number of textures which will

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.189
be generated.
Click on Apply.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.801
The Triangles map method creates multiple
texture files that consist of many colored triangles.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.680
The other option in the Scan panel (Use existing

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.859
atlas UV)
is meant not for UV unwrapping but for changing

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.740
texture resolution.
There is only one step here.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.000
This is useful when you want to increase or
decrease the resolution of existing texture.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.980
And that’s it! Happy texturizing!
