00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.720
What's up Food Tube. I'm Kelis. I'm backstage at Big Feastival.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.561
Jamie's asked me to cook a few things, so

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:14.193
I'm going to make shredded flank steak sliders.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.760
Now it comes from something called a which is a Puerto Rican kinda Cuban dish.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.483
We're gonna like start then and then we're gonna scootch on down and we're gonna make something else

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:29.028
and then become the sliders. Erm, alright. So we're gonna start off with a little bit of olive oil.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:31.902
This is actually really easy too, and it's great cos it's one of those things that you can put on

00:00:31.902 --> 00:00:33.840
and walk away

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.060
go watch tv. Ha ha.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.880
Play outside. Come back.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.902
And it'll still be doing what it does.

00:00:39.902 --> 00:00:44.669
I like flank steak too because it's got so many different ways you can cook it.

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:47.871
So one of the first things, always, is to start with a hot pot.

00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:51.302
So right now we're just searing it. We want to give it a nice good colour.

00:00:51.302 --> 00:00:56.543
We've got some sea salt here, a little ground pepper. As you start to sear the meat sometimes you'll feel it stick.

00:00:56.543 --> 00:01:01.739
And one of the things I realised was that as soon as it releases, like if you're not tugging, you're not fighting with

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.056
it, then you know it's done so you can flip it over.

00:01:04.303 --> 00:01:07.903
So we've got some paprika here. I love smoked paprika

00:01:07.903 --> 00:01:09.716
for colour, it's absolutely amazing.

00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:12.252
So like you can make this, and you can separate part of it

00:01:12.252 --> 00:01:15.597
add your sauce to it. Have amazing, you know, sliders, and then tomorrow you could have like

00:01:15.597 --> 00:01:20.093
it with rice, or you know what do you guys have? Bubble and Squeak or something?

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:23.215
Right? Yeah! Ha ha ha!

00:01:23.423 --> 00:01:25.903
So good. It would totally work. Ha ha!

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.820
But today we're gonna have sliders.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.633
Alright. So we've got some ground cumin

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.240
Cumin is a really, really strong flavour. So you've got to be really careful

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.960
I'm going to add some onions here. We've got some greens, some red bell peppers here.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.840
We've got some garlic cloves here.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.900
I'm from the rule that there's never too much garlic.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.280
I already have a boyfriend, so I'm not too worried about that. He's not going anywhere.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.700
Don't start off this way in a relationship.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.268
We've got some fresh thyme, some oregano, and some rosemary.

00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:57.615
And once your meat is slightly brown, you're not trying to cook it fully right now, you just want to give it

00:01:57.615 --> 00:02:00.150
some colour so that it's not hideously grey.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.593
I'm just going to add some water.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.740
You just want to just about cover it.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.460
This is great. I want to cook outside more. This is fun.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.497
We're gonna add a bit more salt to it, we're gonna add a bit more cumin.

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:15.583
And for colour I always like to add a bit more paprika. I love paprika.

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:17.803
Well the water acts like a tenderizer right,

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:21.869
So first what we do is keep this heat on really high cops it's going to boil and we're gonna make sure it's hot.

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:28.205
And then we bring it all the way down and then you cover it, then you go out, walk around. Buy something online.

00:02:28.286 --> 00:02:33.806
Hang out, let it do what it's gonna do. Everything starts to get soaked in the water.

00:02:33.806 --> 00:02:38.398
And then the water cooks down. It reduces and it's going to make a really nice gorgeous thick kind of gravy

00:02:38.398 --> 00:02:40.871
sort of thing. And you really shred that meat.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.460
We're gonna make our sauce now.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.578
Our sauce is a wild cherry bbq sauce

00:02:49.798 --> 00:02:51.398
infused with espresso.

00:02:51.398 --> 00:02:54.658
Which is my favourite part. And I threw in a few other things to put your mind at ease.

00:02:54.658 --> 00:02:59.400
Things like ketchup and mustard. We've got some horseradish in case you're wondering what this strange

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.020
long object is.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.600
This is chilli oil. I love stuff with a kick.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.122
So onions, garlic, salt, and some pepper in there. This is brown sugar here. Don't worry about it being too sweet

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:12.920
cos you've got so many other components in there that it's going to counteract.

00:03:13.038 --> 00:03:14.158
So more paprika.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.700
This is all spice, which is gorgeous.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.461
But again you don't want to go too crazy with it.

00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:20.706
Okay now we're starting to get the effect that we want.

00:03:20.706 --> 00:03:27.217
A little bit of vanilla extract, a teaspoon and a half ish. For me being a sauce head I make tonnes of sauce,

00:03:27.217 --> 00:03:32.400
and usually I'd do it on the weekends. So I'll make like BBQ sauce, or jerk sauce, or ginger sesame glaze

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.539
whatever it is I'm making

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:37.879
I'll make a bunch of it and then I put it in the fridge so then when my little girl comes home from school

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.500
I could grill some chicken or I'll make a steak and I've just got sauce.

00:03:40.508 --> 00:03:43.948
I promise you horseradish, I give you horseradish.

00:03:43.948 --> 00:03:47.783
Okay so be careful with your manicure, cos this will demolish it.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.380
You would think how unclassy is ketchup. Judge not.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.020
So remember we're worried about how much brown sugar we put in there. We're gonna put some mustard

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.535
this is definitely going to counteract.

00:03:57.535 --> 00:04:01.445
Work with it. That looks like a good colour. Now I'm just going to add a little bit more brown sugar,

00:04:01.445 --> 00:04:07.477
We've got some good Worcester Sauce. I'm gonna add some more black pepper now. We're seasoning in layers

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:11.339
The winds like no you're not.

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:14.592
Ha ha ha! Okay. Now we're going to add my most favourite thing

00:04:15.047 --> 00:04:16.327
espresso. So good.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.460
So that makes it really delicious.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.194
But if you feel you're short on time you can take your really finely ground coffee

00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:26.391
and put it straight in there, cos you're already cooking it. It's essentially brewing anyway.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:31.303
You let this cook. You want your garlic and your onions to be completely like soft and mushy so they don't have

00:04:31.424 --> 00:04:33.824
that kind of bitter ending, and then

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.860
here's the secret, right

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.800
cherries. So good.

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:40.722
Really good.

00:04:40.722 --> 00:04:46.701
These are fresh cherries. I wouldn't use canned and I wouldn't use cos I don't even know what that is.

00:04:46.701 --> 00:04:48.422
To be honest, is this a cherry?

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:52.388
Let those cook. You're going to start to see the colour. How pretty is that?

00:04:52.388 --> 00:04:56.359
You start off with like a cup, a cup and a half and then do it to taste.

00:04:56.359 --> 00:05:01.359
Obviously I thought of cherry sauce. So bbq sauce with cherry,  just bare that in mind.

00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:04.961
You let this simmer down. You let it reduce. Do you smell that? Literally it's amazing cos you can smell like

00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:08.744
all the different things. You can smell the coffee, you can smell the cumin, you can smell the all spice,

00:05:09.102 --> 00:05:14.862
and the Worcester. It's like it becomes this wonderful family of flavour. It's great.

00:05:14.862 --> 00:05:16.098
Oh I forgot we blend it. Durr!

00:05:16.098 --> 00:05:17.180
You have to blend the sauce.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.815
Ha ha. You have to blend the sauce.

00:05:21.911 --> 00:05:26.871
Our sauce has been blended, and over here we've got our beef that is all done

00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:29.434
Just look at how gorgeous that is.

00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:32.730
I mean literally guys this is with a fork. Like I want you to see this. Like

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.576
it's literally falling apart.

00:05:34.576 --> 00:05:39.172
You just keep doing this until you get all those big chunks out. How good is that?

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.640
So good. Once you take all of your meat out

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.844
keep that sauce. You can add a little slurry or rue or something. You've got amazing gravy

00:05:46.844 --> 00:05:50.589
Put it in the fridge. Throw it over something later. Not a big deal. Look at that colour.

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:53.214
How beautiful is that? A little bit at a time. You're just

00:05:53.214 --> 00:05:56.228
tpssing it in the sauce. You don't want it to be like mush.

00:05:56.228 --> 00:05:58.859
I've got these super cute little buns here.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.480
Look how cute that is. Yummy!

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.719
That was my shredded flank sliders with wild cherry bbq sauce infused with espresso. I do hope you like it

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:13.171
I like it. If you haven't subscribed yet

00:06:13.288 --> 00:06:15.608
Seriously. If you want to talk to me

00:06:15.686 --> 00:06:17.446
I talk back. Totally fine.

00:06:17.446 --> 00:06:22.061
And there's tonnes of great chefs on here, like myself and obviously Jamie and a whole gang of other folks.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.520
So don't miss it,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.100
I mean they're good, they're good.
