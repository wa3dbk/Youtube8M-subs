00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:04.770
The eyelashes we're going to be using, you
can find at any of your local beauty supply

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.000
stores. They are big, long eyelashes with
sparkles in it to tie all of her glittery

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:24.130
accentuations and you just pull from the corner
to peel them off of their case. And you apply

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:33.770
the lash glue, just on the edge. Just a thin
stripe. And you want to apply it on the side

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.000
that will be going down into her eyelashes
so that it can bond with her natural eyelashes.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.680
I'm going to have her close her eyes, and
I'm going to set these along her lash line

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.610
and then I'm going to use the point of my
tweezers to just push them down and hold them

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:08.430
down into her lashes so that that glue can
adhere. You want to make sure they're as close

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.440
to her natural lashes as you can get them.
And this is hard the first couple times you

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.080
do it, but you may want to practice on yourself
so that you don't get glue in your models

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:28.229
eyes but once you get the hang of it, it's
not difficult. Again, I'm going to just set

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.810
this down and use my tweezers to get in there
close and just push it down into her natural

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:52.810
eyelashes. Then I kind of just use my thumb
to push on the ends of it so that it tightens

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.720
in as it's drying and then we'll let her sit
for about twenty seconds before opening her

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.350
eyes so that that glue has time to dry while
she's not moving.
