[Music]

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:13.660
DONNA KARAN: This space is my heart, my soul,
my spirit.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.500
About 15 years ago, I had a vision.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:31.500
I had done Donna Karan, I had done DKNY, and
I felt what was the next thing.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.120
And I saw this company called Urban Zen where
you walked in and it was cotton, cashmere,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.220
candles, CDs, cafe, community, yogaâ€”just
everything for the mind, body, and spirit

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.320
in a gallery and in this gallery was exhibitions
and conferences that would bring people together

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.500
or connect the dots as my husband would say
to make a difference in this world.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.600
Stephan was my husband and he was an artist,
a sculptor, my partner in business, father

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.750
of my children, drove me crazy.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.750
[Laughs]

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.250
I met him when I was 18 years old and he was
far above my head.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:30.009
Y'know, he would talk about these scientific
things of connecting the dots and string theory.

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.799
I had no idea what he was talking about.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.560
I think until now.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.700
Now it has all come together.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.049
It all makes sense to me.

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.670
Unfortunately, Stephan's not here to share
in that.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:50.289
He passed away 11 years ago and it probably
took me 11 years to be able to be able to

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.750
reflect back and move forward.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.710
Stephan used to sit every single minute of
his life putting dots on a piece of paper

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:08.039
and connecting them and out of that, came
a horse, an apple, a film, a nothing, an object,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.039
a desire.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.319
It was sort of y'know, quantum theory.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.660
Y'know, that we're all connected.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.880
Y'know, whether it's mother, father, child.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.460
You're connected as family, your own fashion,
pants, sweaters, it's connecting a wardrobe.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.570
Y'know, you think about it really who we are.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.530
Are we just a dot on a piece of paper?

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:38.660
And Stephan's philosophy was the connection
of those dots.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.850
Stephan's first art was he worked in the broadway
theater.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.670
He worked on the sets and he had a studio
out in Long Island City where he started doing

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.570
his artwork and then he took this place.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.520
He did it all by himself.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.430
And then we'd hang out here and the grandkids
would hang out here and the bikes would be

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.350
here and his friends would be here.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.230
He would work 24/7.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.880
He loved his art and as you look around the
room, there's pieces that are not finished

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.900
yet.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.780
Stephan worked until the very end.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.180
Stephan is in every place that I'm in.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.760
Stephan's in the center and I think you feel
the energy here.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.970
Stephan met the Dalai Lama right before he
passed away and he wanted a prayer.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.070
Really the birth of Urban Zen happened when
His Holiness the Dalai Lama came here.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.160
At that point, I realized that this center
belonged to a dream that I had of connecting

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.660
the dots.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.140
Of putting people together that wanted to
create change in the world through spirituality,

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:52.150
through healthcare, through education, through
culture and it continues.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.430
Hi, I'm Donna Karan.
