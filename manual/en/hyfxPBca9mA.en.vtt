00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.540
When we went to our high school in 1939

00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:26.530
and when we returned there in the autumn after the summer holiday,

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:31.225
the door was closed and written on it was:

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:32.790
– Jews out, Czechs out! –

00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:36.566
They did not let us enter the school

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:39.542
and nobody came to explain

00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:41.985
why they wouldn’t let us in.

00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:44.916
So it was a terrible shock.

00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:52.128
And it was really from that time that I felt very excluded,

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.700
that I did not feel much like a Slovak,

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:56.813
because they had kicked me out.

00:01:00.214 --> 00:01:02.621
So I knew that I did not actually belong there,

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.672
but I did not know where I belonged.

00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:07.584
I was twelve years old then.

00:01:20.144 --> 00:01:23.228
In Slovakia before the Munich Agreement,

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:25.254
and before the Vienna Arbitration,

00:01:25.455 --> 00:01:27.206
which was a sort of “Slovak Munich”,

00:01:27.407 --> 00:01:29.088
there were over 130,000 Jews.

00:01:29.544 --> 00:01:35.681
To consider some kind of mass exodus after Munich was not that simple.

00:01:36.082 --> 00:01:36.914
Individual countries

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:41.322
that would be able or willing to take in Jews

00:01:41.623 --> 00:01:43.369
would not accept them

00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:47.496
unless they brought some capital with them.

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:56.270
This state self-interest... still exists today.

00:02:14.127 --> 00:02:16.546
We considered leaving,

00:02:17.147 --> 00:02:20.083
but my father just could not believe

00:02:20.284 --> 00:02:22.797
that something so horrible would take place there.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.741
And I think that my parents were afraid of leaving.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.234
I think that in Slovakia,[br]when compared, for example, with Bohemia,

00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:37.776
Jews were poorer, simpler and more religious.

00:02:37.977 --> 00:02:40.760
So they tended to rely more on the idea that,

00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:44.398
as they were not affluent, God would protect them

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.099
and that their relationship with the Gentiles was not too bad.

00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:50.009
Why didn't they leave?

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.087
International Jewish organisations at that time

00:02:53.488 --> 00:02:57.216
were already supporting many Jewish citizens in countries,

00:02:57.417 --> 00:02:58.940
where it was much worse

00:02:59.216 --> 00:03:01.332
for the Jews in 1938 and 1939.

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:04.978
After Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass, in Germany and Austria.

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:09.340
In Poland, where anti-Jewish sentiment was much stronger,

00:03:09.541 --> 00:03:11.876
even before the Nazi occupation of Poland.

00:03:13.072 --> 00:03:15.892
And Czechoslovakia – or Slovakia –

00:03:16.093 --> 00:03:17.578
was not one of the countries, even in 1939,

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:25.402
where the danger for the Jewish population was greatest.

00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:31.172
And above all my parents could not imagine, particularly my father,

00:03:31.373 --> 00:03:34.999
that events in Slovakia would go as far as

00:03:35.512 --> 00:03:38.386
their being considered outcasts.

00:03:39.807 --> 00:03:43.386
Why, the family had lived there, I think, for two hundred years –

00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:45.538
I don't know exactly, but for a very long time,

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:47.999
so they felt very...

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.910
Slovak.

00:04:25.753 --> 00:04:34.387
And then they did not want to leave the country in which their forebears were laid to rest,

00:04:34.688 --> 00:04:38.661
where they cared for their cemeteries, for their memorials.

00:04:39.162 --> 00:04:43.590
They were afraid of the unknown outside world, which is understandable.

00:04:44.091 --> 00:04:49.047
Because even if we talk, however critically, about those times,

00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:51.982
all that had happened in the twentieth century,

00:04:52.183 --> 00:04:54.842
not only to Jews, but to other nations as well,

00:04:55.043 --> 00:05:00.615
whether here, or say in Africa, or in the nearby former Yugoslavia,

00:05:00.816 --> 00:05:03.568
it was, until then, something unimaginable,

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:07.974
that people would be murdered simply for their “bad” origins.

00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:47.421
It is true, they really could not imagine at all

00:05:47.622 --> 00:05:49.546
that they would be expelled from Slovakia,

00:05:49.747 --> 00:05:52.585
they had thought it would only last for a short time,

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:55.271
and then it would go away.

00:05:56.076 --> 00:05:58.047
Also, they had nowhere to go,

00:05:58.248 --> 00:06:03.954
because you could not go to England or to America just like that,

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.256
unless you already had somebody there.

00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:14.585
And... apart from that... nobody at all actually wanted those Jews.
