00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.080
It’s much appreciated, and it motivates
me to make more great content for you to enjoy.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.830
Subscribe and hit me up with a “like”
if you want me to keep on with these videos,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.529
and stay tuned for some interesting findings
on the Traveler, coming soon.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:21.529
Alright everyone.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.570
I’m leaving wolf symbology one in your hands
for a while.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.980
But Let’s keep this discussion going.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.520
Let’s make sure we keep the intrigue of
Destiny alive.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.800
Who care’s if your theory sounds ridiculous.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.800
Tell someone.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.400
Post it here, facebook, twitter, Bungie.net.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.400
anywhere.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.359
This is why the Bungie community is so awesome,
because we care about this stuff.

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.440
Before I let it go though, I wanted to point
out a last little bit that I found, that’s

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.390
plausible, but not obvious and it has to do
with the fallen.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.390
Here are a few interesting Explanations of
the Fallen that could easily sound like quotes

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.390
about wolves:

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.140
“They travel light, hit hard, and are gone
before you know it.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.469
Fallen may look like mere scavengers, but
on closer inspection you will see hints of

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.910
a splendid, sophisticated past”
and

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.460
“If you see one in the wild, know there
are many more nearby,”

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.040
Notice anything about this fallen captain?

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.570
I’m going to point out three aspects of
wolf imagery on the captain in this photo

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.640
that, once I noticed them, I couldn’t unsee
them.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.640
Ok.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.640
First.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.970
Do you see anything that resembles the tricorn?

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.970
Here it is.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.250
Another triangular design.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.250
Significant?

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.250
Maybe.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.250
Maybe not.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.350
Maybe artists just put triangles everywhere
without knowing it.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.740
Second, and maybe less likely, Giant wolf
ears anyone?

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.090
And the last and most plausible connection:
Fallen captains wear pelts!

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.740
And check out this Arcon.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.369
He’s wearing one as well.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.369
Real subtle.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.980
There seems to be a heavy correlation between
wolves and the fallen.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.350
I’m starting to think that Destiny’s references
to the law of the jungle aren’t about factions.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.950
They could be about the different races found
within the world of destiny.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.020
Bytheway, shoutout to CynicalCyanide for finding
these on destinydb.com.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.549
Sorry for sending you on this wild goose chase
so late at night.

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.070
I hop you didn’t lose too much sleep.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.270
I’ll wrap up with a big thank you to everyone
getting on the hype train about Destiny lore.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.789
It’s been a treat looking through your findings,
which is why i’m so happy to let the community

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.469
run with as many of their own theories as
they can find.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.930
