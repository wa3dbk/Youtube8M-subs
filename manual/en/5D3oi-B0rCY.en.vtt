00:00:07.422 --> 00:00:10.323
Why does my computer freeze randomly?

00:00:10.323 --> 00:00:12.813
It has decided to give you the cold shoulder.

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:14.673
No, seriously.

00:00:14.673 --> 00:00:17.923
Why is it freezing and locking up?

00:00:17.923 --> 00:00:23.463
If you are running a lot of memory intensive
applications, it might freeze up while trying

00:00:23.463 --> 00:00:28.073
to figure out what to do or finish what it
is doing before you can do something else.

00:00:28.073 --> 00:00:31.053
Why else might it be freezing up?

00:00:31.053 --> 00:00:35.953
It might be a virus, taking up all the computer’s
resources while it is sending out tons of

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:39.183
junk emails or storing someone else’s child
porn.

00:00:39.183 --> 00:00:41.412
You’re giving me nightmares.

00:00:41.412 --> 00:00:43.933
I wish it was just possessed.

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:47.023
It might be a zombie computer in someone’s
bot net.

00:00:47.023 --> 00:00:52.043
Or it might have one of those viruses waiting
for you enter your personal information before

00:00:52.043 --> 00:00:53.313
stealing it.

00:00:53.313 --> 00:00:57.123
Maybe it is one of those cool ransom-ware
viruses.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:01:01.273
If you had ransom-ware, it would actually
let you know by freezing the computer while

00:01:01.273 --> 00:01:04.093
putting up a notice and demanding money.

00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:06.793
Why else could a computer freeze?

00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:11.083
If you have Connected Backup or another backup
software taking up all the resources while

00:01:11.083 --> 00:01:14.673
you are trying to work, that might explain
it.

00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:16.732
So might NSA hacking.

00:01:16.732 --> 00:01:20.423
I really doubt you have anything on your PC
they want.

00:01:20.423 --> 00:01:25.062
And if they want your emails, they’ll get
it from Microsoft or Google, not hack the

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:26.062
machine.

00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:29.662
What’s a more mundane reason it could be
freezing up?

00:01:29.662 --> 00:01:34.972
You might have too many background processes
running, from three different anti-virus applications

00:01:34.972 --> 00:01:37.982
to too many browser windows open.

00:01:37.982 --> 00:01:41.222
Or the Java plug-ins on the computer are crashing.

00:01:41.222 --> 00:01:44.882
I have the Java plug-ins turned off so for
security reasons.

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:49.853
Then it is the browser, if not a plug-in or
browser extension.

00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:52.192
I use Internet Explorer a lot.

00:01:52.192 --> 00:01:55.152
Then you can blame it on Microsoft.

00:01:55.152 --> 00:01:57.412
Everything can be blamed on Microsoft.
