00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.440
(Music)

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.500
Anacapa Island,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.800
one of the Channel Islands just eleven miles off the coast of Southern California.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.355
Comprised of three islets, Anacapa's steep cliffs,

00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:20.900
vegetated terrain, and protected beaches

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.360
provide safe haven for a variety of marine mammals and seabirds.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.880
But during the 80's and 90's resource managers noticed a steady decline

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.560
in the population of some species of seabirds on Anacapa.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:45.180
One of the primary reasons: predation by the non-native black rat.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.260
The rats affected everything here. They affected the gulls, they affected the murrelets,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.580
they affected the mice, they affected the lizards, they affected the vegetation.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:02.120
In this infrared footage, a rat is seen attacking decoy eggs placed in a nesting site on Anacapa.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.950
The rats prey heavily on a rare, nocturnal seabird named the Scripps's Murrelet.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.290
There are four primary breeding islands in the world for these seabirds,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.800
and Anacapa is one of them.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.440
It was really important that we brought back this potential habitat here on Anacapa Island

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.640
and we provided that and allowed once again for murrelets to be able to nest here.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.400
Given the chronic threat to the seabird populations,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.400
a group of government, university, and non-profit organizations

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.700
partnered together in the late 90's to rid the island of the black rat

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.170
and document the subsequent restoration.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.800
So we spent four years designing a program that would have

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.650
the maximum likelihood of eliminating every last rat

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.470
while still conserving the other native species that are unique to  Anacapa Island.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.859
The team developed a strategy using helicopters to distribute a specially formulated rodenticide.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.960
After years of preparation, on a cool, clear december day in 2001

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.740
the bait was loaded onto the island and the application began.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.150
This was the first time an application procedure like this would take place in North America.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.980
Ten years after the initial eradication,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.910
the benefit of removing rats from the island becomes increasingly evident.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.500
It's only been ten years since we implemented Anacapa.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.130
In ecological time it's just a drop in the bucket.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.720
But the changes that have been documented on the island are incredible.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.340
The seabirds are recovering. They are expanding outside of seacaves,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.310
we're seeing them recolonize in areas that they were never thought to be nesting when the rats were present

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.900
and we're seeing new species come to the island

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.390
we're discovering ashy storm-petrel nests on the island and Cassin's Auklets on the island.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.850
As for the Scripps's Murrelets, researchers are now finding more productive nesting sites

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.140
with the eggs intact in areas that had a history of predation.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.220
When you look at areas like this in landing cove and other areas on the island that are not in the seacaves

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.930
the growth rates are upwards of 25% per anum. For seabirds, that's unheard of.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.412
I was recently on Anacapa and it's like, wow,

00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:40.280
we had a positive impact on this ecosystem here in Southern California

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.810
and it's paying dividends. The island is paying dividends,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.740
and it's going to continue paying dividends for future generations.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:55.240
