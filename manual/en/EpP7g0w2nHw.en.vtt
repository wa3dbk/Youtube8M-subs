Hey, guys,
and welcome back to the kitchen.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.360
So today we are cooking quesadillas,
delicious, tasty Mexican street food,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.760
one of your favourites, I believe,
because they are cheesy.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.280
And we're also doing
a hot tomato salsa.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.840
So thank you so much
to Samara Nunez,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.520
and Abby Jones, who have
all requested Mexican food.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.320
If you have any requests
for us to cook recipes,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.960
let us know in the
comments section below.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.680
I'm gonna pop in a little
bit of oil into the pan,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.920
let that heat up and
then we're taking some frozen,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.160
pre-chopped onions.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.400
Tree chopped?

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.880
Pre, pre-chopped.
Fry them up for a bit.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.360
So a good 50 grams, isn't it?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.520
Yeah. I reckon.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.600
Then we're gonna put
in frozen garlic,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.760
which again is pre-chopped.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.640
That is seriously useful.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.600
So these onions
are frying up nicely.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.160
Do the tomatoes go in now?

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.200
In you pop.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.960
So now while it's simmering way,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.920
we're going to add half a teaspoon
of sugar in there as well,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.600
to sweeten it up a little bit.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.520
In it goes, stir that up, you know.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.440
So have you ever been
to Mexico before?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.280
I have. I've been to Tijuana.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.400
Tijuana, eh?

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.120
That's the nicest place
in Mexico ever.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.240
Yes, see, I've only been to Cancun,
which is kind of like mini-America.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.280
Yes.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.920
That is not proper Mexico.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.640
It's got to be real Mexico
'cause they had quesadillas,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.760
they had fajitas and they had
margaritas and they had tequilas.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.360
So in that way,
it's real Mexico. Right.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.320
I think I'm ready to add
some parsley as well.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.880
Parsley?

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.520
Don't hold back.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.680
I'm gonna pop my onions
into this bowl.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.160
100 grams of cheddar.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.600
I'm also going to grate a courgette
into there as well.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.920
Ever since we did
the courgetti recipe,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.680
I have been slightly obsessed
with courgette in salads,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.600
loving the fact that it is in here.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.200
You know, courgette's
actually really easy to grate

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.680
and I'm also gonna grate a carrot.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.920
I might actually get you to do this,
'cause my arm kind of hurts.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.200
You were thinking this was
just gonna be cheese, weren't you?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.160
But I quite like
the cheesy quesadillas.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.360
Actually a lot of veggies in here.
We're gonna put all of the beans in.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.920
We've already drained
and rinsed them.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.280
And then we're also gonna chop up
a little chilli for some heat.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.440
Do you want to heat that pan up?

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.640
- It's done.
- A little bit of oil.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.520
Tiny bit of oil. How
much though? Just a tiny bit?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.680
Tiny bit and brush it around.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.760
I'm gonna mix all of
my ingredients together,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.920
cheese fully dispersed, kind of
sticks together as well there.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.840
So next we're gonna take a tortilla,
just a one to start with.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.680
Pop it in the pan.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.960
We put this in the middle.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.480
Yeah.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.520
Spread it around a bit.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.200
So we're gonna pop our second wrap.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.240
Putting a lid.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.400
On top and push it down,
so you squidge it all together

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.480
and then we're gonna flip it upside
down on a plate and turn it over.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.400
We think we've seen a face
through the camera.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.440
It's not like the
Jesus in the toast.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.280
No, but we think maybe
even Michael Jackson.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.600
It's Michael Jackson. He's
come back via a quesadillas.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.080
He's quesadillaing his way in.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.480
And I'm taking a picture of it.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.960
Here we go, Mike.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.160
That's actually pretty good.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.120
Cheesy goodness.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.480
Try a little bit of this salsa.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.960
Everybody loves a quesadilla.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.640
That's actually a good combo.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.000
My piece of salad.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.000
One a piece of salad.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.440
