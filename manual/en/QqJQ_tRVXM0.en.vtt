00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.489
Hi thanks for joining me at Quilt with Marci
Baker.

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:06.899
Today I'm going to share with you chameleon
our latest pattern.

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.381
And it is this design here behind me which
is one square and its mirror image; this square

00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:17.140
here and its mirror image and we are going
to make that throughout the whole quilt.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.480
And you can get lots of neat designs.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.939
Here I have a lantern shape.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.439
You can do a pentagon.

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.369
We can do a fish shape.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.630
If you want to emphasize that.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.820
We can do a heart shape.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.820
And over here you probably can see the bow
ties which we emphasize strongly with the

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.570
white and black contrast and the hourglass
shape.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.940
That's all done with the chameleon pattern
and we are going to be using our 10" clear

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.300
view triangle ruler and we are also going
to introduce our new Qtools, On The Dot.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.810
So here's the pattern.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.260
I want to give you a little bit of information.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.430
These two quilts you saw behind me are the
makers first quilts.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.290
That's how easy the project is.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.360
We give a design page, step by step instructions,
some tips on pressing, and even some quilting

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.360
design options.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.830
So those are the instructions.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.800
And we are going to start with two squares
that are one is wrong side up one is right

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.860
side up, that's going to give us our mirror
image.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.140
And we are going to cut using our 60 degree
ruler.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.880
We've lined this up so we are going to be
cutting this on the diagonal then we will

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.610
rotate it, and that's why I like working with
the Brooklyn Revolver, and we are going to

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.020
cut on that diagonal.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.120
That gives us four pieces that are all the
same shape and the will be able to be laid

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.530
out into blocks.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.630
Pulling the combinations that you want and
being able to make the block that you want.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.490
You will sew those together in pairs, sew
the pairs together and that gives us a block

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.830
that looks like this.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.860
This piece we now need to square up and we
are going to use our On The Dot to mark our

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.420
ruler, notice the three different colors.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.500
We are going to mark our ruler and I have
the center marked here and I have the four

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.270
points that need to line up with the seems
marked.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.640
These are re-position-able, you just put them
on the ruler, peal them off, replace them,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.060
use them over and over.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.260
And we are going to line this up, line up
those corners and we are going to be able

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.760
to trim that up and then rotate this and be
able to trim that other corner.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.670
And these just make it so it's faster and
easier to get my ruler lined up.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.790
That's On The Dot.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.069
So that's how easy the chameleon pattern is.

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.029
Thanks for joining me at Quilt with Marci
Baker.
