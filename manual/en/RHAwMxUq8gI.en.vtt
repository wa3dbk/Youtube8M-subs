00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.880
The whale shark passes right in front of me.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.250
The water is not very clear, and this is where
I get my first clue what is going on here.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.090
The sharks have come to this section of the
ocean because it is filled with plankton!

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.630
Whale sharks might be the biggest fish in
the sea, but they eat only plankton and small

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.430
fish.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.500
The word plankton comes from a Greek word
meaning drifter, so plankton are drifting

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.520
organisms like these tiny copepods.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.140
The water is filled with copepods, jellyfish,
and other drifting animals.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.550
They might be small, but these planktonic
animals are all food for the mighty whale

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.520
shark.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.661
Early in the morning, when the water is calm,
the plankton forms a thick layer near the

00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:01.600
surface.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.820
He's just surface feeding.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.759
What the whale sharks do here is they swim
across the surface of the water with their

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.829
mouths open wide and all that plankton that's
sitting right there at the surface gets funneled

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:23.299
right into their mouths.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.020
The enormous mouth swallows up huge quantities
of water.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.999
The water comes back out through the shark's
gills, but comb-like structures in the gills

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:39.679
capture the plankton like an enormous spaghetti
strainer.

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.409
So the whale shark swimming through the water
is like a big pool skimmer, filtering the

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.479
plankton for breakfast.

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.729
Each shark eats hundreds of pounds of food
every hour!

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:01.249
It turns out that eating plankton is very
efficient for a large animal.
