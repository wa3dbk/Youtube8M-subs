00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.140
Rob: Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Rob...

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.240
Neil: ... and I'm Neil. Hello.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.500
Rob: Hi there, Neil! Now, Neil... what's that on your face?

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.900
Neil: What... this? It's a beard, Rob.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.260
Have you never seen one before?

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.769
Rob: I have. But I've never seen one on you before...

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.400
and I'm surprised to say, it looks good on you!

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.980
Neil: Well, thank you!

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.300
I thought I'd get on the beard bandwagon, you know.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.560
Beards are all the rage at the moment

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.340
that means 'very fashionable'.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.660
Rob: And to get on a bandwagon

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.700
is when you join other people in doing something

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.140
that has become popular ─ perhaps because you hope to become popular yourself!

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.500
Neil: Well, that doesn't apply to me, Rob,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.760
because, as you know, I'm very popular already.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.780
Rob: Yes. Yes, I know that, of course... Anyway,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.040
beards are such a talking point

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.880
a subject that a lot of people are discussing

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.660
that we decided to talk about them on today's programme!

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.700
So are you ready for today's question, Neil?

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.060
What's the name for someone who loves beards? Is it...

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.860
a) barbophile?

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.180
b) pogonophile?

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.500
or c) pelophile?

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.240
Neil: Hmm. All the answers sound tempting.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.800
But I'm going to go for a) barbophile.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.340
Rob: Right. OK, well we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.780
But this is interesting

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.260
a new scientific study suggests that the more beards there are in a population,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.480
the less attractive they become

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.479
and this currently gives clean-shaven men a competitive advantage.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.339
Neil: Oh, no! That's bad news for me, then!

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.920
Competitive advantage means when a condition or circumstance puts you in a favourable position

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.740
in this case, being clean-shaven or having no facial hair.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.720
Rob: That's right. We've reached 'peak beard' apparently.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.840
Beard popularity has peaked

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.700
or reached its highest point

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.440
and will decline in popularity from this point.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.740
Neil: OK. Let's listen to writer, Lucinda Hawksley,

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:03.469
talking about beards through history.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.119
And listen out for a word that means women's struggle

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.339
to achieve the same rights and opportunities as men.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.880
Lucinda Hawksley: It's interesting,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.080
while I was writing the book

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.780
I came to realize that the most heavily bearded times in Britain are either when women are in power,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.880
such as Elizabeth I or Queen Victoria, or when there's a big discussion of feminism

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.060
and it is really interesting that in the last few years there's been so much more discussion of feminism.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.980
You get a woman on the throne and men

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.560
go, 'Oh, got to have a beard.'

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.500
It's really strange.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.680
Or in the 60s or 70s with all the kind of, you know, big thing about women's lib,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.700
suddenly the beard becomes huge here.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.940
Rob: Well, needless to say Lucinda doesn't have a beard,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.940
but she certainly knows a lot about them.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.500
She's the great great granddaughter of famous writer Charles Dickens,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.460
who sported ─  or wore ─  a very flamboyant beard.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.980
Flamboyant means eye-catching and different.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.940
Neil: Now, did you spot the word for women's struggle to achieve the same rights as men?

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.040
Rob: Yes. It's feminism.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.620
She also talks about women's lib, which is short for women's liberation.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.700
And this has a similar meaning to feminism.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.980
So, what do you think, Neil?

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.820
Are beards a show of testosterone in reaction to powerful women?

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.880
Is that why you've grown your beard?

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.760
Neil: I don't think it's testosterone

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.000
that's the main male hormone.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.720
For me, it's laziness.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.020
I'm flying the flag for men's liberation from the razor.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.240
Rob: Right. Well, I'm not sure whether that's a worthy cause or not, Neil.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.400
Let's hear from Brock Elbank, the photographer behind the exhibition 'Beard'.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.540
He's talking about one of the people he photographed.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.000
Brock Elbank: I found Jimmy on a friend's Facebook page whilst I was in Sydney.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.840
Invited him to come to my home studio for a portrait and I posted it

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.300
and it got reblogged over half a million times in four hours.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.200
I mean I think when Jimmy and I...

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.340
when I met Jimmy he told me about his 'beard season' melanoma charity

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.840
and I was kind of on board from the get go.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.000
Neil: So Jimmy must have a pretty awesome beard!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.820
Rob: Indeed. We should check out the Beard exhibition and find out.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.840
But Jimmy has a beard for a special reason, right Neil?

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.440
Neil: That's right.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.380
Yes. Brock mentions Jimmy's melanoma charity.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.620
Melanoma is a serious type of skin cancer

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.100
and Jimmy is raising money and awareness to help people who suffer from it.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.620
Rob: And Brock says he was on board from the get go

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.520
meaning he wanted to be involved with the charity right from the start.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.300
Neil: We should also mention 'Movember' and 'Decembeard'

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.660
both campaigns invite men to get hairy
for good causes.

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:45.989
Rob: That's right, good causes

00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:49.609
moustaches in November and beards in December.

00:04:49.609 --> 00:04:52.109
Now, let's have the answer to the quiz question.

00:04:52.109 --> 00:04:55.369
I asked: what's the name for someone who loves beards.

00:04:55.369 --> 00:05:00.920
Was it: a) barbophile b) pogonopile or c) pelophile?

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.680
Neil: And I said a) barbophile.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.460
Rob: Wrong, I'm afraid.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.160
The answer is actually b) pogonophile.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.540
Neil: Oh, well, you can't win them all.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.300
Now then, Rob, can we hear today's words again?

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.060
Rob: Sure. We heard:

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.280
all the rage

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.900
get on a bandwagon

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.060
talking point

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.200
competitive advantage

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.100
clean shaven

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.780
peaked

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.520
sport

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.460
flamboyant

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.520
feminism

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.540
women's lib

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.580
testosterone

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.940
melanoma

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.940
on board from the get go

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.120
Neil: Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.980
We hope it wasn't too hair-raising for you.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.540
Please join us again soon.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.600
Both: Bye.
