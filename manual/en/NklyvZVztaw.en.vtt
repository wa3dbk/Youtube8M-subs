00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:10.104
How does a mobile phone call?

00:00:10.447 --> 00:00:13.250
Nina calls Maxime on his mobile phone.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.961
What happens when Maxime answers
and says “hello”?

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.563
How is this sound transported
to Nina’s phone?

00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:26.533
Well, Maxime’s phone first transforms
his voice into a digital signal,

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.120
that is to say
a succession of 0 and 1.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.049
Then this signal is sent
by airwaves to a cell phone tower.

00:00:33.356 --> 00:00:38.964
This tower transmits the signal to a fixed
telephony network to which it is directly related.

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.388
This network carries the signal to
the nearest cell phone tower from Nina

00:00:44.388 --> 00:00:47.833
which is sending a signal to Nina’s phone.

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:52.386
Finally, it transforms
the digital signal into a signal

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:56.769
able to excite the loudspeaker of
the phone which will change it into sounds

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.896
that are similar to
those emitted by Maxime.

00:00:59.896 --> 00:01:02.237
The communication between the phone

00:01:02.237 --> 00:01:06.782
and the tower is made by airwaves,
as for radio or television.

00:01:07.474 --> 00:01:12.029
FM radio uses 90-100 MHz frequencies;

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:15.439
television uses 400-800 MHz frequencies.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:22.098
Mobile telephony uses two bands,
a 900 MHz band and another 1 800 MHz band.

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:25.525
In the same way that
every radio station on the FM band

00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:28.477
is assigned a particular frequency,

00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:32.772
every communication
also use a specific frequency.

00:01:32.772 --> 00:01:37.753
Or rather two: one for traffic
from the telephone to the tower,

00:01:38.106 --> 00:01:41.594
and a second one for traffic
in the other way.

00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:46.015
The number of frequencies available
on a cell phone tower is limited,

00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:50.501
so that only sixty simultaneous 
communications are possible.

00:01:51.747 --> 00:01:55.996
For the phone to send a signal
to a relay cell phone tower,

00:01:55.996 --> 00:02:00.585
first of all it has to be
within range of a tower.

00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:04.637
As a cell phone tower
has a maximal range of thirty kilometres,

00:02:04.637 --> 00:02:09.974
a mobile telephony operator must
first install a large number of towers

00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:13.479
to cover all the territory
it wants to serve.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.110
To cover all the surface
of metropolitan France,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.577
less than 200 antennas with a 30 km range
would be sufficient while in reality,

00:02:22.577 --> 00:02:26.639
more than 50 000 antennas are installed
in France at the beginning of 2012.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.457
Even if we divide by the number
of operators, it’s still much!

00:02:32.457 --> 00:02:38.142
Why? Well, the real range of a tower
is decreased by many factors,

00:02:38.142 --> 00:02:42.403
as the geography, the vegetation or
the presence of buildings.

00:02:42.572 --> 00:02:46.619
But that’s not all:
we saw that a tower can only manage

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:52.656
a few numbers of simultaneous phone calls,
typically about sixty.

00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:58.332
So in areas of high population density,
we have to put the towers close to each other.

00:02:58.886 --> 00:03:04.814
If we put a single cell phone tower over Paris,
it will cover more than ten million inhabitants,

00:03:04.814 --> 00:03:07.970
but only 60 could call at the same time.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.928
The operators divide
the territory in cells of variable area,

00:03:13.512 --> 00:03:16.840
according to the
geography and the population.

00:03:17.086 --> 00:03:21.994
To facilitate the representation of the coverage,
we use hexagonal cells,

00:03:21.994 --> 00:03:27.526
but of course, the real form of the area served by
an antenna may be really different,

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:31.489
and the signals transmitted by
an tower don’t stop at the edge of the cell,

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.850
but goes well beyond.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.180
At the centre of the cell,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.838
the tower sends permanently
an identification signal in every direction

00:03:40.838 --> 00:03:44.562
with the name of the operator
and the number of the cell.

00:03:45.254 --> 00:03:49.925
When we turn the phone on,
it is searching identification signals.

00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:53.088
If it doesn’t find any signal,
it means it’s not a covered area,

00:03:53.088 --> 00:03:55.638
and no call is possible.

00:03:55.638 --> 00:03:59.330
If there are several signals,
it measures the received signal strength

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.517
and chooses the tower
with the best signal.

00:04:02.978 --> 00:04:07.758
So, it sends an identification signal
to the corresponding tower.

00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:10.656
The antenna transmits this information

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:14.880
to the switching centre
which manages the mobile operator network.

00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:18.007
Thus,
if someone wants to call it,

00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:22.092
the switching centre knows toward
what cell the call has to be pointed at.

00:04:22.092 --> 00:04:24.696
The mobile phone measures permanently

00:04:24.696 --> 00:04:28.151
the quality of the signal
sent by the cell phone tower.

00:04:28.582 --> 00:04:30.312
If it decreases too much,

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:34.882
the phone tests again all
the identification signals of the towers it may find.

00:04:34.882 --> 00:04:36.782
If it finds a better signal,

00:04:36.782 --> 00:04:40.925
it informs the cell phone
tower which is informing the switching centre.

00:04:40.925 --> 00:04:45.220
The switching is very fast
and is not perceptible but the user,

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.954
even during the communication.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:54.034
We know that a telephone conversation consists in
a transmission of digital signals.

00:04:54.434 --> 00:04:59.320
So nothing prevents from transmitting
digital data from other sources,

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.424
as photos or web pages.

00:05:02.424 --> 00:05:06.166
Except that the amount of
information is much bigger

00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:09.541
and requires higher transmission rates.

00:05:11.048 --> 00:05:16.476
This is the reason why the 3G network
complements the 2G network we just describe.

00:05:16.845 --> 00:05:19.644
It required,
as the 2G network,

00:05:19.644 --> 00:05:24.874
the setting-up of about
50 000 additional towers and an entire infrastructure

00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:28.174
but the operating principles
remain the same.
