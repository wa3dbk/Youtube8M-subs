Hi this is Rich Buccola here in NYC and on
behalf of Expert Village today we're going

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.990
to show you some great comfort food and making
meatloaf. Okay chopping your onion I forgot

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.409
to do that in the last clip while we got our
ingredients right there so just let me reiterate

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:19.730
and saying that we're going to chop up our
onion. One small onion let me just go over

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.970
the ingredients cause I just like to eyeball
stuff and I don't want you to get confused.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.590
Two pounds of chop meat you should use 2 cups
of breadcrumbs one cup of Parmesan, I know

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.289
I eyeball it because I know for making it
as you make this your going to see your going

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:38.780
to be able to do the same. But for beginners
that are just learning 2 cups of breadcrumbs

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.829
one cup of Parmesan cheese, so now we're going
to cut our onion. One small onion I had a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.600
big onion so I used it for something else
earlier in the week it's still fresh it's

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.809
still good, don't let it go to waste. Remember
our trick that I always teach you want to

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.489
at the knuckle here you want to bend your
finger tips so that when your chopping as

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.649
you see, you won't cut your fingers. You see
the lines on the onion already there are lines

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.870
here just hold your fingers so that you don't
cut just go straight down. And you don't have

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.480
to be like these fancy chefs that cut like
you know those Japanese guys that can cut

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.460
like they got to, just put your knife down
and come straight through or your lines. Take

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.910
it this way and turn it and hold it tight
holding your fingers bring your fingers in

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.060
and just chop straight down. Now if the pieces
are to big don't' sweat it it's not a big

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.070
deal what I like to do then just put everything
like this and grab your point and start chopping

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.660
down getting everything to small. You want
to get everything smaller so just sit here

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.180
and chop some people will cry so you cry a
little bit. Everybody says whats the big deal

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.660
about crying with an onion you tell everybody
you heard a sad story I don't know if your

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.530
in the kitchen. Someone will come in and say
oh, I lost my friend I don't know doesn't

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.750
matter, that was pretty sad to say you lost
a friend, but all kidding aside chop up your

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.560
onion by putting the point like this and get
your pieces very small push all your onion

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.409
in the center. I'm cooking and cutting in
a very small board and you'll see.
