00:00:02.916 --> 00:00:05.156
Here's what we've experienced
our first year at York.

00:00:08.246 --> 00:00:11.366
My first term at
York was crucial.

00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:13.476
Horrible. It was really hard.

00:00:13.476 --> 00:00:16.006
It was really, really
different from high school.

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:17.576
Whereas in high school
you didn't have

00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:18.636
to put in as much effort.

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:21.816
And I came out with a 93
average and then I come to York

00:00:21.816 --> 00:00:25.276
and my average is
like just a 70.

00:00:25.276 --> 00:00:27.076
And that is like me
working my butt off.

00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:30.316
It is just a lot more
work and the volume

00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:31.706
of work is a lot, a lot more.

00:00:31.926 --> 00:00:37.466
I was accustomed to
doing things last minute

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.736
and getting good grades.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:44.636
To my disappointment it didn't
work out that way in university.

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:48.216
I learned the really hard
way when I got my grades back

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:49.216
from the first semester.

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:53.776
I had a really good experience
in my first year at York.

00:00:53.776 --> 00:00:58.206
I was encouraged to get involved
in extracurricular activities.

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:00.686
I developed leadership skills

00:01:01.096 --> 00:01:03.806
and built networks
with other students.

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:07.846
In my first year I was a
Volunteer Student Ambassador

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:09.976
and a speaker at
York International.

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:15.506
I would be lying if I didn't
say it was the hardest year

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.016
of my academic career.

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:19.096
There is a huge change
from high school

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:21.286
because more independence
is required from you.

00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:25.726
You have to basically
learn to manage your time

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:28.046
and not fool around
and partying.

00:01:28.136 --> 00:01:30.546
I felt that during my
first year, because I was

00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:32.956
in residence I had to
work especially hard not

00:01:32.956 --> 00:01:33.956
to get side-tracked.

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:37.316
I believe that it is incredibly
important to be responsible

00:01:37.316 --> 00:01:39.446
for your own learning
in university.

00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:41.586
No teacher or parent
is getting at you

00:01:41.586 --> 00:01:43.676
to finish your assignments
or study

00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:46.546
or even attend class anymore,
but if you don't you will pay

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:49.126
for it -- both literally
and figuratively.

00:01:49.486 --> 00:01:52.996
It is really important to
have a sense of self control.

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:57.016
It is a key for success.

00:01:57.596 --> 00:01:59.506
Here are some of the
resources we've used...

00:02:00.096 --> 00:02:03.086
The role of academic
advising is very important.

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:05.726
These people help and guide
you to choose subjects

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:06.986
that are best suited for you.

00:02:06.986 --> 00:02:09.646
It is very important to ask
questions during your meeting

00:02:09.646 --> 00:02:11.686
because you want to be well
informed for the courses

00:02:11.686 --> 00:02:12.686
that you will be taking.

00:02:12.826 --> 00:02:16.216
It can be relieving and calming
to get your questions answered.

00:02:16.576 --> 00:02:18.346
Your TA's are your best friends.

00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:20.116
By always interacting
with your TA's,

00:02:20.116 --> 00:02:23.676
they will understand your
weaknesses and strengths

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:25.426
and they will better tutor you.

00:02:25.676 --> 00:02:29.306
Also, if you always show them
a draft, or present an overview

00:02:29.306 --> 00:02:32.386
of your paper, or even hand them
your thesis statement you have a

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:35.216
better chance of
receiving a good mark.

00:02:35.296 --> 00:02:39.726
For international students like
me, we need academic support

00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:42.266
to help us adjust
to a new environment

00:02:42.636 --> 00:02:44.656
and get used to university life.

00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:47.386
I would say York International

00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:50.136
and the International
Student Association

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:52.276
at York are the best choices.

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:57.436
There is a special program
called Open Learning Centre.

00:02:57.776 --> 00:03:01.596
It concentrates on tutoring
students whose second language

00:03:01.596 --> 00:03:02.886
is English.

00:03:03.386 --> 00:03:07.016
We can also visit RED
Zone, where senior students

00:03:07.016 --> 00:03:10.406
and peer mentors can
help new students to find

00:03:10.406 --> 00:03:12.786
out about university programs.

00:03:13.456 --> 00:03:17.546
The library here
at York is amazing!

00:03:17.626 --> 00:03:20.366
Unfortunately, I commute to
York so I am not always here

00:03:20.896 --> 00:03:22.796
so I prefer going to the
library near my home.

00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:25.706
I would highly recommend
making good use of the library.

00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:29.636
I am the type of person that
needs absolutely no distractions

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:32.506
in order to do my work and the
library is an excellent place

00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:34.436
to do that because the
other people are there

00:03:34.436 --> 00:03:37.246
for the exact reason you are,
they need quiet working time,

00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:40.166
which means NO DISTRACTIONS!"

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:43.346
I also used the writing centre
a lot so when you go there

00:03:43.346 --> 00:03:46.286
and you ask them to help
you out with your papers

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:50.706
and different departments and
faculties will have tutors

00:03:51.786 --> 00:03:53.196
to help you out if
you are struggling.
