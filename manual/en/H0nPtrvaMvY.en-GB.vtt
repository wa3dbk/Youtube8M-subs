00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:14.005
Ajanta.

00:00:14.434 --> 00:00:16.730
The heartbeat of my hometown,
Shamli.

00:00:18.261 --> 00:00:21.037
Here when the good times rolled.
When the music kicked in...

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:24.737
...feet tapped, laughter sprinkled
and hands clapped...

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.286
...the whole world would
begin to sway.

00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:29.538
This is where I learnt to dance...

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.136
...to spread my wings...

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.034
...to live like there was
no tomorrow.

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:36.493
And now...

00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:39.871
Its Shamli's people that want
Ajanta destroyed.

00:00:42.302 --> 00:00:45.649
But I won't let that happen.

00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:01.400
Amongst these shy faces
a hidden flair

00:01:01.873 --> 00:01:04.921
This American song and dance bullshit,
you're trying to shove down our throats.

00:01:05.527 --> 00:01:06.919
We're not going to let you.

00:01:07.228 --> 00:01:10.312
Hidden in the swing of her strut,
swagger, sway.

00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.660
Even my lice have never
shaken a leg before.

00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:18.174
Drive the world insane.

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:25.351
Come on give us a glimpse.

00:01:25.674 --> 00:01:27.048
Of your hidden flair.

00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:29.092
We're both yours...
my tea... and me.

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:30.567
Of your hidden flair.

00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:32.241
Show me your Jalwa.

00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:35.566
Show me your Jalwa.

00:01:44.748 --> 00:01:46.890
How the hell are you going
to put up this show?

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.826
I'll show this city... and her folk...
this show's going to happen.

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:58.371
I will make it happen... with them.
You just wait and watch.

00:01:58.717 --> 00:01:59.877
Dance with me.

00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:02.189
Won't you come dance with me.

00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:05.238
A one a two and a three.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:07.767
Dance with me.

00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:10.216
Won't you come dance with me.

00:02:10.587 --> 00:02:13.168
Let down your hair, break free.

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:16.111
Come dance with me.

00:02:16.332 --> 00:02:18.005
Get on the roofs and dance.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.113
Come dance with me.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.057
Kick off your shoes and dance.
