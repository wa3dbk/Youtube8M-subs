00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.290
welcome back to another session with

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.690
your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today we are

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.120
going to make Keema Khameeri roti, this

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.190
khameeri means yeast you know this is

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.180
nothing but fermented dough roti so for

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.949
this first we are going to make the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.080
starter what we are going to use as a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.210
fermentation you know nowadays everybody

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.789
is using yeast but they used to make

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.669
this method for many generations so in

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.020
this take some buttermilk and add pinch

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.260
of salt some sugar and add flour in this

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.200
ok I think I can add more of buttermilk

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.440
now you know just make this into a thin

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.170
batter you know for jalebi also we do

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.110
khameer the same way just make this into

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.079
a batter and then pour this into a bowl

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.629
and we're going to leave this overnight

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.290
look at this batter because the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.000
buttermilk is there the flour is there

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.850
and more fermentation is happening with

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.720
the flour and by the next day when it is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.270
fermented you know it looks like this

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.380
can you see lot of you know air bubbles

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.049
in this, this is what is used to make our

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.720
khameeri roti that is a nice fermented

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.000
roti but nowadays if you want you can

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.520
also skip this method and add yeast to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.579
it and you can still make a similar kind

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.500
of roti but the yeast will have a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.590
different flavor and aroma whereas this

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.140
khameeri roti made with the butter milk

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.350
and flour batter makes it taste even

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.259
more better; now take this khameer that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.960
is the fermented dough in this we are

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.310
going to add milk we add the liquid to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.990
the flour but today I am just going to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.049
do it by adding this way it is ok and

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.610
now just make this into a nice soft

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.619
dough just the way you make your bread

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.170
dough, I am not adding salt at this point

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.239
of time because i already added some in

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.660
the fermented batter

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.780
but if you want you can also sprinkle

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.150
little bit of salt on this, knead this

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.570
dough till this is nice and soft you

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.610
know you may have to knead this like 4 - 5

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.560
minutes the way you need the bread dough

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.510
because you want the gluten to form in

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.580
this dough you know after kneading the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.530
dough we are going to rest it for around

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.560
5 minutes after that we are going to add

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.260
some ghee and again knead the dough and

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.020
this time we are going to rest this dough

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.840
for two hours because this is not yeast

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.400
there is khameer this takes a little

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.350
more time than yeast just cover this

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.590
dough with a wet cloth and put it in a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.230
warm place for two hours they used to

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.790
make khameer that is the fermentation

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.520
dough by mixing yogurt with the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.220
all-purpose flour but nowadays lot of

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.050
people are using yeast but this is

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.600
another method of making ok now the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.250
dough is all ready we have rested enough

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.380
time for this kheema masala khameeri roti

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.480
we're going to take mince meat that

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.970
is keema in this we're going to add

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.020
chopped onion small onion, chopped garlic

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.770
and chopped mint and coriander both of

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.220
the mix in this add salt, add chilli

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.730
powder, add garam masala powder and also

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.730
some chopped tomatoes now we're going to add

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.670
one egg also in this and you're going to

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.860
mix all of this and we're going to use

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.780
this as a topping for our keema

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.900
khameeri roti now this mince meat

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.320
masala is all ready now once you have the

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.760
bread ready we are going to spread this

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.680
on the top I am going to show you how to

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.230
cook this;  look at this dough this looks

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.510
perfect but the dough is nice and soft

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.390
so we just going to take one portion

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.780
of this dough and do not beat this dough

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.820
or anything because there is aeration

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.610
in this and we just going to spread this,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.140
to make this khameeri roti just

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.000
sprinkle some flour on a plate or

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.910
anything and then put the dough and just

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.860
spread the dough on this because this is

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.770
a nicely fermented though and this is a

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.750
