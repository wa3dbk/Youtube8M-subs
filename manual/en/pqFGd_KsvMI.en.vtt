00:00:09.185 --> 00:00:12.171
This is my guide on how to perform the Charged Shot.

00:00:18.248 --> 00:00:20.437
Here's how to do it, step by step.

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:23.951
Start off by grabbing an assault rifle.

00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:32.733
Begin by equipping the hand gun.

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:38.143
Step 3, start by holding down the left trigger.

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.474
You'll need to hold the trigger during the whole process.

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:44.516
Step 4, switch to the assault rifle by pushing

00:00:44.516 --> 00:00:47.394
the yellow "Y" button on the controller.

00:00:47.394 --> 00:00:51.203
Step 5, push and hold down the right trigger button.

00:00:51.412 --> 00:00:53.953
This will start the charging process for the shot.

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:57.894
Step 6, continue holding down both triggers for about

00:00:57.894 --> 00:01:00.948
5 seconds.  If you let go too early it won't

00:01:00.948 --> 00:01:03.145
shoot out all 50 rounds.

00:01:03.384 --> 00:01:06.789
Step 7, release only the left trigger and the rifle

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.426
should shoot out all 50 rounds at once.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.446
Practice the charged shot a couple times.

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:13.611
You'll soon find that

00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:16.424
you don't actually have to hold down the left trigger long

00:01:16.424 --> 00:01:19.195
before you switch out to the assault rifle.  Try pushing

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:22.695
the left trigger and immediately switch to the assault rifle,

00:01:22.956 --> 00:01:25.050
then charge your shot with the right trigger.

00:01:26.304 --> 00:01:30.394
You can open and close doors, pick up pain pills and pipe bombs

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.634
while still maintaining the charge.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.493
If you want to cancel the charge,

00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:39.229
simply release the right trigger first and it will stop.

00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:44.364
The charged shot can also be used with the sub-machine gun.

00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:49.709
This method does not work with the shotgun or hunting rifle.

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:01.150
The charge shot is only effective against the witch and the tank.

00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:04.298
And it's only beneficial  on the first shot.

00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:06.557
Once you've fired the charged shot,

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.614
reload and begin firing as you normally would.
