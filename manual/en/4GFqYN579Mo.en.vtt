00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:14.526
&gt;&gt; Welcome to another installment of the
AMSOIL Information Series. I'm Rob Stenberg.

00:00:14.796 --> 00:00:18.446
Today we get to talk about
toys, specifically, snowmobiles.

00:00:18.446 --> 00:00:20.786
And we're going to talk about
exhaust power valves.

00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:22.476
Everybody's talking about them.

00:00:22.946 --> 00:00:26.946
With me today, Mr. Len Groom, Technical
Product Manager with AMSOIL in Power Sports.

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:28.316
Len, thanks for being here today.

00:00:28.316 --> 00:00:28.816
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Rob.

00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:29.866
&gt;&gt; Appreciate it very much.

00:00:30.176 --> 00:00:34.036
Now, tell me: What's one of the main issues
that people see with exhaust power valves?

00:00:34.176 --> 00:00:35.176
&gt;&gt; The biggest issue that you see

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:39.406
with an exhaust power valve is
sticking, if it fails to operate.

00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:41.566
&gt;&gt; So maybe I should back up just a little bit.

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:44.466
What does an exhaust power valve
do for a two-stroke engine?

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:46.686
&gt;&gt; Exhaust power valves allow
a two-stroke engine

00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:49.596
to be more usable across a real wide rpm band.

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:52.106
It'll give it good power
download when you go to take off.

00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:54.166
It will also give you good power up top.

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:56.676
&gt;&gt; So what exactly would
make a power valve stick?

00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:01.386
&gt;&gt; The very design of the exhaust
power valve can contribute to sticking.

00:01:02.046 --> 00:01:06.056
These things work in the exhaust stream of
the engine; so anything that the engine burns,

00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:09.616
the gasoline, the oil is all going to
make its way past that power valve.

00:01:09.616 --> 00:01:13.566
And if it's going to -- if it's forming
deposits, whether there's carbon involved,

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.066
it's going to end up stuck on the valve.

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:18.246
&gt;&gt; So a power valve, exhaust power
valve does stick, what kind of --

00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:19.886
what does that do to the
performance of the engine?

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.136
&gt;&gt; You're going to see all kinds
of performance-related issues.

00:01:22.136 --> 00:01:25.506
If the valve sticks closed, the
engine won't have any top speed.

00:01:25.816 --> 00:01:30.256
If the valve sticks open, the low
speed of the engine will be real bad.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.556
You'll go to take off and it won't do it.

00:01:31.706 --> 00:01:33.806
&gt;&gt; And you don't want any of that to
happen if you're out on the trail.

00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:35.156
&gt;&gt; No. That's no fun for anyone.

00:01:35.326 --> 00:01:35.616
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:37.616
So can we take one of these
off, take a look at one of them?

00:01:37.616 --> 00:01:38.356
&gt;&gt; We sure can.
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:01:49.636 --> 00:01:51.196
All right.
So, Len, what am I looking at?

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:51.776
Is this good?

00:01:51.776 --> 00:01:52.576
bad? indifferent?

00:01:53.276 --> 00:01:56.376
&gt;&gt; Well, if you take a look at this valve,
you're looking for -- like we talked about.

00:01:56.376 --> 00:01:57.646
You're looking for depositing.

00:01:57.766 --> 00:01:58.706
You're looking for carbon.

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:02.096
This little bit of oil that you're seeing
around here on the edges, that's normal.

00:02:02.096 --> 00:02:02.866
They're all going to do that.

00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:03.886
You want to see this.

00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:06.776
If you pulled it out and you saw all kinds
of hard carbon on it, you'd know right away.

00:02:07.206 --> 00:02:12.566
So, with this particular example, what we can
do is we can actually wipe away this little bit

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:13.696
of oil that's left over.

00:02:15.206 --> 00:02:20.946
And what you can see is that there's
virtually no depositing on this valve at all.

00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:21.446
&gt;&gt; That's clean.

00:02:21.606 --> 00:02:22.466
&gt;&gt; It's very clean.

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:23.856
This is actually a real good example.

00:02:24.096 --> 00:02:26.826
&gt;&gt; So, if you have a clean valve, that means
you're going to have a good day on the trails.

00:02:26.826 --> 00:02:27.786
&gt;&gt; You're going to have a good day.

00:02:27.786 --> 00:02:29.116
This valve will operate freely.

00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:32.096
This thing will provide -- this one
didn't really need to be cleaned, Rob.

00:02:32.356 --> 00:02:34.756
&gt;&gt; Great. Can we take a look at
the valve off of this machine?

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:35.536
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We sure can.

00:02:35.646 --> 00:02:36.146
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:47.686
So, Len, tell me: What am I
looking at here with this valve?

00:02:47.986 --> 00:02:50.476
&gt;&gt; What we're looking at here
is the start of a problem, Rob.

00:02:50.686 --> 00:02:52.866
If you take a look real closely
at this particular valve

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:57.176
after we've wiped away the excess oil,
you're looking at carbon deposits.

00:02:57.306 --> 00:03:00.626
If we take a razor blade
and we scrape just a little,

00:03:01.216 --> 00:03:05.426
you can start to see the
carbon forming on this valve.

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:07.776
&gt;&gt; So I've got a problem
started with this valve.

00:03:07.776 --> 00:03:09.006
&gt;&gt; You've got the start of a problem.

00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:11.826
This sled runs okay right now, but
it's not going to stay that way.

00:03:12.286 --> 00:03:15.846
&gt;&gt; And why it's so important for me
to use a high-quality two-cycle oil

00:03:15.846 --> 00:03:18.686
like AMSOIL Interceptor in
a machine just like this.

00:03:18.836 --> 00:03:22.836
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Interceptor is formulated
specifically to fight this problem.

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:25.096
It's not prone to depositing.

00:03:25.096 --> 00:03:27.206
You'll see -- you won't see any of this --

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:30.526
any of this excessive carbon buildup
like we're seeing on this valve.

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:32.756
And like we already said,
this sled still works good.

00:03:33.186 --> 00:03:37.856
This would be -- if I were to give you the
example of let's say you ran over a nail.

00:03:38.376 --> 00:03:41.366
Maybe the air is going to stay in your tire
for a while, but eventually it's going to leak

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:42.636
out of there and you're going to have a problem.

00:03:43.336 --> 00:03:45.976
This particular carbon buildup
problem is just like that.

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:49.646
It may work today, but it may not
work tomorrow or the next day,

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.796
and eventually it's probably
going to leave you on the trail.

00:03:51.796 --> 00:03:53.086
&gt;&gt; And it's going to ruin my day.

00:03:53.086 --> 00:03:53.526
&gt;&gt; It is.

00:03:53.526 --> 00:03:54.896
&gt;&gt; So one last question, Len.

00:03:55.456 --> 00:04:00.376
If I continue to let that problem occur,
what am I going to be looking at then?

00:04:01.246 --> 00:04:03.996
&gt;&gt; If the valves stick, let's say
they stick in a closed position,

00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:05.446
and they're stuck in the exhaust stream.

00:04:05.906 --> 00:04:07.526
You see excess heat buildup.

00:04:07.526 --> 00:04:09.916
We see all kinds of issues
that will come from that,

00:04:10.006 --> 00:04:12.486
and the end result could
be costly engine repair.

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:14.206
&gt;&gt; We want to help people avoid that.

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:14.696
&gt;&gt; We do.

00:04:14.696 --> 00:04:15.776
&gt;&gt; Len, thanks for being here today.

00:04:15.776 --> 00:04:17.116
We appreciate all your information.

00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:20.026
For the AMSOIL Information
Series, I'm Rob Stenberg.

00:04:20.256 --> 00:04:21.836
We'll see you next time.
