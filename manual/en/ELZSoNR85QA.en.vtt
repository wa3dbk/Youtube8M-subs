00:00:04.914 --> 00:00:07.383
I get a haircut every single month

00:00:07.437 --> 00:00:10.562
And I hate the experience
every single time I'm there!

00:00:10.587 --> 00:00:14.423
Like most guys I don't go to a barber,
I go to a salon

00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:16.327
*Lisping*
Because it's fabulous!

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:20.994
I look around this place and there's just
pictures of these people just smiling

00:00:21.028 --> 00:00:22.560
With their sweet hair

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.047
I hear all these other customers
just talking about the same thing

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.179
Everybody's like:

00:00:27.254 --> 00:00:29.262
"Boy, it's windy outside!"

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.184
"I can't believe how cold it got this weekend"

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:35.540
And I hate it!
I hate talking about the same shit over and over

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:37.599
That's why the next time they're all like:

00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:38.948
"Heeeyyy, what's up!"

00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:40.129
I'm like: "Well.."

00:00:40.197 --> 00:00:44.023
".. My dog has cancer. You wanna talk about that?
I don't think so."

00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:45.350
"So cut my fuckin' hair."

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:49.418
But I know it's part of their job, you know,
I'm sure they don't want to talk to our dumb asses either

00:00:49.472 --> 00:00:53.091
Now, for women it's a completely different experience

00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:54.435
They love getting their hair cut

00:00:54.495 --> 00:00:58.204
They're all excited, you know,
they got the day marked off on their calendar

00:00:58.251 --> 00:00:59.417
And they just can't wait

00:00:59.473 --> 00:01:00.322
But I don't get it

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.075
Because 98% of women hate their haircut afterwards

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.525
The hairdresser will ask them:

00:01:05.562 --> 00:01:08.570
"Ohhkayyy, how do you like your hair so far?"

00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:10.724
"Oh, it looks really good!"

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:13.801
'What the fuck is this bitch doin' to my hair?"

00:01:13.863 --> 00:01:15.426
And then they get home and they're like:

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:17.601
"WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?!"

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:18.758
For guys it's easier

00:01:18.783 --> 00:01:22.459
Because most of us have been getting
the same haircut since the second grade

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.013
I used to get a bowl cut

00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:26.044
But then one day I was like:

00:01:26.093 --> 00:01:28.458
"Mom.. I think I look like penis.."

00:01:28.527 --> 00:01:32.170
So then I switched over to the haircut
that I've had for the past 15 years

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:34.582
Now, there's a bunch of ladies that work at this place

00:01:34.612 --> 00:01:38.136
But I usually get the same lady every time

00:01:38.177 --> 00:01:41.779
She's this Korean lady,
and she does a really good job

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.013
She knows what she's doing

00:01:44.273 --> 00:01:47.916
It's just that her accent is so thick
that I can't understand her at all

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.363
I can decipher, like,
one out of every eight words she says to me

00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:53.429
She's always like:

00:01:53.483 --> 00:01:55.197
*High-pitched voice*
"Oh, you no work today?"

00:01:55.293 --> 00:01:57.626
And I'm like:
"No, I no work today"

00:01:57.695 --> 00:01:59.967
But that's usually the highlight
of my whole trip there

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.317
Is just trying to guess what we're talking about

00:02:02.353 --> 00:02:04.472
I try to relate with her and I'm like:

00:02:04.515 --> 00:02:07.213
'Think of something Korean...'

00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:08.248
I'll be like:

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.902
"Heeeeyyy where's all your nucular weapons at, huh?!"

00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:13.546
*Silence, crickets chirping*

00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:16.600
I'm like:
"Well, shit, I guess I could bring up Gangnam Style.."

00:02:17.047 --> 00:02:19.841
