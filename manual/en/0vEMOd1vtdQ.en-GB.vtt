00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.320
-Is your hand OK?
-I just wrapped it in toilet paper.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.160
Never mind that.
You know what?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.720
It's not the taking part that counts.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.720
Right? That's what
I've been trying to say.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.120
OK, if we can take this home...

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.840
I really want that script.
I will give you ten thousand...

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.160
I don't give a damn about the script
or the money. I'm in it to win it.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.400
-Move, Jon. I need to warm up.
-I need to warm my hand.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.880
Screw that.
I need to warm up.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.840
But I need to...
Relax, man!

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.880
All set?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.480
Come on, Thomas.
Nothing but victory will do.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.600
Ready, set, go!

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.600
And they're off!
Thomas got off to a great start.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.400
Oops, trouble.
Get in there!

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.680
Jonna is doing well.
Thomas is falling behind.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.400
-Come on. You're bloody last.
-Way behind. Get the balloon!

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.400
Linni got there.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.200
Quit clowning around, Giertsen.
Finish already.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.040
Oh, now I get it.
Funny as hell when people fall.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.240
Why aren't you laughing now?
Give us a little smile.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.480
Yeah, Linni!

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.720
Thomas, you have to finish,
or we disqualify the whole team.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.360
Come on, Thomas.
Help Thomas get there, guys.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.600
Come on,
or the whole team is disqualified.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.520
Help Thomas.
Cheer him on!

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.360
And he crossed the finish line!

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.440
What the hell is going on?

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.360
I... I...

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.960
Too much bloody sunshine,
and it's windy, and your nagging...

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.960
-Don't you want to win?
-Yeah...

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.160
That's what I'm gunning for.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.400
But you're of no help.
You need to motivate me.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.560
I tried, but you spent more time
off the field than on it.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.080
I'm a paraplegic,
and I would've done way better.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.200
OK, but the quiz is up next.
You can handle that.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.000
Yes, I can handle that.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.120
But it would be nice
if we won as a team...
