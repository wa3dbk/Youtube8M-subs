00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.420
I got a request a few weeks ago asking me
if I can touch more on the meal plan and workout

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.779
program that I decided to go with.

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.820
And if you are new to my channel, I had a
goal of eating a little more healthier, learning

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.680
how to cook healthier and just staying on
track.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.570
I’m going to get into what you get in this
program, I can’t really tell you how it’s

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.220
going cause I’m only on Day 4, this is my
first week.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.289
I can’t really show you results, I can’t
show you a before and after at this time,

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.730
because i’m only on day 4.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.300
I definitely will be doing a follow up.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.390
I do vlog my meals and I take pictures of
them on my snapchat.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.970
So if you aren’t following me on there,
I’m getting better at it, so you can follow

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.790
me on snapchat and I’ll have all of that
stuff there as well as my blog KaleiLagunero.com

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.680
And if you aren’t following me on twitter
or Instagram, I usually post thing son there

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.680
too!

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.780
You get two DVD’s - you get one which I
feel is more of toning and sculpting dvd.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.240
And you also get this guide that tells you
what days you need to do what.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.579
So you don’t have to remember anything.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.900
You just follow the recommended days on what
workout to do and you are off.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:25.350
What I loved abut the meal plan, so far, is
everything is portion controlled, each container

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.649
has a specific thing that you should eat.

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.679
And when you go through the meal plan book,
it tells you what the green container is for.

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:40.360
So, they say Green is for veggies, purple
container is for fruit and the red is for

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.360
proteins.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.819
Basically, all you do is put all the ingredients
in these containers and you fill it up into

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:46.999
these containers.

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.999
You can eat it.

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:53.609
They aren’t talking about junk food or anything
like that, cause they have a carbs container.

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.710
They are telling you what type of carbs to
eat.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.220
And they aren’t saying you have to eat them
one by one, they are saying basically, you

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.609
can mix it all up.

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:07.469
Once you go and calculate your calories, there
is a calorie target goal, once you find out

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.120
where you are supposed to be, it will tell
you how many of the containers that you need

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.239
to eat throughout the day.

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.239
That’s all you do!

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.761
You just fill up exactly what you are supposed
to eat, and those, you can make recipes, they

00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:22.850
have recipes in here, they have what you can
and can’t drink.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.480
That is why I chose this workout plan and
this meal plan.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.269
Because I felt like it fit my lifestyle a
lot better.

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.430
I ordered my program and meal plan on Beachbody.com,
the direct site.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.819
I am not sponsored, this video isn’t sponsored,
it wasn’t sent to me, I purchased this with

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:42.819
my own money.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.989
This is something that I am very passionate
about and something that I really do want

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.239
to achieve on.

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.260
And I just love in 21 days, if you do the
work and you work super hard at it, you will

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.260
see results!

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.650
Thank you so much for watching and thank you
for being interested in my fitness videos.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.159
I’m really passionate about it.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.409
It’s something that’s a lifestyle.

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.049
It’s not a fad for me.

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.660
I’ve been at this for almost 4 years now,
and I’m just really happy that you guys

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.260
are very inspired by them.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.170
And, I’m happy that you find them helpful
at that.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.180
Thank you guys so much for watching!

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.851
And I will see you next time!
