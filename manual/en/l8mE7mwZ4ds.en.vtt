Hi, I'm tom Wright from Ginger Bread Glass
and I'm here today to show you how to make

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:19.220
a glass jar.
Now were going to detach our jar from the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:30.660
tube. So I'm going to apply a punty, a cold
steel punty here on the bottom.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:55.260
Close to the middle as I can and that will
help us heat this up a little bit more. Little

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:20.540
bit more juice here. Alright so were going
to puff out the top just a little bit more.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:42.350
Going to get this a little hot again. So with
that bottom piece you can kind of of just

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.350
pull a little bit, help it and stretch it
out a little bit. Alright now were going to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:02:37.140
blow a hole here in the tube. Alright, we
detached it.
