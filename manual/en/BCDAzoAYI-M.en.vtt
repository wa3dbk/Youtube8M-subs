Good morning guys, it's Mommy, and I am heading
into the offices of The Toy Insider today!

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.160
You know, cause I'm on the parent advisory
board. I'm like, just gonna rub that in everybody's

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.539
noses for a while now. I'm just really excited
about it, and I'm headin' in today to talk

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.880
a little bit about some ideas for the vlogs
that I'm gonna be doing for the parents advisory

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:27.360
board, or PARENT advisory board, it's "parent"
advisory board, and maybe they'll let me film

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.980
a little bit of their offices? Because let
me tell you, if you ever wanna work in an

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.610
office, this is the office you want to work
in. There are toys EVERYWHERE. It's like my

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.050
house! It's so cool.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.640
So I'm gonna ask the ladies there if I can
film a little bit of The Toy Insider offices

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.240
to share with you, and I will see you along
the way. Love you, bye!

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.050
So here I am, I'm here with Marissa, this
is like - we're in the office of The Toy Insider!

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.560
No, you don't have to hide them! So I was
like, so, you got any of those other dolls?

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.760
Now I'm not taking these because we are committed
to finding them in the wild, but -- daahhhh!!

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.179
Oh my God! Now you know when we first saw
the pictures of Jinafire, I will tell you

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:15.979
a true story - in the original promotional
pictures, it looked like she was vomiting.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.789
But now you can totally tell that she's breathing
green fire, but in the promotional pictures

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.270
- oh honey. Honey honey honey. You're not
allowed to hide in my bag. No, no. We're the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.939
doll hunters, and we have to find them in
the wild. It's just the rules. Darn you! Darn

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:32.740
those ethics.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.719
Oh look, there's Minions! I love your offices.
Look at this! There's just like Minions lying

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:46.630
around, Transformers, like -- We got some
Fashionistas -- Fashionistas just lying around...

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.259
Now there's Minions flying around! Whoops.
I would love - man, working here -- Oh yeah

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.139
I just got her, she's beautiful. Oh, I have
her. Look at this - but this is the problem,

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:02.229
I'm like, got that, got that, got that. This
one -- Ooh, we don't have that one. Oooh!

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:02.509
Cool.

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.159
I'm gonna show you my favorite doll. Oh, is
this your favorite doll? This is Laurie's

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.690
favorite doll. Do you - I'll show you why
though. So it's Cabbage Patch, but I want

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:19.690
you to look at the adoption papers. Oh my
gosh! How did you get that? Cause I'm special!

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:27.170
Awww, Laurie has her very own Cabbage Patch
Doll! I do, they made the hair curly for me

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.810
and everything! Oh my gosh, oooh! So this
sits on my special shelf, cause it's not for

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:39.010
anybody but me! Aw, that is so cool! I love
that! This is so fun. How come I didn't work

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.830
here? Why was I in commercial real estate
management? What was I thinkin'?

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.000
Hey guys, so this is what it looks like to
be in a meeting room at The Toy Insider. Is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.200
this not like a Mommy kind of meeting room?
This is totally - now mind you, there is a

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.520
conference room table. See? And we're gonna
have business, we're gonna talk business,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.090
but I spy an Elektrokid. Oh, and we got some
Shopkins, and and and some Puppy Surprise,

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.870
and some Loopsies, and Elsa, GoldieBlox, and
Buzz Lightyear. But yeah, this is what it's

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.080
like. And then if you look out there, there's
more toys. Coolest place in the world to work.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.780
So we're pickin' through their inventory here
of toyage, with Marissa and Ali. And I got

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.780
a couple of Barbies, I grabbed some Jenga,
because believe it or not, our house is Jenga

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:39.300
free. How does that even happen? Oooh. Ohhhh.
She would love that. Am I really carrying

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.280
that home on the train for Gracie? I think
it's worth it. I think so. Definitely. Oh

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.040
yeah. She was all Katniss --

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.040
Okay, so I'm headin' home to Gracie, armed
with the giant crossbow. Yes! Secrets &amp; Spies.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.510
And the elevator's here, and I gotta go get
a train, so I'll see you guys later. Bye!
