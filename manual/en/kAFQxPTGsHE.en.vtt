00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.490
How to Take Pictures in Bright Sunlight.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.460
Transform bright light from a foe to a friend
with a simple polarizing filter.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.040
You will need A camera Circular polarizing
filter and eye protection or sunglasses.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.280
Step 1.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.360
Put on your sunglasses—you don’t want
to hurt your own eyes.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.279
Step 2.

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.109
Decide on what subject you wish to shoot.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.410
Step 3.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.820
Position yourself according to the orientation
of the sun, with your back toward the sun

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.129
and your subject facing the sun to minimize
shadows on their faces.

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.489
Step 4.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.480
Grab your camera and screw on a polarizing
filter, which will help defray excess UV light.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.749
Step 5.

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.929
Set your ISO to the lowest possible setting,
such as 100.

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.780
Step 6.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.449
Turn of your auto-mode and choose either Manual,
Aperture Priority, or Shutter Speed priority

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:00.449
modes.

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.449
Step 7.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:02.449
Compose your shot.

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.990
Compose your subject by using the rule of
thirds, where your subject is either in the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.380
left or right third, not the direct middle,
for the most interesting pictures.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.380
Step 8.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.630
Focus on the subject.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.630
Step 9.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.530
Take a light reading by metering the subject.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.630
If your camera has a built-in light meter,
it will meter through the glass, adjusting

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.920
for the polarizing lens.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.649
If, however, you’re using a hand-held meter,
be sure to add the appropriate ƒ-stop by

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.609
reading the instructions on the filter’s
packaging.

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:33.880
Step 10.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.330
Select your shutter speed and aperture, based
on your readings.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.590
In bright situations your camera’s meter
system will tend to underexpose your shot

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.369
to balance out the amount of light hitting
your sensor.

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.039
If you want “white” snow, not “grey”
snow, over-expose your shots by 1/2 to a full

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.039
stop.

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.399
Step 11.

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.079
Look through your viewfinder at the subject
and adjust your polarizing filter until the

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.380
sky is a deep blue.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.909
Step 12.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.439
Re-focus on the subject.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.439
Step 13.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.100
Shoot until you’re satisfied, then shoot
a little more, just in case.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.569
Did you know The intensity of ultraviolet
rays increases 5% every 1000 feet of elevation

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.110
you gain.
