00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Santiago, Chile is the capital city of my country. 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.100
My name is Spiro Razis and have been skating for over 25 years now and close to 20 years riding a snowboard.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.500
Today I am going to take you on a skate and snowboard and surf tour of my country.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.900
Thanks to Santiago´s unique geographic location, the Andes mountains lie just outside the city limits.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.500
Today we are going to travel to an area known as Cajon de Maipo, which is located a mere 70 kilometers from the city.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.200
Here we will encounter huge mountains

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200
with ideal snow conditions for riding.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.200
After spending the morning riding in Cajon 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.000
we´ll return to the city for a bit of skating.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.700
When I first arrived in Chile there barely existed anywhere to skate, no skateparks, no ramps, nothing. 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.300
It's changed,  in Santiago alone there are more than 5 skateparks now, and many more scattered throughout Chile.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.500
Today we are going to visit a skatepark called Los Reyes, which is one of my personal favorites.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.300
Just 100 kilometers to the west of Santiago

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.000
is the city of Viña del Mar, located on the Pacific coast, it is one Chile´s most beautiful cities. 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.500
Before the sun sets today we will arrive in Viña del Mar for a late afternoon surf session.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.500
I hope you have enjoyed this day as much as we have 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.500
showing a bit of the mountains, the city and the sea. This is Chile!
