00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.940
Hey guys.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.500
Today we're going to be installing the AMI
replacement billet

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.520
fuel door.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.840
What we have here is the fuel door, the adapter
for it, the magnetic latch,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.720
some hard parts.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.570
We need a quarter-inch drill bit, Phillips
screwdriver,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.770
and an Allen key.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.059
Your stock fuel door is installed with these
two rivets right here.

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.290
So what
we need to do first is drill those out so

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.440
we can get our new fuel door on.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.600
Okay.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.019
So now that we've finished drilling out those
rivets for the fuel

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:48.530
door, we can go ahead and remove that.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.039
When removing the old fuel door, if
you need to, you may need to remove this liner

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.249
right on the inside.

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:04.070
Our next step is to take out these two rubber
grommets here.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.100
Just twitch
those guys right on out.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.159
Next we just want to remove the screws, nuts,
and washers from this adapter

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.740
and just set them aside for right now.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.120
The next step is to install our adapter, which
is going to mount right

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.300
where we removed those two rubber grommets.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.220
Now that we have our adapter
on, I didn't fully tighten it down just yet,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.780
because what we want to do
first is check to make sure that our holes

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.710
are lined up and centered.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.270
Put
this guy on here and center up our ring, and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.590
the holes, which ours are not
completely lined up, we can then go and adjust

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.320
this guy real quick, right
where we need it to go.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.660
After we've installed our adapter, what we
will want to do is install our

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.110
latch assembly to the fuel door.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:02:00.780
All we're going to do is screw this latch
right here, those two bolts.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.120
After we've installed our latch assembly,
we will come over here and

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.770
install our fuel door.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.019
We'll just use these two bolts.

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.069
They'll run them
through the old rivet holes that we had drilled

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.200
out.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.710
Place that on there
like that, and then we will put the washer

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.750
and bolts on the back side.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.200
Once we've installed the bolts on the back
side there, we will install the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.950
bolts here on the front.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.170
All right, and that completes our installation
of

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.590
the AMI billet fuel door.
