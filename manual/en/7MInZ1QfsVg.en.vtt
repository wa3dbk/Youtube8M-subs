This is a guide to completing all the challenges
for the Dexter Industries mission.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.370
For the chameleon challenge you are required
to find and take all the disguises in the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.350
Dexter Industries mission.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.639
Load into Factory Compound on the normal difficulty.

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.890
Shoot the guard leaning on the entrance of
the mine and take his outfit.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.010
Get to the other side of the bridge by pushing
guards off the side of the bridge and jump

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.080
up to the bathroom window.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.350
Pull the truck driver out of the window and
drop back down to take his outfit.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.000
Go into the garage and wait for the client
in the suit to get close to it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.940
Throw something at the wall so that he comes
to investigate.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.700
Take him out and pick up his outfit.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.710
Go into the back of the garage and pick up
the key card.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.750
Go into the Factory and onto the roof, then
climb down the side of the Factory.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.910
Make your way into the hut with the key card.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.070
The Charlie the Chipmunk outfit is in the
hut.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.760
For the suit only challenge you are required
to finish each part of the Dexter Industries

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.230
mission without using disguises.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.870
Load into Dead End on the normal difficulty.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.410
At the first security station wait for the
guard leaning on the wall to have gone.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.949
Then you can climb into it.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.990
After disabling the security system there
go to the u-shaped bit of wall and wait for

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.260
a guard to have walked past you.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.460
Then keep going deeper into the area past
the right side of the car and take cover on

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.170
the barrels ahead.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.850
Wait for a guard to show up and talk to the
guard inside the second security station.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.170
He will leave after a short while, then you
can get into the second station and disable

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.630
the backup security system there.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.290
Pick up the wrench and get out of the second
security station through the other window.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.700
Throw the wrench to the left of the guard
standing in front of the second security station,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.810
then you can sneak to the exit of Dead End.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.770
In the Old Mill there are only three guards
which you can easily shoot.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.810
For Descend make your way down to the entrance
of the mine and wait for the two guards to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.810
finish talking.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.520
Then sneak past them and keep going down.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.120

then keep going past the door.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.810

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.549
Go into the main mine area and enter point
shoot mode to take out the guards that are

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.160
assembled there.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.450
Keep going and take out the last two guards
in the area.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.040
Now you can finish Descend without worrying
about any more guards.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.780
In the Factory Compound shoot the guard leaning
on the entrance to the mine.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.980
Then go over the bridge pushing off the guards
near the edge.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.030
Go into the leftmost area and take out the
two guards there.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.790

Climb down a ladder into the Factory.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.230
Here you will have to take out guards as you
see them, entering point shoot mode where

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.230
necessary.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.930

When you are close to it enter point shoot
mode and mark the mines.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.140
It is easier in point shoot mode, but you
can't enter point shoot mode once enemies

are hostile.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.280

Climb through the window into the security
station and out the other side.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.349
The building in question is just ahead.

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.680
Go to the right side of it and open the door.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.080
Now load into Factory Compound.

Shoot the guard leaning on the entrance of
the mine and take the sniper rifle.

Then just shoot three enemies on the bridge
