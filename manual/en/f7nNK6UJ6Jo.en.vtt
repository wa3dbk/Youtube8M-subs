Charlie Wilson]
Mike test, "one", "two".

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.430
Good morning!

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.549
Como estas?

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.549
How you doing, baby?

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:07.549
[young man]
How are you?

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:08.549
[Chelsea Cogdell]
He's definitely one of the nicest people.

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:09.549
[Jimmy Caughron]
The kids just love him to death.

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:10.549
[Charlie Wilson]
Good morning.

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:11.549
Good morning, girls.

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:12.549
[woman]
Good to see you.

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:13.549
[Trey Hamlett]
Charlie Wilson.

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:14.549
[young man]
How ya doing?

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.549
[Colton DeCock]
He makes it fun all the time.

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.549
[Chelsea Cogdell]
He's sassy sometimes.

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:17.549
[Trey Hamlett]
He's a force of nature.

00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:18.840
[Charlie laughs]

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.850
[skeet shooter]
Pull!

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.190
[gun shots]

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.781
[Charlie Wilson]
What am I?

00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:30.690
I am the, ah, shooting sports specialist for
Texas Parks and Wildlife.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.850
I gotta look at my card.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.719
I'm not even sure what ... I drive the truck.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.030
I ride the quad.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.120
I throw the targets.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.719
[narrator]
Charlie Wilson is, indeed, a force of nature.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.210
While he hasn't been the only one involved,
he has definitely been the driving force behind

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.760
Texas Parks and Wildlife's very successful
shooting sports program.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.760
[gun shot]

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.629
[Charlie Wilson]
Number four, going straight up.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.679
Set your face.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:00:59.679
[skeet thrower]

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:00.679
[narrator]
Since 1992...

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:01.859
[Charlie Wilson]
See there?

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:02.859
[boy]
Yes

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.830
[narrator]
...Charlie has travelled the state with a

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.080
truck and a trailer...

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.080
[gun fires]

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.760
[narrator]
He teaches folks, most of whom have never

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.210
picked up a firearm in their lives, how to
handle a shotgun.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.210
[woman]
Pull.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.210
[skeet thrower]

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.210
[narrator]
...how to shoot a shotgun.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.210
[rifle fires]

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.210
[onlooker]
Perfect, yea!

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.840
[narrator]
...and most importantly, how to be safe with

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.840
a shotgun.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.960
[Charlie Wilson]
Follow it in, follow it in.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.960
Take it.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.850
[gun fires]
Good shot!

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.660
Nothing to this, is it.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.660
Nothing to this.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.660
Let's try this again.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.570
[Charlie Wilson]
I'm on my second generation of shooters now.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.420
Kids who started with the program back in
the early nineties.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.650
I'm seeing their kids now.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.650
[rifle fires]

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.520
[Charlie Wilson]
On behalf of Texas Parks and Wildlife, Texas

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.730
FFA, I'd like to welcome everybody here to
the sixth annual Ag Clays 381 Shoot-out.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.440
[audience]
Good morning.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.820
[Charlie]
Six years ago, we had 60 kids come shoot and

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.820
we had eight schools.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.820
[girl]
Pull!

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.510
[Charlie]
This year, we have 612 entries.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.680
[girl]
Mom, remember 35.....

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.390
[Charlie]
Have you won anything?

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.480
[boy]
No.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.100
[Charlie]
You sure?

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.190
[boy]
Yes!

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.780
[Trey Hamlett]
With the kids, he develops long-term relationships

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.299
where 500 kids all feel like he cares about
them personally and he does.

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.430
He follows them through school.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.609
Those kids still send him cards, they come
see him after they're in college, after they're

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:22.709
out of college.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.129
He's made life long participants in the outdoors
through shooting sports.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.569
It's really an amazing thing.

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.129
[Charlie]
What happened to your teeth?

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.590
Have you been kissing girls?

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.590
[boy]
Noooo!

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.299
[Charlie Wilson]
I think we get into a trap.

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.370
We don't as adults, we seem to think that
we knowwhat's always right and what's best

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.370
for the kids and what the kids want.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.370
[clapping]

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.469
[Charlie]
And I've found that if you sit and talk to

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.739
the kids and listen to them, they'll pretty
much tell you what they would like to see

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.280
and how they would like to see it.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.159
[woman]
I always try to come find him as soon as I

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.219
get to a shoot.

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:01.219
[woman]
Good morning.

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:02.219
[Charlie Wilson]
Good morning, how you doing?

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.219
[woman]
Good.

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.219
[Charlie Wilson]
All right, you ready?

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:05.719
[Trey Hamlett]
He's the pied piper of the shooting sports.

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.809
[audience laughs]
