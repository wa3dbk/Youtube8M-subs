00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.969
Hi. I'm Jason Shoemaker at Slugfest Printmaking
Workshop and I'm going to show you how to

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:10.270
wipe a plate in intaglio printmaking. We have
our tarleton. It's been balled up. Good in

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.950
the hand. We have our hot plate which is slightly
warm just to keep the plate hot so that you

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.150
can move around. We've got our plate and it's
inked up. Now there's a few different techniques

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.060
wiping the plate. It's going to be different
for every plate that you do. You just need

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:30.980
to print and kind of see what the plate is
doing and then keep going. So you can scrub

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.030
in the ink. That helps even it out a little
bit. I generally like to just get in to wiping.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.210
The idea is that it's in the wrist and keep
moving in a sweeping pattern. Always starting

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:51.080
off the plate and ending off the plate. So
it's just a motion like this. And you keep

00:00:51.080 --> 00:01:04.509
turning the plate as you need to.

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:10.550
Now we're using a pretty, already saturated
tarleton. You can see ink is getting on there.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.540
So what you want to do is just move around
to a cleaner part. Now we're going to pull

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:28.380
off a little more ink. And this first waves
is going to get some of the excess ink off.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.150
Get the ink down in the crevices, move it
around. You already start to see the image

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.979
coming through there. Now we've gotten to
about that point we want to switch to a less

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.780
saturated tarleton. We slowly get cleaner
and cleaner with the tarletons. This one's

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.689
ready to go. And you can see it's pulling
off more ink and we're getting more of the

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.000
image showing through there. And again, just
keep turning around and make sure you're starting

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.310
off the plate and ending off the plate. If
you stop on the plate you actually will leave

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:29.400
ink on there. And you actually see some of
the pattern of the tarleton. Now we go even

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:47.121
cleaner. This one isn't brand new but it's
clean enough to do what we need it do. And

00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:52.219
if you need to concentrate in certain areas
you want to kind of pick up the tarleton.

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:58.689
You can hit it with your hand if you want.
But just keep it moving.
