Hi my name is Tubby. I live here in this wonderful library

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and I love to eat books. I live here with my friends Gumbo and Freckles.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Over there, On that great book is Holy.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
She is really old and wise and tells us wonderful stories, when she is awake that is.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We just learned this awesome new song. Come Guy's let's sing.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Hello Holy! It's so nice to see you awake. Now please, please, Tell us another story from the Bible. Please!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Of course! I will. But you have to promise you will listen to the story very carefully

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And answer my Question at the end. Yes Yes we promise. A Long time ago

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Jerusalem had got destroyed overtime because of many wars

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Nehamaya a Jewish exile in Babylon decided that he wanted to rebuild Jerusalem.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
He was finally able to finish building the wall of Jerusalem by the seventh month since then.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The people on Israel were all settled in their towns. On the first day of that month

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
All of them gathered in the square inside the water gate. They asked Esra

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The priest to bring the book of the law. Esra stood on the platform

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And opened the book. All the people stood up to praise the lord.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And they bowed down to the ground in worship. Esra read out the law

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:21.000
To the people From early morning until Noon. They listened carefully Esra put the word of the law

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Into their own language and explained it to the people. On the 24th day of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The same month the people of Israel again met together. They fasted the entire day

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
To show sorrow for their sins. They prayed to god and asked for forgiveness

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
for their sins. The promise that the people made to god was we the people of Israel

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Made this promise to God in writing. Our leaders put their seal to it. We know

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
How we suffered in the past because we disobeyed God. We have now

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Decided to separate ourself from those Who do not worship the Lord

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
According to the law of Moses. We will live by this law and obey all that

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Our God has told us. If we do not Obey God  He may punish us.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.640
So children,  Now Answer My Question. What was the name of the priest  who read out

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.960
law out to the people of Israel? I remember his name was Esra.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:40.320
Very good Come on Freckels, Come Gumbo let us finish our song. Bye Holy! See you children
