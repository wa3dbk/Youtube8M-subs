00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.750
What's up guys it's Justin TheGCDoc and Mr.
Cullen!

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.930
We're actually out doing some geocache maintenance.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.270
As a geocache owner a big responsibility is
to make sure all the caches are up to snuff,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.270
and have fresh log books and are where their
suppose to be.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.930
So I wanted to do a quick video on what it's
like to be a cache owner and give you some

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.140
tips and insights on responsibilities and
what you need to do to be a good geocache

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.140
owner.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.559
Don't click away as that's coming up next.

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:49.559
A great question I get asked often is, "How
much maintenance to expect when you're a geocache

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.710
owner."

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.079
That all depends obviously, but plan on doing
maintenance seasonally especially if you live

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.899
in an area in the country or the world that
has a lot of drastic seasons as that's going

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.421
to change things a lot.

00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:12.380
I do maintenance quarterly, things like repairing
containers, replacing containers, changing

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.939
out logs, keeping things dry and putting new
swag in.

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.400
Just to name some of the basics stuff.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.850
You never know what to expect when you're
out doing geocache maintenance.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.159
A great example is this cache series that
I've had for just about 2 years I've been

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.150
out here doing lots of maintenance.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.189
In fact last year this whole area flooded.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.060
I thought now would be a good time to show
you some of that footage where I had to do

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:51.080
quite the overhaul of geocaches, and how Mother
Nature changes the environment and how it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.950
affects your geocaches.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.859
Well I'm out this morning doing some serious
cache maintenance.

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:08.370
In fact this trail that I'm walking on right
now was completely underwater.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.970
So in total somewhere between 9-10.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.440
Which is the unfortunate part about being
a cache owner, but that's just part of the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.230
game.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:31.621
When I was first placing these caches I was
thinking the river might get a little high,

00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:38.920
but the chances are the caches won't get washed
away as I was hiding them hundreds of feet

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.990
away from the river.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:48.150
A good lesson learned, if there is even the
slightest chance of flooding buy some paracord

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.460
and tie these things off onto anything you
can.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.540
Just in case there's that slight chance they
may get washed out like the majority of mine

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.560
did.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.170
Cullen and I made it to the cache location
of the one we have to replace and here we

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.410
are What I need to do is actually replace
the whole container as the original one as

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.410
gone.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:22.190
SPOILER WARNING for anyone who've not found
my Sleepy Hallow series, I'm going to be showing

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.200
you what it is.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:35.010
Originally this tree behind me was filled
with heads!

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.470
After the flooding I know they were mostly
intact, but the one that actually has the

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:50.050
geocache container is gone so I made a new
one.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:04:03.270
Creepy I know 
but what's actually in the bottom is the geocache

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.270
container.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:10.350
Rite-In-the-Rain log book these things are
water resistant basically waterproof.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.259
In case this place floods again at least the
log is going to be nice and dry.

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:22.390
I also have some toys to drop in and pencils
so let's get this back in order.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:40.690
Thanks for coming along with me today, hopefully
you've learned a little about geocache maintenance.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.790
Sometimes caches need little maintenance and
sometimes they need lots of maintenance and

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.200
this cache series is definitely has become
one of those.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.440
But it has lots of favorite points and a lot
of people enjoy it so that's all that matters

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.150
and that's why I keep doing the things that
I do.
