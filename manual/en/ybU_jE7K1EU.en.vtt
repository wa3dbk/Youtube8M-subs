00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.920
Colored steam sticky rice and grilled pork

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.960
Ta Van has stunning landscape.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.420
My legs already feel heavy and tired

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.660
after a long walk.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.300
I’m hungry now.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.300
I need something to fill my belly.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.760
Hello!

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.760
Please show me the way to

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.780
a local restaurant or something else!

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.440
This way.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.260
I got it. Thanks.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.400
Hello! What are your specialties?

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.180
Colored steam sticky rice and grilled pork.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.020
Colored steam sticky rice?

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.320
Why is it called so?

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.320
Sticky rice is soaked in water

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.960
with a kind of leaf giving purple color

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.420
before being steamed.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.520
I see.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.260
What can go with steamed sticky rice?

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.960
With toasted sesame and peanut salt,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.340
or grilled pork.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.020
Grilled pork?

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.520
So appetizing!

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.000
This is a perfect dish for winter.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I’m very hungry now.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.500
A portion, please!

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.240
I’ll sit over there. Thanks.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.080
Two dishes with many colors,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.480
it’s enough to overwhelm me.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.260
They look eye-catching and appetizing.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
This is the perfect blend between

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.920
the nutty flavor of steamed sticky rice

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.660
and the greasiness of grilled pork.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.720
This is a one-of-a-kind combination.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.240
The locals use special spices

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.860
to make such tasty dishes.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.240
This is their secret, I think so.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.860
Having these two dishes

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.860
on such a chilly day in Sa Pa,

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.940
I feel as if I were on a beach in Da Nang.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.000
Let’s continue!
