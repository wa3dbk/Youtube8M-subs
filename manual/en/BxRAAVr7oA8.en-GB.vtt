00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.240
In our practices we use high definition

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.580
Optical Coherence Tomography (or OCT) Scanning

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.540
to obtain images of the structures of the eye

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.580
which previously we were unable to see by conventional means.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.620
The OCT is non-invasive and does not usually require dilating drops.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.200
From the patient's point of view all that is required

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.355
is to keep their eye still while looking at a fixation light inside the machine.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.520
The OCT can image the deeper layers of the retina beneath the surface

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.495
where the early stages of macular degeneration and disease start.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.320
The earlier the disease is detected, the sooner it can be treated 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.120
and the better the visual outcome.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.860
This OCT scan of a normal retina 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.540
clearly shows all the layers to be healthy.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.360
In this image, the jelly or vitreous in front of the retina

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.840
is pulling away from it, apart from at the central macular region.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.780
This is called vitreomacular adhesion.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.480
In these next two OCT scans, the vitreous has moved foward further still

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.760
taking part of the retina with it.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.694
This is called a macular hole and results in very poor vision.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.820
It is possible to treat vitreomacular traction surgically, to prevent macular hole formation.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.800
This 3D scan shows a blister of intraretinal fluid, that has occured following cataract surgury.

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:38.355
The location of the fluid is shown clearly on the 2D OCT section.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.040
We treated this condition with steroid eye drops, until a normal retinal profile returned.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.760
This patient, shown in the next two images has developed a epiretinal membrane on the retinal surface.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.340
As the membrane contracts, it causes distortion and cysts of fluid to form.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.120
This requires urgent surgical intervention.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.520
In wet macular degeneration, unwanted blood vessels grow into the retina, from the deeper choroidal layers.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.400
These unwanted blood vessels can hemorrhage and leak fluid into the retina.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.680
This can result in massive visual loss if left untreated.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.280
The watery fluid inside the eye drains away at a point 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.860
where the front of the eye or cornea, meets the iris or coloured part.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.880
If the gap between these two structures gets too narrow, acute Glaucoma results.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.820
If spotted early, simple laser treatment can prevent the disease.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.020
In Glaucoma, the transparent nerve fibers that take the visual signal to the brain atrophy away.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.380
The OCT scan can visualize the thickness of this transparent nerve fiber layer

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.260
and so atrophy can be detected early.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.540
Glaucoma caught in the early stages can usually be treated by taking a suitable eye drop 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.900
to lower the pressure in the eye and prevent further damage to the optic nerve.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.160
We believe that all patients over 60 years of age and those in high risk groups

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.200
should have an OCT scan regularly - at least every two years.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.280
Thank you for watching our video on OCT scanning

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.360
a technology that has revolutionized the diagnosis and the treatment of many eye diseases.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.432
