The king of cakes...
ChoppA for the win!

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.440
G'day guys, welcome back to CakesByChoppA, Today we have the Olaf Spa for you. You loved the first Olaf cake i did so

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.590
I was inspired to do another one, start by
leveling off your cake.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.800
and you gonna place some frosting down on
your serving platter

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.080
place a cake on top of that, Fill it and
then go around giving it a generous coat

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.859
with the frosting

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.300
I've tinted it  light blue because
I want it to look like water in the spa. 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.579
 now with the Kit Kats that go around the edge...

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:39.089
I got a fork and scored them along the
back to make them look like a woodgrain

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.829
Once that's done set it aside and stop
making Olaf

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.789
I used gum paste here where I made a large ball, a medium ball and a small ball.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.319
the small is  his coffee
cup so I made that into a cylinder and

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:54.800
put a little dip in the top.  

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.039
And then I used another large ball 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.100
the same size as the bottom to shape
his head

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.199
I roll that into a pear shape and then
cut

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.690
in his mouth and lifted his lip and
manipulated that around

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.450
for the bottom of his body I cut the
bottom to make you sit flat

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.520
and then place them on the skewers, his
mouth need to be reworked

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.120
 I think this is just because it was
gumpaste... this is the first time I've

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.230
used gum paste

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.030
it was a bit of a trial and error for me
I noticed as I kept working with his

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.870
head, his lip kept going back into place

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.350
So i just had to keep  manipulating that out. 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.500
I used a piece of  orange starburst taffy

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.040
for the carrot nose and two round balls  for
the eyes

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.120
and then just paint on the details... with
the eyes you just do a

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.680
Eyelid in blue and then a black dot and
some eyebrows

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.260
for his hair used a fine strip of 
licorice which I just cut with scissors

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.210
and then gave it three prongs. 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.510
for his arms I used cut off pieces of  
a pretzel

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.120
and just stuck them  into the torso.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.940
then applied the coffee cup to his hand, Once I had done that I stuck them on to a skewer 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.540
and then used a sculpting tool to
seal  off the edges around his arms

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.799
and make sure he was all sealed up to
the head...  place on the bottom part of his body

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.659
and then you are ready to fill the top of your cake 
with more frosting

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.230
I left this step until now   because I
didn't want the frosting to set

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.870
before I stuck Olaf in

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.639
once you've got it in, push him down
placehim in where you need him

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:32.150
and then build his little buddy which is
just a round circle

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.099
same carrot nose that you just roll out of orange taffy

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.799
Or fondant. and then paint on his eyes then place him in next to olaf

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:42.420
 to seal off the  barrel 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.639
that they are having a spa in, I used the strip of licorice with some  melted chocolate

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.709
and placed around the edge and held
until it had set, (which only takes a minute)

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.230
and there you have my Olaf Kit-Kat Cake!
