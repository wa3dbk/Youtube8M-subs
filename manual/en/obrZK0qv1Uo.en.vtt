00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.540

I believe collage browsing is the best
way explore tumblr photo blogs

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:17.259
once you have the extension installed
simply click on the collage icon

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.490
this icon is active on any Tumblr blog

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.410
it even appears on blogs with the custom
address

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.470
once clicked it will open a new tab that 
instantly displays all photographs for

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.029
the blog

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.570
to see more simply scroll down

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.330
there are no buttons to click

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.990
simple

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.140
to enlarge a photograph simply click on it

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.230
open the post directly by control click
or command click if you're on a mac

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.390

posts or photo sets by using the arrow

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.460
keys

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.530
in the back and four buttons work as
expected

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.440
the image size can be changed and
you'll find some presets sizes under the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.290
options page

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.799
and yes you can bookmark any collage for
later browsing

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.470
we've added better integration with your
own Tumblr account in the latest release

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.120
a request a feature is the ability to
browse your own dashboard in collage mode

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.250
this is now possible

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.650

and click on the collage icon

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.860
you'll need to link extension with your Tumblr account before you can do this

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.130
linking is done under the options page

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.140
