00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.300
Hi YouTube, Darth Here:
This is Against the Grain, a series where

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.049
I try out strategies and tactics that I normally
just don't use, and I see what I can learn.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.090
In previous episodes, I tried nothing but
knives, all magnums, and punching straight

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.710
up the gut in Operation Lockers.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.080
Today, I'm going to talk about my experiences
when using smokescreen on armored vehicles.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.860
Ever since the release of Battlefield 4, after
I had unlocked active protection I used nothing

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.300
else on my vehicles.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.840
It's pretty easy to use: you anticipate damage
or start taking damage, and ta-da: you stop

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.550
taking projectile damage for roughly five
seconds.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.050
Now there are some bugs in active protection,
but that's generally how it works.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.360
But with smokescreen, I unlocked it, and maybe
tried it for a few rounds and promptly moved

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.720
on to active protection.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.460
It never seemed to provide a tangible benefit
that I could see, and it just didn't sound

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.630
all that appealing.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.340
Until an episode of Over Your Shoulder a few
weeks ago, I really hadn't seriously considered

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.860
smokescreen an option.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.190
I was shocked that a top tanker was even using
it.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.200
I think it's partly because smoke's benefits
are not really conveyed by the in-game description,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.270
and are also hard to quantify.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.989
Here are some key bits of information about
smokescreen: when you use it you drop off

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.140
the minimap and cannot be spotted for six
seconds.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.230
You do not have to stay in the smoke for this
effect to work, and even if your secondary

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.550
gunner is firing, you're still invisible on
the minimap.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.960
Secondly-and this is not well conveyed by
the text-you take the minimum amount of damage

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.920
from projectiles while you're inside the smokescreen.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.960
The in-game text refers to critically damaging
hits from missiles, which is exceptionally

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.140
misleading.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.610
So I'll get back to those key distinctions
later, but I want to talk more about my specific

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.430
experiences with smokescreen, and what I learned
as a result of using it.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.680
When I first equipped smokescreen, I nearly
abandoned it immediately.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.159
It's definitely not active protection, and
it will not save you from circumstances where

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.690
active protection might otherwise.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.560
I ended up dying pretty frequently because
I needed to understand that smokescreen is

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.210
more about damage reduction and avoidance
than damage prevention.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.159
So I started using it in a much more active
manner.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.810
Rather than waiting for a fight to begin,
I'd pop the smoke if I knew I was sneaking

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.130
up on an armored target.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.840
Because smokescreen has as recharge time of
only twelve seconds, it'd be back up by the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.100
time I engaged my target.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.590
And this is a key distinction between active
protection and smokescreen.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.680
Smokescreen is up for six seconds, which is
nearly half of its recharge time of twelve

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.680
seconds.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.079
Active protection is up for five seconds,
and then has to recharge for a full twenty-five

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.489
seconds before it can be activated again.

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.250
So smokescreen can be almost constantly up,
whereas active protection is almost always

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.250
down.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.430
I did notice one exceptional disadvantage
of running smokescreen in any situation, though,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.939
and that was against air power.

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.239
Unless I was able to break locks, it was a
guaranteed sixty damage any time a jet locked

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.879
onto me with guided missiles.

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.040
If there were two jets attacking me simultaneously,
or if I were in hardcore, this was usually

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.040
fatal.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.840
And unlike regular projectiles, guided projectiles
will always do full damage to tanks in smokescreen.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.439
This is because their minimum damage is also
their maximum damage, so smokescreen does

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.139
not reduce this damage.

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:49.440
So you take full damage from smart projectiles
like the Javelin, TV-guided missiles, the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.840
UCAV, and Staff shells.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.000
Contrary to belief, smokescreen does not break
locks from these guided weapons.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.719
But the big advantage of smokescreen is its
ability to conceal your movements from enemies.

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.889
You hide yourself from spotting and the minimap
for a good length of time.

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.099
Though it's hard to quantify how effective
smokescreen was when I was trying to sneak

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.099
up on my enemy.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.139
It's entirely possible that they were just
oblivious.

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.139
However, it did feel like I had a good advantage
in sneaking around undetected in certain engagements.

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.709
What I can quantify is just how much less
damage I would take during firefights with

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.169
smokescreen active.

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.469
Enemies would often miss shots, and the ones
that they landed would always do the minimum

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.340
amount of damage for that projectile.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.169
As a quick note, if you're unfamiliar with
projectiles (that's unguided rockets and tank

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:31.260
shells), they do more damage the closer you
get to a 90 degree angle shot on a side of

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.260
an armored vehicle.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.499
The further away you get from that 90 degrees,
the less per shot each projectile does until

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:38.349
it reaches a minimum value.

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.449
Anyways, another benefit smokescreen provided
was that I felt more comfortable removing

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:46.290
reactive armor from my tank, and replacing
it with the autoloader.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.959
Reactive armor increases the amount of damage
that must be done to get a disable on your

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:50.959
vehicle.

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.760
When you're in a tank, and inside a smokescreen,
the damage done by projectiles is always is

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.920
less than that crtical damage requirement.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.430
So in a tank, switching to autoloader is a
good choice when you have smokescreen to back

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.430
it up.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.499
When autoloader is combined with the canister
shell, it's an absolutely amazing combination

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.150
that will let you just completely shred infantry.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.639
I was really negative on canister shell before
because of the long reload time, but with

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.779
an autoloader it's a whole new game.

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.569
But I'll do a video all about canister shell
another day.

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:19.329
So let's look at some numbers here.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.419
Smokescreen is not going to defeat active
protection in a head-to-head battle unless

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.050
you're both facing each other's ass-end.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.409
In a head-to-head battle, two tanks firing
HE shells with autoloaders will destroy each

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.870
other in four shots in about nine seconds.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.900
If two of those shots are absorbed by APS,
smokescreen only reduces the damage to 25

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.810
from 29, and it's still four shots to kill.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.820
So the smokescreen tank is dead, and the active
protection tank is at half health.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.340
Where smokescreen makes a huge difference
in tank battles is for the tank pilot who

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.000
uses the smoke to maneuver and pillar.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.440
Reducing and avoiding damage is also critical
if you have an engineer repairing.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.000
If both attacking tanks have engineers repairing,
this becomes a long fight.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.110
The longer the fight drags on, the more effective
smokescreen becomes because of active protection's

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.250
long cooldown.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.080
Time is smokescreen's friend, as it also increases
the likelihood of missed shots.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.569
But it's really that hard-to-measure benefit
of staying off the minimap that really makes

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:10.659
smokescreen shine.

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.379
You can completely outmaneuver your enemies
and take them from a highly damaging angle.

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.170
If your enemy can't see you on the minimap,
and can't see you because of the smokescreen,

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.050
it becomes exceptionally hard for them to
land shots on you.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.940
And the projectiles that do hit you are reduced
to minimum damage.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.810
So, after trying out smokescreen for a few
weeks, I have to say that I really like it

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.240
on tanks in particular.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.740
With smokescreen on infantry fighting vehicles,
you still need to keep your reactive armor

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.409
on to reduce the odds of receiving critical
hits, as those will be fatal.

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.691
If you don't have lock-on weapons to worry
about from the ground or air, and you can

00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:42.300
outmaneuver your enemy, it's a really effective
choice.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.069
If you're newer to tanks, I probably wouldn't
recommend it until you're comfortable in your

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:47.460
suit of armor.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.630
Smokescreen is a great way to fool and surprise
your enemies who are reliant on the minimap,

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:51.870
much like a silencer.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.229
It's also a great tool for long-term damage
reduction and avoidance.

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.370
But keep in mind that it won't save you from
huge spikes in damage like active protection

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.620
will, so you have to play carefully.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.270
That's it for this episode of Against the
Grain.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.460
If you have an idea for a strategy or tactic
that is maybe a bit out of the normal playstyle,
