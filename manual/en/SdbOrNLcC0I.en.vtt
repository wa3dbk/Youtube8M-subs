00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.776
(piano playing)

00:00:04.776 --> 00:00:08.780
Steven: We're looking at one of the single canvases from a series of canvases

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.167
of the Campbell Soup Cans by Andy Warhol from 1962

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:13.786
at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:13.786 --> 00:00:16.721
And one of the really important questions that comes up about,

00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:21.058
especially modern art, is well, why is this art?

00:00:21.058 --> 00:00:24.963
Sal: When you ask me that a bunch of things kind of surface in my brain.

00:00:24.963 --> 00:00:28.365
It does evoke something in me so I'm inclined to say yes,

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:30.418
but then there's a bunch of other things that say well,

00:00:30.418 --> 00:00:32.750
if I didn't see this in a museum and if I just saw this

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.168
in the marketing department of Campbell's Soup,

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:37.074
would you be viewing it differently?

00:00:37.074 --> 00:00:38.976
Steven: Because it's advertising then.
Sal: Yes.

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:41.418
Steven: But in the context of the museum or in the context

00:00:41.418 --> 00:00:44.881
of Andy Warhol's studio, it's not quite advertising, right?

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:47.552
Sal: Even if it's the exact same thing.
Steven: Yeah.

00:00:47.552 --> 00:00:50.335
Sal: And the idea here is by putting it in the museum

00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:52.290
it's saying look at this in a different way.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.752
Steven: Well that's right, it really does relocate it,

00:00:54.752 --> 00:00:57.835
it does change the meaning, it does transform it,

00:00:57.835 --> 00:01:00.399
and that's really one of the central ideas of modern art

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.133
is that you can take something that's not necessarily based

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.870
in technical skill, because I don't think you would say

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.085
that this is beautifully rendered.
Sal: Right.

00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:11.419
Steven: But it relocates it and makes us think about it in a different way.

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:14.611
Sal: And so, I guess he would get credit for taking something

00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:19.116
that was very, almost mundane, something you see in everyone's cupboard,

00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:23.620
and making it a focal point like you should pay attention to this thing.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.690
Steven: I think that's exactly right and I think that he's doing it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.028
about a subject that was about as low a subject as one could go.

00:01:31.028 --> 00:01:34.365
I mean cheap advertising art was something that was so far away

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:38.870
from fine art from the great masters and then to focus on something

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.309
as lowly as a can of soup, and cream of chicken no less, right? (laughs)

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:47.893
Sal: A lot of it is, if he did it 50 years earlier,

00:01:47.893 --> 00:01:49.780
people would have thought this guy's a quack

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.613
and if he did it now they'd think he was just derivative and...

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:57.411
It was really just that time where people happened to think this was art.

00:01:57.411 --> 00:01:59.021
Steven: I think that that's right.

00:01:59.021 --> 00:02:02.161
In 1962, what Warhol is doing is he's saying

00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:06.661
what is it about our culture that is really authentic and important?

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:09.494
And it was about mass production, it was about factories.

00:02:09.494 --> 00:02:13.079
He in a sense said let's not be looking at nature

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.949
as if we were still an agrarian culture, we're now an industrial culture.

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:19.866
What is the stuff of our visual world now?

00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:21.434
Sal: I think I'm 80 percent there.

00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:24.899
I remember in college there was a student run art exhibit

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:28.675
and as a prank a student actually put a little podium there

00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:30.482
and put his lunch tray.

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:33.380
He put a little placard next to it, you know, lunch tray on Saturday

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.948
or something is what he called it.

00:02:34.948 --> 00:02:37.065
So he did it as a prank and everyone thought it was really funny

00:02:37.065 --> 00:02:40.553
but to some degree it's kind of a sign that maybe what he did was art.

00:02:40.553 --> 00:02:42.232
Steven: Well I think that's why it was funny

00:02:42.232 --> 00:02:43.493
because it was so close, right?

00:02:43.493 --> 00:02:45.635
Sal: And to some degree when someone took a lunch tray

00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:49.037
and gave it the proper lighting and gave it a podium to look at it

00:02:49.037 --> 00:02:51.743
and wrote a whole description about it, I did view the lunch tray

00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:52.872
in a different way.

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:54.374
That's kind of the same idea, that something

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:56.709
that's such a mundane thing but you use it everyday.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.779
I mean, what would you say to that?

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:00.492
Was that a prank or was that art?

00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:02.171
Steven: I think it is a prank but it's also very close

00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:04.884
to some important art that had been made earlier in the century.

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:08.222
He had license to do that because of somebody named Marcel Duchamp.

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:11.692
In fact, Warhol had in a sense the same kind of license

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:15.743
to not focus on the making of something, not focus on the brushwork,

00:03:15.743 --> 00:03:18.565
not focus on the composition, not focus on the color,

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.825
but focus on the refocusing of ideas.

00:03:21.825 --> 00:03:25.410
Sal: And the reason why we talk about Warhol or Duchamp

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.707
or any of these people is that, as you said,

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.642
it's not that they did something technically profound.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:32.243
Obviously Campbell Soup's marketing department had already done

00:03:32.243 --> 00:03:37.450
something as equally as profound, it's more that they were the people

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.161
who looked at the world in a slightly different way and highlighted that.

00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:42.493
Steven: Well I think that that's right.

00:03:42.493 --> 00:03:46.659
Warhol is also very consciously working towards

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.695
asking the same questions that the prankster at your school was asking.

00:03:49.695 --> 00:03:52.599
He's saying can this be art?

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.201
And in fact he's really pushing it.

00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:55.909
Look at the painting closely for a moment.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.513
This is one of the last paintings that he's actually painted.

00:03:58.513 --> 00:04:01.846
He's really defined the calligraphy of this Campbell's,

00:04:01.846 --> 00:04:05.743
he's really sort of rendered the reflection of the tin at the top.

00:04:05.743 --> 00:04:08.832
But then he stopped and he said, I don't want to paint the fleur de lis.

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:11.541
You see those little fleur de lis down at the bottom.

00:04:11.541 --> 00:04:12.809
I don't want to paint those.

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:14.545
So he actually had a little rubber stamp made of them

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:17.666
and actually sort of placed them down mechanically.

00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:19.551
What does that mean for an artist then,

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.625
to say I don't even want to bother to paint these?

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:24.813
I'm just going to find a mechanical process to make this easier.

00:04:24.813 --> 00:04:26.863
Warhol is doing something I think which is important

00:04:26.863 --> 00:04:29.433
which is reflecting the way that we manufacture,

00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:31.731
the way that we construct our world.

00:04:31.731 --> 00:04:35.338
Think about the things that we surround ourselves with,

00:04:35.338 --> 00:04:37.776
almost everything was made in a factory.

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:40.211
Almost nothing is singular in the world anymore.

00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:43.230
It's not a world that we would normally find beautiful.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.564
Sal: I don't know, sometimes I feel and correct me if I'm wrong,

00:04:45.564 --> 00:04:49.585
that a decision was made that Warhol was interesting or great

00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:53.958
and then people will interpret his stuff to justify his greatness.

00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:58.262
That oh look, he used a printer instead of drawing it

00:04:58.262 --> 00:05:01.847
which shows that he was reflecting the industrial or whatever,

00:05:01.847 --> 00:05:04.265
but if he had done it the other way, if he had hand drawn it

00:05:04.265 --> 00:05:08.003
or hand drawn it with his elbow you know, or finger painted it or something

00:05:08.003 --> 00:05:10.220
people would say oh isn't this tremendous because we normally

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.001
would see this thing printed by a machine and now he did it with his hands.

00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:16.557
How much do you think that is the case or am I just being cynical?

00:05:16.557 --> 00:05:20.725
Steven: Well no, I think that there's value in a certain degree of cynicism

00:05:20.725 --> 00:05:24.515
and I think that in some ways what we're really talking about here

00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:26.559
is what does it mean to be an avant-garde artist?

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.307
What does it mean to sort of change the language of art

00:05:29.307 --> 00:05:33.888
and to try to find ways that art relates to our historical moment

00:05:33.888 --> 00:05:36.292
in some really direct and authentic way?

00:05:36.292 --> 00:05:38.427
Sal: And maybe it's easy for me to say this because

00:05:38.427 --> 00:05:43.057
I remember looking at this when I took 5th grade art class,

00:05:43.057 --> 00:05:47.893
Andy Warhol and all of that, so now it seems almost not that unique

00:05:47.893 --> 00:05:51.105
but in '62 what I'm hearing is that Warhol was really noteworthy

00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:53.393
because he really did push people's thinking.

00:05:53.393 --> 00:05:58.114
Steven: I think that Warhol was looking for, in 1962, a kind of subject matter

00:05:58.114 --> 00:06:02.552
that was completely outside of the scope of that we could consider fine art.

00:06:02.552 --> 00:06:04.484
One of his contemporaries, Roy Lichtenstein,

00:06:04.484 --> 00:06:06.544
was asked what pop art was and he said,

00:06:06.544 --> 00:06:10.092
"Well we were looking for subject matter that was so despicable,

00:06:10.092 --> 00:06:14.097
"that was so low, that nobody could possibly believe that it was really art."

00:06:14.097 --> 00:06:16.124
And I think you're right, I think now we look at it

00:06:16.124 --> 00:06:20.248
and it's so much a part of our visual culture that we immediately accept it.

00:06:20.248 --> 00:06:22.950
But I think that it's really interesting to retrieve

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.617
just how shocking and radical that was.

00:06:25.617 --> 00:06:26.868
Sal: This is fascinating.

00:06:26.868 --> 00:06:29.311
It seems like there's a lot of potential there,

00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:32.363
that stuff that's pseudo-art made for other purposes,

00:06:32.363 --> 00:06:35.822
for commercial purposes but if you kind of shine a light on it,

00:06:35.822 --> 00:06:39.430
in the way that a light has been shone on this, that it does...

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.181
In your mind would that cross the barrier into being art?

00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:45.371
Steven: Well I think that, you mentioned before,

00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:48.430
that if somebody was doing this now it would feel really derivative.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.740
And I think that that's right.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.380
I think it underscores just how hard it is to find in our culture now,

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.316
ways of making us see the world in new ways.

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:59.015
Sal: Fascinating.

00:06:59.015 --> 00:07:06.230
