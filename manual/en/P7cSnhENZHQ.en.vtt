00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.410
A typical day is never really a typical day
here and that’s what I like about working

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.240
for Rumpke.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.380
Our mechanics are very skilled in keeping
trucks running.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.160
The industry standard is 7 years on an average
garbage truck.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.220
Our fleet generally last 10 years.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.590
These trucks now everything is electronic
controlled, they would last about a month

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.050
without us maintaining them.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.970
Now you have a have a computer to hook up
to these to diagnose them, so it’s more

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.730
than just changing parts.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.830
We have a large variety of people working
in the garage, from college educated to a

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.409
high school education, and a lot of the skills
are learned on the job.

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:40.839
When I started at Rumpke, I pretty much felt
lost, but it was easy to see that I had a

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.059
support group, and the shop foremen pretty
well took me in, and they taught what I needed

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.209
to know to be able to work on these trash
trucks.

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:53.609
Some of the bad parts about working on garbage
trucks: sometimes what everybody throws away

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.990
isn’t the nicest thing in the world and
we have to deal with it.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.920
I’ve seen pretty much everything around
here that you could think of that could be

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.870
thrown in the trash, some things that shouldn’t
be thrown in the trash.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.591
The extreme weather conditions that you have
to endure, how dirty the trucks are, everything

00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:10.760
on them is heavy, but it is rewarding because
in the end you fix something that a lot of

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.920
people don’t know how to fix.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.320
I really enjoy the ability and the challenge
to grow here.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.820
Rumpke is always looking to the new things
with these trucks.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.229
They’re getting the latest and greatest
technologies with the new regen systems or

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.869
with the new compressed natural gas trucks.

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.160
Being a diesel technician is a good career
to pursue because it’s in large demand and

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.329
it’s something that can’t be outsourced.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.140
But it’s also a job that forces you to implement
your knowledge and skills in order to be successful.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.490
At the end of the week, you feel the sense
of accomplishment knowing that the garbage was picked

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.930
up, the trucks were running, everybody got
back in safe, and everybody got along and

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.040
we accomplished a job that we have to do,
so that we can make a paycheck and go home

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.310
and have a good weekend.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.130
So if you’re looking for career, a decent
mechanic is a great opportunity.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.710
Everything is continually growing and continually
advancing.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.920
There’s so much room for growth.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.799
As a mechanic, not just to turn a wrench,
but to be able to further yourself and your

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.720
knowledge, and come in with a good attitude
and willing to work, that’s what it takes.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.010
So if you decide that this opportunity is
good for you, I want to welcome you to the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.310
Rumpke family.
