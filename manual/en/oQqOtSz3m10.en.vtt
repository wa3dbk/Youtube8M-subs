TERRY RICH: With me is Eric Shaffer,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.500
Iowa's newest millionaire. And Eric

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
just won a uh..... (laughs, clapping)

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.500
[music]

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.500
ERIC SHAFFER: I usually go to the front

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500
porch to get the Gazette and read the

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.500
paper with my breakfast and check my 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.500
numbers and then throw the paper away.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.500
And I just noticed that the numbers

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500
looked pretty familiar this morning. So I

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.500
threw the paper away and I was going to check

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.500
the numbers later, maybe thinking I matched

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.500
two or three or maybe four. And before

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.500
I went to work I decided to just look 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.500
at my tickets to make sure and all five hit!

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.500
[music]

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500
ERIC: I thought I had won $400,000. I went to 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.500
the store where I always play the lotto and

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.500
where I always pick up a USA today and a soda

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.500
and she was actually on the phone with the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500
lotto commission. And they said they sold

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.500
the $1 million winner and I'm in line

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.500
going, "No, I won $400,000." So I didn't

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500
think they sold two tickets at the same

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500
store so then I just inquired, you know, "Did 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.500
you sell a million dollars?" She goes, "Yeah!"

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.500
So I handed her my ticket, she checked it,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.500
she goes, "No, you won $1 million!"

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500
TERRY: What was your feeling at that point?

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.500
ERIC: I was happier!

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.500
[music]

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.500
ERIC: My wife called the school and wanted them

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.500
to announce over the intercom that Derek and 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.500
Kara's dad won a million dollars.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
[music]

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.500
ERIC: I actually got a call from one of my

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.500
secretaries asking why I wasn't at work. 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.500
It was about 8:15 and she said, "You 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.500
weren't slated to be out on the road today."

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
And I go, "Yeah, I'm taking the day

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.500
off. I have to go to Des Moines." I did tell

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.500
her. Yeah. Now my phone hasn't stopped ringing.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.500
ERIC: Half of it's going to retirement for sure.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.500
Kids' college, pay off my house, that kind of 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.500
stuff. The usual. Wife needs a new car.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.500
[music]

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500
TERRY: Our newest millionaire from the 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.500
state of Iowa, Eric Shaffer. Congratulations!
