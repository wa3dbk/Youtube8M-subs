Custom made saddle review by Bruce Cheaney saddle maker

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.680
Buster Welch Ranch Saddle for Trail Riding Saddle

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.389
This is one of my  finished saddles right here 100% handmade

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.920
I have done tutorials on leathercraft as well as tooling and carving leather

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.970
Tooling and carving leather

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.830
This is a custom made saddle I just finished

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.130
Here is a view of some of the hand tooling I did by hand

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.099
Front side view of the custom saddle

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.010
Hand carved oak leaves and acorns

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.290
The swell was tooled after the swell was covered and allowed to dry and then I re-wet the swell so I could lay out the design and then carve it into the leather

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.640
The swell was put onto the saddle

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.020
The swell was put on without a seam 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.430
It takes extra time and effort to put a swell cover on like this

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.039
Getting that swell cover stretched on there

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.410
one piece with a splitting it there's
picture of the horn cap right there

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.050
This is a view of the rear housing of the custom made saddle

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.399
The cantle of the ranch saddle

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.479
The owners three initials carved onto the cantle

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.990
Carved into the center of the cantle with the Cheyenne  roll

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.549
I put some decorative cut marks within the hand carved initials 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.049
On the initials I didn't dye the initials I just kinda like to leave it then natural

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:19.780
That way

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.939
Then when the custom made saddle was finished I made a pair of custom saddle bags to fit the saddle

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.799
Custom saddlebags 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.360
A whole side of Hermann Oak Leather saddle skirting
pretty much

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.200
Then I carved and tooled the saddle bags to match the saddle

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.299
And used some vintage leather tools to put some set stamp designs on that bottom piece of the saddle bags

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.460
The X is actually the owners brand which means the Cross Cannon Ranch

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.500
Cross Cannon Brand

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.640
That's the name of the man's ranch

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.170
There's another shot of the saddlebag

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.200
Makers Mark Bruce Cheaney Custom Saddles Gainesville Texas

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.869
I had to hand sew

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.719
Hand sewing involved..
I hand sewed the patch on the middle of the saddle bags

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.289
Handmade the owner a set of handmade coffee coaster representing the ranches brand

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.810
Coffee Coasters

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.080
Ranch brand and a back view of the custom made saddle

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.020
From across the shop

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.340
I usually clean up the saddle shop when I finish a saddle

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.980
After making a saddle like this I get tools, materials and supplies scattered all over the saddle shop

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.390
Here is the finished product a unique one of a kind custom made saddle by Bruce Cheaney

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.030

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.280
The saddle tree is rawhide covered and will last many years
