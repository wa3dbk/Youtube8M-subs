00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:08.250
Hey all you bloody little blighters, I'm Bill
Bower and this is what I think of the Tomb

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.820
Raider Reboot!

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:26.680
Ok, tell me if you've herd this story before.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.660
A young brilliant mind heads out on a dangerous
adventure, runs into lots of trouble, gets

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.929
caught in something larger than they are,
and has to fight, climb, shoot, swing, and

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.819
run more than humanly possible to kill the
bad guy, get out alive, and be an absolute

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:41.819
hero by the day's end.

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:48.819
Yeah, I guess it isn't an original story.

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.749
Truth be told Tomb raider actually doesn't
have that bad of a story, it just doesn't

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:54.239
go anywhere new.

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.030
The writers for this game don't stand a chance
at winning any awards though, and if they're

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.530
hoping to pen the next blockbuster film or
game, they're going to need a check-list of

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.399
bad tropes to avoid.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.880
One of the check boxes they've left glaringly
empty was not making the hero dumber than

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.900
the audience.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.053
I mean seriously, the enemies motives become
blatantly obvious no latter than 1/3 of the

00:01:13.053 --> 00:01:15.130
way through the game.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.270
Yet somehow Lara Croft a college educated,
adventuring, archaeologist can't figure out

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.710
what the island natives are after until the
story is nearly over.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.869
I mean for Christ's sake how hard is it to
connect the dots of supernatural events, stories

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.700
of an ancient Island witch, and crazed cultists
with a vested interest in you and your shipwrecked

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.700
friends?!

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.399
Honestly if Laura Croft is supposed to be
sharp I'd equate her to a ball-peen hammer.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.100
The other thing the writers have done a horrible
job of is managing their cast of characters.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.880
I mean when half a dozen people get shipwrecked
on a cursed island it's a given that some

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.289
of the survivors aren't going to make it.

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.299
Tomb Raider however, just kinda plays Russian
roulette with all the friendly faces.

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.590
You only see most of them for all of two minutes
and hear five words from, and just like that

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.590
they're offed.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.149
If you want to kill someone off fine, but
don't expect me to fucking care when I barely

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.149
saw them.

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.340
Honestly, emotional attachment and proper
pacing do not exist in this game.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.629
Which is why it's a real damn good that a
lot of the other things are done properly.

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.930
On the actual interactive side of Tomb Raider,
just about everything is designed properly,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.290
but not perfectly.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.790
The platforming mechanics are on target, and
most of the level design so easy to understand

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.970
that even blind man with no hands could still
get Lara from point A to point B.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.040
Truthfully jumping puzzles don't really exist
in this game you just leap, slide, shimmy,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.400
and edge with reckless abandon in the direction
you're pointed at.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.840
No real brain power is required when climbing,
unless you actually start raiding all the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.019
optional tombs on the island.

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.920
This is the most idiotic thing about the game,
it's called Tomb Raider, yet actually raiding

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.450
tombs is almost entirely optional.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.370
Make sense this does not, I know this game
is about how Lara becomes the tomb raider,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.900
but for god's sake how can she pick up that
title by not regularly desecrating any ancient

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.150
burial sites?!

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.870
No, instead she seems content to twiddle away
her hours trying desperately to get off the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.790
island she's on by slaughtering hordes of
it's inhabitants.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.580
Which brings up the combat.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.420
The gun play is about what you would expect
form this type of third person game.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.739
The only difference is instead of starting
with a hand gun you get a bow.

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.220
It's not exactly the most reliable weapon
though, but it is silent which can't be argued

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.360
with if you're looking to go the stealth route.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.410
Honestly though, with the abundance of ammo
in the game, and all the skill upgrades that

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.849
allow you to find and carry more ammo, there's
not much point in trying to play in stealth

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:47.849
mode.

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.939
Moreover Lara is a fucking bullet hog.

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.580
I don't know what that camisole she wears
is made out of, but it stops bullets like

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.049
bloody kevalr.

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.920
How the hell it works better than the iron
plates that some of the enemies wear I'll

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.920
never understand.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.219
On the note of what everyone is wearing that
brings me to another thing about Tomb Raider,

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:07.219
it's design.

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:13.209
The look, feel, and general design style of
tomb raider is what I should talk about now,

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.250
but balls to that.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.830
I know everyone wants to hear the out in and
out about Lara's defining features.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.750
Right off she's nowhere near as voluptuous
as she used to be, that extreme hourglass

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.200
figure is a thing of the past.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.820
Not exactly a bad thing, considering how Lara
used to be the epitome of an objectified female

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.820
character.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.980
That is to say big tits, huge ass, tiny waste,
and she kicked ass to boot.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.410
Basically a caricature of a woman that only
a bunch of horny thirteen year old boys would

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.200
masturbate to while hiding under the covers
at night.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.940
That isn't to say that pubescent little brats
won't be fantasising about the new Lara though.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.530
Oh no the character designers have made sure
that she still has an incredibly toned ass

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.390
that you get to see wiggle every time she
crouches through a passageway.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.700
Then there's her chest which struck me as
flat out weird.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.610
Despite being redesigned she still has quite
a lot of real-estate up there, which I would

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:15.290
imagine should get in the way while she's-
But for some reason everything stays locked

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.290
solid.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.570
I shouldn't complain though, if anything did
move it would only jiggle in a painfully fake

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.580
way, and do nothing but weird me out more,
piss off femnazis, and make the kids with

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.930
raging hormones fap that much faster.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.400
Now if you want to know about the rest of
the game's grapical design, I guess I could

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.400
say, It's good.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.570
I might even have some nice things to say
about the attention to detail with the japanese

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.570
architecture.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.180
But I dont' feel like being kind, so instead
I'll say that everyone who talked absloutly

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.000
salughtered every last Japanese word or name
they uttered!

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.760
Bitching about that may just be pissin in
the wind, but I fucking speak Japanese.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.850
Characters that are supposed to be traveled
and well educated butchering every last word

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.990
that's not english quickly breaks the illusion
of them being intelligent!

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.510
And now that I'm circling back onto why I
hate the characters and story, I think it's

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:12.180
about time I wrap this up.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.020
If you want me to tell ya weather or not to
play Tomb Raider I say go ahead give it shot,

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.680
espically if you've only got an Xbox.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.680
The reason?

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.060
PS3 owners have had access to their own relic
hunting, gun toting, ruin explorer ever since

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.750
the system launched.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.970
With Tomb Raider 360 and PC owners will finally
get to run, jump, shoot, and survive exotic

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.370
and cursed locals for the first time this
generation.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.090
Now if only it could have happened sooner,
cause sony fanboys have walked down this path

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.250
no less than three time in the last six years!

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.220
Tomb Raider late to the party?

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.770
MAYBE!
