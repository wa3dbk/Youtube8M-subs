00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:11.400
Hi I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com and
I'm going to be breaking down 2 rear upper

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.660
control arm options both from SR Performance,
I have with me their adjustable and non-adjustable

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.230
option, both fitting the 2005-2010 Mustang.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.119
SR Performance is a company that's been earning
the respect and attention of a lot of Mustang

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.330
enthusiasts lately, thanks to their budget
friendly yet high quality performance and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.180
suspension components for all generation Mustangs.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.780
IF you're not already watching this video
on AmericanMuscle.com and you'd like to get

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.660
back to our site, to read more about SR's
killer lineup, just click on the link below.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.809
The job of an upper control arm is to locate
the axle side to side and prevent any pinion

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.010
angle changes otherwise known as axle rap
or axle windup.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.780
The factory stuff utilizes some pretty soft
rubber bushings, which are notorious for flexing

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.109
or distorting on hard launches, and aggressive
cornering which can cause a bunch of wheel

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.120
hop, and inconsistent handling.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.989
If you want to learn more about making your
Mustang handle better and reducing your wheel

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.770
hop, well, then you have to subscribe to our
YouTube channel by clicking the link below.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.829
Here you can check out numerous suspension
overviews on all of our products, in addition

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.530
to some pretty cool suspension builds that
we've done to our own cars.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.890
Both of the options I've got on the table
should do an excellent job of dropping your

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.689
60ft times, and reducing wheel hop and axle
deflection, while increasing your rear end

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.009
group by using superior materials compared
to your factory control arms.

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.619
The non adjustables here feature a strong
TIG welded steel construction, along with

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.770
these polyurethane bushings which are greasable.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.080
Poly bushings will do a great job of reducing
any noise vibrations or harshness, that you

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.740
otherwise might find on the spherical bearings
found on the adjustable control arms here.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.530
In my opinion this is a great option for someone
who enjoys doing some spirited driving with

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.520
their Mustang, maybe just a few track days,
and just wants to replace those soft rubber

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.990
factory bushings in the control arm.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.179
The adjustable option from SR Performance
is for someone who is serious about their

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.740
track performance, and would ultimately like
to dial in their optimum pinion angle settings.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.840
For only a few bucks more compared to the
non-adjustables, you're getting full on car

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.270
adjustability, strong TIG welded steel construction,
and these spherical hind joints here, which

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.000
are going to take all the unwanted movement
out of your Mustang's rear end.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.819
Both options aren't terribly difficult to
install and should only take you a couple

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.640
of hours in the garage using some pretty basic
hand tools.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.780
Whenever you switch out your rear upper control
arms I recommend getting your pinion angle

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.750
checked out just to make sure everything's
within spec, especially if you decide to go

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.750
with the adjustables.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.989
An incorrect pinion angle can cause unwanted
traction, wear and tear on your pinion bearing

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.600
and drive train vibrations.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.819
If you're not quite sure which option would
be best for your application, you should get

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.360
in touch with one of our Mustang experts,
you can call them at 855-422-7439, or shoot

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.299
them an email at support@AmericanMuscle.com.

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.769
So if you're on the endless quest to make
your Mustang perform better on the street,

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.841
or at the track then you have to check out
a set of these adjustable or non adjustable

00:03:02.841 --> 00:03:06.189
control arms from SR Performance, right here
at AmericanMuscle.com.
