Gemma's Bigger Bolder Baking
Best-Ever Carrot Cake

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.420
Hi Bold Bakers! A great carrot cake recipe
is a must for every baker's repertoire and

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.160
that's what I'm going to show you today--the
best-ever carrot cake. So let's get baking!

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.369
A great carrot cake recipe is not something
you create yourself. It is something that

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.430
is shared with you or handed down to you.
Mine is from the amazing Avoca Handweavers

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.370
Cafe in County Wicklow in Ireland and it is
hands down the best recipe I've ever tried.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.510
We're going to start out in a stand mixer
but you can also mix this cake by hand. In

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.300
your bowl, add your eggs, flavorless oil,
sugar, and vanilla extract and whip all together

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.160
until nice and thick. You can still get this
result by hand, you just need a little bit

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.260
more elbow grease.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.860
Ok, great! After a few minutes of whisking,
you end up with this lovely, thick batter

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.310
and this is exactly what we want to give lovely
texture to our carrot cake.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.289
Now in a separate bowl, mix together your
flour, cinnamon and baking powder. If you're

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.640
not a fan of cinnamon, you can actually leave
it out of this recipe. I like it for a little

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.940
bit of extra flavor.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.880
Then just add your dry ingredients into your wet
and mix together until just combined. Lastly,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.570
we're going to add in our finely grated carrot
and our raisins.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.229
I love raisins in my carrot cake. Some people
love walnuts so you can add those in either.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.799
Or you can add in both.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.250
At this stage, we're just going to mix all
of the ingredients together until they're

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.729
well combined and then turn off the machine.
Lovely! Our carrot cake batter is done so

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.450
now it's ready for the tin.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.189
Next butter and line a 9 inch baking tin.

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.439
And then pour in your cake batter. In case
you didn't notice, this cake is actually dairy-free

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.770
so it's a great recipe to keep everybody happy
this springtime.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.090
This guy is ready for the oven. We're going
to bake him off at 340 degrees F until golden

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.310
brown all over and nice and firm in the middle.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.079
While our cake is baking, we're going to get
started on our cream cheese frosting. Now

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.110
I've made this cream cheese frosting before
in a video for Red Velvet Cake. It is really

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.869
good and it pairs really well with carrot
cake and with red velvet. I'm going to show you

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.880
again how to make it because it's really easy
and I do know that some of you have a little bit of difficulty

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.310
when making frostings.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.959
In a stand mixer or hand mixer, we're going
to beat our room temperature cream cheese

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.810
to make sure we get out any lumps. Great!
This is lovely and smooth.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.590
Now to this mix, we're going to add in our vanilla extract,
our room temperature butter and our icing

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.910
sugar. And we're going to mix them all together
until they're nice and soft. To make a really

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.019
good frosting, it's important that you use
room temperature butter and room temperature

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.679
cream cheese because they just whip up so much better
and they yield a really good frosting at the end.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.519
Our frosting looks lovely. It's gotten bigger
in size which is exactly what we want and

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.510
it's nice and smooth. I'm going to put this in the
fridge and go check on our carrot cake.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.250
Our carrot cake is done and it looks perfect!
Mine takes around 70-80 minutes just all depending.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.790
What you get is this lovely golden brown on
top. We're going to set this guys aside and

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.500
let it go cold before we decorate it.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.329
Now this is my favorite part of making a cake
and that is the decorating. We're going to

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.590
start out by cutting some layers into our
cake. When you're cutting layers into your

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.250
cake, get down nice and low so you can make
sure they're level. Gorgeous! Look at that

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.870
lovely moist cake. I cut my layers free form.
I'm not too worried about them being perfect.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.310
And at the end of the day, you know what?
It's a homemade cake and everybody will love

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.220
it regardless. Once you have your layers cut,
put a generous layer of cream cheese frosting

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.310
in between all of them. Spread your frosting
all the way to the edge and in a little bit

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.540
you'll see why. Then lay the next layer on
top and then keep on building. I'm using a cake

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.880
turntable which makes my life so much easier.
On with the next layer and then keep on going

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.570
until you reach the top. Take a little look
at your cake and make sure it's nice and level.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.010
Now I know you're thinking this cake doesn't
look like so great now, but we're actually going to

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.260
decorate it like a "naked cake" which I've
done before in a previous video for a wedding

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.660
cake. It's a super easy style that anybody
can do and I'm going to show you how.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.889
All you do is take your spatula and run it
along the outside of the cake smearing all of

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.220
the extra icing coming out of the layers
and creating this beautiful rustic effect.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.250
It's like icing a cake but way less work.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.699
To decorate the top of my cake, I generously
spread on cream cheese frosting all the

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.209
way around. And just like with the layers,
you can just spread it on any way you like.

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.070
To me, the more rustic it looks, the better.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.410
Now for another BIG &amp; BOLD decorating tip.
Pipe on squiggly lines of orange cream cheese

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.940
frosting to make carrots. Then add on some
green frosting to look like their tops. You

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.350
can pipe them on just like the face of a clock
so you can have one carrot per slice. I'm

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.690
going to eat two carrots because I always
eat my vegetables.This cake is incredibly

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.000
moist and the flavor gets better the longer
it sits. But I think you'll find this cake

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.250
won't sit for very long.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.169
The best part of my day is receiving your
BIG &amp; BOLD creations on my social media so

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.450
if you remake this carrot cake then please
don't forget to share a photo with me. I really

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.820
hope you enjoyed this BIG &amp; BOLD carrot cake
and thank you for subscribing to my channel.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.060
I'll see you back here again next Thursday
for more Bigger Bolder Baking.
