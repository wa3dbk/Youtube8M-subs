00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:05.370
Hi, my name is Don Snyder, Executive Director
of the National Skeet Shooting Association,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.099
on behalf of expertvillage.com. One of the
things we want to talk to you about is carrying

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:18.800
and handling your shotgun while on or in and
around a skeet field. One of the things, as

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.200
we mentioned earlier, is that you always have
to be conscious of, is the muzzle and where

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.180
it is pointed. One of the things that we suggest
is that you always have control of the muzzle

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:40.730
and of the shotgun. The actions are always
open, always open. Now when carrying a shotgun

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.440
in and around a shotgun range, what we suggest
is that you can take your arm, put it right

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.440
up underneath, and carry the shotgun like
this. But as you see, you have absolute control

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.600
of that muzzle, always have control; you can
see where it is. One of the other things that

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.030
you can do, if this is not comfortable for
you, you can actually take and drop it over

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.280
your shoulder and now you can grab the muzzle
or up here at the forearm and you can carry

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.040
it, but you have absolute control of the muzzle.
One of the things that you don't want to do,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.661
and you'll see people sometimes they'll take
a shotgun and they're out in the field and

00:01:19.661 --> 00:01:23.970
their hunting it, but you have no control
of the muzzle. You don't know where that muzzle

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.320
is going to be pointed. You don't want to
see, and people on the skeet field for obvious

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:37.230
safety reasons, don't want to see the muzzle
not under control. This is an automatic, or

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:44.000
a semi-automatic shotgun that's used a lot
in skeet shooting. So again, always have control

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.520
of the shotgun. You can carry it like so,
you can carry it balanced under the arm, you

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.659
can carry it over the shoulder, but always
have control of the muzzle. Another common

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.700
shotgun that is used in skeet shooting is
the over and under. And when you're carrying

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.130
an over and under on a skeet field, the thing
that you want to do is always make sure that

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.590
it is broken open. And again, you can carry
it much like the other one, like so; you have

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.280
absolute control of the muzzle. You can drape
it over the shoulder like so where you have

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.450
absolute control over the muzzle. One of the
things that you never want to see on a fixed

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.780
action shotgun like this is the action closed.
If you're walking around like this, nobody

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.010
knows that it's unloaded. It's very, very
dangerous. Even the handler, a lot of times,

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.650
doesn't even know that it's unloaded. So it
always must be broken open, again. And when

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.190
you carry an over and under shotgun, always
have control of the muzzle end of the shotgun,

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:59.880
not like so, not with the barrels over the
shoulder like so, you don't have control.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.989
Always have control of the muzzle of the shotgun.
