00:00:04.986 --> 00:00:07.186
&gt;&gt; This video illustrates
the efforts of a team

00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:09.936
of visualization and civil
engineering researchers towards

00:00:09.936 --> 00:00:12.086
producing a high
fidelity visualization

00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:15.976
of the September 11, 2001 attack
on the World Trade Center.

00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:19.936
The visualization has to be
eloquent to the non-expert user.

00:00:20.816 --> 00:00:23.876
The simulation was placed
into context by modeling

00:00:23.876 --> 00:00:27.176
and importing the buildings
of the WTC plaza shown here

00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:30.946
in color into a Google earth
model of Lower Manhattan.

00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:33.826
A fine element analysis
simulation of the impact

00:00:33.826 --> 00:00:36.776
between the Boeing 767
and the top 20 floors

00:00:36.776 --> 00:00:39.346
of the North Tower was
computed using a state

00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:40.846
of the art simulation code.

00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:44.506
Then the simulation results
were imported into a state

00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:45.896
of the art animation system

00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:47.606
where the visualization
was produced.

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.906
The simulation tracked the
impact over three-quarters

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:52.116
of a second real time.

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:56.756
This sequence is 13 times
slower than real time.

00:00:57.946 --> 00:01:01.616
All the animated geometry seen
here was created automatically

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.916
from the simulation of the data.

00:01:04.516 --> 00:01:15.926
[ Pause ]

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:19.366
&gt;&gt; This sequence visualizes
the aircraft trajectory

00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.976
between the facade and the
structural core of the building.

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:26.336
[ Pause ]

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:32.006
&gt;&gt; Notice the oscillation of
the ceiling during the impact.

00:01:32.416 --> 00:01:35.376
This reverse angle shot
visualizes the important damage

00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:37.506
sustained by some
of the core columns.

00:01:38.716 --> 00:01:41.056
Using a camera with a distant
hitter plane [assumed spelling]

00:01:41.356 --> 00:01:44.406
this sequence simultaneously
visualizes the two floors

00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:47.586
that sustained most
direct impact damage.

00:01:48.516 --> 00:01:53.696
[ Pause ]

00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:56.756
&gt;&gt; Notice the right
engine titanium shaft

00:01:56.756 --> 00:01:58.956
which traverses the
building virtually intact.

00:01:59.516 --> 00:02:08.606
[ Pause ]

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:11.096
&gt;&gt; Plane debris re-emerges

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:13.386
on the opposite face
of the building.

00:02:17.356 --> 00:02:18.816
The jet fuel in the central

00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:22.276
and two-wing tanks was simulated
using smoother particle

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:23.626
hydrodynamics or SPH.

00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:26.996
The nearby fuel particles
were lumped together

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:29.976
in the animation system
and the fuel was rendered

00:02:29.976 --> 00:02:33.146
with reflections and refractions
using a retrace material.

00:02:33.256 --> 00:02:36.116
Notice how the wing tank
fuel disperses first

00:02:36.246 --> 00:02:39.436
as the wings are considerably
damaged by the facade.

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:42.356
The core columns are essential

00:02:42.356 --> 00:02:44.216
to the structural
integrity of the building.

00:02:44.686 --> 00:02:47.506
This sequence visualizes the
damage to the core columns

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:49.726
and to their connecting
horizontal beams

00:02:50.096 --> 00:02:53.396
by rendering all other entities
with transparent materials.

00:02:59.656 --> 00:03:04.586
Here are the core
columns exclusively.

00:03:04.586 --> 00:03:07.966
These sequences also turn out
to provide a good visualization

00:03:07.966 --> 00:03:10.156
of the overall deformation
of the aircraft

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.376
as it enters the building.

00:03:18.646 --> 00:03:21.726
The simulation did not consider
the effects of the explosion

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:23.126
and of the instrument fire.

00:03:23.776 --> 00:03:27.066
Here, the fuel particles were
used in the animation system

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:30.356
to automatically produce a
plausible fire visualization.

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:33.936
Apps can be seen in this
side by side visualization,

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:37.196
the simulation fuel particles
control the fire computed

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:38.456
by the animation system.

00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:46.966
Elements that out or go
excessive stress are eliminated

00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:49.826
from the computation by
the FEA simulation code.

00:03:50.386 --> 00:03:52.676
These eroding elements
correspond to entities

00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:56.996
that disintegrate such as a slab
of concrete turning into dust.

00:03:56.996 --> 00:03:58.726
Although they do not
have much relevance

00:03:58.756 --> 00:04:02.126
from the simulation standpoint,
eroded elements are important

00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:03.306
for the visualization.

00:04:04.046 --> 00:04:06.556
Eroded elements are used
in the animation system

00:04:06.556 --> 00:04:09.136
to automatically create
and control visual effects

00:04:09.206 --> 00:04:10.896
such as dust and
glass [inaudible].

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:16.796
The visualization produce
leverages of strength

00:04:16.796 --> 00:04:18.646
of the state of the art
visualization system

00:04:18.916 --> 00:04:22.036
which models the interactions
in detail based on physics based

00:04:22.036 --> 00:04:25.896
over principles and of the state
of the art animation system

00:04:25.896 --> 00:04:28.066
which produces a high
quality visualization

00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:29.456
of the simulation results.

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:34.086
This was made possible by
developing a scalable translator

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:36.776
that automatically converts
the simulation [inaudible] data

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.026
into an animation scene.

00:04:38.576 --> 00:04:41.286
The translator is
general and reusable

00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:43.746
in the context of
other simulations.
