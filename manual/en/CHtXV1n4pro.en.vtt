00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.790
You have to hand it to Mark Millar, the man
simply doesn’t give up.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.370
His letter writing campaign as a teenager
to both comic book publishers and artists

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.839
alike has become legendary, not just for its
bravado but that he actually ended up - years

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.810
later - working with many of the people he
wrote to!

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.590
He made his first big splash in the comics
world with the DC Elseworlds miniseries Superman

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.539
Red Son, and then gained superstar status
when he - along with Brian Michael Bendis

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.430
- launched Marvel’s initially successful
Ultimate universe.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.620
He also orchestrated Civil War for Marvel,
which is about to become a pretty big movie,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.010
and also the popular story-arc Old Man Logan.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.210
But while Bendis was happy to stay at Marvel
and is still at Marvel, Millar has new heights

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.510
to which he wanted to climb - HOLLYWOOD!

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.730
He was well-known for “casting” his comics
by having his artists draw some characters

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.260
to resemble famous actors.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.680
Samuel L Jackson actually become Nick Fury,
however Eminem and Halle Berry did not go

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.960
on to star in Wanted.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.480
Publishing his own independent comics since
20014 under his Millarworld banner - hey,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.880
I told you, the guy dreams big - Millar had
enough success with Wanted for Universal and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.380
then Kick-Ass for Lionsgate that he decided
to write for Millarworld full time, where

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.630
he consistently was able to land the biggest
artists in comics - probably by promising

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.130
them a lucrative movie deal.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.320
Unfortunately, in the beginning, he wasn’t
able to quite deliver on that promise.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.700
Sure Millar was BFF’s with Fox, as he agreed
to supervise their Marvel properties and seemingly

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.610
in exchange, they agreed to develop Millarworld
titles Nemesis, Superior and Starlight for

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.909
the big screen.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.110
Keyword - develop.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.020
And in fact, those titles might never have
gotten out of development hell if not for

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.750
a little movie called Kingsman The Secret
Service.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.340
Yes, many thought that Kick Ass would take
Millar to the next level - there were even

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.070
plans for a Hit Girl movie with The Raid’s
Gareth Evans set to make his Hollywood debut.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.140
Again, Millar is not afraid to just reach
out to the those he wants to work with...

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.500
But when Kick Ass failed to make enough money
at the box office, well, it did not look good.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.670
Perhaps Kingsman The Secret Service never
would’ve been made if not for Matthew Vaughn’s

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.670
success post Kick Ass with X-Men First Class.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.760
But it did get made, and after a brief scare
when its release date was pushed back a few

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.560
months, it finally hit theaters - and changed
everything.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.680
Kingsman might not have opened in first place
- who COULD beat out sexual phenomenon Fifty

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.950
Shades of Grey?! - but its held steady for
weeks at the box office worldwide and now

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.750
is actually closing in on X-Men First Class
and Wanted, Vaughn and Millar’s respective

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.560
biggest hits to date.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.660
It’s also worth noting that Kingsman was
made for just half of what it cost for X-Men

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.310
First Class.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.550
Colin Firth is an action star!

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.239
Taron Egerton is a hot new discovery!

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.930
And comic book artist, comic book LEGEND,
Dave Gibbons got to walk all the red carpets

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.550
and collect the big check.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.300
I’d imagine Mark Millar will now be able
to get any comic book artist he wants, perhaps

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.240
even some of the top artists currently employed
by the Big Two.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.290
He also seems to be able to get the attention
of any studio he wants, as Universal just

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.660
swooped in and optioned his newest comic Chrononauts,
where Millar is partnered with Scott Snyder’s

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.350
usual artist Sean Murphy.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.380
Fox might be miffed they lost out on that,
if they didn’t have Kingsman 2 in their

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.380
pocket.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.260
Vaughn has been very vocal about a potential
sequel, even saying - SPOILER ALERT!

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.530
Seriously, Spoiler Alert.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.890
If you haven’t seen Kingsman The Secret
Service, go see it to help ensure we get this

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.520
sequel, and then come back to this video - likely
with much enthusiasm is Kingsman The Secret

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.950
Service is awesome.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.260
Okay, still here or just came back?

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.640
Well Vaughn assures fans that Colin Firth’s
Harry Hart will be able to return for a sequel.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.730
He’s mum on how exactly, but he could either
ONE simply not actually be dead, happens all

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.629
the time in spy movies, or TWO because this
isn’t that kind of movie FRANCHISE, Harry

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.830
could be featured in flashbacks or as some
have suggested, have an evil twin?

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.680
Hey, Kingsman is successful because it brings
back SOME of the camp to spy genre.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.439
Then again, maybe some of you don’t want
Harry Heart back, and Vaughn has said he sees

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:21.739
Kingsman The Secret Service as a prequel of
sorts to an all out Eggsy Super Spy movie.

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.339
So, it’s looking like we’re going to get
a Kingsman 2.

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:28.119
Do you want one, and who do you want in it?

00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:31.800
Plus what do you think all of this will mean
for Mark Millar’s career, and his comics,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.800
going forward?

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.330
IS he the secret sauce that made Kingsman
so great?

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.819
And I don’t know about you, but I’m having
a hard time getting over that lost Hit Girl

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.129
movie to be directed by Gareth Evans!

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.469
Be sure to share your thoughts down below.

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:46.659
I’m Grace Randolph and this has been a Movie
Byte!

00:04:46.659 --> 00:05:00.039
