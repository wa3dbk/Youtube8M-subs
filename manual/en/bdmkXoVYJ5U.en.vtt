Hey guys~! Today I'm gonna talk about how
I line things and how to make your line art

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.460
look nice. I'll be going over some tips and
tricks that I use when I do it... Although

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.019
lining is probably one of my least favorite
thing to do, I do like how it gives things

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.000
a cleaner finish and a lot of the times I
actually like my linearts by themselves better

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.029
than the final product! I'll be using this
piece that I'm working on right now as an

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.470
example and I'll talk as I line.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.330
So first of all, I have a Wacom Intuos 5 tablet,
the pen pressure sensitivity is pretty decent

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.180
but just to make it absolutely clear, you
really don't need a good tablet to make amazing

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.300
lineart or just art in general. I had one
of the earliest models of the Wacom Bamboo

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.280
tablets for the longest time and my linearts
back then still looked pretty good.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.109
Anyways! The settings. Make sure that the
stabilizer up here is set to the highest setting

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.140
that your computer can handel. I say this
because most people suggest you to hull it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:07.500
all the way up to S-7, but if I do that my computer actually lags when I start drawing. Like this.... For

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.250
me anything in the S series lags, try it out
yourself and see what your computer can handle.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.770
I normally just keep it at 15, and it works
fine. Now as for the pen/brush that I use,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.990
I generally just use the default pen tool,
EXCEPT I turn the opacity down to around 90%.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.280
I do this because I don't like it when the
lineart looks too solid or black. Depending

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.820
on the piece I'm drawing I might even bring
it down to an 80%.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.780
Now let's get to the actual line-arting. The
layers here get a little crazy, so just focus

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.829
on these top 3 layers, ignore everything else
and the folder on top. So! I take the sketch

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:52.149
layer and turn the opacity down to around
15-20% I'll go lower if I need to but I never

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.759
go higher than that. Then I make a layer on
top of the sketch layer called "Line-art"

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.329
and start to do my thing. Generally for the
face I'd like to use a thick brush. I tend

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.900
to undo a LOT cuz I'm a perfectionist. Which
is why I normally don't include linearting

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.130
in my speedpaints cuz it'll double the length.
I go back in to make sure the lines on the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.000
face are thick enough if i need to.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.280
For the mouth and nose I use a slightly smaller
brush, and same goes for the clothing. Now,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.590
let's make a new layer for eyes. With the
eyes, I turn the opacity level of the BRUSH

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.620
down to around 70% to give it a softer look.
Then I fill it in so that it's all black.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.550
This is just something that I like to do for
no particular reasons. It's just my style

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:50.480
I guess, so obviously, you don't have to fill
it in if you don't want to.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.660
So now we make a new layer for "hair".
Here the opacity of the brush goes back up

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.850
to around 90%. And using a relatively small
brush I start to work out the details. When

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.510
I line the hair I like to make some improvisations,
so the opacity of the SKETCH goes down to

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.990
around 5-8%.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.760
After that I go back in with an air brush
to make the eyes darker. Then, I use the pen

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.190
tool again to thicken the face, the outer
parts of the clothing, and etc. to add more

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.930
definition. Then I just move things
around and fix the things that doesn't look

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.600
right to me. I'm not sure if you guys can
see with the fast-forwarding, but

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.370
I'm slowly merging the layers down as I go.
I'd like to keep the layers to a minimum.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.690
The more layers you have, the more laggy the
program gets. And since I like to work with

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:26.450
ginormous files, having a small amount of layers
is essential. The goal is to end up with just one

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.170
layer of  "Line-art" by the end.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:41.640
Now lastly, since I'm not planning on adding
colors or shading to this piece , I made another

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.460
layer and added shadows to the lineart to
make it look more finished. This part is definitely

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:57.530
110% unnecessary. I would normally never go through the trouble to do this with my normal linearts

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.230
Just some final tips as we watch the speedpaint.
Make sure to inverse/flip the canvas lots

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.820
when you're line-arting. You can do this by
pressing "H" on your keyboard. For me, I do

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.540
the majority of my editing while I lineart,
and doing this really helps. Remember to vary

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.590
the size of the lines for different parts,
it really helps in making the final piece

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.410
more dynamic. The thickest lines should be
at the face and the outer parts of clothing,

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.400
while the facial features and hair should
have thinner lines.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.420
And that's pretty much it! You guys can see
the final product on my deviantart, I'll leave

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.090
a link to that in the descriptions down below.
