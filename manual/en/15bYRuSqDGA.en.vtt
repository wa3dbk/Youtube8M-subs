00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.370
How to Assemble a Bike.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.130
If your new bicycle comes in a box, it won't
be ready to ride.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.350
With a few tools and some elbow grease, you'll
be off and riding in no time.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:22.000
You will need Bicycle lubricant An air pump
An Allen wrench set An adjustable wrench and

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.369
a kickstand or wall (optional).

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.509
Improper assembly can lead to injury.

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.670
Attach all components securely and test the
brakes and handlebars before riding.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.830
Step 1.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.730
Remove the bike frame and all the parts from
the box.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.420
Make sure everything is unwrapped and accounted
for.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.620
Be careful not to rest the bike on the sensitive
parts such as the derailleur and gear sprockets,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.040
so they won't bend or warp.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.550
Step 2.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.010
Squeeze bicycle lubricant on the front wheel
axle.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.800
Set the wheel in position between the front
brake pads.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:04.390
Slide the axle in, replace the spring and
cap, and tighten.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.680
Step 3.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.039
Repeat the procedure with the rear wheel,
and then gently pull up on the chain, setting

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.439
it on the gears' teeth.

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.619
Set the bike on its kickstand if it has one,
or lean it against a wall for the rest of

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.430
the assembly.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.790
Step 4.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.600
Use an air pump to inflate the tires to the
pressure recommended on their sidewalls.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.789
Step 5.

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.359
Drop the seat post into the seat post tube
and tighten the clamp.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.770
Make sure the seat is aligned with the frame's
top bar.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.799
Step 6.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.729
Slide the handlebar stem into the vertical
handlebar tube.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.359
Adjust the position of the handlebars until
they are perpendicular to the front wheel

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:43.060
and tighten the neck with an Allen wrench.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.289
Be careful not to loosen the headset too much
or the handlebar nut may drop into the tube.

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.600
Step 7.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.889
Find the pedal labeled "L." Tightly screw
it into the left crank by rotating the nut

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:57.689
counter-clockwise with an adjustable wrench.

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.779
Repeat the procedure with the right pedal,
but this time screw it in clockwise.

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:03.959
Step 8.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.420
Reconnect the brakes and make sure all screws
and joints are tight before taking off on

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.869
your new bike.

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.701
Did you know The basic gear system for bicycles
has been in use for more than a century; the

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:20.840
main improvements to bicycles have been made
in materials and assembly.
