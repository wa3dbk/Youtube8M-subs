00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.760
What's up guy and girl players of World of
Warcraft. This is Ryutarou AkA Tarou bringing

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.270
you this week's WoW Report Episode 38! For
more FREE WoW guides, check out my website

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.630
at tarouwowguides.com

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:18.110
In this Tarou Weekly WoW Report, I'll cover
ingame news, Cataclsym PvE, Patch 4.0.6 News,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.610
Auction House chaos, an Auction House tip,
as well as a Q&amp;A session but first I want

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.960
to appoligize for not getting a video out
on Sunday. Things have been hectic around

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.720
my house and I'm just swamped with trying
to make ends meet, play with my kids, and

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.019
please the wife. But don't worry, I have it
all under control and to help with that, from

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.989
now on my weekly video will be out on Mondays,
every week. To make up for it, Saturday, maybe

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.219
Sunday, and some day during the week too will
have a guide type video since I can make those

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.489
in advance. Thanks everyone for understanding
and I really appreciate all the support.

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.469
In Cataclysm news, the Lunar Festival and
Darkmoon Faire are gone but we still got the

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.640
'Love is in the Air' event continuing on until
early morning on the 22nd. Remember to do

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.539
your dailys and the Crown Chemical Co. battle.
Good luck to everyone getting their mount.

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:15.890
Patch 4.0.6 released as expected and was fairly
smooth with minimal downtown on Tuesday. They

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.230
did discover random bugs though so some hotfixes
are being sent out and should all be applied

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.890
during this week's maintenance. Oh and let
me know what you think of all the changes

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.130
in the comments. Good or bad, feel free to
vent and nerd rage.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.710
In Cataclysm PvE news, nothing too special
but I have noticed Heroics are getting a lot

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.040
easier for PuGs. Maybe we'll see less QQ on
the forums now. Ha, yeah right. Let me know

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.579
what you think the next QQ will be in the
comments.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.240
Ok, now on to Auction House Chaos. Prices
are pretty good across the board and if you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.920
had listened to my 'hot items' list you should
of made a good amount of gold on patch day

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.409
from gems, Volatile Life, and herbs. Well
except for Whiptail which had an interesting

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.671
bug of instant respawn. Players could just
sit there and pick Whiptail forever. Pretty

00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:10.690
funny bug taht crashed the Whiptail price.
Volatile Life was also interesting and went

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.890
all the way up to 15g per on my server and
slowly declined until it reached pre-patch

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.170
prices today. I made about 25k just buying
and selling it. Elementium and Pyrite Ore

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.090
keep spiking up but come down over the weekend
so like I say in a lot of video, that's when

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.470
I'm mass buying my mats for the week. Hypnotic
Dust is on a downward spiral with nothing

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.030
to save it and prices should eventually stick
around on the low side. The Darkmoon Faire

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.980
is gone and if you made any trinkets to resell,
you should get the most out of them in a few

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.710
weeks. Right now the prices are a bit low
but once that stock runs out and demand comes

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.180
back, they'll be a good bit higher which is
when I'll sell mine.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.150
Alright, moving on to this week's Auction
House tip. Managing all your mail can be quite

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.370
a hassle. Get the addon, Postal to help with
looting. Will save time and your fingers from

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.770
clicking.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.060
In Blizzard news, it's their 20th Anniversary
and mad grats to them. The first game I played

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.070
of theirs was Diablo II and I had a blast.
They launched a mini-site where new content

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.470
will release so be sure to watch that for
some neat stuff.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.760
Finally, I'd like to end this Tarou Weekly
WoW Report answering a few questions you guys

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.870
and girls have asked me over the last week.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.841
Q1. How long does it take to make a video?

00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:29.340
A1. It depends on the video. I do a lot of
research and testing but not including that,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.190
a typical guide type video takes 10 hours.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.900
Q2. Can you get rid of the ads on your website.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.220
A2. I will be reworking my website and reducing
the ads to 50% or less since I know they can

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.180
annoy some people. Unfortunately, I may have
to get creative to make up the revenue or

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.820
Tarou WoW Guides will be done for. Remember
I don't sell any guides, they're all free

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.320
so money has to come from somewhere. I'll
also be giving everyone a way to get rid of

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.990
all ads and help the site at the same time.
I'm still working on the details but expect

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.040
that over the next week.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.840
Q3. Can you come to my server and hold my
hand through doing your guides?

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.370
A3. I'm sorry but as much as I would love
to play with everyone, I'm only one person

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.850
and barely have enough time to make videos
as it is. In my free time I just want to relax,

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.790
have fun, and enjoy the game. I can't be spending
hours on 36,000 player's servers helping them.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.060
Unless you have a cloning device or some crazy
speed buff. If you do, hook it up.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.290
Before I wrap this week's report up, just
want to let everyone know I release the first

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.470
video of my Mining Gold Making Series with
routes on my website. I will be releasing

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.970
1-525 Mining this week along with another
Mining video and Herbalism. I'm also finishing

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.750
up my server choosing video. Lots of good
stuff is coming so sub and stick around.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.060
Lastly, this week's YouTube channel that I'd
like to mention comes from TradeChat. She

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.090
makes informative videos about all kinds of
things in World of Warcraft and some other

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.690
games. Definitely check her out. Whoa, girls
really do play WoW. But.. probably not the

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.010
chick Rogue you talk to on a daily basis.
That's a guy, sorry.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.070
That's it for this week of Tarou's Weekly
WoW Report and I hope you liked it.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.000
Personally, I'm still puzzled with my buggy
Troll flight form.
