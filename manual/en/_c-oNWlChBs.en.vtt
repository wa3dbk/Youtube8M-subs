00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.619
Hello, everyone. This is mumbo here welcome back and today

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.439
We're going to take a look at this relatively boring looking house

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.009
But of course looks can be deceptive because this is a piston house

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.260
Now for those who don't know what a piston house is, it is essentially a house you build that you cram as many redstone

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.600
Contraptions into as you possibly can. Seriously, just go ham with them.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.289
Now I used to build these all the time in my early days of redstone, but since then haven't really done one for a while

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.160
So what I thought, I'd do is give it another shot

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.559
But issue myself a bit of a challenge to try and build it within a nine by nine area

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.259
I'm pretty happy with what I've come up with so let's take a closer look.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.420
Now obviously when it comes to piston houses first impressions are fairly key you want to make a grand entrance

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.878
So that everyone knows you're an absolute pro at redstone. Which is why I have taken the opposite route

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.619
I want people to get their expectations nice and low when they walk in so I've gone up for the wooden door

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.099
But oh! you weren't expecting that were you. The door isn't actually the door, the door is actually next to the door

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.620
So you just walk through here. You can see this is a little room

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.689
We've got a light switch up at the top here

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.140
Which is fully functional and can turn on and off all of these lights

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.339
We also have a few little bits in this corner here, which are non redstone related

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.760
So we have a chair and a table

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.399
Because this wouldn't be a house without a chair and a table, and we also have this guy. His name is Bob

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.180
He is a creeper

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.790
And he is stuck inside there which means even if we were in survival mode he wouldn't actually explode which I quite like

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.210
Then over in this corner we've got the armour fitting station

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.229
So the minute you can see I'm pretty much naked, but if we walk inside here hit this button

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.130
You will see that

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.560
We actually get kitted out in all of the finest armor

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.660
Now on to some of the more exciting parts of the building. We just hit this button here you will see that the floor drops away

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.850
revealing a secret hidden armory. Now down on the bottom here we've got a couple of chests

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.540
We've got an ender chest as well, an anvil to do all your apparels and also an enchanting table complete with books

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.739
Yes, it has actually got books inside it which means you can get a half decent enchantment

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.869
Which I quite like. Then if we take a look over here

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.669
We've also got a couple droppers that you can use to store other items and to get out of this thing all you have to do

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:07.040
is do some jumping and button placements and you can see that, well, that happens

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.580
Still works doesn't it, then if we walk over here you can see we've got a super smelter

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.840
This is where you can do all of your smelting of your items

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.720
it's nice and fast because it uses hoppers and all of those items flow in and get out put it through into the chest

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.510
And then over here. We have got this lever

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.200
we give it a flick you'll see that a staircase folds out and we can head down it into the bottom section of the base

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.160
Now what we have down here is a few of the farms that are involved because otherwise of course we wouldn't have any resources

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.299
So at the back here you can see we've got ourselves a chicken farm

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.050
I've actually turned off friendly mob noise, because it's a little bit too much

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.060
I think we have a couple hundred chickens up there

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.100
So it's pretty efficient and it produces a decent amount of cooked chicken as well as a decent amount of feathers

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.540
then in this section here we have got our bread maker

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.680
so what we have to do is flip this lever that turns on all the bone meal

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.510
Then if we hit this button

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.420
You can actually harvest all of it which I find to be very useful but also a little bit noisy

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.100
Then if we spin it round we've got something really cool over here if you just place a redstone torch down here

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.619
You can see that our hidden storage opens up once again

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.179
we have a couple extra chest for storing all of our items as well as another ender chest and

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.310
Also a little furnace down at the bottom in case you wanted to do some precious item smelting

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.450
Which is pretty cool

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.410
So if you just place down the redstone torch once again all of that gets completely hidden away

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.529
So we can just head up back up to the top and then once we get up there

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.820
We can flick the lever, fold away our little staircase, say goodbye to Bob walk over our pressure plate and the wall is restored

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.110
Just out of interest I've used

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.380
MC edit to copy and pasted that little house down there out into the open world then I removed all the Sandstone

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.260
So you can see all of the redstone

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.680
obviously removing the sandstone has caused a few little problems

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.180
With the fact that we now have a bit of the floating stuff

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.869
But if we take a look around you can see that there's actually quite a lot to this build, despite the fact that it all

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.010
looked fairly simple there's quite a lot of stuff going on. We got hidden staircases armories

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.219
We got farms and hidden storage systems and all that good stuff, all comes together to create a fairly cool little piston house

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.080
As always if you do want to take a closer look at the redstone behind this thing then there is a well download down

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.080
The description for anyone that wants to check that out

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.509
Also, if any of you guys have built piston houses that you think are really cool

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.299
Then let me know down in the comments section because I'd love to see them

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.549
But anyway, that is all I've got time for today

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.689
