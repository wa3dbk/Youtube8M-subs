Hi, I'm Rachel for Expert Village. Now we
are going to mix all the ingredients together.

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.520
We are going to start with the flour. As I
mentioned before, we are not going to put

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:19.020
all the flour, we are going to leave some
outside in case we need more. We are going

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:29.570
to pour the salt on top of the flour and the
baking powder. Mix all 3 of them together

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:37.660
cause we don't want to have all the baking
powder stuck into one corner then it does

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:49.000
not taste too good. We are going to mix the
3 eggs before we pour them into the flour.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:12.420
Pour the oil in and the 2 large grated onions.
We are going to start mixing them from the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:27.420
middle. The onions are very strong so if you
are sensitive you should make sure that you

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:40.310
mix it as quick as possible with the flour
so it would not make your eyes tear. Yup we

00:01:40.310 --> 00:02:04.930
need some more flour in it. This dough is
very very soft but it should not be sticky.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:20.599
Here we go.
