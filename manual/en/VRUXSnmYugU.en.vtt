[music]

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.380
&gt;&gt; (OFF-CAMERA): What are we doing?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.580
&gt;&gt; LYNNE: What are we doing? We're going to
give a Daisy Award.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.820
[music]

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.340
&gt;&gt; (OFF CAMERA): Maureen, you going to turn
around for us?

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.740
[music]

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.100
&gt;&gt; MAUREEN: Geez.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.310
&gt;&gt; (OFF CAMERA): Do you know what this is?
&gt;&gt; MAUREEN: No.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.050
&gt;&gt; RHONDA: So who wants to tell her why everyone
is here gathered in your honor.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.560
&gt;&gt; MAUREEN: What's going on?

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.629
&gt;&gt; LYNNE: Good morning everyone. We are very,
very happy to be here

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.559
to celebrate nursing excellence at Maine Medical
Center.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.050
And we are here from the Daisy committee to
present a Daisy today.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.860
[applause]

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.780
&gt;&gt; MAUREEN: I had no idea! I'm sorry.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.609
&gt;&gt; BRANDI: My name is Brandi Lovering. I work
on R-2.

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.579
And I nominated Maureen O'Brion-Snowden for
a Daisy Award.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.829
Every year, since Maureen started working
on R-2, she has purchased small gifts

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.489
for all the patients on the unit out of her
own pocket.

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.409
One patient wore the scarf she had given to
him for the next several weeks

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.189
while he was a patient on the unit.
&gt;&gt; MAUREEN: He did!

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.000
&gt;&gt; BRANDI: Maureen is just an excellent nurse.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.140
You can tell that she really loves what she does.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.870
&gt;&gt; MAUREEN: It was a fun Christmas.
&gt;&gt; BRANDI: It was!

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.450
&gt;&gt; DORN: This is my colleague, Jenny Gilmore,
a Daisy Award winner.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.109
&gt;&gt; JEN: Hi! We're going to flush your IV and
then I'm going to put you back on your fluids.

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.569
&gt;&gt; DORN: Long before I nominated Jenny,

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.680
 I knew she was going to be a Daisy Award winner in my book

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.030
because Jenny just can have that touch that
just makes a patient,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.200
even if they are facing really difficult circumstances,
smile.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.600
&gt;&gt; JEN: My dad has been kind of a patient
in a hospital many times.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.880
I mean, I remember in 6th grade, a nurse went
beyond.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.520
We weren't allowed in the ICU back then and
she would sneak us in.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.850
She'd go, "1, 2, 3, run!" We'd literally run
and sit in the chairs

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.100
and from that day forward, I knew that I wanted
to be a nurse

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.600
because what she showed went beyond.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.779
And the compassion she showed for my mother
and for us, I'll never forget that day.

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:59.250
&gt;&gt; RACHEL: Knock, knock. Hi Mary Lou! How
are you?

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.719
&gt;&gt; MICHELLE: We first met Rachel when she
was doing her student nurse clinicals here.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.639
She always had a good attitude and was bouncing
around all over the place,

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.160
 and smiling and happy.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.720
&gt;&gt; RACHEL: I'm walking up to the unit and
there's, I think what it looks like,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.280
 50 people standing there.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.190
And I'm trying to just sneak by them and you
know, get to my patients and do my thing.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.120
And they're like, "Congratulations. You're
a Daisy Award winner!"

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.850
So that was quite the Monday morning.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.480
[music]

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.260
I've always wanted to be a nurse since about
16. I'm the only nurse in my family.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.210
And I think it is a true calling. And I can
see that in all the nurses here at this hospital.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.140
They really are passionate about what they
do and it shows.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.750
Alright. I'll be right back. You're very welcome.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.590
&gt;&gt; PATIENT: They're polite. They're efficient,
joyful.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.570
It's really, it's a treat to be here.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.350
[music]

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.640
&gt;&gt; JARED: I didn't really know what I wanted
to do growing up.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.740
I went down a few different paths.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.180
I started out off doing some multimedia and
then I've been doing a lot of landscape hardscaping

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.640
which I enjoy working outside. I've worked
for a hydro-electric company.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.630
I've kind of done it all.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.310
When I finally decided to go into nursing,
it turned out to be the right decision for me.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.130
Being able to help someone else through a
difficult time is very fulfilling.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.930
And to be able to go home and feel like I
made a difference is a big deal for me.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.600
&gt;&gt; BOBBI: I am extremely proud of Jared.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.480
The nurses at Maine Medical Center, we do
strive for excellence.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.120
We are Magnet nurses. We just live and breathe
it every day.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.670
It's who we are.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.720
[music]

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.160
&gt;&gt; MARJORIE: Congratulations. Well deserved.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.240
&gt;&gt; MAUREEN: Thank you everybody. I didn't
expect this.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.050
I didn't know what was going on. [Laughter]

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.830
I've always wanted to be a nurse. It kind
of started back when I was young.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.340
And you're going to be going home today.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.020
.&gt;&gt; PATIENT: Oh good!

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.120
&gt;&gt; MAUREEN: I decided after I stayed home
with my son for 15 years,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.900
that I wanted to go back to nursing school.
So, I'm actually a fairly new nurse.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.350
I love being around patients, patients' families.
I love educating.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.239
I love being around, or part of a good team.

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.670
&gt;&gt; ALL: Aww. I'm so proud of you.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.480
&gt;&gt; MAUREEN: When one person is having a bad
day, the other one is right there to hold

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.960
your hand and lift you up.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.289
And that's the same type of caring we give
our patients.

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.200
There's always one of us there to hold their
hand or just to kid of make them smile.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.160
And that's been my whole personality ever
since I was young.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.280
And it's just been fulfilled by being a nurse
here at Maine Medical Center.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.860
Good luck to you Theodore.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.400
