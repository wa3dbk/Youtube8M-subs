00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.979
It was a Monday morning quiet, like.

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.619
I was sitting at my desk enjoying the daily cup of joe and browsing the old tweethorn, when the dame blew in.

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:11.860
She was all kitten heels and crocodile tears and looking for my help.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.379
Didn't anyone ever teach you to knock?

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.820
Well, I'm sorry, but you've got to help me. My husband thinks I've had an affair.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.620
Well, did ya?

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.460
How dare you?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.010
The problem you see is my husband and I we both have brown eyes and the baby's got blue. My husband thinks I've been off cavorting

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.700
with some blue eyed cad some stud, but it's not true...

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.220
The broad kept yammering but I'd already spotted her problem.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.840
I've never cheated, I've never strayed, I've never done anything wrong.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.240
You stumbled across some biology darlin'

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.918
If you've got the dough I'll explain it right to you.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.440
She nodded that she had.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.900
Fine, you just found a recessive gene you see.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.640
A what?

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.860
A recessive gene. Now we'll go back to the start.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.380
You get one copy of each gene from your mother and one copy of each gene from your father.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.849
And sometimes these genes come in two varieties

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.530
dominant and recessive

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.760
So let's say you get a dominant allele from...

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.280
Allele?

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.420
It's like the flavor of a gene. Genes that have multiple types are said to have multiple alleles

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.128
For example those earlobes hang off those sea shells of yours

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.819
They could be hang or they could be attached and those possibilities are determined by which alleles of the earlobe gene you get.

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.289
You get that hanging varieties or the attached varieties you follow?

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.326
I think so

00:01:20.326 --> 00:01:21.569
Well alright then

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.939
Let's say you have two alleles for eye color one of them gives you blue eyes and the other gives you brown eyes

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.610
now you get one copy of the gene from your mother and one copy of the gene from your father and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.770
they can be dominant or recessive

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.850
So let's say here that brown eyes are dominant and blue eyes are recessive if you have two copies of the dominant brown gene

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.309
You'll have brown eyes. If you have two copies of the blue-eyed recessive gene you'll have blue eyes

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.199
but if you have one copy of the brown-eyed gene and one copy of a blue-eyed gene

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.280
The dominant gene wins and you'll still have brown eyes.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.340
Well, how is this supposed to help me?

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.290
I'm getting there doll-face give me a minute

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.239
Now you and your husband were both probably carrying

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.549
a recessive blue-eyed allele behind those big brown saucers of yours. Now this here is called a punnett square

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.289
You put your husband's alleles up top and yours down the side

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.920
now you combine them in these boxes to see what combinations your child might have

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.060
Your little squirt's got a 75% chance of having brown eyes, and a 25% chance of having blue eyes

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.040
Assuming you and your husband both had one copy of the brown allele and one copy of the blue.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.020
So that's it. That's all. Well. Thank you. I...

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.760
Not so fast babe. There's a bit more. This is a nice example you see,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.560
one they like to an all the textbooks, but it ain't true and they ain't being square

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.499
There's more than just one gene that controls eye colour. There's lots.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.750
That's why you don't have just brown and blue eyes in the world you got all different various shades and patterns

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.680
But this idea of dominant recessive genes â€” that's one to remember

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.850
so what do I tell my husband?

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.480
You tell him you had an affair.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.360
But I told you I didn't

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.480
Well didn't you?

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.300
And then just like she'd arrived she blew out with a thundercloud dropping  little raindrops on the wood floor.

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.329
That'd be the last I'd see of her.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.500
Or was it?

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.900
Go forth
do science
