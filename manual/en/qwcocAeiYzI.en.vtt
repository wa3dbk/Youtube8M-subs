00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:12.781
You are made to be ruled.

00:00:17.027 --> 00:00:17.864
In the end...

00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:23.446
there will be every man for himself.

00:00:32.635 --> 00:00:33.407
What do we do?

00:00:35.818 --> 00:00:36.762
We get ready.

00:00:42.013 --> 00:00:43.260
There was an idea...

00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:49.021
to bring together a group of remarkable people.

00:00:50.897 --> 00:00:55.294
So when we needed them, 
they could fight the battles...

00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:57.458
that we never could.

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:03.744
Gentleman.

00:01:05.052 --> 00:01:07.183
What are you prepared to do?

00:01:10.712 --> 00:01:12.717
No offence, but I don't play well with others.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.510
Big man in a suit of armor.
Take that away, what are you?

00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:18.224
A genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist.

00:01:31.828 --> 00:01:33.694
If we can't protect the earth, -

00:01:35.313 --> 00:01:37.092
you can be damn sure we'll avenge it.

00:01:45.698 --> 00:01:48.377
The Avengers

00:01:48.664 --> 00:01:55.085
Dr. Banner. Your work is in unparalleled.
And I'm a huge fan of the way
 you lose control and turn into
an enormous green rage monster.

00:01:57.053 --> 00:01:57.796
Thanks.
