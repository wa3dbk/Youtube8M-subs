00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.030
Which greenhouse is this?

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.320
&gt;&gt; Okay, now this is A3
&gt;&gt; A3.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.880
&gt;&gt; And, Eric I'm sorry, but you're

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.160
gonna have to get your feet
wet again. &gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.650
&gt;&gt; I'd like you to meet somebody.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.300
&gt;&gt; I don't even care anymore.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.710
It's actually getting fun now.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.160
&gt;&gt; This is Emily Grant Hutchings.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.280
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh she's beautiful!

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.919
&gt;&gt; She is my favorite pink.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.800
She is beautiful.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.530
&gt;&gt; She's massive.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in another month,
she'll be much more massive.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.590
Now, in real life Emily
might not have liked to hear

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.640
you say that she was massive, but
I don't think this Emily will care.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.780
&gt;&gt; What size pot is that?

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.680
&gt;&gt; This is a 16 by 7 inch pot.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.782
Oh, that's good size pot.

00:00:41.782 --> 00:00:45.150
&gt;&gt; And, this is one that
they can really grow into.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.800
You can always plant one in
a bigger pot than this, and

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.350
it will appreciate it,
but it will do just fine.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.750
&gt;&gt; So these are the same leaf,
right?

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a newer leaf.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.630
This is a little bit older leaf.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.983
And, as you can see-
&gt;&gt; That's a great look in a pond.

00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:00.660
&gt;&gt; It's a-
&gt;&gt; Two different colors.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.180
&gt;&gt; It's a bronzy look, but

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.810
it's a lighter bronze than you found
in the Maroon Beauty, in the red.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.860
&gt;&gt; Night bloomer, right?

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.150
Even though it's daytime.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.670
&gt;&gt; Even though it's daytime, it's
9 o'clock, it's still fully open,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.330
9 in the morning.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.382
&gt;&gt; Let me smell her.

00:01:14.382 --> 00:01:15.482
&gt;&gt; It's coffee time.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.620
&gt;&gt; Emily smells beautiful, too.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.900
So, Emily Grant Hutchings was
hybridized by George Pring.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.312
Came out in 1922, so-
&gt;&gt; '22?

00:01:27.312 --> 00:01:27.885
&gt;&gt; '22.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.340
It's a-
&gt;&gt; Okay George,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.500
I gotta remember this guy's name,
too.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.720
I know the Slocums, the and Nelson.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.549
&gt;&gt; Yeah, George Pring.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.117
And, it came as
a seedling out of C.E.

00:01:41.117 --> 00:01:44.480
Hutchings, which was her husband.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.800
And they were friends
with George Pring.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.200
In Missouri George Pring
was a famous hybridizer at

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.120
Missouri Botanical Garden. And-

00:01:55.124 --> 00:01:57.738
&gt;&gt; Like a scientific hybridizer or

00:01:57.738 --> 00:02:00.070
an accidental hybridizer?

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.858
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he was more of
an intentional hybridizer.

00:02:01.858 --> 00:02:03.628
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yes, he did a lot of intentional

00:02:03.628 --> 00:02:07.500
hybridizing rather than
accidental bee pollinating.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.719
So, she was a seedling off of what
was named after her husband, so

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.610
it was kind of natural for
Pring to name it after her.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.976
She was also famous back then
in her own right because she.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.480
Wrote a book, and
she wrote it as the medium for

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.075
Mark Twain through a weegie board after he died.

00:02:30.075 --> 00:02:31.211
&gt;&gt; What?

00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:34.698
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That's wicked!

00:02:34.698 --> 00:02:36.877
&gt;&gt; So, she's probably more famous
than that, than she is for

00:02:36.877 --> 00:02:39.320
the water lily. But-

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.170
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna have to check

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.790
that one out.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Emily Grant.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.180
&gt;&gt; She-
&gt;&gt; So she was into weegie boards?

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah, she communicated with Mark
Twain through the ouija board and

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.750
wrote an entire book
through the weegie board.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.154
&gt;&gt; That is a cool story for
water gardening.

00:02:54.154 --> 00:02:55.308
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I mean, I never even heard

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:55.877
such a thing.

00:02:55.877 --> 00:02:58.332
&gt;&gt; You never even know [LAUGH].
&gt;&gt; So 1922, okay.

00:02:58.332 --> 00:03:00.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was in 1917
that she wrote the book.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.395
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Well,

00:03:01.395 --> 00:03:03.581
that Mark Twain wrote the book
after he was dead [LAUGH].

00:03:04.862 --> 00:03:06.680
&gt;&gt; Mind blown right now.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.900
This is amazing.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.750
&gt;&gt; So-
&gt;&gt; So George Prune you said, right?

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.570
Is that right?
&gt;&gt; Pring.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.650
&gt;&gt; Pring, George Pring.
&gt;&gt; P-R, like Pringles potato chips.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.970
&gt;&gt; Pringles, okay.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.870
&gt;&gt; George Pring.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.419
&gt;&gt; So once again, so this is a night
bloomer, but it's kind of red, but

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:21.290
it's pink.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.020
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.140
&gt;&gt; But, it's kind of a cross because
it has the green leaves, but

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.100
they come up kind of bronze.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.300
That's what I'm kind
of getting from-

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.310
&gt;&gt; Right, it's in-between.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.247
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
from our talk from the reds.

00:03:30.247 --> 00:03:30.870
&gt;&gt; It's in-between.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.400
&gt;&gt; We're moving towards-
&gt;&gt; The white will have green leaves,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.850
the red will have more red leaves,
and the pink is in-between.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.360
&gt;&gt; We have another,
you have another pink, right?

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.420
&gt;&gt; Yes, we do have another pink.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.760
&gt;&gt; Okay, I just don't know if
I wanna leave Emily yet and

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.800
move to the other pink.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.690
Yeah, I'm kinda
mesmerized right now.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.450
&gt;&gt; It is very cool.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.710
&gt;&gt; All right,
let's go check out the other pink.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.930
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.260
&gt;&gt; Where's she at?

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.440
Is she a she?

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.690
The other pink?

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.900
&gt;&gt; She is an it.
&gt;&gt; An it, okay.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.750
&gt;&gt; State of Texas, Texas Shell Pink.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.130
&gt;&gt; All right, let's go find out,
let's go to Texas.
