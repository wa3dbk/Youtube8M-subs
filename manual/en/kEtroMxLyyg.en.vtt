You have got curly hair running through your
family and you're not sure what to do. You

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:14.320
have biracial hair, African American hair,
you've got crazy hair. Well my name is Sylvia

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.080
Russell and I'm going to tell you how to care
for African American hair, biracial, or ethnic

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:29.260
hair and things to avoid. Now remember biracial
hair tends to be a lot more curly, sometimes

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.520
even curlier than what you see in front of
you. Biracial hair needs to be handled with

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.600
care. We need to use good shampoos and conditioners,
moisturizers, things that can give the hair

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.300
shine and moisture, something that will hold
and attach to the hair to keep the hair's

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:55.719
emolliency. Remember the hair always combs
better when wet, not dry so before combing

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:02.199
any knots and tangles be sure that you wet
the hair and use a leave in conditioner or

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.330
a detangler to help detangle your biracial
hair. Now if you have African American hair

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:16.140
things to avoid is excessive heat. Over using
chemicals too much by overlapping chemicals

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.810
on your hair is very bad. Make sure that you
visit a professional and see someone that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.659
can help you care for your hair. You don't
want to brush and comb daily. You want to

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.700
find a hairstyle that is suitable for your
work and lifestyle, something that is easy

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.610
to maintain. Using shampoos and conditioners
that can help you maintain your hairstyle

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:47.470
is very important. Home care can be something
that you can do but getting professional care

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.430
can give you the hair that you want, long,
strong, beautiful, healthy hair. Now remember

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.689
there are tons of products on the market,
make sure and ready your labels and buy products

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.770
that are specific for your hair type. If you
have ethnic hair, African American hair or

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:14.349
biracial hair, moisture is vital. Less heat
is always more and visiting your professional

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.600
on a regular basis can help you achieve the
look that you desire. Remember finding the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.510
right haircare products, the right stylist
and avoiding all the pitfalls can help you

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.860
have beautiful hair. My name is Sylvia Russell
and this is how you can care for African American

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.150
biracial or ethnic hair and the things to
avoid.
