00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.300
Now we're going to talk about how to store
wine. You may be a collector in which case

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.760
you might have a cellar. More likely you're
like myself and just like wine but don't have

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.210
a cellar. If you don't have a cellar, the
ways to store wine, the most important thing

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.020
about wine is it needs to be kept in a steady
temperature, a cool temperature, out of light

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.250
and away from vibrations. I myself live in
a flat so I tend to store my wines in the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.809
kitchen in the coolers cupboard of the kitchen,
out against a wall that's never exposed to

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.929
sun. Having found your location where there's
no light, no vibration, and you've got a steady

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:47.841
temperature, preferably around twelve degrees
centigrade, eight to sixteen is fine, but

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:54.889
it needs to be cool. And dark, and no vibration.
You need to take your wines and you need to

00:00:54.889 --> 00:01:01.309
lay them down on their side. This is a typical
wine rack you would find at the shops, which

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.470
puts the wines slightly so that there's no
air, so that there's no air between the wine

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.750
and the cork. The reason you do that is that
the cork if it dries, it actually shrinks

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.160
and it lets air in. Once it gets more air
circulating into the wine, it oxidizes and

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.280
ages your wine. Oxidation is fine in very,
very small quantities because that's how you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.550
actually age your wine. But if you have too
much air in there by having a dry cork, which

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.880
you will get if you stored your wine standing
up, by having too much air in there, circulating

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.810
your wine ages much faster. And in most cases
wines are dated and have a recommended time

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.970
to drink. So if you think you're going to
drink your wine in two years time, yet it's

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.790
exposed to air, you might find the wine has
gone off by that time or is not at its best.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.610
Sometimes when the air is away from the wine
if the wine gets warmer, for any reason and

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:11.269
expands slightly, it pushes itself out and
it actually creates a wet and rotting cork.

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:17.380
So you want to at the best to have the air
bubble actually touching the cork as well

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.840
as the wine itself. The wine has to be in
contact with the cork to prevent the cork

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.810
drying out, shrinking and letting air in,
therefore oxidizing your wine. Red wines and

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.520
white wines can be stored in exactly the same
way if they are - have a cork enclosure, so

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.859
on their side in dark, in the cold, no vibration.
These days though, we're now getting wines

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:47.829
with screw caps. These are ideal for white
wines that need to remain fresh. They work

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:54.060
well with red wines as well, because they
create a hermetic seal so no air gets in or

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.220
out, it means your wine can actually be stored
upright in this case, and you are not actually

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.129
having to worry about a cork being kept wet.
Furthermore in the modern world it means that

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:10.959
you can put them up - you can store more bottles
of wonderful wine in your kitchen cupboard

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:17.540
or under the stairs. Or in a wardrobe somewhere.
These have the flexibility that you can put

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.599
them on their side, and you can have them
upright, no problem with air circulation whatsoever.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:28.169
We have yet to see how they will age the more
expensive wines that need to be aged for five,

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:35.439
ten, fifteen years. What we have found is
that they will keep a young wine fresh and

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.069
crisp, a young white wine. When you've got
a cellar sometimes your wine will come in

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.969
wooden boxes such as these, best is to leave
them within the wooden box on a shelf somewhere

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:52.799
within your cellar. Same if you just have
a normal kitchen place to store. If they're

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:59.019
sealed it keeps the air steady, it keeps them
in the dark, and then you can conveniently

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.730
shove them somewhere under the kitchen units.
And they will be fine there. But the key thing

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.719
about storing wine is that aspect about no
vibration, no temperature fluctuations. But

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:15.469
obviously temperature fluctuations do happen.
The important thing there is that they're

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:21.260
very slow. If you have sudden changes in temperature,
that has a big effect on wine. Another very

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.120
important thing is wine shouldn't be stored
above eighteen degrees centigrade or twenty

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.780
 - the drinking temperature basically, because
above that you're starting to seriously damage

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.590
your wine, and also you shouldn't really store
your wine anywhere near freezing point so

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.941
we are saying about four to six degrees centigrade.
Below that, water starts crystallizing. So

00:04:43.941 --> 00:04:43.970
that's how we store wine.
