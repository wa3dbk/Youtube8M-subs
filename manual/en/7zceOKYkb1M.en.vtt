00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:09.750
well I went to a local propane dealer to
get my tank filled up thirty bucks

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.820
twenty nine sixty that seem like a lot
sure does seem like a lot for a thirty

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.670
pound tank and they had another big
propane tank there that I asked him for

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.580
and it's the old-style valve that you
can't fill up and it was sitting there

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.200
where they refill these I said what you
gonna do with that they goes throw it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.690
away if we get the valve off I said well
can I have it

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.450
they said you promised me you take the
valve off you can have it and I assured

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.550
him that I knew how to purge him and and
I am going to make an upright wood stove

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.699
out of this for the shop what I'm using
right now is a really old cast-iron

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.270
Sears full of air leaks you just can't
control the the temperature you can't

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.310
control the air going in the best you
can do is choke it down till it smokes

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.640
and then back off a little bit so it
either runs too hot or it just burns up

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.290
the wood so I'm gonna make one really
airtight and it's gonna be sort of a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.509
pot-bellied stove it's gonna be an
upright stove anyway I got to get a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.470
couple of things a leg I think I have
enough flat steel to make a top but I

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.490
got to get a some 6-inch pipe for the
flue pipe for the stovepipe and I may

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.009
actually not actually get to this till
spring summer because I got a lot of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.560
other things I got to do first but the
next winter I will have this in my shop

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.689
and and I'm probably just gonna sell
that cast-iron one it's really dangerous

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.920
it's so full of air leaks that you can't
control them you know I could fill them

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.579
up and fill the air leaks up and all
that but I don't want to I just want to

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.840
build one myself out of this kind of
metal that's the last you know probably

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.270
a lifetime alright just thought I'd show
you my latest treasure gave it to me for

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.700
free it's probably worth you
five six bucks crap and uh they just

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.450
gave it to me
