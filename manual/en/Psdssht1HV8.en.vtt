00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.900
These are the jewels I'm going to be using
on Maddie today. These ones are rectangular

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.679
Princess, or Emerald cut and I'm going to
be using the purple ones so that it'll tie

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.100
in the purple underneath her eyes to the top
of her eyes. To apply the jewels, I'm going

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.630
to be using just eyelash glue. This is a waterproof,
so it's a really strong hold so that it can

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.230
hold up the jewels. And what you want to do
is just put a teeny little dot in the center

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:44.880
of the jewel and as you press it onto her
face, that'll spread out.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.579
and then you just put it on her face, hold
it for a second and then give it some space

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.079
to dry. There could be some glue that seeps
out the corners, but that's okay because it

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:12.680
dries clear. She won't ever be able to see
it. As you can see right there, the glue seeping

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:24.200
out. But it is no problem and I'm just going
to apply these on kind of the few of the points

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:50.970
of her eye shadow to accentuate the detail.
With smaller jewels, it's easier to use tweezers

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.590
to apply them because they're hard to hold
in your hands, but these ones are just big

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:10.250
enough that I can hold them between my fingers
as I apply them. And you can set them on there

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.780
and then move them to face the direction that
you want them to face, while they're still

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:30.209
wet.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.239
And there's the last jewel.
