00:00:05.823 --> 00:00:08.943
Give me instructions on how to fix PS4 Error
CE-30784-2.

00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:09.943
Bingo!

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:17.783
No, seriously, it is an error from my PlayStation
4.

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:20.353
It is a PlayStation upgrade error.

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.862
So what the heck do I do about it?

00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:28.282
The PlayStation has trouble and it is sometimes
caused by the PS4 seeing a USB stick with

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:31.853
more memory than the FAT32 requirement.

00:00:31.853 --> 00:00:34.583
I do not even know what that means.

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:40.353
It means you might be able to run the update
off a USB stick with only 2 gigabytes of memory,

00:00:40.353 --> 00:00:45.533
after it fails when you try one with more
space, because it cannot handle the partition

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:53.933
being 2 GB on 64 GB USB, but can read 2 GB
on a 2 GB USB.

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.143
And a partridge in a pear tree.

00:00:56.143 --> 00:01:01.923
Seriously, try running the update from a USB
stick with less memory, and see if that works

00:01:01.923 --> 00:01:08.343
because it does not have other partitions
over the 2GB that seem to confuse the PS4.

00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:12.552
I do not know if I have any USB sticks with
that little memory anymore.

00:01:12.552 --> 00:01:17.412
There’s probably a commemorative keychain
with a USB stick with that little space somewhere

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:22.492
in a glove box or that drawer for all the
other crap you could not bear to throw out.

00:01:22.492 --> 00:01:25.723
What’s another possible solution?

00:01:25.723 --> 00:01:29.872
Sometimes the problem is the connection on
which you’re trying to run the update.

00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:33.303
Switch from WiFi to Ethernet and it might
work.

00:01:33.303 --> 00:01:37.992
If we’re going backwards, I might as well
try a plugged in internet connection.

00:01:37.992 --> 00:01:40.983
That’s the next thing to try on the list.

00:01:40.983 --> 00:01:43.423
Should I try clay tablets?

00:01:43.423 --> 00:01:45.823
The PS4 cannot read that.

00:01:45.823 --> 00:01:51.783
Side note – the issue is usually caused
when the PS4 cannot read the memory stick,

00:01:51.783 --> 00:01:57.263
so sometimes formatting the USB stick with
a different version of Windows may work.

00:01:57.263 --> 00:02:00.213
Do I have to go back to a Windows XP?

00:02:00.213 --> 00:02:05.402
It may be as easy as formatting the USB stick
with a Windows 7 before putting the updates

00:02:05.402 --> 00:02:10.022
on it, if a Windows 8 PC formatted it and
it did not work.

00:02:10.022 --> 00:02:14.053
So the issue is the formatting of the USB
drive that you’re trying to run the patch

00:02:14.053 --> 00:02:15.173
from.

00:02:15.173 --> 00:02:19.223
That would explain why an older USB drive
would work – it might even date back to

00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:21.423
Windows 3.1.

00:02:21.423 --> 00:02:25.523
Windows 3.1 was before USB drives.

00:02:25.523 --> 00:02:31.223
But you could try reformatting a different
USB drive with the default FAT32 settings

00:02:31.223 --> 00:02:33.003
and then run the update.

00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:38.653
I’m going to end up formatting and updating
from several different ones until it works.

00:02:38.653 --> 00:02:44.083
Kind of like finding a working HDMI and audio
cable on the PlayStation 4.

00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:48.203
Which is why I liked their wireless controllers
and WiFi connections in the first place.
