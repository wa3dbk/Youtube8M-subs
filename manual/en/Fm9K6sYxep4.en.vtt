00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.640
Due in large part to my extraordinary laziness,
I don’t usually prepare my own meals.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.890
That’s why Jesus invented takeout.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.720
But I’m pretty sure that frying stuff doesn’t
require electricity—at least, not an open

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.760
beam of electricity.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.120
And even if it did, I mean...I think there’s
probably a difference between frying things

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.220
and electrocuting them.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.769
That line is crossed in Don’t Fry The Frog.

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:58.250
I feel like I should be wearing rubber gloves.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:07.409
Don’t Fry The Frog is both a brand new App
Store game and a command that, in this particular

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.790
case, is virtually impossible to obey.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.350
Much as you’d like not to, you will fry
the frog.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.170
And it will be electrocuted to death.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:26.270
Have you no conscience, oh Grim Reaper?

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.999
The debut project of the independent developer
Blacktorch Games, Don’t Fry The Frog is

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:34.390
built entirely around multitouch.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.039
With two fingers on the iPhone, you summon
a beam of electricity between them...a beam

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.340
you can manipulate simply by moving your fingers.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.549
Move them further apart, and the beam grows.

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.450
Pinch them together, and the beam shrinks.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.450
The beam shrinks.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.450
It was in the pool!

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.709
So you move this beam and use it to electrocute
flies.

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.229
See, there’s a frog on the screen, and apparently,
it’s on a strict diet.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.409
He’s only allowed to eat so-called healthy
flies, which means you have to zap all the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.810
bad flies while doing your best not to fry
the frog...hence the title.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.040
If the frog eats a bad fly, it actually gets
fatter.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.459
Which forces both you and its heart to work
harder.

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:30.500
It’s a really simple concept, but the game
throws in plenty of twists to keep things

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.500
interesting.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.490
The healthy flies are essentially the game’s
power-ups, so if the frog eats one of the

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.190
blue flies, it temporarily freezes him.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.251
That lets you kill all the other flies on
screen without having to worry about the frog

00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:43.490
getting in your way.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.290
Although, again...I don’t cook a lot and
I eat with a blatant disregard for my own

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.430
health, but since when is a meal that renders
you immobile considered the healthy option?

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.780
Countering the effects of those healthy flies
is a selection of flies are that even less

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.280
healthy than the normal ones.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.360
Some of them are on fire, some are infected...and
if the frog eats one of those, it’s obviously

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.760
bad news.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.740
Don’t Fry The Frog is really frantic, and
it usually only takes about a minute or so

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.200
for things to get difficult.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.600
In fact, it kind of reminds me of the fly-swatting
game in Mario Paint, only with really sweet

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.470
multitouch controls and more replay value.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.080
You can purchase several kinds of helpful
upgrades, and you can also chain together

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.270
combos by keeping your fingers on the screen.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.170
Which is easier said than done.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.070
This is a fantastic iPhone game that really
utilizes the strengths of the platform.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.541
The multitouch controls are great, and while
it can be difficult to see the screen when

00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:48.580
you have two hands moving all over the place,
that’s actually part of the fun.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.630
It’s simple, it’s addictive, it somehow
makes extermination fun.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.010
You might call it shocking.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:06.590
It’s Don’t Fry The Frog for the iPhone.
