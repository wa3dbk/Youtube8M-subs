Hi, my name is Paul Becker and I'm going to
talk to you today about playing the blues

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.059
on the piano, some beginner intermediate need
to advance information about the blues and

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.090
I'm doing this for Expert Village. The other
important sound in a blues at least when I

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.720
play it is important to the 7th chords and
the 9th chord, you'll see for an example we

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.369
use a 7th chord in blues on the very first
opening measures of the song. Which isn't

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.120
very common the 7th a lot of times the 7th
used too when you're moving to something else

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.890
but right not at the beginning but we'll inject
the 7th chord right into the beginning of

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:55.280
a song. Just by comparison here like plain
Jane is the sound is without that. (playing

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:08.840
piano) Similarly when I go up to the 4th I'm
almost playing the 9th chord there if I stay

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:22.290
right in that position. Found the G I'm going
to be playing the 9th chord too. (playing

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:31.000
piano) Here's why I like to throw that D in
(playing piano) now these same notes are not

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.120
only important recording but when you're starting
to improvise these are the notes that are

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.880
really going to distinguish the music in blues.
You want to give certain emphasis so for example

00:01:40.880 --> 00:02:12.489
(playing piano) There's a 7th I'm landing
on the 7th using the minor 3rd emphasizing

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:40.860
the 7th, using that flat 5th, 7th, flatted
3rd, 7th. (playing piano) So you want to find

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.650
ways when playing this music to really bring
out what's distinctive in music.
