00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:11.331
Hello, Justin here, how are you doing?

00:00:11.331 --> 00:00:13.212
In this lesson we are going to be checking out

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:16.324
some really cool fingerstyle picking patterns

00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:18.235
just kind of basic ones you might use

00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:20.201
for your normal kind of pop ballad

00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:24.660
Hopefully you've done your finger picking exercise

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.192
that we talked about in the last stage

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.212
just doing thumb-1-2-3

00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:30.842
the fingers' positions are going to be the same

00:00:30.842 --> 00:00:33.796
so make sure you get your thumb here...

00:00:33.796 --> 00:00:35.754
In this case I'm just gonna actually start here

00:00:35.754 --> 00:00:38.033
on the sixth string... Thumb on the sixth string,

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.437
first finger on the third string,

00:00:39.437 --> 00:00:41.597
second finger on second string,

00:00:41.597 --> 00:00:43.957
and third finger on the thinnest string

00:00:43.957 --> 00:00:46.347
now, the first pattern we are going to check out

00:00:46.347 --> 00:00:48.715
just playing a G chord with my left hand

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.484
we are starting here with the thumb on the sixth string

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:54.374
first finger on the third string,

00:00:54.374 --> 00:00:56.371
second finger on the second string,

00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:59.907
and third finger on the thinnest string

00:00:59.907 --> 00:01:01.980
and the pattern we are going to be checking out today

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:10.977
goes like this : it's thumb - 1 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 2

00:01:10.977 --> 00:01:18.510
thumb - 1 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 2

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.950
. . .

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.983
and we are going to do this really slowly together

00:01:25.983 --> 00:01:28.097
so get your G chord on with the left hand

00:01:28.097 --> 00:01:30.140
and lets have a little bit of a go here

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.946
here we go, nice and slow, 3.. 4..

00:01:34.946 --> 00:01:50.607
thumb - 1 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 2

00:01:50.607 --> 00:01:57.976
keep going... 1 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 2

00:01:57.976 --> 00:02:01.249
and the trick here is just to do it over and over again

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.968
so it becomes a little bit automated

00:02:05.568 --> 00:02:06.881
just so you think about it,

00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:08.858
at some point in the near future

00:02:08.858 --> 00:02:12.651
you gonna start changing chords while you're doing this

00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:19.528
the big trick is just to keep doing it over and over again

00:02:21.682 --> 00:02:23.894
once you got the pattern kind of under your fingers

00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:26.064
a good idea is to speed it up a little bit

00:02:26.064 --> 00:02:28.189
maybe getting it up to a speed kind of like

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.372
. . .

00:02:31.372 --> 00:02:34.668
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and

00:02:34.668 --> 00:02:42.284
thumb - 1 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 2

00:02:42.284 --> 00:02:44.235
now, all of those were the G chord

00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:45.888
with the thumb playing the bass note there

00:02:45.888 --> 00:02:47.674
which is on the sixth string

00:02:47.674 --> 00:02:50.551
a really nice little sequence to practice is

00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:56.483
G - D - C - D

00:02:56.483 --> 00:02:57.881
this is a really good one,

00:02:57.881 --> 00:02:59.914
aside from the fact that is actually sounds going nice

00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:01.301
it means that your thumb is moving

00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:03.274
from the sixth string for the G

00:03:03.274 --> 00:03:06.062
over to the fourth string for the D chord

00:03:06.062 --> 00:03:08.292
to the fifth string for the C chord

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:10.636
and back to the fourth string for the D chord

00:03:10.636 --> 00:03:12.752
so really, your thumb is getting a bit of workout

00:03:12.752 --> 00:03:15.020
what you do is to probably just play that pattern

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.963
once on each chord something like this...

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:20.624
so G

00:03:20.624 --> 00:03:24.323
to D

00:03:24.323 --> 00:03:27.613
to C

00:03:27.613 --> 00:03:31.910
to D

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.272
very nice little sequence this one

00:03:35.272 --> 00:03:37.826
you could even say it's a wonderful sequence

00:03:37.826 --> 00:03:46.715
. . .

00:03:46.715 --> 00:03:48.503
so that's the first little chord sequence

00:03:48.503 --> 00:03:50.296
I want you to try and get through

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:52.228
G - D - C - D

00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:56.467
use that little pattern: thumb - 1 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 2

00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:58.456
really, really nice, it's on the website

00:03:58.456 --> 00:03:59.961
it can definitely help to say it,

00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:01.704
it can definitely help to see it as well

00:04:01.704 --> 00:04:03.586
so maybe write down on a piece of paper:

00:04:03.586 --> 00:04:06.102
thumb - 1 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 2 ...

00:04:06.102 --> 00:04:08.099
would be a good thing to have in front of you

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.993
you can kind of almost use it as a little trigger

00:04:09.993 --> 00:04:13.184
just to see it and do it as your eyes follow along

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.862
so maybe check that out

00:04:14.862 --> 00:04:16.395
Now I wanna do another little pattern with you

00:04:16.395 --> 00:04:18.687
this one is this, I'm gonna do it on a C chord,

00:04:18.687 --> 00:04:23.399
and this is thumb - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 3

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:27.161
thumb - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 3

00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:37.785
. . .

00:04:37.785 --> 00:04:40.158
very nice little sequence again

00:04:40.158 --> 00:04:42.798
so you can apply this lots of different ways of course

00:04:42.798 --> 00:04:45.193
you might do it on an E minor

00:04:45.193 --> 00:04:47.564
so thumb will be on the sixth string

00:04:47.564 --> 00:04:55.609
thumb - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 3

00:04:55.609 --> 00:04:57.659
then  maybe to a C chord

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:04.788
thumb - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 3

00:05:04.788 --> 00:05:07.680
to a D chord

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.947
. . .

00:05:11.947 --> 00:05:14.433
E minor

00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:17.946
. . .

00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:19.554
C

00:05:19.554 --> 00:05:21.325
. . .

00:05:21.325 --> 00:05:22.906
of course remembering that with the C

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.323
the thumb is now on the fifth string

00:05:25.323 --> 00:05:28.987
D. And now the thumb is on the fourth string

00:05:28.987 --> 00:05:35.027
. . .

00:05:35.027 --> 00:05:37.752
so that's also a really, really nice little sequence

00:05:37.752 --> 00:05:39.611
the last one I want to explain to you here

00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:41.513
is we kind of looked at it last time,

00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:44.442
but this one I want to describe it to you as being in six

00:05:44.442 --> 00:05:47.254
now you could think of it as kind of two triplets,

00:05:47.254 --> 00:05:51.546
but really what we are going for is 1-2-3-4-5-6

00:05:51.546 --> 00:05:53.152
so if we just do it on the D chord,

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:54.685
we are just going up and down so going

00:05:54.685 --> 00:06:00.096
thumb - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 1

00:06:00.096 --> 00:06:04.756
like 1-2-3-4-5-6...

00:06:04.756 --> 00:06:11.127
then to G: 1-2-3-4-5-6

00:06:11.127 --> 00:06:16.488
D: 1-2-3-4-5-6

00:06:16.488 --> 00:06:19.789
G

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.922
it's a very nice little sequence this one

00:06:21.922 --> 00:06:24.662
and you can work it through lots of different chords

00:06:24.662 --> 00:06:26.514
now we've just gone to an E minor

00:06:26.514 --> 00:06:31.999
maybe go to an A, now we've got a fifth string root

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:35.500
we can go back to E minor even

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.363
we can even go, maybe something radical

00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:40.405
we've just gone to C chord

00:06:40.405 --> 00:06:43.307
with the thumb moving over to the fifth string

00:06:43.307 --> 00:06:45.838
the big key here is making sure that your thumb knows

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:48.163
which the bass note is for each of the chords

00:06:48.163 --> 00:06:49.782
so it knows whether to pluck the sixth string,

00:06:49.782 --> 00:06:52.488
the fifth string or the fourth string

00:06:52.488 --> 00:06:54.917
so have a play around with those three patterns

00:06:54.917 --> 00:06:56.467
see if you can apply them to some songs

00:06:56.467 --> 00:06:59.056
there's a list of songs that use them on the website

00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:00.369
but just use your ears as well,

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:02.544
you might try putting the fingerstyle on a song

00:07:02.544 --> 00:07:04.272
that's not normally fingerstyle

00:07:04.272 --> 00:07:07.001
why not, remember if it sounds good, it is good

00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:07.840
so experiment

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.728
and see what cool things you can come up with

00:07:09.728 --> 00:07:11.784
you might end up writing your own tune even

00:07:11.784 --> 00:07:13.029
wow, cool!

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:15.035
so, have fun with that,

00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:17.110
I shall see you for another lesson really soon

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.555
take care of yourselves, bye bye
