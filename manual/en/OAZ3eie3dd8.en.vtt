00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:11.520
Dicrocoelium dendriticum, also called the
lancet liver fluke, is a tiny parasite fluke

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.580
that uses ants to infect the only animals
he can reproduce in, cows and sheeps.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.890
Once the ant infected, the parasite takes
control of its movements: at night, the ant

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.270
climbs to the top of a blade of grass where
it stays fixed by sticking in its mandibles.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.589
This behaviour increases the probability that
the ant will be accidentaly eaten by a cow

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:40.969
passing by, cow in which the fluke will be
able to reproduce!

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.329
Other brain hacker, maybe you've already met
those 10 to 70 centimeters long worms that

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.359
we call nematomorpha?

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.910
We find them close to the watering holes,
outdoor swimming pools or ponds, because that's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.269
their living environment when adults.

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.800
To reach those watering holes, nematomorpha
takes control of... locusts and grasshoppers!

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.850
How?

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.400
That's easy: once inside the locust, the worm
will secrete proteins that will modify the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.630
activity of the locust's brain, forcing him
to leap into the water every time it gets

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.260
close to a pond (or from your swimming pool)!

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.400
This is when nematomorpha gets out of its
host who doesn't have long to live generally...

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:29.960
Finally, what to think of Toxoplasma gondii,
this unicellular parasite known to give toxoplamosis?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.900
This parasite can only reproduce in cats,
and uses... mice to spread from cat to cat!

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.220
Whereas mice usually tend to avoid places
smelling cats, it has been shown that mice

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.580
infected by Toxoplasma gondii lose this repulsion,
or better, are attracted by this smell!

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.741
In the end, infected mice have more chances
to walk in places frequented by cats, and

00:01:53.741 --> 00:02:00.270
thus more chances to get caught by a cat,
to nematomorpha's great delight!

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.880
All those animals are called parasites because
they develop and reproduce at the expense

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.960
of other organisms.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.940
Throughout evolution, those three parasites
we have seen have developed strategies allowing

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.220
them to use other intermediate species and
modify their behavior to spread and join the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.640
species or medium in which they can reproduce.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.270
Could the same thing happen in humans?

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.600
Could a parasite hack our brain?

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.850
Well, the last parasite we've just seen, Toxoplasma
gondii, can actually infecte humans in addition

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.140
to mice, and it is estimated that around one
third of the world population could be infected!

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.790
Most of the time not dangerous for humans
(except for the foetus), recent studies have

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.590
nonetheless shown associations between Toxoplasma
gondii and affective and neurologic disorders.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.630
For example, there are correlations between
the infection by Toxoplasma gondii and schizophrenia,

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.270
and other more bizarre correlations like a
higher probability to get involved into car

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.400
crashes when we are infected!

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.280
Though it is not yet possible to affirm that
Toxoplasma gondii is causing those behaviours

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.860
(it could be for example that it's being schizophrenic
that increases the chance to get infected

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.020
by Toxoplasma gondii), it's a studied possibility
especially knowing its manipulative abilities

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.900
in mice!

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.140
And maybe this could explain the strange phenomenon
of "cat ladies", those old women who like

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.599
to own dozens of cats.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:37.680
What if Toxoplasma gondii was behind this?
