00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.720
Hey, this is day 14 since 
I had my rhinoplasty operation.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.880
Because it's 2 weeks
since the operation now,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.360
this will probably be
my last video I guess.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.920
Because not much is
really changing now,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.000
so I haven't really got
much else to report.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.120
It is going to be quite a
slow process from now,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.860
I think with the tiny
changes of healing.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.540
So, yeah, I just wanted
to say that today,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.120
there really wasn't much change
to what I should expect.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.510
It's not dramatically changing
from day to day anymore.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.990
 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.960
Sometimes my nose seems
to ache I think.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.630
It feels like if I touch it,
it's a bit bruised.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.670
It is not bruised, 
but it feels kind of tender.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.330
Obviously and that will
just a go away in time.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.340
And my scars are still
like healing up,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.960
and starting to fade away
more and more.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.850
I still got some blood in my nose

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.940
which is coming out
every so often.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.490
Not really much else to
say except from that.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.960
Like I said it is going to be a
really slow process from now on.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.130
So, I don't think there will be
much more videos I will be making.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.000
This is kind of just
to wrap it up, really.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.220
I am still doing the
tape nose thing.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.970
I feel like it kind of just keeps
it in place while I am sleeping.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.010
So that's quite useful.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.370
And I think that's
about it really.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.000
 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.000
Like I said, I could
just wrap it up

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.070
and say that it's been a
really good experience.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.090
Much better than I actually
thought I would have.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.150
I thought I would be
in a lot more pain.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.050
I thought I would have
a lot more bruising.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.750
I thought um, well I was worried
that I wouldn't get what I wanted.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.330
Like as one, I've never had
cosmetic surgery before

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.000
you get a panic about the idea,
well what if it goes wrong?

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.300
What if I don't get what I want?

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.570
What if it is not
what I expected?

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.040
What if I can't do
anything about it?

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.810
Which are just I think are
normal worries for anybody.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.210
But no, perfectly happy,
he kept it very natural.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.120
Like most people I see, 
say like it does look natural

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.630
even thought they know
I have had a nose job.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.800
They say like it still
looks really natural.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.370
So if they didn't know me they
wouldn't have known anyway.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.760
So, I am really happy with that, 
and it really compliments my face I think.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.830
He's done a really
good job at kind of,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.230
keeping my natural
shape of my nose.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.350
But then also like
tailoring it in,

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.500
so that it kind of makes
it more feminine shape.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.380
So he's done a really
good job with that.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.310
So I am happy with
everything so far.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.860
Great people, great service.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.620
Obviously if I wanted anything else
I would go back to them,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.510
because I have had such good
experience with this so far.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.640
I trust them with other
things if I would do that,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.040
which I don't know if I would.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.600
Just because I am worried about the
whole kind of cosmetic addiction thing

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.610
that people say about,
same with tattoos.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.620
So I think I have done this,
I am really happy with the results,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.840
and I will just
leave it at that.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.210
But yeah, really happy
with the results so far.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.060
I think it is starting
to go down even more.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.290
So yeah it is all good so far.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.370
I think that's about it,
I don't know what else

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.780
I can really say unfortunately.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.030
So, yeah, I will just wrap it
up with saying it is all good.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.910
If I do another video then
that might be in quite a while

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.690
maybe just to see the result in
a few months time, we will see.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.370
But at the moment I don't think
there isn't any much point,

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.140
because it isn't changing
dramatically anymore.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.460
And even I can't really notice
the difference day by day.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.280
So I don't know how
anyone watching this can.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.510
So, yeah if you are thinking of
getting a nose job, don't panic,

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.170
because as you can see
I didn't need to.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.780
Even though I did a bit, 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.590
even though I might have
hidden it quite well.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.810
So yeah, just be very specific
in what you ask for.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.660
I think I went above
and beyond specific.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.990
It must have been
quite annoying.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.530
Yeah and just be honest
with what you want,

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.710
and Dr. De Silva will be honest
back of what's realistic,

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.940
and what's actually achievable.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.330
And hopefully you will be as
happy as I am with the result.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.540
So, just be smart basically.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.890
So, yeah that's about it.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.860
So, thanks for watching, 
and I hope I have been helpful

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.210
with like kind of the
whole experience,

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.090
and what I felt in by the 
day by day changes and stuff.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.960
Yeah and hopefully it will come
in handy to anyone watching this

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.340
and is thinking of having
rhinoplasty themselves.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.530
Or is going for it 
and wants to know

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.110
how long it takes to heal,
I guess.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.680
I'm sure if probably if one does it
different times like their body heals

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.530
in different ways,
different times.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.920
But, yeah, hope 
I have been helpful.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.820
So, thank you for watching.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.730
Any questions I am sure 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.200
Dr. De Silva will be able
to answer them.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.010
And um, yeah that's it.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.810
So, maybe see you soon,
probably not.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.110
And um, yeah good luck
with whatever rhinoplasty 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.250
you may, or may not have.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.450
Okay, bye guys.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:33.073
