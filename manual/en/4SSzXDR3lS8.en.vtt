00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.880
&gt;&gt;The Toyota Fortuner is big, butch and looks
really purposeful as an SUV.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.690
The Mahindra XUV500, however, looks like it’s
trying too hard – it looks a little over

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.840
designed.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.980
Both vehicles have their share of fans, but
you have to hand it to the Fortuner for its

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.370
more pure SUV styling and robust build quality.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.530
The Fortuner and the XUV500 are spacious vehicles.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.870
The XUV though has almost no space for luggage
with all three rows of seats in use.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.720
But in middle row comfort, the XUV is better
than the Fortuner.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.890
And when it comes to features – well, the
XUV just runs away with the game.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.500
It simply has a very, very long feature list
– six airbags, cruise control, hill-hold

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.310
control, micro-hybrid system, cornering lamps,
the XUV just has a lot more to offer.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.850
When it comes to ride quality though, the
Fortuner has a more settled ride, while the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.500
XUV is like an excited puppy.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.290
It doesn’t feel as solid as the Fortuner.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.250
The Fortuner beats the XUV on engine power,
with its 3-litre 169 bhp engine.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.990
But the XUV’s 2.2 litre 140 bhp engine sounds
quieter, and it has a six-speed gearbox, that

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.550
helps in better mileage.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:54.180
The XUV can do 15 kilometers to the liter,
while the Fortuner barely manages about 10.5.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.330
When you consider the fact that you’re paying
nearly Rs. 7 lakh less for the Mahindra XUV500

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.759
and getting a lot more than the Fortuner offers,
there’s simply no argument that the XUV

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.830
is better value for money.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.170
But in terms of build quality and long-term
reliability, you can’t go wrong with a Fortuner.
