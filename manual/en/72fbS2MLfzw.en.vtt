Generations of immigrants

to our national security
and our men and woman

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:28.281

I love Meryl

Her husband knows I love her,
Michelle knows I love her

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.576
there's nothing either
of them can do about it.

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:58.278
Narrator: That night the

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:00.647
reached by the grand jury
in Ferguson, Missouri.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.181
The President: But what we
want to do is to make sure

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:05.885
that we're also focusing on
those who can offer the kind

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:11.357
of real progress that
we know is possible.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.326

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:16.496
the St. Louis
region, in Missouri,

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.665

are looking for.

us all together.

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:33.012
That's what's at
stake when we have

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:34.781
conversions about
immigration.

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.382
That's what's at stake
when we have conversations

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:37.650
about Ferguson.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.554
Are we going to live up to
those ideas of who we are

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:45.325
as a people and it falls
on all of us to hand down

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:50.730
to our kids a country that
lives up to that promise.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.533
Where America is the
place where we can make

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:54.934
it if we try.

long White House tradition

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:00.306
and pardoned the hand
selected turkey.

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:02.542
Sparing the bird from someone's
dinner table and assuring

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:04.744
the rest of its days are
spent roaming a farm

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.714
or doing whatever it is
that turkeys like to do.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:10.216
Children: (inaudible)

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:15.254
