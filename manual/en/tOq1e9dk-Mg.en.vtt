Hey this is Daniel from Adorama.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.530
Were here in New York City in our world
headquarters and today we're going to

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.809
talk about the Nikon 58mm f/1.4G Nikkor Lens.

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.420
So let's get started. So the Nikon AF-S

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.100
58mm f/1.4G lens is a
Nikon F bayonet type

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.289
lens. It'll cover both FX and DX formats.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.519
9 lens elements, two of which are aspherical.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.800
With nine aperture blades you get a nice
clean round

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.780
out of focus area. It will help with flayer. It takes a 72 millimetre filter.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.040
Weighs in at 13.6 ounces. I really
like this lens.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.420
I think it's great for kinda walking
around as a general purpose lens. It's a good

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.090
normal focal length on FX camera like
this. Gives you

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.160
different portraits  good for just general
stuff.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.990
If you're using a DX camera the field
of view puts you right around where

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.620
eighty-five would be which is kinda
short portrait lens.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.170
It's also very fast, it’s a f/1.4, so if you are
a zoom user and you're looking for your

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.190
first prime lens or a prime lens to add to your kit

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.870
this could be a really good option. It kinda puts you right in the middle of

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.870
where your zoom would be.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.600
So this lens has all the high end features
you’d expect from Nikon.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.430
It has the silent wave motor. It has kind of a
one-touch manual focus.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.990
You've got the nanocrystal coating on
the lens which can help with

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.240
lens flare. It's also got two spherical
elements in there so your gonna have sharp images

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.640
straight across the whole frame and there a nine-blade aperture which gives you

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.380
nice round out-of-focus highlights.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.090
So I had this 58mm lens from Nikon, the f/1.4 for about a week or

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.979
so. I took it out,

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.360
I shot some portraits out with it. I went to the Renaissance Fair it was really fun.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.330
It's really nice lens it’s a good format. It
allows you to get in close to your subject

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.920
and really get comfortable.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.910
A lot of times people will shoot portrait
with long lenses which is of course is

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:43.750
very acceptable.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.020
I like to kind of be close to my subject when I’m doing a 3/4. So I like

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.040
this focal length, it's really nice. Its got the nano crystal coding and all that

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.549
fancy stuff so you don't have any flare.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.280
So I mentioned a little bit but this lens is
actually really great for video as well.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.670
In fact we’re shooting this video with it. If
you're somebody who shoots video and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.210
stills,

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.520
it’s just a great lens to have in your kit.
It's fast, it's sharp

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.060
is really good all-around lens. I want
to thank Nikon

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.819
for letting me borrow this lens for a week. I’m really considering putting my kit

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:11.560
permanently.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.950
