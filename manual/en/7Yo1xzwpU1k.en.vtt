Phil: Hey guys, my name is Phil and this,
is my garden.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.319
I'm a certified organic gardener, author of
the gardening book, “Building Soils Naturally”

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.240
and I run a website called smilinggardener.com
where I show you how to grow a healthy organic

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.960
pest-free, chemical-free garden step-by-step.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.769
I want to share with you some really important
tips for your garden and that could be a big

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.560
organic garden in your backyard or maybe just
a few containers you have on your balcony.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.759
By the way, if this kind of thing interests
you, you can click the annotation right here

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.150
to subscribe to my YouTube channel and then
you'll get all the videos I produce.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.750
You can actually click it right now and this
video will keep playing for you.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.940
Now, onto the how.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.629
How do we make our plants so healthy that
insects and disease predators don’t want

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:37.629
to look at them?

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.460
How do we make them so healthy that we get
the proteins and the vitamins and the minerals

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.460
that we need?

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.469
First, increase the organic matter content
of your soil with high quality compost and

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.020
mulches like leaves and straw and cover crops
like vetch with the beautiful flowers and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.109
clover and grains.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.129
Organic matter brings so many benefits into
your soil

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.019
Two, increase the fertility balance of your
soil with certain mineral fertilizers like

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.370
lime or rock-phosphate, but you need to use
the right ones.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.240
A lot of times people will bring in things
like dolomite lime or certain potassium sources,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.320
which even though they're organic, they can
cause major problems in your soil.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.180
Three, this part is very interesting.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030
This is where organic gardening is heading.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.420
You want to increase the diversity of beneficial
organisms in your soil with again, high quality

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.950
compost but also microbial inoculants like
compost tea and effective microorganisms.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.360
When you do all of these things, you get rid
of most of your pests and weeds.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.159
You'll have healthier flowers, you'll have
more nutritious food and I want to help you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.159
with that.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.159
So I have two things for you today.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.120
The first, if you haven’t subscribed to
my YouTube channel yet, you can do that right

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.579
here by clicking here and I will give you
more detailed videos and all these things

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:41.659
I've been talking about today.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.360
If you want to get into this stuff in more
detail, I've created a free rather in-depth

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.520
e-book called "The Holistic Gardening Handbook"
and a free online organic gardening course.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.479
You can get them both by going to the link
in the description below.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.159
They're both free, so I hope you'll go check
them out now.
