00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.100
So, let me tell you about an interesting experiment
that our family conducted.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:13.330
Last April, a friend of mine told me about
this really intriguing and slightly weird,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.420
well, okay, its really weird, experiment and
I couldn't wait to try it.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.270
She told us to boil white rice, but instead
of eating it for dinner, she told us to put

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.370
it into glass canning jars.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.010
So, we filled the jars with this cooked rice
about half-way full.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.760
And then, after tightly twisting on the lids,
we labeled the jars in permanent marker--One

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.700
labeled love, and the other one we labeled
hate.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.230
And we put the jars in two different rooms.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.579
And every day, we would talk to the jars as
they were labeled.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.499
We would go into the love jar and we would
say things like, "you are the prettiest white

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:57.499
rice.

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:58.499
We love you!

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.429
We are so happy you came to our house"!

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:08.860
And then, using our meany-head voices, we
would say to the hate jar, "You are ugly!

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.100
We wish you didn't live here.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.020
You are going to turn brown".

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.890
Well, admittedly, it was a little weird to
talk to rice.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:30.570
But, after just 6 days, the hate rice started
to develop black, yucky, moldy spots on the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.570
bottom.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.300
While the love jar was as white and fluffy
as the day that we started.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.640
Amazed by what was happening, we continued
to be rice whisperers.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:50.450
And after two months of talking to the rice,
the love jar was just as white and fluffy

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.330
as the first day, but the hate jar had become
a soupy, disgusting, mini-swamp.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.130
You couldn't even make out one of the grains
of rice.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.290
Words did that!

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.460
Not heat.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.460
Not cold.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.800
Not stirring, shaking, turning, mixing.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.510
Words--unkind words.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.569
It was like a crazy science experiment.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.700
And it can actually be explained scientifically.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.849
The rapid oscillation of the larynx when not
experiencing disphonia, carries through the

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:36.249
amorphous and optically transparent jar into
the dihydrogen monoxide into the Oryza Sativa.

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.260
Duh!

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:46.489
Or, in other words, the vibrations of our
voice, carried through the glass jar into

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.920
the water in the rice, and the rice responded.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.930
But, it was a real eye-opener for our family,
from the seven-year-old to the forty-two year

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.579
old.

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.180
That words matter.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.060
An unkind word can linger in the mind to be
replayed over and over.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.569
Fortunately, so can a word of praise, and
a word of encouragement.

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:17.079
Elder Holland said, "Words are sacred, and
must be spoken with care, and by constraint

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.560
of the spirit".

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.060
Words matter!
