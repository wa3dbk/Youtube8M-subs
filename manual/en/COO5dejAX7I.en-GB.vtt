00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.120
Hello Youtube! Fancy seeing you here on the
internet.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.029
I'm- oh sorry, happy Halloween. In all likelihood
this will not be shown on Halloween but um

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.000
just pretend that it makes sense that it would
be presented by a... dead mariachi. At this

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.920
point it's been a while, so you may remember
us from such failed crowdfunding projects

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.320
as

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.660
Sam Sweetmilk

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.580

Sam Sweet-

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.100
But today we're- it's Sam Sweetmilk. We're resilient! 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.600
We raised $11,000 to make another episode.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.080
 And we've been doing exactly that for the past 4 months, so

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.860
Would you like to see how we've been using your money?

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.040
Can we go to that clip?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.280
 Am I alone? Is there nobody else here? I'm just gonna go to that clip.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.600
For our next episode we're gonna need to record all our own audio, so we're gonna need to make 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.780
some soundproof panelling.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.700
 George, our videographer, has lent us his GoPro camera

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.740
And we're going to film a timelapse of their construction.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.520
Are you ready? :D

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.420
(William Tell Overture)

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.860
And there we are.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.560
Let's see that again in slow motion

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.700
First up is the owner of Canada's most famous beard

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.080
The comedian Chris Betts.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.680
Hey. I'm Chris Betts.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.460
I play the voice of 'Collector 3'.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.280
And I'm doing some random, background conversation stuff

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.340
I was thinking about space... and time...

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.600
(background laughter)

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.360
I, uhhhh-

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.100
-in this luxurious suite. It's hot as balls in here.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.300
Space... like noodles... delicious.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.780
Time... like noodles... also delicious!

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.520
"QUIT EATING SPACE AND TIME GEORGE

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.380
(background laughter)

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.320
WE NEED IT"

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.220
Jason purposely doesn't allow me to drink in here.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.120
 I think he turned up the heat just to spite me.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.080
Would you care for some canapÃ©s?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.620
This is a Mercurean beluga.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.740
It has been seared on the surface of the fourth sun of Rumbulus

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.020
And temprered with just a little bit of herb of sacrifice

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.300
-constantly told me that I sounded too feminine, and then too masculine and then too feminine again

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.600
I don't think he knows what either of those words mean.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.780
I think you'll find it has special notes

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.680
that can be described as

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.780
'sensatiofun'

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.660
(laughter)

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.700
and 'spicetacular'

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.360
Yeah but it's a real-

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.300
yeah it's a real pleasure to be here.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.440
If Jason could stop yelling at me with his whiskey-soaked breath, that'd be a nice touch

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.720
But I'll take what I can get for now.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.100
(Laughter)

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.780
I'm really sweaty

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.980
Thanks for watching, hope you liked it, next time we'll be going to Comic Con

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.800
See you later.
