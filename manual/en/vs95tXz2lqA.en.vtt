00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:08.990
We are back again, this is Taylor with uniquesquared.com
and today we are checking out the Alesis DM8

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.199
Pro kit. I brought my good buddy Alex Selph
to come and demo the kit. He's going to play

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.320
around with some of the features and I'm going
to run you through some of the specs as we

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.320
go through the demo so, take it away Alex.
The Alesis DM8 is a five piece electronic

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.890
drum kit with five cymbals. Right out of the
box you will notice the combination metal

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.100
and plastic construction of the rack which
is fully adjustable to fit any style of play.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.460
We're going to go over the drum pads, the
cymbals, and the module, as well as get some

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.230
impressions from Alex about the Alesis DM8
Pro. First let's talk about the module or

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.939
brain on the Alesis DM8. If we start on the
back you can see that we have our jack for

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.460
powering the module, and Alesis also supplies
you with a MIDI input for adding additional

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.649
control surfaces. You also have a USB connection
for communication with computer software for

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.229
additional sounds or recording capabilities.
You have a Â¼ inch headphone and main output

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.869
jacks. You also have an auxiliary input for
hooking up things like an iPod so you can

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.859
play along to music. The percussion one and
two input jacks are for assigning your dual

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.020
zone snare and your triple zone ride. You
can also use these if you want to add more

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.049
pads or symbols. The front of the module is
going to give you all the controls you need

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:43.030
to manipulate sounds, set up kits, and record
your performances. You have over 100 kits

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.329
with 750 different drum sounds to pick from.
You can create your own kit or use the ones

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.069
provided. With each of the pads you have tight
control for sensitivity which is great for

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.700
ghost notes versus heavy hits. Depending on
your style of play, there is a sensitivity

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.700
style just for you. In addition to sensitivity
control you have control over the velocity

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.750
curve so you can be super accurate with how
the trigger responds to your hits. The tap

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.110
tempo button is great for setting a metronome
to a desired tempo with ease. The beats per

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.900
minute is displayed nicely on the screen so
you can reference the tempo at all times.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.040
The Alesis DM8 Pro allows you to do more than
most drum modules. You have full control over

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.060
the instrument sounds that accompany your
drum performance. All the MIDI mappings are

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.470
completely customizable to the pad that you
want to send that sound to. You can even change

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.830
the resonance note on any of the drums. The
sequences are customizable as well, you can

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.290
set the tempo, time signature, and link the
loop. So even if you don't have a band, you

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.970
can have an accompaniment to your jam.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.710
You had a chance to play around with this
brain a little bit, but you only really scratched

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.240
the surface. Tell me how important it is to
have just a massive array and control over

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.320
a module like this with an electronic drum
kit.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.070
Yeah I think it's just about never ending,
the amount of creativity that you could have

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:18.070
with this. Reverbs, and pitches, and delays,
and all the different sounds.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.820
So as a learning tool how important is it
to things like a metronome and a record feature

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.530
to sort of use it as a home training tool?

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.670
Yeah for years I've been using an electronic
drum kit to practice on, and as far as having

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.600
a metronome, I mean it's amazing to have.
And also being able to play along with songs

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.830
that are programmed into a drum brain like
this, having the latin song, or the rock song,

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.830
or the jazz song, or the funk song. It really
helps.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.230
Moving on from the brain let's talk about
the drum pads and triggers. Starting with

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.840
the kick drum. The kick pad is a good size,
which is great for players that use double

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.080
kick pedals. The high hat pedal has a nice
realistic feel with a large spring for resistance.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.650
It stick to the carpet with great ease, and
the pin at the edge of the pedal is adjustable

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.269
to different levels of resistance. As for
the drum pads, they have a true drum feel

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.680
with the design of the skins. They also have
a rubber rim to prevent the drums from getting

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.020
scratched by hits. All of the heads are fully
adjustable to the desired level of stick rebound.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.860
Alesis provides you with a drum key so you
can tune it however you like. You get a 8,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.710
10, and 12 inch tom, as well as a dual zone
12 inch snare which is great for rimshots

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.289
or cross stick hits.

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.919
What do you think about the response of the
drum pads?

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.330
They're really real, I mean you can tighten
each one of them. You know I think it's really

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.099
important to get a really good sensitivity
out of these drums. Like with this snare,

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:00.319
if I barely tap it you still get something
out of it, like a ghost note. You can create

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:07.099
a really good feeling beat out of that. The
advantage is you can save six to ten hours

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:14.020
of getting sounds on a snare. Tuning, the
issue is not getting that buzz out of your

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.930
snare. It's literally just tuning up the drum
through here so you're instantly up or down

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:26.930
and perfectly in pitch. And I've used some
other electronic drums in plenty of sessions,

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:34.529
and it's that quick, you just plug in.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.659
So let's check out the cymbals. With this
kit you get three cymbal pads. The pads are

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.069
huge, a twelve inch high hat, a fourteen inch
crash, and a fourteen inch, and a sixteen

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:49.259
inch ride. The ride cymbal has three zones
for playing, you can strike it on the surface,

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:55.099
or the bell and bow of the cymbal. The crash
cymbal has the ability to be choked for truly

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:02.099
accurate cymbal feel. Let's hear how the ride
sounds. And here's the crash being choked.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:13.620
What do you think about the response of the
bell and the bow on the ride cymbal?

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:21.719
Yeah it's pretty dead on. I mean... versus...
you get that washy feel, and choke. I think

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.800
it's really cool that they have these boom
stands right here, so you can adjust your

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.330
cymbal up here, put the right angle on it.
With most companies you just get two straight

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:40.330
stands and you have to work with that but
here with this angle you can get a lot more

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:22.069
options.

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:29.069
So there it is the Alesis DM8 Pro kit. I want
to thank Alex for coming in today and demoing

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.740
