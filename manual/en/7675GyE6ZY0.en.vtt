00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.700
Hello, my dear!

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.500
Who's there?

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.300
Just a friend... Don't be afraid!

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.300
Who are you?

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.600
I'm just a solitary kind of rabbit. I've been living here for years... Alone.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.000
The dark is my only companion.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.400
I-I'm sorry... I didn't know someone else lived here. I'm going somewhere else...

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.500
I'd like you to stay here a little longer.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I haven't talked to anyone for such a long time...

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.700
You know, it's awful when people avoid you, when people hate you... 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.600
You feel lonely, helpless... and there's nothing you can do about it.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.400
I know, I know what you mean. What's your name?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.900
- They call me... Springtrap!
- Springtrap?!

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.800
- Your wonder makes me suppose you've already heard this name...

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.000
Well... yes... s-sometimes...

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.100
I don't have a good reputation, do I, Mangle?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.200
What? N-no. I mean... Wait... How do you know my name?

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.300
I know a lot of things. Poor Chica, poor Bonnie... They were only trying to help you!

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.200
And you almost destroyed them! You ruined everything.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.200
Now Foxy hates you. There's nobody on your side. You're as lonely as I am.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.200
It's true... I've ruined everything.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.800
- That's why I'm asking you to stay with me...
- Stay with you?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.100
- Stay with me forever... 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.800
- As my bride!
- What?!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.800
- You heard me, Mangle! Marry me, and we will reign together over this place!
