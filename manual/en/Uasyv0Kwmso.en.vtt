00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.890
Welcome to Ahmet's kitchen, today we will be making Mücver

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.330
we need from you:

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.330
I have 1kg zucchini, onions 4 fresh, handful of parsley, 150g soft cheese, 150g

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.950
Flour and 3 eggs

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.119
Salt and pepper

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.199
let's get started

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.169
first peel the zucchini

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:34.169
ok that we do away

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.079
Cut the bottom piece off

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.079
Cut the

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.249
now we rub the whole

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:11.869
the last remaining

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.869
let's see if much water is in it, if a lot of water in it, you have to express it

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.979
there is very little in it, so you need not express

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.359
I leave it so

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:11.359
3 eggs purely

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.390
Then we cut the onions small

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.310
the onions purely

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.390
Now cut the parsley

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.240
add in here

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.840
now the pepper

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.610
Salt

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.280
and finally the cheese

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.280
the need to make small

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:30.110
stir something

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.280
150g flour

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.280
let the whole

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.850
we carried through a sieve

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.569
Stir 2 minutes and let stand for 10 minutes

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.970
I have sunflower oil in the pan

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.900
We always take a spoon

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.900
and pure

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.480
always with some distance

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:37.130
make the last, well, deduction of

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:44.130
let's see, now they have a good color

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.380
Auburn, rotate all

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:58.380
which is now also good, we pick them out

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.350
on a napkin

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:17.350
until all are ready to move on, that are now the last, I'll get them to get out

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.419
done

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:29.410
Drain

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.060
so ready

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.340
so you can serve them to take best Cacik

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.990
I wish you a good appetite with Mücver until next time, Ahmet, bye

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.240
:)
