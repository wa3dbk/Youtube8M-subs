00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.260
Burnie: Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of A Million Dollars But...

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.580
We have Colton Dunn with us and Chris Demarais

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.680
Chris, why don't you start us off with your scenario

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.600
Chris: A million dollars...

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.400
Burnie: That's a lot of money

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.680
Chris: But for one year

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.100
everywhere you go, you are pushed in a baby stroller

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.320
by an incredibly strong, muscular man wearing like a tiny like muscle shower outfit

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.740
Burnie: What abou- I mean, so literally everywhere I wanna go

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.280
Let's say I've had a long day

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.580
I go home, I go to sleep

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.200
Chris: He's there, he put you in the bed and he kinda like spoons you

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.100
Burnie: Oh he sleeps with me?

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.920
Chris: Yeah yeah

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.080
Sometimes too when you're like

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.800
Say you go and you're reading a book

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.420
Burnie: Right

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.140
Chris: He's just flexing and exercising right behind you

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.220
so that's how he maintains his physique he's just like

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.880
Colton: So when he's not needed he's just working out close by

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.100
Burnie: Even like a regular scenario

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.060
What if you're dating your girlfriend and you're like going to bed

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.600
Even if you're sleeping with your girlfriend, he's sleeping there with you?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.280
Chris: Yeah, he can just hang out on the side and kinda hang out

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.180
Burnie: Is he awake?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.160
Chris: I mean yeah he can go to sleep, it doesn't matter. It's up to him.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.780
Colton: So like, what if he takes you to like a sad event

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.240
like if he takes you to like

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.280
you know the hospital bedside of your like dying mother

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.440
Chris: I think he would have a moment of sadness where he might cry

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.660
and then he'd start working out

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.080
Colton: He would share the pain and then work out

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.500
Burnie: Flexing and working out

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.760
Colton: I will say that there's a great benefit to this though

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.520
'cause you could go out, you could get so drunk all the time

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.980
and you would never have trouble walking anywhere

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.040
or driving a car

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.380
You could just get tanked

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.960
Burnie: It's like the police officer stops you and is like

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.220
"Have you been drinking tonight?"

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.040
and you're like "Fuck you!"

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.760
Colton: "Fuck you cop, why don't you go talk to my friend"

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.720
(laughter)

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.900
Burnie: A million dollars...

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.940
but for one year, we gotta be wheeled around by a dude

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.440
Colton: He's oiled up

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.200
Burnie: He's oiled up and muscly

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.300
Colton: I'm in, I'm in

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.060
Burnie: For a year? I would do it too

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.580
It's a year, I'll do it

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.840
Colton: Not only do you get a Million dollars, all right

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.680
but you also can go to any movie you want

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.700
For free

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.880
But, through the duration of the film

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.140
spaghetti is constantly flowing out of your mouth

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.040
(laughter)

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.400
Just falling out of your mouth

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.960
Burnie: Is it just me? Or can I bring friends to the movie too?

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.060
Colton: What, do you get them in for free and get them the good seats?

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.080
Then spaghetti comes out of their mouths too

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.180
Burnie: (laughs) Out of their mouths?

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.720
Colton: Yeah

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.800
Chris: Does it hurt? Is it like you're vomiting?

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.980
Colton: Nooo it just, it just happens

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.100
it just kinda happens

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.900
Burnie: So is this spaghetti gross or could I like sell it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.640
Colton: Hey man, that's capitalism

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.400
Chris: Start an Italian dinner store

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.940
Colton: Yeah!

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.700
Chris: And you'd be like the spaghetti man

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.080
And you just sell all, you just collect in the bucket

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.560
Colton: Collect it in like a big tin, and pour some sauce on it and sell it

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.240
Chris: Bring all your friends you get hundreds of friends

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.660
and you're just all vomiting

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.000
You can end world hunger

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.800
Burnie: All right. Million dollars Chris. Free movies. What are you doing, you doing it?

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.980
Chris: Yeah I would do it, I love spaghetti

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.960
Burnie: All right, I'm not doing it

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.200
I can't do it, I like movies too much

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.460
Burnie: I'm gonna give you...a million dollars

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520
AND...I'm also gonna give you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.640
the greatest dog in the whole world

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.420
That dog just becomes an amazing dog

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.720
It does whatever you want AND the dog can talk

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.220
You can actually talk to a dog

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.760
Colton: It can like verbalize its thoughts

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.400
Burnie: Absolutely

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.200
Here's the problem: greatest dog in the world, it can talk to you, but nobody else in the world can see or hear this dog

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.320
You cannot prove in any way that this dog exists

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.520
and if you ever ignore the dog intentionally

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.900
it loses the ability to talk

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.200
Colton: And do I lose the million dollars?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.800
Burnie: No. You get to keep the million dollars

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.160
Chris: You just silence your best friend

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.820
Burnie: Let's say you feed the dog

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.120
You feed the dog and say "look it's going to eat!"

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.500
It's just you showing a full bowl of food to everybody

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.180
Even though the dog eats it, it still looks like a full bowl of food to them

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.000
Colton: To the rest of the people

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.720
Burnie: Everybody else

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.040
Chris: What if it goes to the bathroom?

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.540
Burnie: Nothing

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.040
Chris: Invisible?

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.640
Burnie: Totally invisible!

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.840
Chris: So okay, so you have a guy that you don't like

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.720
and you go to dinner with him and you get your dog

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.400
and you're like "sit right there, sit right there"

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.040
and then he's sitting there and he's just eating dog shit

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.500
Burnie: He'd have no idea

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.040
Chris: Invisible dog shit, and he's just *eating sounds*

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.380
Burnie: But that's- only you would know

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.060
Colton: I mean a talking dog is cool but if I can't like

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.520
use it to pick up chicks

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.680
Like, that's the best reason to have a dog

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.520
I would take the million dollars, then I would ignore the dog

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.820
So he couldn't talk anymore, and then I'd just buy another dog

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.160
Chris: So he dies a normal dog age like 12 or 15

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.660
Burnie: Sure

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.280
Colton: If you don't feed him though he'll die in like 2 weeks

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.080
(laughter)

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.740
Burnie: And then you get a million dollars, yeah

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.200
So could you live with that

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.380
You get this magical dog

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.080
Colton: I could live with that

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.800
Look, I'll kill a magic dog

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.040
(laughter)

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.960
Colton: For a million dollars

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.460
Chris: No one would know you did it

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.380
Colton: Yeah. Nobody's gonna know, nobody's gonna care

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.460
Burnie: And you keep your million bucks

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.680
Colton: I keep my million dollars

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.640
Burnie: That's a quick way to a million

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.600
All right so, million dollars and magic dog to you

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.220
Million dollars and a magic dog to you

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.840
Chris: I would do it

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.440
Burnie: All right, I'm 2 million dollars poorer

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.260
Congratulations guys, you guys got 2 million bucks

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.720
Chris: And a best friend

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.140
Colton: Bury him in my backyard

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.700
Burnie: Well gentlemen, I think that we learned a lot about each other today

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.400
Join us next time. We'll have 3 more terrible scenarios that we'll subject each other to

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.760
I'm not looking forward to it

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.520
Colton: I am

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.320
