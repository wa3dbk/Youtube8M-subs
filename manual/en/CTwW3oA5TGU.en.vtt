*Learn Magic with Hermione*

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.800
Hello, today in Learn Magic with Hermione,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.700
we are going to talk about spells which are less dangerous than last time...

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.220
Actually, today, there will be no torture and no death...

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.860
We will learn the spell to open locked doors.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.760
*The Magic Word*

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.140
The Magic Word is Alohomora.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.400
Repeat after me !

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.800
Alohomora !

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.360
Again

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.760
Alohomora !

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.340
One more time on your own...

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.380
Bravo ! you know the magic words !

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.360
*The gesture*

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.500
The gesture is very, very, very, very simple.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.860
You just have to give it a wave like this.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.980
Come on, do it with me !

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.520
Take your wand.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.740
One last time, on your own.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.060
Bravo ! You mastered the gesture !

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.820
*Demonstration*

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.880
Now we will try to use the spell on a locked door.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.120
Stand before a door, take your wand and do as I do.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.300
Alohomora !

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.400
We'll check if it's worked !

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
No... wait ! wait !

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.160
Please ! I can explain everything !

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.700
No NO this owl is not carrying a bomb !
