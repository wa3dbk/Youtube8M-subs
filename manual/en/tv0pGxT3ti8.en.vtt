00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:07.310
you're going to make sure that the cuticles are pushed back on your finger

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:13.619
clean finger with alcohol, that'll take of
any excess oil that might be on your finger

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.449
when selecting a Jamberry nail, the
new improved wraps now now come on a

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.720
clear backing

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.439
it's very easy to take a nail shield and place it  over your finger

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.720
check to see

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.210
if it's going to fit your nail, you don't
want it to touch the skin on either side

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.680
just the nail

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.000
this one looks good for this finger

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.330
remove wrap with a pair tweezers

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.079
if you have on acrylic or gels

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.739
you will want to heat for about ten
seconds on a personal heater or hair dryer

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.830
you can apply the jamberry right
to your hair dryer and turn it on for

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.750
about ten seconds

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.050
if you have natural bare nails, like i do,  there's
no need heat the wrap before

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.500
applying

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.360
place the wrap on your mail

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.130
be sure that you don't

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.480
touch the cuticle.  You can pick it up

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.480
reposition as necessary

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.560
press the nail starting at the cuticle
and press outward

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.560
then take a cuticle pusher and press all
all of the edges down

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.869
as you can see there's plenty of nail
wrap left.  Turn your finger over so you can

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.580
see where your nail is so you can cut close

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.760
but not too close to your nail

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.660
take your extra Jamberry nail and place it back on your sheet

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.390
so that you can use it later for another
nail

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.810
now regardless if you have plain (bare) nails

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.390
or acrylic or fingernail polish (some polishes don't work well with Jamberry, test yours)

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.960
you want to now heat your wrap

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.960
for about ten seconds

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.129
the heat, along with pressure makes your Jamberry nail wrap adhere to your fingernail

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.239
with a nice Water Tight seal!!

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.769
pressure again

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.359
pressing down

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:30.359
getting all the edges

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:34.259
you could go on do your next nail , but
we're only doing this one today

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:35.719
for demonstration

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.870
take a course fingernail file, that's NOT flexible 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.809
180 grade works really well

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:45.389
and this will take the access

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.540
Jamberry nail wrap, off of your nail

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.449
using and downright motion - ONLY

00:02:54.449 --> 00:03:01.449
never PULL off the nail shield always
wait until it falls off with your file

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.009
use a finer file, 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.279
to give it a smoother finish

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.879
you can apply a little more heat,

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.419
your choice

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:17.109
you can try without the heat (the second time) 
time

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.369
press down

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:20.199
again along the edge

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.459
especially where you just filed

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.999
you're all done, that's your Jamberry nail wrap.
