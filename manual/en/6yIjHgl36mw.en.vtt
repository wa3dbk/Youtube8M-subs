00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.686
Now I'm first to admit that I don't know that
much about sports.

00:00:05.686 --> 00:00:12.809
A guy once said to me that he would like to
show me his "Backdoor slider" but I don't

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.000
think he was talking about baseball...

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.270
But what I lack in sports knowledge I make
up for in common sense.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.200
Apparently Clippers Owner Donald Sterling
doesn't have this characteristic.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.640
An appalling sound bite surfaced over the
weekend supposedly of the Clippers owner talking

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.350
to a female associate: "why are you taking
pictures with minorities, why?" and told her

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.149
not to bring to Lakers Hall of Famer Magic
Johnson to Clippers games.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.989
He also says, "Yeah, it bothers me a lot that
you want to broadcast that you're associating

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:46.989
with black people.

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:47.989
Do you have to?"

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.290
And it get's worse: "You can sleep with them,
you can bring them in, you can do whatever

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.290
you want.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.679
The little that I ask you is not to promote
it on that ... and not to bring them to my

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.120
games,"
Allegedly the female associate that he is

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.850
talking to in the video is V. Stiviano, Donald
Sterlings girlfriend.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.489
These statements have set off a landslide
of responses!

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.460
Magic Johnson tweeted "I feel sorry for my
friends Coach Doc Rivers and Chris Paul that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.610
they have to work for a man that feels that
way about African Americans."

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.360
And "LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling's comments
about African

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.500
Americans are a black eye for the NBA."

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.510
Some current and former Clippers players have
responded as well.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.810
Baron Davis tweeted "That's the way it is
... He is honest about what he believes in..Been

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.680
going on for a long time, Hats off 2 the Team..

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.680
4 playin above it all."

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.350
And DeAndre Jordan posted his response on
instagram with just a black picture.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.920
This disruption could not come at a worse
time for the team.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.479
Right in the middle of the NBA Playoffs the
team needs to focus!

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.479
Give 110%!

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.479
Win this one of the gipper!

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.479
Bring their A game!

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.670
Don't stop playing till the fat lady sings!"

00:01:49.670 --> 00:02:00.060
I was going to say more but I ran out of Sports
ClichÃ©s.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.469
Who knows whats going to happen to Mr. Sterling
in the near future.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.470
Should the players boycott?

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.240
Should the NBA make Mr. Sterling throw in
the towel?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.000
Please tell us what you think should happen
to Donald Sterling in the comments below...

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.490
Should he walk the plank?

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.280
Get it...

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.640
Clippers, Ships... walking the plank...

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.780
