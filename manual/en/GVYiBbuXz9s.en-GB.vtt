00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:05.799
The week starting the 20th of January is a
milder week across Victoria. It's a welcome

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.980
milder week given the fact we've just had
such excessive heat and also fire operations

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.200
over the last week. This week the Fire Danger
Ratings will be high or very high in most

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.690
districts on most days, however there could
be a spike day later in the week which will

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.259
be Friday, so certainly watch that. But on
the same token the forecast has indicated

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.220
there may be a shower of rain on Friday so
it could be a little bit both ways so obviously

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.869
by Friday we will know that.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.820
The key thing though is that we've come off
the back of a very strong heat period, with

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.910
excessive heat, and people need to think about
that and reflect on how it impacted upon them,

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.760
what it meant and what are the plans people
need to have. Because I think if people reflect,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.620
it will tell them to either build a plan that
they may not have, and it's not too late to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.480
build a plan, and also if they've got a plan
it might allow them to modify it slightly.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.070
Then if you take it to fire it's the same
scenario. Think about what the heat does,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.180
think about the connection to fire, it's about
revisiting what you do and how you do it.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.149
I think Victorians have done extremely well
over the last week. Our fires that we've had,

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.399
we've had lots of fires, most of them have
been started by lightning which means the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.340
Victorian community has been listening and
been very aware of what the fire potential

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:26.439
is and has been. But we need to make sure
we stay focused. The conditions will not change.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.150
The showers of rains if they come through
will be just that, showers. There's no forecast

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.240
of excessive rain. Rain that will change the
landscape and the scenario. The month of February

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.399
will be critical, normally in Victoria's history,
it's very clear in Victoria's history, that's

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.320
the month when we have our major fires. It's
the hot month, it's the critical period and

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.939
we've got dry, dry conditions everywhere across
the state now, so the month of February will

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.229
be critical. We shouldn't be scared of it,
we should stay focused and we need to be about

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.439
what you and your family, about what you need
to do about your safety and you need to know

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.869
where to get information and we say it all
the time but take time in this slow period

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.050
to find where the information is and understand
what you will use it for, how you'll use it

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.230
in the time of need.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.130
That's it, I think we've done extremely well.
To our firefighters you have to say thank

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.210
you. Every one of them has done an exceptional
job, volunteer, career, MFB, CFA, Parks Victoria,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.820
DEPI, absolutely fantastic. Not only have
we protected Victoria, we've got trucks in

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.510
South Australia, CFA has been in South Australia
and also New South Wales fighting their fires

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.090
so we've done really, really well, and we
should be extremely proud of our firefighters

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.560
and what they do and how they do it.
