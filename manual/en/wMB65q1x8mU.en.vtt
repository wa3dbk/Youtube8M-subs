00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.580
Hi, I'm Jen from Online Fabric Store.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.140
This high waist skirt has pleats on the front and the back and has a zipper on the side.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.660
To keep it is simple there is no interfacing or lining.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.280
So let's get started.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:33.320
The materials you'll need are: 1 yard of fabric, I'm using Amy Butler Optic Blossom linen fabric,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.960
thread, a 7 inch zipper, fabric scissors, ballpoint pins, and a hand needle.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.600
First, fold the fabric in half.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.400
Pin the center of the pattern to the fold line and cut.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.300
Remove the pins and the pattern piece.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.880
Pin the pattern to the fold line again and cut.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.340
Unfold the remaining fabric.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.840
Pin the waistband pattern and cut.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.800
Take the top of the skirt and make 1 inch pleats along the front and back

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.680
leaving about 2 and 1/2 inches of space in between.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.760
You should have 7 pleats total.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.480
Stitch with a half inch seam allowance across the top to secure the pleats.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.620
Do this for both the front and back pieces.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.280
Place the front and back pieces on top of each other with the right sides facing together.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.980
Pin one side all the way to the bottom.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.440
For the other side start pinning from the bottom up and leave 4 inches open at the top.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.300
Starting a 1/2 inch in, stitch with a 1 inch seam allowance leaving 2 inches at the bottom.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.100
Do the same on the other side, leaving 3 and 1/2 inches open at the top.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.340
Backstitch at the beginning and the end and fold to the right side.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.580
After removing the pins, fold the edges up a 1/2 inch and iron.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.620
Then fold the waistband in half and iron.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.260
Unfold the waistband and pin one edge to the top of the skirt.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.960
Stitch with a 1/2 inch seam allowance leaving a 1/2 inch open at each end.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.900
Fold the waistband over to the inside and pin.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.100
With a hand needle, blind stitch the inside seam leaving a 1/2 inch open on each end.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.660
A blind stitch is a stitch that lightly grabs a thread of the fabric from the inside that cannot be seen on the outside.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.740
Continue this until you've reached the end and double knot.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.600
First, cut off the top of the zipper.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:07.020
From the top, insert the zipper into the waistband by folding over the edge of the fabric 1/4 inch on each side.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.260
Continue to fold and pin the fabric down to the bottom of the zipper.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.240
Make a 1 inch snip at the bottom.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.600
Make sure the zipper foot is on and stitch along the fold line.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.280
Do this for both sides.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.760
Fold the skirt inside out.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.400
For both side seams, snip the seam allowance at the top.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.760
Fold over a 1/4 inch twice, pin, and stitch.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.120
Fold the hem up 1 inch and iron.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.220
Fold up another inch and iron again.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.860
Fold the extra fabric at the seams under and pin.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.400
Back stitch and stitch with a 1 inch seam allowance.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.920
Fold the skirt to the right side.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.840
The high waist cotton skirt is now complete.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:16.640
You can wear this type of skirt all year round and you can also use hook and eye closures instead of a zipper.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.200
Thanks for watching this OFS project.
