00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.766
- I've gotten to know
some incredible artists

00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.700
over the last 12 seasons,
and this next guest

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.600
has quickly become
one of my favorites.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.200
She's nominated
for four Grammy Awards.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.100
Here to perform "Elastic Heart,"
please welcome my friend Sia.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.100
[cheers and applause]

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:22.166
[upbeat atmospheric music]

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:29.000
[singing]
- And another one bites the dust

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.333
But why can I not conquer love?

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.966
And I might've thought
that we were one

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:39.333
Wanted to fight this war
without weapons

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:43.733
And I wanted it,
I wanted it bad

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.966
But there were so many red flags

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:51.066
Now another one bites the dust

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:54.200
And let's be clear,
I trust no one

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.600
You did not break me

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.800
I'm still fighting for peace

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.600
Well, I've got a thick skin
and an elastic heart

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.400
But your blade,
it might be too sharp

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.500
I'm like a rubber band
until you pull too hard

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.666
Yeah, I may snap,
and I move fast

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:29.733
You won't see me fall apart

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:37.633
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:42.166
I've got an elastic heart

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:49.566
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:57.600
And I will stay up
through the night

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.266
Yeah, let's be clear,
won't close my eyes

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:05.000
And I know that I can survive

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.266
I'll walk through fire
to save my life

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:12.166
And I want it,
I want my life so bad

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:15.933
I'm doing everything I can

00:02:15.933 --> 00:02:19.766
Then another one bites the dust

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:22.666
It's hard to lose a chosen one

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:30.100
You did not break me

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.366
I'm still fighting for peace

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:41.900
Well, I've got a thick skin
and an elastic heart

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.266
But your blade,
it might be too sharp

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:49.733
I'm like a rubber band
until you pull too hard

00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:51.266
Yeah, I may snap,
and I move fast

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:58.500
You won't see me fall apart

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.366
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:11.333
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:13.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.900
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.200
Oh, oh, oh, oh

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.233
'Cause I've got a thick skin
and an elastic heart

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:28.533
But your blade,
it might be too sharp

00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:33.633
I'm like a rubber band
until you pull too hard

00:03:33.633 --> 00:03:36.100
Yeah, I may snap,
and I move fast

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.866
You won't see me fall apart

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:50.466
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:56.033
I've got an elastic heart

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:02.900
[cheers and applause]

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.166
- Thank you so much.

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:08.233
- Sia.
- Hi, babe.

00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:10.033
[giggling]

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:11.800
- Sia.
- Yes.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.600

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.166

00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:18.633
- And you have an announcement,
right?

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:19.833
About the Grammys?
- Oh, yeah.

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:20.833
What--I've forgotten.

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:22.066
That I'm gonna do a performance?

00:04:22.066 --> 00:04:23.300
- That's what it is, yes.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.600
- That's the--
that's the announcement.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.466
- You're gonna actually do
a performance on the Grammys.

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:27.600
- Yup.
- It's exciting.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.166
Always--
[cheers and applause]

00:04:29.166 --> 00:04:30.366
- I love you.

00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:32.900

00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:40.433
