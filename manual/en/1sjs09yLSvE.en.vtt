00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:13.889
Good morning, welcome to NRA 2014.

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.270
My name is Jim McLellan with Schwank.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.780
Schwank is the world leader and inventor of
gas-fired infrared heating.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:30.430
Outdoor heating has become very popular, originally
due to new smoking by-laws in the US but over

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.500
time people want to spend more time outdoors
and they want comfortable outdoor environments.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.160
These type of products are what started the
industry and they were a very common, inexpensive

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.400
way to heat the outdoors.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.830
With the invention of great technologies like
the Schwank heaters behind me, the industry

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.850
has really taken off and created a complete
outdoor environment.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.600
Permanent mount solutions like this are a
lot safer.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.150
Restaurateurs can now extend their patio season.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.780
This is very important because that means
more revenue.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.310
The longer that chair is filled in season
and on the shoulder months, brings new revenue

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.289
to that restaurateur.

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:14.289
Schwank's newest gas unit is our new bistro
series heaters these heaters are available

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.950
in different sizes for different comforts
for different climates.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.350
Our newest product is this great new stainless
steel unit that's great for coastal regions

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.020
where we have corrosive salt air and it's
a 2-Stage unit so we can turn up the heat

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.410
when we need more heat or turn it down when
we need less heat.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:36.240
At the flip of a switch.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.860
Another solution is electric infrared heating
including misters.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.950
In this case, we can both heat the patio when
it cools off and during the hot daytime temperatures

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.310
we can cool the patio.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.500
A lot of restaurants need cool as well as
heat in an outdoor environment.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.149
Areas like Arizona, Nevada, and the Southern
and Western US, require both times of comfort.

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:04.299
One of the things a restaurateur wants to
know is what he is going to get out of an

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.380
investment into comfort for his outdoor patio.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.400
Schwank has created a simple design tool that
will assist them by putting in some simple

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.360
metrics like the square footage of your patio
but here's a quick example to show you the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.310
kind of return on investment and how quickly
a patio can pay for itself by investing in

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.310
outdoor patio heaters.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.730
As we move down to the bottom in this particular
example, you can see that we've potentially

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.580
created an additional 56,000 dollars worth
of net revenue.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.540
He has an estimated install cost of 30,000
dollars and in 33.75 days he's paid for that

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.629
heating system that he gets to use year after
year after year.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.260
Schwank provides solutions for some of the
largest franchises in the United States.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.180
Companies like Hooters, Buffalo Wild Wings,
Twin Peaks.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.499
Keep the patios full, keep the revenue streams
going.
