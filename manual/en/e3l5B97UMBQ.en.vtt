00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.450
The next generation Rover however is ready
to carry on with even more advanced instrumentation……and

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:24.250
its name is CURIOSITY.
Curiosity is almost twice as long and five

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.500
times heavier (2,000 pounds) as Spirit and
Opportunity. But before Curiosity can explore

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.550
Mars, it has to get there.
The nose cone or fairing, carrying the Mars

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:44.050
Science Laboratory (Curiosity) falls open
like a clamshell and falls away. After this,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.129
the rocket’s first stage cuts off and drops
into the Atlantic Ocean.

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.589
The rocket’s second stage, a Centaur engine,
is started and boosts the spacecraft out of

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.729
Earth orbit and sends it toward Mars.
Once the spacecraft is in cruise stage toward

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:06.300
Mars, it begins communicating with Earth.
The last stage gives the spacecraft a final

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:16.820
push for its 8 ½ month cruise to the red
planet.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.930
Hitting the atmosphere at about 13,000 miles
per hour, the spacecraft begins to slow down.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:48.810
While slowing down, the spacecraft uses thrusters
to help steer toward the landing site.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:02:02.080
It throws off weights to rebalance the spacecraft,
so that it is lined up for the parachute deployment.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.570
Once it is below the speed of sound, the heat
shield separates and the spacecraft looks

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:17.430
for the ground with the landing radar.
Once it reaches an altitude of about 1 mile,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.159
the spacecraft drops out of the back-shell
at about 200 miles an hour. It then fires

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:52.840
up the landing engine to slow it down even
further.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.659
Once it has descended to about 60 feet above
the ground, and going only about 2 miles per

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:09.489
hour, the rover separates from the descent
stage. As the rover is lowered, the wheels

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:17.930
deploy in preparation for landing.
Once the rover is safely on the ground, and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.939
touchdown has been detected, the descent stage
cuts the rover loose. It flies away leaving

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:51.120
Curiosity safe on the surface of Mars.
One of the first things Curiosity does after

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.120
landing is to deploy the mast, which supports
many cameras and instruments.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.569
The Curiosity rover has 10 science instruments
including:

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:07.589
A gas chromatograph, a gas spectrometer, and
a tunable laser spectrometer to identify a

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:13.620
wide range of organic compounds.
An x-ray diffraction and fluorescence instrument

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.139
named CheMin designed to identify and quantify
minerals in rocks and soils.

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:26.340
A Hand Lens Imager to take extreme close-up
pictures of rocks and soil revealing details

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.180
smaller than the width of a human hair.
An Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer to detect

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.819
different elements in rocks and soils.
A Camera mounted on the Mast capable of capturing

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:42.229
images of the rover’s surroundings in high
resolution and color.

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:49.259
An instrument named ChemCam capable of vaporizing
thin layers of material from rocks or soil

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:54.720
designed to identify atoms and capture detailed
images of the area.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.889
The drill on the arm allows it to grab some
of that rock and deliver it to the laboratory

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.840
instruments inside the body of the rover,
and the Radiation Assessment Detector to analyze

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.690
the radiation environment at the surface.
This information will be necessary for planning

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.630
human exploration of Mars and its ability
to sustain life.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.760
Those instruments can get us even closer to
understanding whether life could have existed

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.169
on Mars.
Curiosity will be exploring the red planet

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:36.360
for at least 2 years ……and ….there’s
no telling what we will discover.
