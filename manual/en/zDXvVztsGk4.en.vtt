Hello friends and lovers of the Edgy Veg!

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.500
Today I'm going to show you how to make strawberry
milk, using real strawberries.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:17.550
Not that pink syrup that you find in the grocery
store.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.290
The first step to your strawberry milk is
to put all of your ingredients in the Vitamix.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.690
The first thing you're going to add is one
cup of almonds and one cup of cashews.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.189
The reason why you're not doing all almonds
is because cashew nuts are a little more high

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.890
in fat so they are creamier and will add a
creamy texture to your milk.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.309
The next thing we're going to add is some
salt, to really bring out the flavors of the

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.300
vanilla we're going to be adding, and the
strawberries.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.059
You're going to add 4 dates for sweetness,
just don't accidentally put your pits in there...

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.280
Because they will ruin your blender.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.420
Then you're going to put about 2 cups of strawberries,
about a table spoon of vanilla (or half of

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.129
a vanilla bean).

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.850
Then fill it to the max line with water.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.940
We just learned that strawberries float...
hurray!

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:17.670
The second last step to this recipe is to
turn on your blender.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:27.560
After about 30 seconds to a minute, you'll
get something that kind of looks like a strawberry

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.560
milk shake.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.060
...so, you can do the last step one of two
ways, you can use a nut milk bag, or you can

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.150
use your average dish cloth if you don't have
access to a nut milk bag.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:46.400
you just want to add your milk to the dish
cloth in a bowl and then slowly squeeze out

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.550
all of the liquid.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.980
Leaving all the debris of the nuts and the
dates and salt inside the dishrag.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.350
Safety precaution! remove any blazers, or
fancy clothing and roll up your sleeves

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.090
... it's going to get messy

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.770
This is a fantastic way to get a workout if
you hate the gym.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.850
Then after a lot of hard, gruelling muscle
work, you'll end up with a beautiful strawberry

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.290
milk.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.189
mmmmmm, that's really good....

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.329
it is, would you like some strawberry milk?

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.709
So, I want to know if there's a beverage that
brings back really happy childhood memories

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:30.709
for you.
