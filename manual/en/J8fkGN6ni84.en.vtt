This is Kevin from SnowboardProCamp.com. In this beginner series video

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.990
I'll show you how to slide on your snowboard on the
heel edge.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.920
Sliding on your heels is the first thing
you want to practice,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.220
with both feet strapped into your snowboard.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.110
Heel sliding allows you to control your
speed on the slope.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.010
It also allows you to travel from one
side of the run

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.320
to the other.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.630
Before trying to heel slide make sure
you've watched the videos

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.860
on skating and getting off the chair
lift.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.250
You want to start by finding an easy bunny
hill to practice on.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.530
Your first try you can even get someone
to hold your hands for balance.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.230
To start your snowboard sliding, lift your
toe edge up away from the snow.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.380
The more you lift your toes away from
the snow the slower you'll go.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.479
You want to find that spot where you can lift your toes and slide smoothly.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.890
While sliding keep your knees and hips
bent,

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.790
with your back straight and head up.
This will keep your wieght

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.180
in the center of your snowboard.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.000
Keep your hands at your side with your
shoulders facing the bottom of the slope.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.360
This will keep your snowboard sliding
straight.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.979
Slide your snowboard to the left by
pointing your hand down

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.010
and to the left.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.900
Putting a little bit more weight on your
left foot

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.780
To change directions start pointing to the
right

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.130
and putting a little bit more weight on
your right foot.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.100
To slide straight put equal weight on each
foot and square shoulders to the bottom

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.800
of the slope.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.050
Practice heel sliding until you're
comfortable controlling your speed

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.330
and traveling back and forth across the
hill.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.909
In the next beginner series video I'll
show you how to slide on your toes.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.299
Which is the final step before turning
on your snowboard.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.560
