Hi, welcome to mDhil, I'm Swati Gupta, creative director of Bodycraft

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.220
and today I'm going to talk to you about hair extensions.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.860
Hair extensions are the huge, huge rage now and 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:28.080
are definitely an option for people who lack volume, and who are really craving for long length but

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.740
some peoples hair just doesn't grow beyond a particular length

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.300
and sometimes when your hair lacks volume

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.120
and it's basically soft, fine hair, it looks really untidy

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.300
having it really long, because it just looks very scraggly and thin

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:51.740
extensions to me are a very very good bet to just add that length instantly

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.000
to your hair hassle-free, and it's very simple to use, and 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.140
I think it's definitely something which works very well for most people

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.640
just to give you an idea, these are extensions

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.760
good hair extension pieces are meant to be made out of 100% natural hair

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.520
so this is 100% natural human hair

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.640
which is why in some of them you will see

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.020
dark colors, a little bit of light color coming in,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.840
some greys sometimes,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.720
these can be colored, they can be washed, conditioned, blow-dried, ironed, smoothened, anything can be done to them

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.620
what you do to your natural hair you can do to you extensions as well 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.480
You get them with clips, which are these, very simple,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.100
open, put on, and clip down

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.060
you open the second one,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.860
so you measure which part of the head it is fitting the best

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.320
and just open the clip, slide it in, clip back

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.040
these are temporary extensions, which means you put them on whenever you want and you

00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:00.660
take them off whenever you want

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.500
you can't sleep with them and have them on your head 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.800
through 2-3 days, because obviously it's not stable enough to stay.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.440
for people who like to have it on a permanent basis,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.620
there is an option of permanent hair extensions,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:27.540
the look exactly the same, they are exactly the same hair and they can be whatever length you want, all that is your choice

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.600
but they don't come with clips

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.280
so you can double them up, keep them single, however you want to do it

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.840
and you can do the technique, there's a stitching technique where

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.140
some section of the hair is braided

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.580
and then this is attatched to that

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.120
and it's kind of sewn on. 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:58.800
Permanent in nature, in the sense that they have to be refixed every... Some people can last for about 

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:03.520
six weeks, some people can last about 10 weeks, some people can last even 12 weeks

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.220
depending on how fast your natural hair grows.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.860
So you take them off and you get them fixed on again

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:20.620
if you are using them on a permanent basis, they can last 2, 3, 4 years even, depending on how well you retain them

00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:23.500
you have to treat them just like you treat natural hair

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.540
wash them regularly, you condition it, 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.920
you use serum, you do whatever you would do to take care of your natural hair.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.920
So that's how permanent hair extensions work

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.500
there are different techniques, I'm talking about the technique of stitching

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.000
but there are different techniques used to attatch 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.760
permanent hair extensions

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.460
some people use glue technique, and there are different things so

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.280
that's your choice

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.020
there's a lot of myths attached to the permanent ones where there is stitching and stuff involved

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.320
It does not lead to any hair fall, it does not affect your scalp condition

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.540
it is stitched on

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.760
of course the hair still feels obviously heavy, because there is a whole length of hair which is attatched to it

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.560
but after that you get used to it

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:17.060
you can do 1, 2, 3, 2 on the side, you can do only one, it's totally your call, there's no limit to what you can do with your extensions
