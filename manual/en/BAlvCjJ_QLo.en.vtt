00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.800
This is a Joe Glavin with

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.059
Philadelphia Floor. Today we're going to
talk about the Woca Oil application process 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:20.059
Before applying any
European hardening oil

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.039
system, professionally sand the wood
floor

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.330
to the NWFA standards

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.789
the Woca oil system requires wood floor
cleaner to be used

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.940
for our pic Asian we used the two
chamber bucket the blue tape on the side

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.160
in the bucket identifies the solution
side

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.020
while the other side straight water

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.840
dissolution

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.340
is a forty 21 mix of water and local
wood cleaner

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.039
on larger applications you may need to
change out the clean water grants

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:57.239
and the solution as he gets thirty local
wood cleaner reviews to clean the floor

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.960
so removes extra tears late pigment oils

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.960
and tenon all substances in the floor
that could affect oil finish once the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.780
clean floors dry

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.990
notice the brightness up the wood

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.960
with the removal of the exit is the wood
floor is noticeably brighter and cleaner

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.680
darker wood species like American walnut
or exotic species like Brazilian cherry

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.680
require the floor to be cleaned twice
the same method

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.460
this character reno playing is being
world with the natural oil

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.600
a three a snap throw reviews and the oil
can be applied

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.110
from Apollo or paint tray we recommend
rolling the oil

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.790
as it forces that will into the grain
and give you the proper spread rate

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.710
applying loyal to a character red oak
floor like this

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.200
where the grain is openly and not some
more malls are present

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.630
are spread rate came in at 100 to 130
square feet per liter a boil

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.280
on species such as walnut cherry or
maple

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.560
with tighter green the coverage can be
200 square feet per liter

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.090
after rolling out the oil allow it to
sit for at least 15 minutes to penetrate

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.360
before going to the bar for

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.430
under the buffer use a red pad

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.960
in the tax the hook and loop patina
desks property discs are not required

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.980
they do cut the Rays green and force the
willing to the floor

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.370
for a very smooth finish if you intend
on walking on wet oil

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.280
be sure to wear plastic food on issues
you but the floor with the theme of this

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.150
listing for the cutting Athlon

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.260
death as it disappear he can move on to
the next

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.810
hard floor the San we're hearing left
fielder Grady

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.090
plane being cut the cut ring next with
the excess oil

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.570
creates a slurry that helps fill the
poor and result in the smoothest

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.200
for excess oil can move for the next set
for 4 with the squeegee

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.300
or replace the red pad with a fresh

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.310
want pad and rapidly te retail to soak
up the excess oil

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.570
feel free to go over the area it one
more time

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.120
with the white pad even out the were
left on the surface

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.850
allow 24 hours for the base coat dry

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.850
before applying the topcoat aside from
natural oil

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.110
their variety of colors available here
we're mixing wanna

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.680
it's important to shake the container to
distribute the color

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.150
into the oil we're rolling the wall
mount will

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.480
onto the sanded include way to a panel
we're still using 3h nap roller for

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.520
proper spread rate

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.290
and penetration of the oil

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.810
the color wheel gives us the opportunity
to show the amount of oil

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.260
that was rolled on the floor

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.910
the other side

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.380
this white oak floor is being oiled with
extra weight oil

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.650
the application is the same as a natural

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:18.650
and the woman well

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.370
shows how important it is to keep our
any areas

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:31.340
such as pain your games and baseboards
as the team with this continue to cut

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.300
the Rays green

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.320
you'll notice a slight sheen being
produced on the floor

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.400
just like the natural

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.919
use a new white pad wrapped in a tear it
out to clean up the excess oil

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.600
on

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.030
world floors with expansion gaps beveled
edges

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.840
or cracks a slow curing oil can we back
it's important to remove

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.490
as much %uh excess oil from these areas
as possible to minimize this effect

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.570
if the Glee back Willis had time to
harden he can be removed by scraping it

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.940
off

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.230
with a sharp wood floor scraper before
the second topcoat

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.180
is applied on the x2-01

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.810
oil side on this floor like to highlight
the way a lil

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.590
in the soft green up the word to
accomplish this

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.969
did not mean patina discs on a bus in
New York

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.989
after cleaning up the excess will lose
the fresh white pad

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:35.960
even out the world

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.330
if the base coat is dry for 24 hours

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.830
applied top but avoid it could develop
some form

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.650
and becomes the protective wear layer
for the oil system there's very little

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.170
will use for the powerful

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.470
spread rated 200 to 300 square feet per
year

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:59.470
recommended

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.090
the team this year view about 3,000
square feet

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.750
views feel free to use paint thinner to
clean off any excess

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.160
will and then rinse them on the clean
water and reuse

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.500
of

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.780
for safety hose down any pads

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.190
tools foretell before placing a dumpster
trash can trackback

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.900
the here the key points

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:36.900
the application of local well

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.820
