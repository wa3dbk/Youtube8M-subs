Hi everyone, it's Lunden, and
this week we're working out

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:06.200
your entire body with the resistance band.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.900
Right here, right now.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.259
Okay, so the exercises are going
to be a step-back lunge with

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.500
bicep curl, 10 on each side.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.850
Knee always stays above your ankle.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.830
Ten on each side.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.379
A side squat to tricep extension,

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.719
10 on each side. You're gonna drop one end of the resistance band, kind of kick it out in front of you so you don't step on it.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.000
You're gonna have enough slack on the side that you're doing
the tricep extension on to fully execute that movement.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.000
So, keeping your elbow close to your
head, bending your elbow back.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.100
Then you're gonna step out with that free leg.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.979
So, I'm using my right arm, my left
leg is gonna step out - squat...

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.000
and come up to a tricep extension.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.900
Ten on each side.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.630
Followed by resistance push-ups, 10 to 20.
Depends on how many you can knock

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.000
outta the park. They're hard,
just try your hardest.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.420
For the push-ups you're gonna wrap the
resistance band around your neck and

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.370
then bring it down below your shoulders. You
wanna grab enough resistance so that you can

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.740
extend your arms out in front of you and still feel that pull back,
that resistance. Okay, now we're gonna do some push-ups.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.300
With your hands like this...

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.490
When you're done rest for 60 seconds, if
not a little bit less, and repeat 3 to 5 times,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.900
targeting that total body. Feels awesome!
Okay, so I hope you enjoyed that

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.170
total body workout with the
resistance band, as you can see

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.569
this piece of equipment is compact, you can roll it up,
throw it in anything that you happen to be taking

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.800
with you or traveling with.
Join me here next week on the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.500
