00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.760
Oooh, pretty!

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.740
And you are sure the large explosions do not

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.660
mean the Earth is being attacked?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.880
For the sixth time, yes!

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.400
Are you an alien, or are you just dense?

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.400
The writers of this show could never decide.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.720
Please be quiet, I'm trying to watch the fireworks.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.580
Here, eat this. That out to shut you up.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.040
Robin what is this pink substance?

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.820
Cotton candy.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.860
[Sweet Cthulhu will someone please shut you up!]

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.520
Eeep!

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.760
Thanks, Lord Cthulhu!

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.240
The rape of the tentacles is not in my contract!

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.960
Pzyew!!

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.560
Meanwhile, back at the fair.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.640
I told you I'd win you a prize!

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.860
The Titans don't need TWO big chickens.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.080
Titans, trouble.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.440
Speak of the devil--

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.700
I don't need that lip, Raven.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.180
Robin: When I realized it wasn't Cthulhu I came to get you all immediately.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.100
Go away now, please!

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.940
Bjowww, Pew pew!

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.160
Titans, this will require teamwork.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.240
Heyah!

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.040
[glass breaks]

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.880
Kaboom!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.600
There, was that so hard?

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.380
How could you punch it to death when my laser blast could not hurt it?

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.260
There's a very good reason. You see--

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.380
Later, back at the ranch.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.000
Well that was a lovely evening!

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.560
I think-- Oh my!

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.800
That acid I took earlier is finally kicking in!

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.960
Still doing acid, eh?

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.160
Starfire: Blackfire?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.000
I thought I left you for dead on Hoth.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.100
Oh you did, but no hard feelings.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.520
Ooh, bling!

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.680
You must be the Titans. I've read so much about you in Lord Darkseid's files.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.520
You must be Cyborg.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.600
Wow you wear almost as much metal as I do!

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.920
And you're Raven right? You sure are cute.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.160
Say, are you--?

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.460
Straight as an arrow.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.240
Never mind then.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.340
You must be Beast Boy.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.320
Starfire says you're the only Titan she can outsmart.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.780
Um, that's what SHE said.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.780
[laughs] You poor thing. You actually think that's witty.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.100
Ooh this cape is so cool.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.240
How did you get in here?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.660
The security system accepted my hand print.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.420
Aw man, I just spent a month fixin' that stupid thing.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.260
You know those tights don't leave much to the imagination.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.300
So, sister, what brings you here?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.700
Nothing sinister.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.820
Nobody thought you were doing anything sinister.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.980
Oh, oops. Hey let's go to a club!

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.060
Sure, it's not like we have anything better to do.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.260
Kaboom!

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.760

[Caramel Dancen Plays]

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.180
Blackfire: I hope you don't mind that I stole your spare costume, Star.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.940
Starfire: I guess not...

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.380
So are we gonna dance or what?

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.340
Hey I bet you Cyborg can do a mean -Robot-!

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.980
Aw sure, just because I'm black you assume I can dance! Racist.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.460
Blackfire: So I'm a lot better than Starfire aren't I?

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.720
Beast Boy: Okay I'm the dumb one and even I get that you're evil.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.820
At least I still have you Raven.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.300
You're so lame, Starfire.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.920
Goth Boy: Hey let's go somewhere and be all emo.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.440
[Maybe if I were also 'The Emo' people would like me as well.]

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.160
Douche: Hey you in the slutty dress, wanna go bang?

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.300
I left my drum at home.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.100

Announcer: Meanwhile in the depths of space.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.500
Buster: The girl may have beaten one probe, but she won't fair so well against three!

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.420
Dave: By 'the girl' you mean Blackfire, right?

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.260
Buster: Oh sure, ruin the twist ending why don't you?

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.440
Dave: Dude even four year olds have seen this plot a billion times.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.940
Perhaps I do not belong here after all.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.900
Look, we only need one Emo per team, and Raven has that covered.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.180
But Blackfire is so much cooler than me. She has nicer boobs and she understands the Earth turns of phrase.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.680
And she gets along with the team so well.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.260
I am just a dork that nobody likes.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.260
This is where you comfort me and tell me I am fine the way I am.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.900
Bruce always taught me that honesty was the best policy.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.500
Yo hot pants, how do I look?

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.720
Like an Asian hooker.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.900
That's exactly what I was going for. Let's go dance!

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.720
[Oh what else could go wrong?]

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.580
I don't care!

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.840
You neither? Okay, let's just keep dancing.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.240
[Starfire screams]

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.040
Vazooom!

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.140
Kaboom.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.700
We could use firepower like that. And you fill out the suit nicer than Starfire ever did.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.180
Wanna join the Titans?

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.680
Hells yeah!

Announcer: Later on the Roof of Justice

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.620
If they like her so much, they can have her. I'm going to run away from home!

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.020
Robin: So what, you get a little jealous and you leave?

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.920
But you like her better.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.380
Who wouldn't? But that's no reason to run off in the middle of the night witout saying anything.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.240
Buster: Surrender or be fired upon!

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.500

Dammit, Dave, they didn't even answer yet!

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.840
Sorry, my finger slipped. Here, let's get the right one.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.240
The rape of the tentacles is not in my contract.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:48.420
[Okay I only have one chance to grab her foot and save her. If I miss, I'll plummet to my doom.]

Beast Boy: Uh shouldn't we get Starfire back?

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.400
Robin: Pfft. If she's going to abandon us at the first sign of trouble, she can rot in jail as far as I'm concerned.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.120
Blackfire: That was so cool of you guys to let me stay, even though I totally framed her for my crimes.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.340
You're just that awesome. But we can't keep calling you Blackfire.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.580
All the merchandizing rights are for 'Starfire' and it would be a hassle to change it.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.180
So keep that hair dyed and work on mimicking her voice and it will be like she never left.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.260
(imitating Starfire) Okay then!

I can't believe that Robin did that.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.480
You don't just replace a teammate and act like nothing happened.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.620
Where did he learn that kind of behavior?

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.920
