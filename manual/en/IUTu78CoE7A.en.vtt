00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:22.279
There’s something to be said for technical
achievement.

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.300
It’s kind of a big deal to have a character
this huge on that tiny little Game Boy screen.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
Back in the late nineties, there’s no question...that
was a nice little development feat, for sure.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.020
But then you press start, and then you see
that...a big character doesn’t really mean

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.020
much.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.280
Not when the gameplay is so small.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.989
In fact, I’ve got to be honest...when I
loaded up Godzilla: The Series for the Game

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.219
Boy, my first thought was that something was
wrong.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.900
Like, maybe the game was damaged or something?

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.739
I don’t know, I mean...otherwise, where
are all the enemies?

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.180
Where’s the action?

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.520
Why is nothing happening?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.489
A few resets and Q-tips later, and it became
clear that...nothing was wrong but the game

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:01.570
itself.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:09.410
Seriously, this is all there is to Godzilla:
The Series.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.170
So this was released in 1999.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.150
It’s based on the animated series, which
spawned from that terrible 1998 movie.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.920
Godzilla: The Series is really plodding, really
uneventful...

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.500
I don’t know if I’ve ever played a game
in which less happens.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.840
So you control Godzilla, although I use “control”
loosely.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.920
He moves automatically, so you’re just handling
his attacks.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.110
You can tilt Godzilla’s neck to spit fire
balls, swing his tail, stomp the ground...um.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.500
I mean, there are cut scenes, with talking
heads.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.900
The cartridge is...made of plastic.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.530
Obviously, there’s not much to talk about
here.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.270
The game is just that boring.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.670
I guess there’s some leveling up...which
is nice.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.580
But it happens automatically, so you don’t
pick which attacks are improved.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.450
The boss battles are kind of a joke.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.010
You just mash the fire balls until it’s
over.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.911
Honestly, the game is almost funny, in a way.

00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:20.950
Like, Godzilla isn’t even on the screen
entirely.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.910
Like, he’s too embarrassed to even be there.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.430
But you know what?

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.850
To the game’s credit, it’s not...awful.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.030
Eventually, there’s a bit of a rhythm to
stomping enemies on the ground and then aiming

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.180
at the ones in the air.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.490
The thing is...there’s never that many to
worry about; your health regenerates, anyway.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.850
In fact, it’s kind of fitting that Godzilla
walks automatically.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.980
Because this entire game basically runs on
autopilot.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.030
Thanks to Felicity from the UK for sending
us Godzilla: The Series.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.360
This game’s boring!
