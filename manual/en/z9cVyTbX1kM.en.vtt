[MUSIC]

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.050
We declare that the Book of
Mormon is a book that

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.830
testifies that Jesus
is the Christ, the

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.820
Savior of the world.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.570
Great prophets throughout the
Book of Mormon have borne

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.960
solemn witness that Jesus Christ
is the Creator of the

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.985
Earth, the Redeemer of mankind,
the only begotten of

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.490
the Father.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.590
These Book of Mormon prophets
knew Him as Abraham and Moses

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.300
did, and received and taught
His everlasting Gospel.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.510
As we read and study their
words, we gain a deeper

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.570
understanding of the Savior's
matchless love, His perfect

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.160
life and example, and
the blessings of His

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.840
great atoning sacrifice.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.210
Although it's history is
compelling by itself, it is a

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.330
book of scriptural significance
that should and

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.340
must be received and read under
the influence of the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.170
Holy Ghost. All who study and
ponder its teachings are given

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.060
a promise in the last chapter
of Moroni, as well as in the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.280
introduction to the Book of
Mormon, where we read "We

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.806
invite all men and women
everywhere to read the Book of

00:01:15.806 --> 00:01:18.340
Mormon, to ponder in their
hearts the message it

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.950
contains, and then to ask God,
the Eternal Father, in the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.250
name of Christ, if
the book is true.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.420
Those who pursue this course and
ask in faith will gain a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.370
testimony that's truth and
divinity by the power of the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.710
Holy Ghost."

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.340
I express my solemn witness
that the Book

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.860
of Mormon is true.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.960
It is a book that has brought
about a mighty

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.010
change in my life.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.180
I know that God lives, Jesus is
the Christ, His Gospel has

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.440
been restored on the Earth.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.430
The spirit I feel as I daily
read, ponder, and pray about

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.680
the Book of Mormon strengthens
my understanding and testimony

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.290
of these things and reaffirms
to me that they are true.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.620
I humbly share this testimony
and my personal witness with

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.380
you in the name of Jesus
Christ. Amen.
