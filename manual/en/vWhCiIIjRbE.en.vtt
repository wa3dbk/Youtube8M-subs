00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.970
Potentially clean your house in the future
with this robot flies concept.&nbsp;

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.900
And if you need a caffeine boost just let
it absorb through your skin with Sprayable

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.900
Energy.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.900
Vsauce!

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.900
Kevin here.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.080
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.640
Two baby rabbits were successfully born glowing
fluorescent green.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.410
Researchers at the University of Hawaii injected
a naturally glowing jellyfish protein into

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.589
embryos in a pregnant rabbit - two of the
baby ended up carrying the gene.

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.390
The point is to be able to eventually make
rabbits that produce medicine in their milk

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.070
and the green glow allows researchers to see
which animals have gotten the specific gene.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.150
Researchers at the University of Tokyo are
working on creating electronic skin.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.710
They've been developing flexible electronic
mesh to wrap around robot hands for over a

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.510
decade and now they're bringing it to humans.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.900
The e-skin can bend, stretch and twist and
is 10 times thinner than kitchen plastic wrap.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.170
Right now it can be used to monitor vital
signs but eventually could be used to make

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.259
humans hyperaware or communicate simply with
our skin.

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.369
The University of Washington meanwhile have
achieved a breakthrough in direct brain-to-brain

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.369
communication.

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.869
A professor linked to another used his thoughts
to control the other's actions &nbsp;- making

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.520
the linked professor involuntarily move his
hand and press a space bar to play a computer

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.520
game.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.859
And while basic hand movement is simple it
opens the door to exploring the possibilities

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.509
of sending more advanced brain signals to
each other.

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.850
Researchers at the Institute of Molecular
Biotechnology in Vienna, Austria have grown

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.619
a 3D tiny human brain.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.939
The mini three dimensional brain models were
grown using stem cells and include parts of

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.060
the cortex, hippocampus and retinas.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.069
And right now they're using these to study
early fetal brain development but hope to

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:01.270
eventually grow larger brains to provide insights
into conditions such as schizophrenia and

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.350
autism.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.560
It turns out seahorses have squishable armor
to help protect them from being crushed by

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.630
predators and researchers at the University
of California, San Diego are building a robotic

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.750
arm from 3D printed plates mimicking this
compressible design.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.750
So yeah.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.420
The Uji is a new shower head that makes you
aware of how long you've been in the shower.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.190
So far they've noticed a 12% decrease in shower
time and say that the $50 shower head will

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.960
pay for itself within 7 months.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.470
It works by turning from green to red after
7 minutes and the hope is that people are

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.370
out of the shower by minute 8.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.590
The Sesame Ring looks to simplify paying for
public transportation by wearing your pass

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.590
on your finger.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.520
The rings are 3D printed and come in a variety
of colors and while it's designed to work

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.270
in Boston right now they're looking to bring
this worldwide.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.970
Yeah, I'll be right there just let me fold
up my Korean armadillo car.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.450
Pocket space craft is giving you the ability
to send yourself into outer space - in a way.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.350
You can upload a picture and a personalized
message to your spacecraft that's smaller

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.090
than a CD and as thin as a piece of paper.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.350
- which will then be launched with along with
thousands of others into space.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.940
Check out the website for more.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.500
Architect Shigeru Ban made a $6 Million cathedral
out of cardboard tubes.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.250
Even though it's made out of cardboard it
is more structurally sound than the previous

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.170
cathedral that was lost in an earthquake.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.060
The structure is called the Transitional Cathedral
and is also apparently fireproof and waterproof.&nbsp;

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.290
Bumpy Photo will turn standard 2D photos into
3D sculptures.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.900
The photos can be made as small as 1" or as
large as 15" and all you have to do it upload

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.540
a picture of your choice to the website, wait
for the conversion and production and then

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.840
have it sent to your doorstep.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.650
Finally, youtuber Vaecon used the Oculus Rift
virtual reality system, a harness to hang

00:03:48.650 --> 00:04:02.850
15 feet off the ground and skydiving software
to create a virtual skydiving demo.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.980
I'm gonna leave you with robots laying out
slot-car track - seriously this is awesome

00:04:07.980 --> 00:05:03.940
- and as always - thanks for watching.
