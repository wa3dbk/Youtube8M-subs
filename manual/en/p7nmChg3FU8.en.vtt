00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.280
we're here in torrance california at the
headquarters of Toyota Motor Sales USA

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.710
my name is mark williams and i'm here
with David Lee market call me a product

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.250
education administrator at work for the
University of toyota is our company's

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.210
training division my primary
responsibilities are to make training

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.839
courses on our new products for our
dealership sales associates out there

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.199
well we're here because of the new
engine what does it fit in the tundra

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.130
line

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.390
well right now are tundra lineup has had
since its inception in $YEAR 07 3

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.830
different engines of these six a small
v8 and a large ba out of those three

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.210
engines are in mid size Gator small v8r
4.7 liter that engine has been in

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.010
service for 10 years now and it's time
to be replaced and so we have a new 4.6

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.150
liter version coming out now it has new
technology that's along with the current

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.630
engine selection we got the temple today
when you say it has more horsepower more

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.590
torque better fuel economy you know we
tried to shoot for here is to make this

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.329
midsize v8 engine have fuel economy on
par with our 4-liter v6 some of our new

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.790
technologies in our dual variable
Valentine evidence

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.540
audience and a six-speed gearbox set
behind the engineer enable us to achieve

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.040
those goals don't have official figures
yet but we should have about 40 shortly

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.470
what about the implications to towing or
a load capacity in this case here if

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.100
you're familiar with the 4.7 liter
tundras capacities the 46 will be right

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.370
in there as far as going all-in
capability payload numbers and counting

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.200
numbers should be very very close

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.840
so right now if you're thinking about
picking one of these up on they're not

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.170
for sale yet take a look at the numbers
on the 47 truck and that'll give you a

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.560
good idea where you're going to be
setting with the 46 you said it's a new

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.630
transmission this 60 minutes on the 4.6
here now is actually a derivative of the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.540
5-speed transmission it's replacing and
a 760 series 3 predecessor was in a 750

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.650
for the new six-speed that goes with the
4.6 liter actually takes up about the

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.580
same amount of space as the previous
five-speed gearbox did so it makes very

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.300
well to this smaller block engine and
the ratios and mystic speed or a little

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.229
bit different from the six-speed ratios
in our 57 truck the ratios of us are

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.640
tuned for this engine and they actually
vary a little bit and in fact the lowest

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.899
gear ratio here first year in this 4.6
liter 6 speed is a little lower and it

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.950
is and we take 5-7 transmission and it
stopped here is actually a little bit

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.630
set up more polluted

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.290
the lower RPM at high speed to spend a
lot of engineering time setting us up

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.560
for this particular engine alright
captain suspense long enough

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.530
what about horsepower and torque
compared to you

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.120
listing for some existing 47 puts out
about 271 horsepower and out was a 313

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.290
pound-feet of torque

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.380
this puts out about 370 horsepower and
roughly 327 pound-feet of torque and now

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.540
