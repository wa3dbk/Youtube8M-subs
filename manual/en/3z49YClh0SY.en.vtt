How did that look? Pretty good?

00:00:38.617 --> 00:00:41.250
Did it seem like I was scrolling my iPad or iPhone?

00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:50.100
So that’s...that’s the sort of part I need to coordinate before I go is getting that timing right.

00:00:51.378 --> 00:00:53.792
OFF CAMERA: With obviously not your fingers but your full body? SHANA: Yeah, right.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.674
This is my wig bag. It’s all wigs. Well, and some bags.

00:01:06.496 --> 00:01:15.209
Okay, wig, book light, I think that’s it. Oh, I have a list.

00:01:18.608 --> 00:01:20.484
I got it.

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:26.756
So I hadn’t been performing so much before I came to New York.

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:37.684
And then I also didn’t have a studio then. I was so broke when I moved here, so I decided to try to build the set with stuff that I could animate on my computer.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.528
So that was like the first time I made this decision to scale down and make this portable performance.

00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:58.837
It’s usually like me running around on the subway or maybe a car service if I’m feeling really glamorous.

00:02:00.998 --> 00:02:08.579
With like all my props, you know on my arms, and uh, setting up half an hour before the performance starts.

[Tonight is the opening]

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:35.088
With these performances I don’t really know exactly how big this projection will be you know in relationship to my body.

00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:40.163
You know if I’m like taller than this projection then that’s not going to really work.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.253
The worst is like if I get there and I can’t test you know the...the DVD and the projection.

00:02:52.435 --> 00:02:56.352
And I hate that feeling of not being totally prepared.

00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:16.855
You know at an opening the attention span is you know at a certain level and something a lot longer than ten minutes is just like too long or....

00:03:17.068 --> 00:03:21.933
I mean especially for my work it’s not about...it’s not really about that kind of challenge.

Sometimes people don’t realize that I’m in a costume. They just think I’m a...the wacky woman skulking in the back.

00:05:08.223 --> 00:05:21.978
People tend to respond positively for most performance, so I don’t know if I can really go off that as, you know a gauge for how successful it really was but....

00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:24.605
I felt...I felt alright about it. You know.
