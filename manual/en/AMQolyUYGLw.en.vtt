00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.866
When you record at full screen, or with any 
large dimensions, sometimes it’s difficult to 
see the details of your video when producing to 

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:13.766
much smaller dimensions…such as on a 
mobile device or a website.    

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:17.332
That’s where Camtasia’s SmartFocus feature 
can help. 

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:23.999
SmartFocus automatically predicts where to 
zoom in during your video to make it easier to 
see things on your screen.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.300
All this happens behind the scenes during 
recording, as SmartFocus analyzes the 
position of your mouse cursor, which windows 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.366
are active, and when text is entered.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:39.066
SmartFocus then uses this data to add zoom 
animations to your timeline in the editor.

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:45.066
One important thing to note is that SmartFocus 
will only work with Camtasia Recording, or 
.camrec, files.  

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:52.932
It will not work when saving your recordings to 
the AVI format, or with other video formats that 
can be imported into Camtasia Studio. 

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:59.533
You can still manually zoom and pan with other 
video formats…but the SmartFocus data just 
won’t be present.  

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:07.233
Let’s take a look at how SmartFocus is 
applied, and then how easy it is to edit and add 
new zoom animations.  

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:12.499
As long as the editing dimensions that you 
choose are smaller than the recording 
dimensions…SmartFocus will automatically 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.833
be applied to the Timeline.  

00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:18.833
If SmartFocus is applied, you’ll see this pop up 
on the timeline.

00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:24.666
You will also see these blue visual animations 
that represent where SmartFocus was 
automatically applied.  

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:28.199
Their placement is predicted based on data 
collected during the recording.  

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.900
Their placement is predicted based on data 
collected during the recording.  

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.566
You can position the playhead before any of the 
animations and playback the video to see what 
happens in the canvas.  

00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:41.199
Here, it looks like this zoom is focusing in on 
the calculator as the mouse pointer is clicking 
the keys.  

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.233
To reposition when the zoom happens during 
the video, click and drag the animation on the 
timeline. 

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:51.099
It’s also very easy to make quick edits to an 
animation.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.366
Just double-click one of them and the Visual 
Properties Tab opens.

00:01:55.366 --> 00:02:00.566
The visual properties give you tons of control 
over how your media looks and appears in 
your video.  

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:04.532
This also includes editing your zoom 
animations.   

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:10.833
Adjust the scale of your zoom by dragging this 
slider…and see the changes instantly on the 
canvas.  

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:17.399
If you’re zooming in, targeting 100% is a good 
rule to follow because that’s where your video 
will be the clearest.  

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.666
Anything over 100% may cause your video to 
look blurry or pixelated.  

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:29.799
You can also adjust the opacity…and other 
visual effects, but we’ll cover these more in the 
Visual Properties tutorial. 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.266
Besides using the scale slider to adjust the 
zoom level, it’s also possible to grab one of the 
corners on the canvas to scale your video.  

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:43.199
You may need to change the percentage of 
view on the canvas using this drop-down 
menu, or the scroll wheel on your mouse, 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.933
to see more of your recorded video.  

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:52.199
Then just drag the recording to reposition what 
you want to show inside the preview area of 
the canvas.  

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.300
Anything outside of this video preview area will 
not show up in the produced video.  

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.700
Once the video is zoomed into this new 
location, it will remain there until it either 
reaches the end of the clip,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.000
or another animation.  

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.833
Let’s play back the video just before this next 
animation to see what happens. 

00:03:10.833 --> 00:03:16.399
Now the focus is on the Notepad document…
and everything else is not visible in the video.  

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.600
Again, if this animation needed to be edited, 
just double-click it and make the changes 
within the Visual Properties tab.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:31.733
Let’s say you don’t want to use SmartFocus, or 
you want to manually control where to add any 
zooms and pans in your video.  No problem.  

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:35.599
First, let me show you how to turn off 
SmartFocus.  

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.866
Click to open the Zoom-n-Pan tab, and 
uncheck this box next to “Apply SmartFocus to 
clips added”.  

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:48.666
Now, any new clips added to the timeline won’t 
automatically add the zoom-n-pan animations.  

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:57.232
To remove any, or all existing animations from 
a clip…right-click one of them and either 
choose delete, or delete all visual animations.  

00:03:57.233 --> 00:04:03.299
If you have multiple clips on the timeline, you 
will have to delete all visual animations 
separately from those clips. 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.133
To add a visual animation manually, first, 
select the media and position the playhead 
where you want to add the animation.  

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:16.233
If you don’t have any media selected on the 
timeline, you will see this message in the 
Visual Properties tab.  

00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:20.466
So, with the media selected, click the Add 
animation button.

00:04:20.466 --> 00:04:24.299
If you like keyboard shortcuts, the hotkey “Z” 
will also work…

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.700
...but again, the media must be selected on the 
timeline in order to add an animation.  

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:36.166
You can resize and reposition the video on the 
canvas so that it shows exactly what you want 
at this point in the video.  

00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:41.966
As an alternative, you can also reposition the 
level of zoom from within the Zoom-n-Pan tab.  

00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:48.532
Whatever is placed inside this selection 
rectangle on the left gets displayed in the video 
at this point in time.   

00:04:48.533 --> 00:04:53.299
Now it’s up to you to decide if you want 
SmartFocus to help guide you with when to 
zoom and pan, 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.800
or take over the control yourself and add the 
visual animations manually.  

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.500
The next tutorial in this series will show you 
how to cut out, or remove, unwanted media on 
the timeline.    

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.966
