00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.690
Hi I'm Carolyn and I'm going to demonstrate
on how to handle a cat on the table. The most

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.200
important thing of all is you do not want
them to jump off. Not necessarily because

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.560
you can't get what you need to have done because
they could hurt them selfs. They didn't get

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.320
up here and if they jump off they can do it
because they are afraid. Especially if they

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.670
are wet there feet would go out from underneath
them and you could be at the vet in a heart

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.680
beat. Now this old guy is good we have bath
him a while ago and he is sleepy. So that

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.230
helps. You can not trust any of them on the
table. Like he looks like he is going to be

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.660
good if some noise happened you know and he
would get hurt trying to get off. Always bare

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:54.140
mind somebody might knock on the door, the
phone would ring, and he is real good so there

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:02.590
is not a lot to do to him. You could hold
him like this and/or this I don't like the

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.150
looks of it but if you are not hurting him
it is a excellent way to hold him. I don't

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.610
like to do cause it looks pitiful but that
is a good way to hold him. I have notice a

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.181
lot of people that don't really know what
they are doing they tell me that is how there

00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:25.510
mother holds them. Well there mother doesn't
hold them like this there mother has a soft

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.280
mouth and it is right around that part there.
She doesn't have her teeth on them and you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.080
have to watch your fingernails. You know if
your fingernails are to long you can't successfully

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.790
work with a animal and the mother does not
hold them like this. She got her mouth is

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.119
really tender and soft plus when if you got
a older cat a mother does not carry him around

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.360
because there body out weights this support
here and you could really hurt a adult cat

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.049
hold them like this. You see he is not being
hurt but I don't like the looks of that. Do

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.700
you? Some of them you have to though some
of them are not this good.
