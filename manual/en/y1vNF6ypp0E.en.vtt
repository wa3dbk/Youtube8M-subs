00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.700
Welcome to Expert Village I'm Steve Blank
audio and video engineer for Mind Food Productions

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:16.710
here to show you how we can record with electronic
drums. One thing I like to do is I route all

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:25.320
the outputs from all these tracks to one track
and in this case this master and then install

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:39.630
a compressor. It just used this complete mix
preset and then adjust my game based on really

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.050
how your input is and how really loud it is.
In this particular case I already know I can

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.429
bump this up about 60 beats, basically what
happen here is when it went to the compressor

00:00:52.429 --> 00:01:01.289
some of the volume was lost. So this makes
up for that volume lost a little more complicated

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:09.799
than that but starting with a compressor on
your mix gives you a big leg up on getting

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:21.560
the mix down quickly. Let's watch the compressor
in action (playing) the level right here is

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:32.630
the full output that would effect if we mix
this down right now to make a MP3 or a wave

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:44.490
file this is the levels we'll be having. Now
if I click here and close this, this is telling

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:59.509
me that my peak is at -.1DB in other words
.0 would be right at peak so we're 1/10 of

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.429
a decibel below peak, which is ideal.
