00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.549
Samsung Ch@t B3410W.

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.459
Expected soon.

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:19.160
A WiFi-enabled update of the existing B3410
Corby Plus, the Samsung Ch@t B3410W is yet

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.970
another phone aimed at users of social networking
sites, in an affordable package that should

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.019
appeal to younger customers.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.140
The Samsung Ch@t comes with a 2.6" 240 x 320
pixel touchscreen display, a slide-out QWERTY

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.200
keypad, 2 megapixel camera, microSD expandable
memory, Bluetooth and USB connectivity. This

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.990
is a GSM-only device, but the inclusion of
WiFi should partly compensate for this.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.079
Social networking support includes Facebook,
Flickr

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.510
, MySpace and others, and usefully the Ch@t's
built-in WiFi means that these sites can be

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.050
accessed without incurring data charges.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.470
It does seem that every phone these days has
support for FaceTube and MyTwit or whatever

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.479
they're called, and the Ch@t doesn't really
stand out from the crowd. WiFi is good, but

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.610
the Ch@t lacks 3G support. The QVGA resolution
display might be OK for social networking

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.820
sites, but it's not much use for web surfing,
and two megapixel cameras are frankly out

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.180
of date. Samsung's TouchWiz interface is pretty
good, and their handsets tend to be well built..

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.680
but even so it is difficult to get excited
about it.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.540
Samsung say that the B3410W does come with
a useful amount of internal memory, either

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.390
1GB or 2GB depending on specification. It
also takes microSD cards up to an additional

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.200
16GB.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.350
The B3410W Ch@t is likely to sell on price
rather than features, the non-WiFi version

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.399
can be had for about â‚¬150 in the retail
channel SIM-free, so we would expect this

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.630
version to be available for a street price
of less than â‚¬200.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.689
It's probably worth considering if you just
can't tear yourself away from Facebook, but

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.640
unless you are on a really tight budget then
we would suggest that there are many other

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.030
better handsets available.
