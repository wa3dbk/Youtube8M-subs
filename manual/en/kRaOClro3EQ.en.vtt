00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:10.410
Have you ever watched one of those videos
where someone gets their ankles destroyed

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.360
and wished that you could do it?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.500
I think it's time you stopped wishing and
finally start to develop your ball handling

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.940
ability and learn how to get sick handles.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.940
There are a few ways you can start improving
your handles and the first one is to take

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.390
action. On your down time start practicing
your dribbling moves like your crossover,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.030
between-the-legs dribble, behind the back
dribble, and your spin move.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.030
You want to 
practice dribbling the basketball high, low,
and in between. You can practice dribbling

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.580
the basketball at different speeds and with
different intensity.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.580
There are many different ball handling skills
you can work on in order to get sick handles.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.800
You can also work on your foot work when you
dribble. You want to practice using jab steps

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.070
when you do certain moves in order to make
them more effective. For example you could

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.810
use a right foot jab step before doing a crossover
move from your right hand to your left hand.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.970
I highly advise watching your favorite ball
handler and implementing what he/she is doing

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.970
into your game. When you see how something
is done it easier to do it than to just do

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.260
it yourself without ever seeing how it's done.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.260
So, if you wanted to be able to run a fast
break without losing the basketball, you should

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.120
watch someone run a fast break that is really
good at it, and figure out what skills you

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.710
need to improve on 
in order to meet your goal of being able to
run a fast break without losing control of

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.230
the basketball.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.160
Once you start implementing different things
into your game you will notice your ball handling

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.440
ability begin to improve.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.440
Besides practicing your dribbling and watching
footage of great ball handlers there is another

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.620
way you can get sick handles. You can improve
your ball handling by gaining experience.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.840
Whenever you get the opportunity to play a
good basketball player in 1 on 1 you should

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.760
take it. There are a few things you can learn
just from a game of 1 on 1. You can try out

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.650
different moves in your arsenal and find out
which ones are effective and which ones aren't.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.650
You can learn a few moves from the person
you're playing 1 on 1.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.500
If the person you're playing 1 on 1 uses a
move on you and it works, then you will know

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.650
it is an effective move and you should start
using and perfecting it.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.610
This will certainly help you develop some
sick handles.
