00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:03.869
Okay, so guys, um

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.460
Well

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.460
That was uh, that was a bit of a stinker that they put up last night

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.880
Leafs losing 4-1

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.180
In overtime?

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.100
Can I even joke about that? No? Okay the Leafs lose 4-1 to the Philadelphia Flyers

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.600
Who I don't even recognize from last year, they're very good. Can I just say?

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.328
Um, Brian Burke who? Paul Holmgren

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.530
That guy,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.180
Said, you know, he inherited this team and went

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.880
"Hmm, they kind of suck

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.440
And just blew up the Flyers, and got all these new players

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.080
Crazy, really good

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.300
Raycroft again

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.860
Gotta feel for the guy

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.340
Back to the Flyers though

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.240
Edmonton, don't you feel a little silly?

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.160
With your impatience there? Joffrey Lupul

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.409
Very,

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.090
very good!

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.740
Lately, and last night, for the Flyers

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.520
It's really good. Back to the Leafs though, and this is the last thing I'll say about the Leafs,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.580
I actually have a story that I want to tell you boys and girls

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.549
Nik Antropov

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:22.600
Now

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.549
Everybody keeps talking about how great Nik Antropov has been this season "Oh! Finally, secondary scoring!"

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.709
"Oh! Finally, playing to potential!"

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.259
Bull.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.780
I don't care how many points he gets, as long as he leads the team in penalty minutes...

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.280
I'm not all that enthused about him

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.260
To be completely honest

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.900
I don't think he's had a fight

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.940
This season, and he leads the team in penalty minutes. That gives you an idea of how many

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.619
Stupid minor penalties he's given the team

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.898
Look at, look at how many times he's been in the box for goals lately. There was one,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.760
I don't know about last night but it was definitely the game before

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.860
And

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.420
During the Carolina loss, I believe he was in the box as well in Overtime

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.180
Terrible

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.160
But now, for storytime Boys and Girls

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.059
Anyway, I promised my friend I would tell this story

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.720
Was at the NHL Awards last year, and it was really fun

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.849
And by last year I mean still this year, it was in June

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.569
Um

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.140
And you might be saying "Oh Steve you're LYING"

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.660
Really???

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.880
Would a liar have an autographed program from the NHL awards???

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.840
We weren't really supposed to get these

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.320
Autographed, but that's, uhh

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.560
Kelly Hrudey

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.860
Who I will get to in a minute, and Scott Oake

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.506
And that's the thing we use for rehearsal.

00:02:57.506 --> 00:02:59.840
I was actually a seat-filler but I also helped them

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.879
In rehearsal. It was a lot of fun, during rehearsal, this guy

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.940
Kelly Hrudey

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.440
Was sitting in the seats, you know, just before the show

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.520
A few hours, I don't know I guess he was just hanging out, and he starts talking to me I'm like

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.360
Oh this Is kind of cool

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.300
Kelly Hrudey talking to me right?

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.500
And he's you know just going on about stuff that I don't understand at all

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.160
And finally he goes "Oh wait, you're not him?" I'm like

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.639
Not who?

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.420
Then he says "Oh, you're not John Tavares"

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.940
Dude, you thought I was John Tavares? Look at me!

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.680
I'm not John Tavares, he does this face a lot

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.280
Do I look like John Tavares? I don't think so.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.220
But, he's tearing up the World Juniors, way to go Johnny

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.480
Wish he could be a Leaf

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.889
I don't think it'll happen, cuz that means the Leafs would have to come in last, and I don't think there that bad

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.809
Although they haven't been very good lately, and I'm going to try to prep a picture for you guys just one sec

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.460
Should've had this done before hand

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.600
Oh well, I'm gonna prep a picture of

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.720
Me, actually at the NHL Awards

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.680
And if it doesn't work, I'm going to be heartbroken

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.940
And, uh, don't think it's going to work

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.560
Let's try it

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.400
Well, not so much, but remind me on my profile wall and on this video

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.860
To upload a picture next time of me at the Awards

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.640
It's actually a freeze frame of when Nicklas Lidstrom won the Norris

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.500
I was sitting right behind his family during the award show

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.280
Really cool, I saw George Snuffleupagus there too, and he goes "See you after the show"

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.180
He just said it to me, we've never

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.080
You know, formally met, I think he thought it was John Tavares too, I'm confused!

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.090
There were a couple girls there

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.900
After the show

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.700
That started talking to me because they thought I was Rod Brind'amour son...

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.260
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be flattered by that. Great player, kind of an ugly dude

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.600
Till next Time
