00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.580
Flying in a 747 from one side of the earth
to the exact opposite side would take about

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.180
22 hours… and while I know there's a bit
of rock in the way, that's really going the

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.780
long way round.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.099
So what if we did dig a hole all the way through
the earth, through the center, and jumped

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.099
in?

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.920
Well, Michael, you probably would't make it
very far - that's because of the Coriolis

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.689
effect (which is why a ball curves weirdly
when you toss it while riding a merry go round

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.919
and why hurricanes always spin counterclockwise
in the northern hemisphere).

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.179
At the equator, the earth (and you on it)
is rotating eastwards at 1670 km/hr.

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.970
As you go deeper, the bits of earth around
you are still spinning around once per day,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.070
but they don't have as far to travel so they're
going at slower and slower speeds.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.170
If you jumped into a vertical shaft, you'd
soon be traveling east faster than the rock

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.090
around you so that after falling only a few
kilometers, you'd crash into the eastern wall.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.250
It might not be a disaster, but some miners
near Lake Superior tried to test this by dropping

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.040
cannon balls down a mile-long shaft - and
the balls never reached the bottom.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.860
OK, so what if the tunnel went from pole to
pole, so the Coriolis effect didn't apply,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.260
and let's also assume that there's no air
resistance, or friction

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Ok.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.659
Since the earth's mass is more concentrated
close to the middle, gravity would pull you

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.509
down with roughly the same amount of force
for the first 3000 km, or halfway to the center

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.920
of the earth - this familiar, constant force
would accelerate you until you were falling

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.479
8km every second, and the trip halfway to
the middle of the earth would only take 13

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.479
minutes.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.539
Soon after, you'd reach the earth's outer
core, and this is the point in your journey

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.270
where the pull of gravity would be strongest
- but only slightly stronger than the force

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.000
we're used to on the surface.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.709
As you continued to fall closer to the center,
so much of the earth's mass would now be above

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.060
you that it would begin to seriously cancel
out the attraction of the mass below, and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.700
the pull would weaken until you reached the
center.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.950
Here, you'd experience no gravitational pull
at all - or rather, the earth would be pulling

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.899
on you the same amount in all directions,
so you could float freely around with no sense

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.869
of "up" or "down".

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.090
Except, remember, that you'd be speeding past
at 22,000 miles per hour, or 6 miles a second.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.749
Once you passed the center, the whole process
would reverse and you'd gradually slow, pulled

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:01.179
down (or is it up?) weakly at first and then
more strongly, until when you got to the other

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.320
side, you'd stop moving and could step out
on the surface, a mere 37 minutes, or one

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.659
dryer cycle, later.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.910
Of course, the deepest we've ever been able
to dig is the Kola Superdeep borehole in Russia.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.270
But it only went down 12km, which is only
two thirds the length of Manhattan.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.810
They had to stop because it got too hot: 180°C.
And this is sort of the problem with digging

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.880
a hole through earth - earth is hot, and molten
in the middle.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.740
You can't just dig a hole through it with
shovels.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.240
But here's a question: wasn't the middle of
earth wasn't all "liquidy", what if earth

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.690
was hollow, but weighed the same?

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.000
Well, with its entire mass concentrated in
a thin shell right under our feet, the earth

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.780
wouldn't have a magnetic field any more, because
that comes from the molten iron core.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.880
So we'd be totally vulnerable to radiation
from the solar wind and storms, and this means

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.460
we'd see the aurora EVERYWHERE.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.460
Look!

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.120
The NorthernSouthernEastern lights!

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.310
And if you jumped inside the hollow earth
to escape the solar storm?

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.690
Well, gravity from the different parts of
the spherical earth-shell would perfectly

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.610
cancel out and you'd float freely about inside
as if the earth weren't there at all!

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.300
Of course, you'd better bring a space suit,
because there's not nearly enough air ON earth

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.630
to fill up the entire INSIDE of earth.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.990
But what if the entire inside of the hollow
earth were covered with mirrors?

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.480
Henry, that's ridiculous… for now

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.820
Ok, so back outside of the earth, we wouldn't
really notice much difference from a gravitational

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.620
perspective - falling things would still accelerate
at 9.8 m/s^2, a baseball would follow the

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.060
same trajectory, and the moon would follow
the same orbit around the earth.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.350
Hey Henry, let's go to outer space, right
now.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.590
Bring your gun - this'll all make sense later.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.740
C'mon.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.970
Oh, and you're coming too.
