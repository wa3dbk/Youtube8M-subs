00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.969
Love the sport itís for all ages. Lucky enough
here Iíve got the mixed open title named

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.659
after me. Iíve won it eight times. Iíve
been captain for the Australian mixed open

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:56.219
team for a few years now. Iíve won a few
of the menís 30ís as well now and played

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.219
Australian menís 30ís so Iíve been very
very fortunate. Probably been in the right

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.219
place at the right time.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.729
&amp;nbsp;

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:11.610
My background is Lebanese. Born in Australia
so Iím Australian. Mum and Dad are from Lebanon.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.979
They migrated here in 1966 and probably the
same as most migrants come over with only

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.000
a thong ñ not that he lost one, he found
one.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.659
They did it the tough way you know. Hard because
it was a new country. They didnít know anyone

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.470
here, had to find a job , they worked two
shifts and they sort of did it the old fashioned

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.010
way.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:51.229
Actually it started with my friends. We had
touch football competitions running week nights

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.880
and a few of the guys got together and said
hey thereís this touch football game ñ itís

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.579
sort of like league but you donít have to
tackle, you donít get hurt, you know, we

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.590
should put a team in, make a night of it.
Wednesday nights go and play and then go for

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.909
a pizza and stuff like that. So it really
did start informally. Got playing for a couple

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.700
of years and they started to mention things
like the regional championships and said why

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.690
donít you come down and trial for this itís
the next level in touch. Itís sort of just

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.489
carried on from there. You play for your local
affiliate, maybe a Parramatta or a Manly or

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.590
a Hawthorn in Melbourne and from there they
picked our regional teams and from the regional

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.739
teams they went on to pick the city country
teams, state teams and Australian teams. Itís

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.880
sort of like youíre in the pool youíre starting
to swim and you keep going because youíve

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.720
got five laps to go ñ itís just been really
good.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:50.949
My background is that we play for a team called
Western Suburbs of Sydney. We are a very very

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:56.519
multicultural team there. Weíve got nationalities
ñ Australian, Italian and Lebanese. Weíve

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.949
got some Chinese guys there, weíve got Pacific
Islanders there, weíve got a couple of Japanese

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:08.060
players there so weíve got a great range
cultures. I think now as a coach youíve got

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.389
to learn not to judge a book by its cover.
They are keen to learn so as a coach its rewarding

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.109
to pick up someone like that and actually
see them progress and become better players.

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.410
The benefits are unreal. When you are touring
and you get to learn the backgrounds of these

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.490
guys thatís where you really enjoy it and
you think you know youíre missing out on

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.900
so much because weíve got our blinkers on.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:39.040
I think the rewards are in the fact that if
you can create something that is successful,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.760
not necessarily as a result but in terms of
the atmosphere that you built. If you can

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.590
create a family and get people just to get
on. Sport is sport especially at this level.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.859
We donít get paid so itís not as if itís
a lifeline for them. They actually pay to

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.930
play this game so we make sure that if you
are going to pay you are going to enjoy yourself

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:09.150
and have a really good time. Yeah thatís
probably one of the challenges.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.950
When I hit my teens and they realized that
I was taking a liking to this touch football

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.470
thing, dad was always on my case saying what
about your school work, you know, what about

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.151
your study. They didnít realize that that
was my out from my study and my break from

00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:25.479
things. Thatís pretty much the way they were
brought up. Having come over and having done

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.152
it the tough way they sort of donít want
to see me do that. Speaking from a Lebanese

00:04:29.152 --> 00:04:33.759
background, weíve taken some teams to the
world cup to represent Lebanon. Weíve taken

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.460
mixed teams and weíve taken menís teams.
Itís always hard to recruit some of the Lebanese

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.500
girls especially in a mixed environment because
the old school thinking is that they shouldnít

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:53.940
be going away with boys unless theyíre engaged
or something like that.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:01.910
Weíve a thing called the Blackest Cat. We
travel around Australia and we run Touch clinics

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.060
just to develop touch and thatís for kids
from the ages of 10 to 18. We come across

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.870
a lot of kids who are multicultural. The beauty
of those clinics is because the kids are young

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.990
g the parents have to drop them off and they
end up making a day of it, having a picnic.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.780
They see their kids having a really good time
and having a lot of fun and they realise that

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:26.190
this sport is pretty good. Thereís no contact,
thereís low risk of injury and we try and

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:37.930
encourage them to come to things like that.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.350
The first thing is to make sure that its fun.
Donít worry about the results, worry about

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.050
the process. If you can breate something that
people want to be a part of it doesnít matter

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.180
if they donít win because they are actually
enjoying themselves. One of things I do with

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.090
every team Iím involved in is that I actually
get them to talk about themselves in the team

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.440
environment. You might do a little session
we you might say youíve got to answer four

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.180
basic questions like your name, your nickname,
something you like to do outside of Touch

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:12.360
Football, where youíre from, what your background
is and the funniest thing youíve seen a family

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.180
member do. It actually invites them to open
up and maybe tell a story and get people start

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.120
thinking oh thatís mad. The idea is to get
the parents to come to training sessions or

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.850
come to the trials. Once they see the environment
the kids are in and know that the kids are

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.720
safe then you can start to break them down
a bit. Half the challenge is to get the cultural

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.320
parents there because they donít really see
sport as a necessity. They see it more as

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.810
something that might get their kids injured
and they look at the negatives effects and

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.820
say if you do sport you get injured, you break
our leg you canít work, how are you going

00:06:50.820 --> 00:07:00.210
to feed your family ñ the snowball type effect.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.180
We can only benefit from everyone participating
and everyone encouraging people to come on

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.990
board. Sport should be taken as something
that you enjoy. If you can put together groups

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.920
of people who enjoy being together then they
can enjoy their sport it can only to make

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:29.440
our sport, no matter what it is, across Australia
much better.
