00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.410
&gt;&gt;Erik: Why has teaching career sustainability
become such a central issue in the charter

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.410
school debate?

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.580
&gt;&gt;Yoav: They have a mix of experience in their
teachers, but a lot of them rely heavily on

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.919
Teach For America, which is kind of a program
for people to give back in a sense, to work

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:26.259
in an urban environment and do something challenging
and awarding, like teaching. They only have

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:33.890
a commitment of several years and what happens
is the charter schools hire a lot of Teach

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.980
For America teachers and they tend to have
longer work hours and work years than the

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.379
traditional public schools, which is a benefit
to the students, but the teachers are working

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:54.030
really hard. They have a high burn out rate,
and so every three or four years you`re recycling

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.120
a high proportion of your teachers. And I
know there are certainly a lot - there are

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.739
certainly some people that are concerned that
it might ultimately affect the quality of

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.690
the education. It`s hard if there is something
with a high burn out rate, it`s hard to build

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.910
that as a sustainable model.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.600
&gt;&gt;Erik: Has this issue been acknowledged by
the public and if so, what is being done about

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600
it?

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.520
&gt;&gt;Yoav: I`ve read several articles, one in
particular I remember from New Orleans about

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.360
a charter school that was experiencing this
issue. They had very highly motivated, energetic

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.500
and great young teachers, but they were burning
out faster than you would have hoped. The

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.310
thing with charter schools is that it`s almost
too new to say whether or not it`s going to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.220
be sustainable. I mean, here in New York they`ve
only been around for ten years, so some schools

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.110
many have cycled through a high proportion
of their teachers, but I think it`s going

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.850
to take another five to ten years to see is
this to be a growing pains thing or is this

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.280
a tend that is going to continue and that
they are going to have to start worrying about.
