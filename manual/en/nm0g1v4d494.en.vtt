00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.220
What's possible out there?

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.210
Everything.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.800
In the light.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.760
Through the elements

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.790
toward the horizon

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.390
soaring

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.940
or grounded

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.000
we are here

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.560
imagining where all this is headed.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.439
The ways we live change every time the Earth spins

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.630
but the hows and whys remain.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.440
We aren’t here to start changing the world.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.150
we're here to keep changing it.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.160
to continue what we set out to do 100 years ago

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.860
Building a World of Difference.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.520
That mission, our mission, has never changed.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.900
We are in the business of answers, and impact.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.500
Of solutions, built to last and last.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.650
To continue to be right as the days, months, and years pass.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.770
To fit a growing world

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.310
while inspiring that world to keep growing.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.920
and every solution starts with a sketch,
an idea. It's on the page or the screen

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.240
in two dimensions, then rises into the
world in three.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.670
and as the years pass our solutions make a
lasting impact in the fourth dimension

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.660
time.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.620
what started as a few projects in the
Midwest a century ago came to have

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.100
worldwide impact.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.990
We've increased our reach across
business lines, markets, and countries

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:12.649
Today we have the ability to deliver
virtually anywhere - at any time.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.740
providing critical infrastructure

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.220
Power

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.740
Water

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.260
Communications

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.680
so people

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.550
businesses, cities

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.990
cultures, the world at large, can do more
than survive. They can thrive.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.200
That’s engineering. Turning possibility into reality.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.040
We will keep changing the world

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.940
because the world keeps changing.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.560
Mega-cities demand mega solutions.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.380
ones that last for the next hundred
years.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.780
What makes us who we are?

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.420
Engineering,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.960
Procurement, Construction and Services.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.120
Solutions are strong as the people creating them.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.740
as individuals

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.260
and as one.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.440
So think of today as a celebration

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.600
of the midpoint on our way to a
bicentennial.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.870
We know the world will continue to spin

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.440
to change

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.600
that's the only constant

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.110
But what do we know about time?

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.100
Simply that there has been no better time to be a part

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.640
of Black &amp; Veatch.
