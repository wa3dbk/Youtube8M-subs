Hey guys welcome back to the Pitt Vlog

00:00:01.958 --> 00:00:03.541
I'm your head FYM Andrew.

00:00:03.542 --> 00:00:04.999
Today we are going to be talking about

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.917
Panther Central and your Pitt ID.

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:24.166
I'm standing in front of Panther Central

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:26.374
this is where you come to get your Pitt ID.

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:28.416
You will want to get it during your Pitt start

00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:30.416
so you can get into your room.

00:00:30.417 --> 00:00:32.957
This is also where you come to ask any questions

00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.499
about your housing, your meal plan,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.582
and if you lose your ID

00:00:36.583 --> 00:00:38.999
there is also a twenty dollar replacement fee

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.832
so hold on to it.

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:42.541
Let's go get my ID.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:46.666
Getting your Pitt ID is a really easy process

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:48.457
just come into Panther Central

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:50.541
hand them your photo ID,

00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:53.082
wait for them to look you up,

00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:54.374
and take a picture.

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:56.708
Look at the camera and smile.

00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:00.999
My name is Lee Will

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.707
and I work for the University of Pittsburgh Panther Central.

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:05.707

We are a twenty-four seven office

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:13.749
so if you need a lockout code or anything like that

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.457
we'll be in our office to get you into your room.

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:17.291
We do not deal with Port Authority

00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:19.499
routes or bus schedules anything like that,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.874
but we will try to help you

00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:24.874
with anything you need for your student life on campus.

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:26.499
