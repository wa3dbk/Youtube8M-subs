00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.820
 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.660
Welcome to my channel! A channel that is
focused on helping you,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.310
the next the manga artist, learn how to draw.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.700
In this channel, I'm going to teach you
everything that I've learned about drawing

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.600
in a way that I think will be both
enjoyable and educational.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.430
So let's get started with part 1, Where to
Start at?

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.480
And that is a good question.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.560
Picking the right starting point is one
of the most important

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.040
and crucial steps you can take to quickly
becoming a good

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.640
artist. Yes, even if you pick the wrong

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.970
path, you can still become a good artist.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.540
It's just going to take longer and be
more painful then it really should have

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.790
been.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.149
However, this is a lot easier said than
done.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.149
For a complete beginner, everything is
unknown territory and

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.710
there are many, and I mean many, places
to start at.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.190
It's like you're thrown into an endless
hallway of doors

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.280
and told to pick the best one. It's not only
impossible,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.500
but also confusing, frustrating, and irritating.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.000
So where is a good starting point? That
magic doorway to success.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.340
Well, for most people, it seems like that
answer is

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.220
the face.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.410
And I totally understand that. It is the
most visible

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.280
and recognizable part of our body. It
should be a top priority.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.000
I mean really, who wouldn't spend the
most time developing

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.710
that part of the body?

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.800
It's beautiful, elegant, and delicate.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.180
It is the part of the body that gives
the character life,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.160
energy, and meaning.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.440
Its, ... Wait a minute.  Did I just draw that?

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.110
Well, for most people, it's the most
important part of the body.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.980
But I have to disagree with that
starting point. I believe the face

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.830
is one of the worst, if not worst, starting
points you can pick

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.300
as a beginner.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.730
So, why do I think that? Simply put,

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.830
it's too hard for the beginner.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.660
As with anything in life, drawing takes
a lot of time

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.650
and patience.  You need to take it slowly,
one step at a time.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.170
Take evolution, for example.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.209
We just didn't go from a single cell
organism straight through

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.450
to a full-fledged human being.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.060
No, we had to go through several stages of
evolution

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.110
before we got to the place where we are
today.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.060
As an artist, you must do the same.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.610
You can't just start anywhere and by all
means

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.090
please don't start at the end.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.440
So, if the face is not the right place
to start at,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.989
where is the right place to start at?

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.200
Is it with, perhaps, proportions

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.590
or anatomy?

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.560
Unfortunately, no, I think

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.660
all these places are wrong.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.880
If I was to recommend one place to start at -

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.370
the very best place - it wouldn't even be a
part of

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.140
the human body.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.909
No, I'd definitely tell you to
stay away from

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.060
that.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.090
Instead, I'd tell you start with primitives.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.820
You know, those cool mathematical things like cubes,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.959
spears, and cylinders.

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.780
awesome right?

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.100
all sarcasm

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.400
aside, there are many, many benefits

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.450
for starting out here.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.560
First, it will get you thinking and drawing

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.000
in 3d. Because, even though the canvas

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.500
is 2d, the thing that you are drawing is
still 3d.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.980
Thus, if your mind isn't thinking in
those terms,

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.030
then your drawings are going to reflect
that. They're going to be two-dimensional,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.750
plain, and boring.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.639
Second, it will teach you about space in
volume.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.269
Primitives can provide you with a simple
and easy way

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.410
to lay out your entire scene in a
realistic

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.820
and accurate fashion.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.020
If you're able to draw bounding boxes for
every one of your objects

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.820
before you even start drawing, I can
almost guarantee

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.830
your end result will look better.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.900
Why? Because that division of space

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.140
will let you focus on a small aspect of
the picture

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.400
rather than the whole.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.250
Third, it's just easier to draw primitives
then it is humans.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.030
And that alone makes it a better starting
point.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.610
Heck, most people learn how to drive
primitives

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.810
in their geometry class - if they weren't sleepy

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.240
like me.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.820
And if you're having any kind of trouble
drawing primitives,

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.910
then you'll definitely going to struggle
with the human body.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.240
And that's it for this video.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.990
Basically, just keep it simple, don't
bite off more than you can chew,

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.009
and you going to be fine.

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.049
