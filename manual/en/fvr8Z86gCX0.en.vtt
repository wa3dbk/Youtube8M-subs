00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.100
When I look, at the stars at night

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.100
all I see is the fading of your light

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.040
I miss your smile, I feel lonely inside

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.520
wonder why you're not, by my side

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.600
It's alright, I'm okay

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.800
I'm my keeper everyday

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.580
no way back

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.740
it's all under control

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.700
I don't feel any pain

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.680
love is never given in vain

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.500
It's in the air

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.400
It's within my soul

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.900
Our winter

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.820
has blown our words away

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.140
all seems gone

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.060
the promises we made

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.240
may the spring

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.940
helps to heal our wings

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.720
so we can fly, to new dreams

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.860
It's alright, I'm okay

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.760
I'm my keeper everyday

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.180
no way back

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.620
it's all under control

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.680
I don't feel any pain

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.540
love is never given in vain

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.760
it's in the air

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.320
it's within my soul

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.200
You make me happy

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.220
you make me sad

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.120
although I love you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.440
I need to survive

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.800
It's alright, I'm okay

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.620
I'm my keeper everyday

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.580
no way back

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.640
it's all under control

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.820
I don't feel any pain

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.680
love is never given in vain

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.700
it's in the air

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.280
it's within my soul

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.780
It's alright, I'm okay

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.720
I'm my keeper everyday

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.300
no way back

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.360
it's all under control

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.720
I don't feel any pain

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.520
love is never given in vain

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.720
it's in the air

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.380
it's within my soul

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.660
it's within my soul
