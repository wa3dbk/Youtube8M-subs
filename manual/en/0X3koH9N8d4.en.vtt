DR. PATRICK NGUKU:
The Field Epidemiology
Laboratory Training Programs --

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.460
sometimes referred to also
as FELTPs --

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.630
are competence-based training
programs in applied epidemiology

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.300
modeled after the 60-year-old

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.460
CDC Epidemic
Intelligence Service,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.460
also known as EIS,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.800
that is responsible for training

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.960
most of
the public-health practitioners

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.300
in the U.S.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.630
FELTP,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.960
just like the Epidemic
Intelligence Service training,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.460
is composed
of 25% class training

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.300
and 75% field-based training.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.800
Currently, there are 41 FELTPs
in 57 countries.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.130
Since 2008 October,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.630
when the Nigerian FELTP program
was initiated,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.030
we have been involved
in response

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.030
to a number of infectious

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.860
and non-infectious
disease outbreaks.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.030
As a graduate
of the Kenyan FELTP,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.200
which I graduated
in the year 2006,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.530
I remember that in my first
three weeks of training,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.700
classes had to be suspended

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.860
because there was a massive
aflatoxicosis outbreak

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.360
in the eastern part
of the country.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.200
Aflatoxicosis is a condition
caused by consumption of food

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.200
that is contaminated
by aflatoxins,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.530
usually caused by poor storage
of grains,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.700
and we were deployed
in the field

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.030
to help solve this problem.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.530
Among the things that we did
was identification

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.530
of affected persons in hospitals
and communities,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.860
confirmation of foods
that were poisoned,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.930
as well as educating
the communities

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.600
on seeking treatment and
prevention of this condition.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.260
The Nigerian FELTP is funded by

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.600
the President's Emergency Plans
for AIDS Relief -- PEPFAR --

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.600
and the U.S. Agency
for International Development --

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.760
USAID -- as well as
the government of Nigeria.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.100
In the Ministries of Health
and Ministries of Agriculture,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.100
we've been able to train
64 residents in the program

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.100
and numerous
short-course graduates.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.630
We've been able to respond
to diseases, outbreak diseases

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.500
of infectious nature
and non-infectious nature,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.830
and therefore reducing illness,
deaths,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.830
and disabilities
from these diseases.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.160
And I'm happy
that we are achieving

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.160
the goals of the program,
which is to provide service

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.400
as we build
epidemiological capacity

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.560
in Nigeria and in the region.
