Howdy folks how's it going welcome to my virgin
kitchen today i'm showing you how to make

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:13.690
a vegetarian quinoa chilli good times.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.329
Looks amazing right and i've had so many recipe
requests come through at the moment I decided

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:24.070
to merge a couple together so i've got Craig
Wigmore, Skitzyskitzo, Sina Mandarina, SpiritHolly

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.710
amongst others who have asked me to make recipes
with quinoa vegetarian recipes and a healthy

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.489
chilli so i've merged these together and it's
bloomin good.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.489
It's cheap.

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.160
it's filling, it's quick, it's easy, it's
delicious, it's so customisable you can add

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.980
meat in it you can make it vegan by not adding
the sour cream at the end all that stuff it's

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.980
cute to look at, it's pretty, it's cute actually
it's not as cute as Chloe trying to sing vanilla

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.470
ice, Chloe can you say ice ice baby, ice ice
baby yeah!

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.740
But it is really good I hope i've sold it
to you my kids absolutely loved it at the

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.920
end hence the reason I made mine kind of mild
if you wanna have a go at making this hit

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.720
pause on the video now write all these ingredients
down lets do it.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.830
First up we're gonna work on our quinoa now
I don't know if it's just me whenever I see

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.470
the word quinoa I don't wanna say quinoa I
wanna say key knower it's like mentally i'm

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.780
like key knower key knower key knower not
someone who knows loads of stuff about keys

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.950
hi would you like to know something about
keys, no just quinoa just I dunno....

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.100
plonk your water into a saucepan and then
add on top your rinsed quinoa you want to

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.970
put this onto a low flame on your hob and
then cover just simmer it for a good 15 minutes

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.880
until it's all fully absorbed.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.610
So while that is happening grab yourself a
large pan add in your oil to get it nice and

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.549
hot before adding in the chopped red onion
you wanna let that soften for a good 5 minutes

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.100
before tipping in your chopped garlic, cumin
and chilli powder mixing it together until

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.780
it's nice and coated.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.270
And just to re-iterate I made this nice and
super mild you might wanna ramp up those flavours

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.210
it's all about customising it and making it
the way you want it to taste good times.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.330
So give the onions, garlic and spices around
about 1 or 2 minutes together to get it nice

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.880
and coated before adding in your tomatoes
your mixed beans with a little extra water

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.060
from the tin, your peppers and courgettes,
oregano and a good grinding of black pepper.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.230
Give it a darn good stir together and let
it simmer away for a good 15-20 minutes for

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.959
all those flavours to mingle together.

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.000
I went quite leniant with my peppers too I
went for some sweet bell peppers along with

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.800
some standard ones these are really sweet
with a nice crunch to them but if you really

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.950
want to ramp it up you could use scotch bonnets
anything like that make this dish your own

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.020
that's what it's all about.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.810
Once you are happy with the texture of your
chilli pour in you quinoa and sweetcorn stir

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.610
it all through so it's nice and combined and
then warm it through for around about 5 minutes

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.610
so it's all nice and combined under a low
flame.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.540
All I did was grab myself a funky little bowl,
a darn good spoonful right in there, sprinkled

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.441
on a little bit of grated cheese, some sour
cream and a little sprinkling of fresh chopped

00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:55.510
coriander so so good I loved it it was stonkingly
good those little beads of quinoa so so good

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.730
just working their way down there, the kids
loved it too.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.450
Chloe is that nice?

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.849
hmmmm oh my goodness look at that mouthful
boom.

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.709
Phoebe do you like it? yeah.

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.380
How much do you like it out of 1 and 400 100
million thousand 80 thousand.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.400
Ooooh my goodness guys this is bum smackingly
good the quinoa is sort of filling all the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.709
gaps it's holding and bringing together all
those flavours it's got an amazing texture

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:25.709
on it too.

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.280
I'm loving it and you know what the next day
it's probably gonna taste even better I don't

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.599
know why it does that it's probably the flavours
mingling together even more but i'm loving

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.270
it and I really hope you give it a try if
