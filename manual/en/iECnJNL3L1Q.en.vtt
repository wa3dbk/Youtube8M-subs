00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.500
hey this Victory1140 from
gentlemen the controllers and i'm doing

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.270
a quick achievement gude here for the walking
dead four hundred days DLC. Now

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.950
they're two achievements in this DLC that you can possibly miss unlike the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.919
first game: Two out of Three and Reunited. Both 10 Gamerscore a piece.

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.099
so "Two Out Of Three" is to win the game
of rock paper scissors

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.209
you can get that in Wyatt's chapter here.
you go select this picture and he's the

00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:24.119
the little

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.689
fat fuck who looks like bruce vilanche
sort of

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.960
Yeah. That's who I'm thinking of: Bruce Vilanche.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.610
the nice thing about these two
achievements is you can get them

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.920
fairly quickly and they're not too
terribly hard to miss.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.160
uh... but you can't miss them, that's the point.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.770
so with Wyatt,  you're gonna start off
driving down the road. You're gonna get in an

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.120
argument with eddie, who you're going to see here in a second. And no idea what happened

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.450
they just kind of throw you into the
story no backstory or anything like that

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.310
so you're getting an argument with him
you guys stop paying attention to the

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.150
road and BAM you nail a zombie.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.760
once you nail that zombie, Eddie's going
to come up with a great idea to figure

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.860
out who's gonna go out and actually check
for the zombie

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.020
and he's gonna suggest rock paper
scissors

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.830
now i don't know if you've ever played a
game of rock paper scissors with your

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.290
life on the line but i haven't so this
was a brand new experience for me

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.259
so once he makes that suggestion

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.860
it's just a matter of going through and
beating him

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.840
now i've heard a rumor that if you don't
win you can hit start really quick and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.650
restart the game

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.390
before it auto saves i'm not exactly
sure if that's true i actually got on my

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.350
first try here so i didn't quite have
to worry about that i guess i got lucky

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.060
it's at least worth a shot and again it's
within like the first five minutes or

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.400
ten minutes or so of his uh, of his 
chapter so even if you do have to play

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.330
again you don't have to go too far on
your way

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.540
so right here he's just saying all right
let's go Two Out Of Three. You're gonna  pick rock, paper, scissors

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.280
or you could abstaine like a little pussy i don't know why you would

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.800
do that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.610
whatever I guess you could if you wanted to

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.690
he also asked what are the chances of a
making the same

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.710
Hey Eddie...

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.040
I believe the uh... chances are about one
in three

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.810
now my math maybe a little rusty here
but uh...

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.990
and that that's just my guess

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.169
so you can see i lost the game. I won a
game before that, lost the game just now

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:15.809
and now i'm going to completely in
totally dominate him here and completely

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:17.120
emasculate him

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.730
in a zombie apocalypse which is saying
something to that's that's like a higher

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.919
level of emasculation.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:26.370
there's there's one thing to beat someone in rock paper scissors

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.780
in just a regular setting, but beating them in a zombie apocalypse, there's

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.480
just something

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.509
so great about that

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.809
and then bam. You're gonna get the
achievements gonna come up and I actually

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:37.900
lied its worth fifteen gamer score

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.049
so uh...

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.659
yeah little bonus their little
five-point bonus from what you thought

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:42.819
your gonna get

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.269
aren't you glad you stuck around?

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.489
so the second one we're gonna get using
russell's chapter here so you can select

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.559
him he's the uh...

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.259
college lookin graduate due to high
school with graduate do the one that

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:55.449
looks like troy from community

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:56.969
Yeah, you know the guy

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:57.849
but anyway

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.349
so this one you get a start off and you're gonna be walking down a road you could be

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.029
walking lonely.

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:04.119
by yourself

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:06.329
down a road reflecting

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.869
on all the mistakes you've made in life

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.579
that brought you up to this point

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.809
but you can see the sign right
here you're gonna see the sign that's going

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:17.469
to open up your eyes and you do you
realize that you've been walking for a

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:19.229
while

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:23.039
So you're just going to examine that sign. I don't know if you have to, I was just bored and

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:25.679
figured "Why the hell not?"

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:29.039
you're also gonna examine this nice little corpse over here you can ask it a nice question:

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:31.339
"Hey"

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:33.349
"You gettin' up?"

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.369
Yup. something like that

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:37.879
Hey Sanka! You dead mon?

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.789

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:43.839
so I'm gonna adjust my backpack here like
i adjust my jock strap everyday my life

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:44.939
because uh...

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.469
i wear a jock strap everyday my life

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:49.669
just for funsies

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.779
anyway so you're gonna turn around and you're gonna see this truck coming at you

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.769
You're gonna want to select the "Hide"option

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.919
You're going to dive into these bushes over here and
you're gonna get a nice little surprise

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.489
it's a dead person

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.469
uh... bit of a spoiler warning here that
that person is actually going to be

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:09.790
either Carley or Doug, whoever you left
on the side of the road during the uh...

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.439
the first story

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.639
so yeah, they managed to tie it in.

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.680
you get the achievement you're gonna get
uh... ten gamer score and you get a

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.519
