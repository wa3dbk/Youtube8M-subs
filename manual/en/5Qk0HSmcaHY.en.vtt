00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.549
hi friends welcome to Cosas del JardÃ­n
It is mid autumn

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:07.520
and we will transplant the leeks
we sow

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.980
late summer , more or less three months ago.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.140
In this video we will talk

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:15.150
about transplant,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.830
irrigation and care that we
have with this crop

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.850
well these are the leeks after three
months we see that the stem has

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.630
a little more than five millimeters and is the
time to put in the final place.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.080
This is the pot where I planted
tomatoes

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.580
that i'm going to take out

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.340
Container has more or less 5 gallons and a little over 20
inches deep

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.789
vermicompost

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.820
 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.569
and mixed with peat roughly
three parts of humus and 1 part peat

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:08.060
it is important to say that the mix
has to be rich in nutrients

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.860
and also to have good drainage. If the
land that will put is compacted

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.660
we can add perlite

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.660
You have to fill the container more or less up to 4 inches from the edge

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.600
we will pull a muffin

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.820
feel the smell of leek .

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.080
delicious!

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.220
this muffin

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.140
It is full of roots. This should not have happened

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.720
What happens is that I had a back problem

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.200
and this we should have done a month ago

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.500
but ok

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.300
We will remove the muffin

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.060
no worries

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.560
if the roots are broken a little
because the leek is a plant

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.040
highly resistant and so do not worry

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
relax

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.500
and enjoy

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.740
because nothing will happen

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.280
look at the seedlings, divine

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.499
let's cut a little the roots

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:15.009
about 2 inches

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:20.069
cut the beard

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.599
and now what we will do is put

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:29.599
in water so they dont dry out.

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:38.689
well, now what we do is use a tool like this,

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.089
about 4 inches long

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:44.089
we will do

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.440
some dimpling

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.560
and we will separate about 4 inches more

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.980
Come here Javi !

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.320
Would you like to help me?

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.320
Yes !

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.320
come on!

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.880
look

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.180
take this tool

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.340
and makes holes like this

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.340
and here

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.189
go on

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.369
make another one here

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.360
here

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.320
perfect

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.320
go on

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.960
here

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.320
other here

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.580
here.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.260
do like

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.500
tikitikitikitik

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.040
there it is . go on

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.700
 very well

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.700
other here

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.700
there

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.460
brilliant

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.460
other here

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.700
then

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.780
with ... these ...

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.100
  May I put one ?

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.700
yeah right

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.020
want to put this one?

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.890
we will

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.260
comb the roots a little

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.980
put it there

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.589
more more more more more

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:48.589
there it is!

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.680
other one?

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.600
yes!

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.220
this is fun

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.220
is it fun ?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.100
and now.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.080
what we will do is

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.380
we will not cover the holes

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.020
we are going to leave them like that

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.200
But let's pour some water

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.500
in each hole until water fills it

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.400
like this

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.280
and

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.480
 water will take care

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.439
to cover the roots. yes! bury the roots

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:23.439
because of the mud

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:24.859
because of the mud

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.300
and ideally , what we seek is precisely

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.109
not cover all
leek that grows in there

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.700
 in the hole

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.370
that

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.770
becomes white. because the rich leek
It is white. not green

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.080
and then

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.520
is white

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.440
and once the leek grows more

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.420
what we will do is

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.760
fill

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.440
this

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.479
this

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.520
with soil

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.520
 with compost

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.400
or mulch

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.900
but that when the leek grows more

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.419
and what we will try to avoid when filling them with mulch

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:06.839
is that

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.999
land does not get into

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.120
where the leaves begin to open

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.060
because otherwise
dirt gets between the leaves

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:21.219
and is difficult to clean after

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.860
Javi, do you understand ?

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.540
do you understand?

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.540
yes

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.380
Leeks need a moist soil

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.840
you have to water them

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.609
in winter
thus watering is not so necessary .

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.720
But at least once a week if no rain

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.740
need lots of sun

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.400
you'll agree Javi , they need lots of sun.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.960
and

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.280
Important . No need to drop the ball in the pot

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.780
able because something could happen here flying kick and bounces

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.449
yes, no, no bounce at all

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.860
Well and that is all

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.920
I hope you liked the video
