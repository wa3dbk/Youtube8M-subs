The following video is of my home made 
“NATUROM DEMONTO " “aka” NECRONOMICON " aka "Ex Mortis: The Book of the Dead! 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is my collection of " Evil Dead " stuff....Small I know but still collecting

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
My book is modelled around the “NATUROM DEMONTO” from The Movie “EVIL DEAD “2013.

00:00:24.626 --> 00:00:27.826
The book itself took me around 8 months to build.

00:00:31.506 --> 00:00:39.800
The outer cover is made from 100% genuine leather.

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:51.100
The stitching is also leather, I used a total of 14 meters of antique brown flattened 100% genuine leather rope which then had to be glued at each end one by one to the reverse side of the cover. 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.700
The writing wrote on the left is Latin, It has no connection to the film and has no religious meaning what so ever.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:03.270
