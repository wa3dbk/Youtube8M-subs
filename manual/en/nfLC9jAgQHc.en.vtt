00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:08.433
Greetings pilots!

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:14.633
You’re watching a video guide on the tier 4 British heavy fighter — the Blenheim.

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:20.300
The Blenheim is the first aircraft of the second British branch to really be considered a heavy fighter.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.600
It has two engines and a large number of guns, including a rear gun.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.333
This makes Blenheim a dangerous adversary for careless pilots.

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:31.100
Its two engines affect its maneuverability.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:39.633
The Blenheim does not roll as well as its German counterpart, the Bf.110B, but it takes less time to turn a full 360 degrees.

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:46.367
Since the Blenheim has no cannon armament, its firepower in top configuration is only slightly above average.

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:52.167
This is not a problem, however. Instead of cannons, the Blenheim has a large number of machine guns.

00:00:52.267 --> 00:01:02.633
Among stock aircraft, the Blenheim is outmatched only by the Bf. 110B and A6M1, which have cannons even in their stock configurations.

00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:06.933
Speed performance depends greatly on which modules are installed.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:11.467
In its stock configuration, the Blenheim will outrun only the BSh-2.

00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:19.267
But once you research its top modules, it can compete in speed with most fighters, losing only to German aircraft of its tier.

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:23.767
In addition, the Blenheim has good durability characteristics.

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:26.867
Only the BSh-2 has more hit points.

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:33.733
That is to say, the increased durability of the Blenheim allows for effective use of its specific armament.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200
Now let’s move on to research.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.567
As mentioned before, the Blenheim lacks speed in its stock configuration.

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:48.700
To overcome this, you should first research the top Mercury XVI engine.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.433
The next step is to research the Blenheim V airframe.

00:01:52.533 --> 00:02:01.333
This will increase durability, speed, and maneuverability of your aircraft, will allow for mounting four.303 caliber Browning machine guns.

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:03.900
You should research them next.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.033
The top Vickers K two-gun turret should be last item to research.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.333
Since the Blenheim is only equipped with machine guns, you should open fire only at close range.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.333
Optimum firing range for the Blenheim is about 300-400 meters.

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:27.233
That’s all for research. Now let’s talk about altitudes.

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:32.767
The Blenheim has a good angle of climb, although its rate of climb is quite poor..

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:39.900
With this in mind, you should attempt short vertical maneuvers instead of long lengthy climbs.

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:44.300
This will help you maintain both speed and boost availability

00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:49.833
At altitudes below 750 meters, the Blenheim does not perform well.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.167
At this range, it loses its speed advantage, and its low maneuverability does not allow you to use terrain effectively.

00:02:57.267 --> 00:02:59.200
So you should climb higher.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.100
At an altitude of 950 meters, the Blenheim’s cruise speed begins to increase.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.933
Maximum cruise speed is reached at about 1200-1300 meters.

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:14.167
This is the optimal altitude range to engage in a dogfight.

00:03:14.267 --> 00:03:19.167
At altitudes above 1500 meters, the Blenheim starts losing top speed.

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:24.033
You should climb that high only to prepare your next attack, or to regroup.

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:27.600
Now let’s discuss in-battle tactics.

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:30.933
You should single out targets wisely.

00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:35.900
Your top priority targets are fast, high-altitude enemy aircraft.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.600
The sooner they are destroyed, the easier the battle will become for you and your team.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.867
This is what you should try to do at the beginning of battle.

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:49.267
First, climb to an optimum altitude right from the start, and try to stay behind your allies.

00:03:49.367 --> 00:03:54.367
This tactic will help you avoid head-on attacks, as the Blenheim does not excel at this.

00:03:54.467 --> 00:04:00.933
Second, try to avoid boom and zoom tactics, as the Blenheim’s maximum dive speed is too slow for this tactic.

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:07.467
You should not follow enemies that dive to attack your allies. Instead, try to damage them when flying by.

00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:13.533
Hopefully, you will knock out an enemy’s engine, and make enemy aircraft an easy target for your allies.

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:19.767
After your first attack, make sure that no enemies are chasing you, and try to regain some altitude.

00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:22.767
Then you can focus on your next target.

00:04:22.867 --> 00:04:27.567
However, you should use different tactics against different types of enemy aircraft.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:29.733
Let’s take a closer look.

00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:32.967
Enemy fighters are the most difficult aircraft to engage.

00:04:33.067 --> 00:04:39.267
Since the Blenheim is equipped with only machine guns, you should close in on your targets before opening fire.

00:04:39.367 --> 00:04:42.167
This can be accomplished in different ways.

00:04:42.267 --> 00:04:48.267
Use diving attacks against slower aircraft, while agile fighters can be destroyed in a fly-by attack.

00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:52.200
If enemy aircraft have low amount of hit points, you can attack them head-on.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.633
When being followed, try to draw the enemy closer to your friendly fighters. Do not rely on your rear gunner.

00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:05.367
No help coming? Use maximum engine boost to gain altitude, and then drop down on the pursuer to take them out.

00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:08.100
Engaging heavy fighters is a bit easier.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.733
Due to its decent amount of HP, the Blenheim can ignore enemy rear gunners for a while,

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:17.567
and its maneuverability gives you an advantage in countering German heavy fighters.

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:22.900
It is most important to prevent an enemy from gaining altitude or attacking you head-on.

00:05:23.367 --> 00:05:26.133
Attack aircraft are the last type to mention.

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:30.333
They are slow and hulky, but do not underestimate them.

00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:33.967
You should try to finish off already damaged aircraft.

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:41.400
Do not spend too much time chasing attack aircraft at low altitude, as you could draw attention of enemy fighters.

00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:46.833
Attacking ground targets is a waste of both time and hit points.

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:49.900
The Blenheim carries neither bombs, nor rockets.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.400
Therefore, you stand to take more damage than you could inflict.

00:05:55.333 --> 00:06:00.167
The previously mentioned tactics are applicable when you are at the top of the list

00:06:00.267 --> 00:06:03.833
When at the bottom, tactics remain mainly the same.

00:06:03.933 --> 00:06:08.100
However, you should never split away from your higher-tier allies.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.767
The more friendly aircraft you have around you, the longer you will survive in such battles.

00:06:13.933 --> 00:06:17.833
Now let’s talk about how to play in a flight.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.067
A couple of speedy fighters are the best option.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.333
In this setup, the fighters draw the attention of enemy aircraft, while the Blenheim engages them.

00:06:28.633 --> 00:06:35.233
The fighters can also cover the Blenheim’s tail, or assist in destroying tougher enemy aircraft.

00:06:36.033 --> 00:06:42.467
To sum up, the Blenheim will give you a good example of how to conduct battle when flying British aircraft in general,

00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:45.167
and British heavy fighters in particular.

00:06:45.267 --> 00:06:53.100
A pilot who manages to handle this capricious steel bird will also excel at flying other aircraft of this branch.
