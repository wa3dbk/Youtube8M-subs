00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.000
My name's Lee and I'm a broadcast journalist,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.000
and one of the reasons that
I enjoy living in London so much

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.840
is because of the transport network.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.600
The freedom that being able to
travel independently for my job

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.480
is something that I really value.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.040
This is Josh, my lovely guide dog.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.640
He helps me get around wherever I travel.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.080
We've just arrived here
at St. Pancras International

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.480
and we're heading to the
ExCel Centre in East London

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.080
to do a very special piece of reporting.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.720
We'll be going by bus,
London Overground train and on the DLR.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.880
For more information on using the bus,
watch our accessible bus film.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.240
Next, I need to get
the London Overground train

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.200
from Caledonian Road and Barnsbury
to Stratford.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.720
Whenever you can,
book assistance before you travel

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.600
at London Overground stations.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.840
Twenty-four hours in advance is best.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.840
The number to call is...

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.400
From buying a ticket to helping you
to the lifts, and onto the trains,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.280
you will always find
the staff are helpful to you.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.760
For the London 2012 Games,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.680
lifts like these have been installed

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.720
at Camden Road, Gospel Oak,
Hackney Central and Wembley Central.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.760
So all of them have step-free access
in time for the Games.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.400
There will be many people travelling
during the Games,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.280
so you may find at times
you need to queue to use these lifts.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.680
So allow plenty of time for your journey.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.760
Newly built London Overground stations

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.520
such as Hoxton and Shoreditch High Street

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.960
are completely step-free from street to train.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.760
Once on the platform, there are help points
if you need any assistance.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.880
(TRAIN BEEPING)

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.200
There are also manual boarding ramps

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.040
which staff use to help
wheelchair users board

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.960
when the platform doesn't have level access.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.080
Once on board the train, we can make use of

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
the designated space for
passengers with disabilities.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.440
Again, also useful for wheelchair users too.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.760
All London Overground trains
are new and fully accessible.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.240
You can walk all the way
from one end to the other.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.640
All of the DLR stations and trains
are fully accessible for wheelchair users

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.880
and those with limited mobility.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.880
If you use the stairs,
to make them as safe as possible

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.360
there is a high-grip surface on the steps,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.960
as well as tactile surfaces
at the top and bottom of the stairs.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.400
Once you're on the platform, there are
easy-to-read passenger information displays.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.040
And there is tactile paving
at the edge of the platform.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.840
There is level access from the street
right onto the train.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.040
And the level boarding makes it easier
to board the train for everyone

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.560
as well as alight.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.720
The DLR is extremely accessible,
there are lifts everywhere

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.640
so people who need to use lifts
can have ready access to them.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.360
One thing I really like about it is that

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.840
there's no gap between
the train and the platform.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.640
And also, as you're approaching your station,
it'll tell you that it's about to come up.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.120
So the DLR is extremely accessible.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.120
It's nice and open,
lots of space and very clean.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.800
During the Games, staff will be on hand
at 26 of the 45 stations on the DLR network,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.240
as opposed to the usual four stations.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.000
Therefore, extra assistance
will be available if necessary.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.520
If you're flying into London
for the London 2012 Games,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.720
the DLR is also a great way to get there
from London City Airport.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.800
And remember that special report
I was going to make?

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.000
Well, you've just watched it.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.640
Come on, Joshie.
