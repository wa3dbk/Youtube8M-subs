00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.899
Who knew you could get a Six Pack by standing
around?

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:13.580
I'm going to show you exactly how to do that
today.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.580
What's up guys?

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.270
Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.619
Time to get a Six Pack by having you guys
stand around.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.150
Now you had to have known me for too long
now to realize that I'll let you just sit

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.580
there and do nothing.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.580
We're going to have you stand.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.580
We're going to have you work.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.329
This is a concept that I addressed in our
last video here about increasing our strength

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.300
by getting rid of our energy leaks.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.340
And most often on every single exercise, one
of the biggest energy leaks is through the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.290
core, and that's because a lot of us don't
know how to engage our core properly.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.149
I say it all the time, sometimes even guys
will leave a comment, what does he mean by

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.149
engage?

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.780
Well, it's more than just your abs guys.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.260
You'll see the core is obviously a whole group
of muscles that go all the way around the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.140
back, up through the front as we see, up underneath
the rib cage.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.540
So how do we get those to contract together?

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.540
Really simple guys.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.180
There's an exercise that I incorporate into
my ab training routine that's just a static

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.290
isometric move.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.910
And some people are going to say, Oh!

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:13.910
Isometrics.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.910
That's so 1980's.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.910
No.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:16.910
That's not.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.910
Really.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.700
There used to be full workout programs based
around isometrics.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.130
But there's always a place for them, ok, especially
mixed into a workout program that's utilizing

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.010
typical concentric and eccentric moves.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.200
So, in isometric what you want to do, grab
something really heavy, ok.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.850
What happens is as soon as I grab something
heavy, could be a dumbbell, a plate, a kettlebell

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.850
in this case.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.930
As soon as I do that, this side of my core,
this side of my body, has to contract to prevent

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.160
me this thing from dropping me down here.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.740
Ok, so it has to contract hard, right in through
here, in order to prevent that lean.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.520
If you lean even a little bit more, you can
see a little bit more activation over here.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.530
It's hard for me to speak too because I should
be bearing down.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.290
Now we talked about the other day in that
video, if you haven't seen it, I should put

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.420
a link of it right over here somewhere.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.290
You have to watch this video on how to increase
your strength because it really does, it's

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.270
not magic, but it really does work right away.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.799
You have to be able to tighten up and tighten
down.

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:24.950
So, if I was doing an overhead Shoulder Press,
what you'd see underneath here is this.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.349
Everything tight.

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.830
Tight through the core, tight through the
chest, up over here as I'm pressing.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.840
That's what you should see.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.530
That's what you should feel, because everything
else becomes much lighter with those energy

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.680
leaks plugged up.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.519
Ok, you're not getting that dissipation.

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.819
But me just standing here in a contraction
for this long, about a minute, a minute and

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.760
a half, really works the core.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.019
Now to give myself a second of a break.

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.819
We obviously have to work the other side too.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.430
But how do we make it even more challenging
if we do think we have a strong core already?

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.650
Well, you pick up the dumbbell again.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.719
And we'll work this side, obviously this side
now does the work.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.450
And I lift up a leg.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.159
Ok, so now I have to work even harder right
here to hold that.

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.280
What do we do?

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.499
We've got to muscle up again.

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:21.109
Through the glut, in through the core here,
through the chest, the shoulders, the arm

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.760
everything should be working together to really
fight that.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.459
And most of all keep this side here working.

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.760
Want to get a little bit more extreme?

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.950
Then you stand on the same side leg.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.749
Because now, all this weight wants to pull
me over here.

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:43.069
I have my center of gravity way to the right
and all this weight to the left.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.170
That becomes even more challenging.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:55.469
And again I just hold.

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:59.540
Right there guys, an isometric, from standing
around.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.700
Could be between sets, ok.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.700
Grab a plate.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.989
Could be even just conscientiously between
your sets when you're carrying your dumbbells

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.769
from one location to the next.

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.900
Work on tightening up your core.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.970
You'll be amazed at what it can do to help
carve in that Six Pack, provided you've got

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.320
your diet in place.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.250
You're following your nutrition plan, making
sure that you're eating well, right?

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.990
I don't care how good a Six Pack you have
underneath, or how strong it is, you ain't

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.450
going to see it if all you're doing is eating
crap.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.720
So, that being said guys, you've got to start
doing more in your workouts.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.440
Don't rest in between workouts, we covered
this too.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.260
Your workouts should be fast and intense.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.670
Take up your rest time by working.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.000
Do something like that.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.730
Ok, it's not related to the chest you're working,
or your shoulders or your biceps.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.320
You can work your core indirectly in between
those periods as well.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.660
The complete ATHLEANX Program guys, here's
what we do.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.170
As a matter of fact, we stress eating, and
eating well, but in a way that's very realistic.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.120
We say it's the meal plan for guys.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.210
Because guys don't necessarily know how to
cook that much.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.450
They don't necessarily have all the time in
the world to prepare.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.620
We make it dead simple easy and make it easy
for you guys to start to rip off that fat

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.220
so you can look great underneath, and incorporate
techniques like this to tie it all together.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.190
If you haven't guys, you can grab that program
at ATHLEANX.COM.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.670
In the meantime, try this just one and see
how it feels.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.300
And make sure and leave me a thumbs up when
it starts to burn.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.690
I'll see you guys back here in a few days.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.190
We'll try to do something Thanksgiving ready
to get you guys ready for the big day.
