Hi. This is Julie with Beadaholique.com and today
I'm going to how to do a flat right angle weave

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.519
in bead weaving

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.689
using multiple beads.

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.369
Andrea, my fellow designer here at
Beadaholique.com has already done a great

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.929
video showing you how to do the
traditional flat right angle weave.

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.649
That looks a lot like this.

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.899
It's probably what you're most familiar with and
then in this particular necklace what I

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.890
did was I started adding more beads

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.100
as I went.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.430
Let me show you how to do that.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.990
So I want to start by just doing the
traditional right angle weave.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.920
So you're gonna need

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.950
four beads

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.280
onto your needle.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.580
I'm just going to pull those down.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.550
The length of the thread is determined upon
how long of a project you have

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.420
how big of a project.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.880
You're going to this down till you have about
a tail of about six to eight inches.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.610
Now I'm going to go back through the first bead

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.610
I strung

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.060
and I'm going to pull that. You can see what
we've done. We've just created a little fourlette

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.900
Now what I want to do is I want to go

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.900
through this second bead I strung

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.800
and also the third

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.290
and come back out.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.080
Now I'm going to string on three more beads
because I've got

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.360
a fourth bead already strong on there. That's
going to be my forth bead.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.000
I'm gonna come back up

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
through it.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.730
Again through the

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:07.460
next two beads

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.819
and then I'm going to do one more and then I'm
going to show you haw to do multiple beads.

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.919
So I pick up three more beads

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.839
go back through that bead which

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:19.869
was my starting bead so you can call that my
first or my forth depending on how you

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:24.170
look at it.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.170
Go back through the two beads next to it and
back out.

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:35.399
You can see we're forming a pattern. They
almost look like little flowers.

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:39.989
So that is a traditional flat right
angle weave. Now I want to add some

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.549
multiple beads. So instead of just doing
three beads I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.579
and do

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.379
one bead here and then add a little bit
of a larger bead to add a little bit more

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.669
interest.

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.040
Now I'm going to add

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.539
three beads

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:59.079
one more larger beads and

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.549
finally add one more of my seed beads
and you're going to see why in one moment.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.930
I'm going to take all of that

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.719
and then go back through

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.680
that original bead.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.169
You notice that I'm going in that
direction that my thread is

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.370
coming out here. It's looping around and
my needle now is sticking out in the same

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.649
direction that thread was originally.

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:28.069
Pull that around.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.480
I hopefully you can see why I did
the one, a large one then three of

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.669
the seed beads, a large one and then one of the
seed beads

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.370
so that I have a balance.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.899
I'm going to come back

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.790
and go through

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.879
four beads.

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.449
I'm going to lay it flat

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.919
so I can take a look at it.

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.879
I have my anchor bead which is joining

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.509
my other cluster.

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:03.499
Than I've got an archway of three seed beads
another anchor and an archway of seed beads

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:07.839
and that's why I strung the three beads
in between the two large ones. Let me show you

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:09.419
that again.

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.629
So we've got one bead,

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.899
a larger bead,

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:21.709
three of the seed beads, another large
bead,

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.710
another seed bead and I'm going to go

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.710
my needle is going to go come out the same
direction our thread was originally.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:41.210
Pull that. Form a loop.

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:48.649
Go back through four beads

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:51.479
and pull out.

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:58.479
Just do a couple more

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.050
And there you go. You'll just continue on like
that until you have as much a length

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.080
that you want.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.659
Then you can also loop back around
and create a second row. You can do that the

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:24.479
same way as you would

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.099
the more traditional flat right angle
weave. Which is like I mentioned before there's a great

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.160
video on

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.050
done by Andrea.
