00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.300
Today, finally move to a new apartment!

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:11.660
I finished carrying my luggage to a new place and cleaning is almost done.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.800
Here is where the kitchen used to be

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:26.920
table's here, kitchen wall, wooden shelf, and… there was a fridge here.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:42.100
Here's junk room, and this room is for a bicycle and futons.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.820
Now almost everything is cleaned up …

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.280
I often do home carpentry in my room.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.860
Aha btw, this sound, it’s good-bye at last.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:04.420
I didn’t like this noise since it often came into videos while I'm shooting, but it’s finally time to say good-bye.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.480
It wasn’t like this when I first came here.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.680
Uh this one, while painting pieces of wood for a large table here at kitchen, I forgot to protect walls beforehand.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:25.620
This is...awful. It’s a paint so it won’t come off.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:33.860
And this one, when setting up wooden kitchen wall, I was putting longer 2×4s together,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.280
but it went like hitting here and there...

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.200
Look at that mark on the ceiling,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.880
and wow… terrible, this can't be undone.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.560
I need to change the wallpaper.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:02.220
Why I move to a new apartment is, that I felt like I needed more space, but the biggest reason was...

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:13.780
Look at that large window, this room is.. where my PC table was.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.820
and a few steps from here, is where the kitchen used to be.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:26.180
When it’s afternoon, it’s...too dim to take a video here.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:35.280
But I had no choice, I had to increase ISO setting, otherwise the recording would have been disturbed by the noise from the floor.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.080
The new apartment is really good place with plenty of sunlight.
I’m sure I can take awesome videos out there.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:51.680
Well it’s going to take a while to make a new episode about recipes, but hope you’ll like it.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:59.740
And one more, folks, plz be careful and do not spoil your apartment like me, especially it’s a rental one.
