00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.490
hit video and how to get better how to
play college really like a pro

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.170
because you have now picked up your copy
if free

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.090
pre-recorded pre ordered copy is called
it a ghost

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.150
anyone take it home and play it and he
did he turn on your x-box and you

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.890
realize you weren't very good at the
game

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.039
so you turn on your the old computer

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.219
and decided look up on youtube video on
how to get better

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.920
and you are now here and I'm going to
teach you how to get better

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.180
so if you wanna start playing like a pro

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.489
follow my steps probably five or six
maybe three

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.940
and how many are happy just way too
early in the video and i'd guarantee you

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.180
you will be playing like a pro cell
first step

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.449
do not trust your teammates okay

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.520
teammates are out to get you they will
let

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.050
the good old other team come in and
shoot you in the booty

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.210
just to get a few extra 100 points
alright do not trust your teammates

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.010
they want the Avenger award

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.240
that comes with your data alright step 2

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.799
the type of gunning you use depends on
the map your plane

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.020
if using a long-range map don't use a
submachine gun

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.330
you will do bad he's establishing an

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.900
Anna white-out is one of the new maps on
ghosts alright

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.590
don't use a submachine gun on a
long-range map step 3:

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.780
this is a pretty common sense one and
say you're making a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.880
rushing class not russian like the
country rushing

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.070
class okay you wanna some fishing and

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.570
on near Thune you know those pics that
make you run faster and

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.280
better and scavenger you gonna be
shooting people and you don't have to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.159
stop and pick up a gun every two seconds

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.140
K scorestreaks go along with this you
don't want

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.210
some you know one like a chopper gunner
something could you not gonna stop

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.790
well you're rushing to use it uses
something that

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.349
can direct itself and does kills people
on its own

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.010
K step 4i think this for a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.590
a step 4: alright this

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.430
is pretty common sense also I'm the
sensitivity that you use

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.950
has to be to your liking with her unit
has to be to your liking

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.069
on say you use in 10 sensitivity because

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.150
he saw in a quick scoping guide or
something make you don't have a seizure

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.730
earlier play in the game okay

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.860
you don't want to spin around in circles
so much that you throw up either

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.010
so is use the sensitivity that you like

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.120
and I'm sure you'll do fine so last hip

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.430
is if you have a headset then I would
recommend using it because game sound

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.900
listening to the game while you're
playing it can be a huge

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.790
benefit deal and you know

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.780
its it's hard to play without any in
sound

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.709
so that was the deal and it lasted three
minutes and 10

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.400
11 12 seconds so that was a video

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.830
and this will probably be over some

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.840
Brandon goes clips at me going on a
streak

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.340
in killing all those noobs they don't
know how to play like me

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.629
with all these tips that they didn't
listen to you

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.019
so that was the video leave a like

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.400
