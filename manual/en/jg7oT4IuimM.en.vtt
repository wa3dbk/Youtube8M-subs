Hi, I’m Mary Alexander from Home Instead
Senior Care and today I’m going to provide

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.720
some tips for making sure your senior loved
ones are getting proper nutrition. Now I’m

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.510
going to discuss what can happen without proper
nutrition and hydration.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.900
So how do you know if your senior loved one’s
diet fits the bill? Simple monitoring of your

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.620
parent’s situation can help. Here are 10
warning signs that may signal a potential

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.649
problem:

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.120
First is a loss of appetite. If your senior
has always been a hearty eater but no longer

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.110
eats as he or she used to, it's time to find
out why. An underlying illness could be at

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.960
the root cause. Or it could be problems with
ill-fitting dentures or other pain while chewing.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.520
Second, ask yourself did mom and dad used
to love eating out and now they rarely if

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.840
ever go out or eat at their favorite restaurant?
If so, ask them about the change to determine

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.679
if there is a problem.

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:30.289
Depression is the third warning sign to look
for. This can be signaled by a change in appetite.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:37.070
The fourth sign is a sudden weight fluctuation.
A weight change – losing or gaining 10 pounds

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.319
in six months – could mean that something
is amiss.

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.490
OK. We’re halfway there. The fifth sign
to look for is expired or spoiled food in

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.730
the refrigerator. Your parents could be saving
food until it's no longer safe to eat. If

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.789
they end up eating something they shouldn’t
it could lead to illness that could severely

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:58.950
weaken them.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.429
The number 6 sign to look for is skin tone.
If your parents are eating properly, their

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.929
skin should look healthy and well-hydrated.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.560
The next warning sign is lethargy. If your
loved one has regularly been active but suddenly

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.219
becomes lethargic, it could mean an improper
diet.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:27.159
Cognitive problems are the eighth warning
sign. Seniors who live alone might forget

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.450
to eat. Dementia and cognitive problems can
lead to nutritional deficiencies.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.269
The ninth signal is when your parent is taking
more than three medications. Medication can

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.641
influence both appetite and weight. Check
with your parent's doctor to find out if the

00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:48.450
medications could be a culprit.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.590
The last warning sign of poor nutrition could
be a recent illness or a hospital stay. Be

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.540
sure to keep tabs on your loved one's recovery
to make sure they’re eating properly.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.451
OK. So now that we’ve given you the ten
signs to look for, what you should do if you

00:03:06.451 --> 00:03:11.139
suspect your senior loved one isn’t eating
right?

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:16.609
First, sit down and have a talk with your
parent. Tell them what you’ve noticed and

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:24.670
that you are concerned. Listen carefully to
find out what they have to say. Also, be sure

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.359
to let them know that their symptoms might
be easily cleared up with some simple dietary

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.790
changes.
If you suspect medications or an illness might

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:43.290
be to blame, suggest a visit to their primary
care physician and offer to go along. Be sure

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.810
to take along lists of current medications,
any recent illnesses they might have experienced

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.830
and signals of poor nutrition that you noticed.
With this information in hand, the doctor

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.709
can best diagnose the problem. The doctor
may suggest some simple blood tests that can

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.560
help reveal any potential medical problems.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:14.049
Once the doctor has conducted his analysis
he may suggest nutritional supplements, including

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:20.240
drinks and pudding. You might also ask if
a nutritionist or dietician would be helpful,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.419
especially if there are medical conditions,
such as diabetes, that need to be taken into

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.030
consideration during meal preparation.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.420
Lastly, if you think dental or jaw problems
are to blame, suggest that your senior loved

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.640
one make a visit to his or her dentist.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.060
In addition to consulting medical and nutrition
professionals, there are many things you can

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.720
do to help your parents eat properly and have
better nutrition. We’ll discuss those ideas

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.130
in our next video.
