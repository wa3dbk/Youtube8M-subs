00:00:00.365 --> 00:00:01.433
- Today we're gonna show you guys

00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:03.823
how to make homemade cake vodka.

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:06.725
What you need for this is a mason jar,

00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:10.464
white cake, and a bottle of vodka.

00:00:13.283 --> 00:00:14.875
And fork if you wanna try it.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.397
- [Skyy] It's real sexy.
- Yummy.

00:00:17.397 --> 00:00:18.347
- [Skyy] Nice.

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:19.647
I'm real turned on now.

00:00:20.485 --> 00:00:23.153
(both laughing)

00:00:23.503 --> 00:00:25.916
Okay, so grab your white cake.

00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:26.824
You like white cake Sophia?

00:00:26.824 --> 00:00:28.426
- [Sophia] I love white cake.

00:00:28.426 --> 00:00:29.749
I love every kind of cake.

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:30.794
- [Skyy] Do you love black cake?

00:00:30.794 --> 00:00:32.234
- [Sophia] Every cake.
- [Skyy] Really?

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:33.557
- [Sophia] Yes.
- [Skyy] You sure?

00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:34.648
- [Sophia] Really.
- [Skyy] Just checking.

00:00:34.648 --> 00:00:36.181
- [Sophia] Okay--
- [Skyy] Don't be racist with this shit.

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:37.527
- [Skyy] Okay so-- (laughing)

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:41.380
I removed the icing.
- [Sophia] Yes, beautiful job.

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.950
- [Skyy] You don't wanna get
the icing all up in there.

00:00:43.138 --> 00:00:44.924
There's two layers of icing
on this particular cake.

00:00:45.204 --> 00:00:47.362
And once I'm done getting
all the damn icing off

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.566
I break it up, put it in my jar.

00:00:50.893 --> 00:00:51.727
- [Sophia] Yes.

00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:54.026
- [Skyy] And once I got my cake in my jar,

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:56.115
I add some booze.

00:00:56.187 --> 00:00:57.626
- [Sophia] We douse it in vodka.

00:00:57.626 --> 00:00:59.064
- [Skyy] Exactly.
- [Sophia] Cool.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.200
- [Skyy] And seal up my mason jar.
- [Sophia] Yes.

00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:02.038
- [Skyy] You like that?

00:01:02.038 --> 00:01:02.990
- [Sophia] I love that.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.103
- [Skyy] Okay.

00:01:04.453 --> 00:01:07.028
(soft jazz music)

00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:13.392
- We have our mason jar.

00:01:13.392 --> 00:01:14.019
- We do.

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:15.061
- Give it a good shaking!

00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:15.988
- Yes!

00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:17.544
- Try to keep it sexy!

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:19.750
- Sorry, I know I always forget.

00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:21.284
- [Skyy] That's sexy?

00:01:21.284 --> 00:01:23.047
- I'm sorry, okay.

00:01:23.582 --> 00:01:24.743
- [Skyy] That's sexy now?

00:01:24.743 --> 00:01:26.019
- I don't know.

00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:29.200
- [Skyy] Oh, you zip it down! (laughing)

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:33.542
Oh you see her stick some boobs in!

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.539
Okay, we're good with that, that's enough.

00:01:35.726 --> 00:01:36.818
So I got a funnel cuz I don't want

00:01:36.818 --> 00:01:37.602
all that cake gunk to get in this.

00:01:37.602 --> 00:01:38.998
So go ahead and pour.

00:01:39.484 --> 00:01:40.290
- High.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.363
- Go ahead and pour.

00:01:46.174 --> 00:01:47.171
- It's working!

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:48.821
- Be advised, okay,

00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:51.768
I'm tossing this aside
but this right here.

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:54.369
This is edible, okay.

00:01:55.117 --> 00:01:57.016
You can eat this if you want to.

00:01:58.254 --> 00:01:59.530
Alright.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.992
That'll get you blitzed though.

00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:02.155
- Uh, yeah.

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.107
- Okay!

00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:06.333
That's it, that's the last,
okay, just a little drizzle.

00:02:06.486 --> 00:02:08.016
Huh, huh, you ever pee like this though?

00:02:09.527 --> 00:02:11.824
- (laughs) I think it's a guy thing.

00:02:12.012 --> 00:02:12.987
- No--
- [Sophia] The shaking.

00:02:12.987 --> 00:02:14.543
- [Skyy] Oh you've seen the shake?

00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:15.263
You've witnessed the shake--?

00:02:15.263 --> 00:02:17.238
- No I have not witnessed the shake.
- [Skyy] Don't fricken lie to me!

00:02:17.238 --> 00:02:19.064
I could see it in your
eyes you've seen the shake!

00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:20.713
You look like you've seen the shake before

00:02:20.713 --> 00:02:22.152
because once you've seen the shake

00:02:22.152 --> 00:02:23.869
it's not something that
you forget, you know?

00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:25.378
Cake vodka!

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:27.932
(soft jazz music)

00:02:34.807 --> 00:02:36.268
Pineapple juice, go ahead!

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.707
- [Sophia] Pineapple juice!

00:02:39.218 --> 00:02:40.285
- [Skyy] Okay, right there.

00:02:41.215 --> 00:02:42.423
You want a glass-- you
want a straw for that?

00:02:42.423 --> 00:02:43.421
- No I don't think so.

00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:44.652
- You gonna just keep it--
- [Sophia] I'm not--

00:02:44.652 --> 00:02:46.347
- [Sophia] I'm gonna keep it classy.

00:02:46.347 --> 00:02:47.599
- You gonna keep it ratchet.

00:02:48.227 --> 00:02:48.761
- Okay.

00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:50.803
- Ratchet German girls,
alright let's do it!

00:02:51.408 --> 00:02:54.195
And there you have it cake vodka

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.790
with a splash of pineapple!

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.274
Yeah, self-made cake vodka.

00:02:59.019 --> 00:02:59.948
Go ahead.

00:02:59.948 --> 00:03:02.013
- Alright, cheers!

00:03:02.177 --> 00:03:04.079
- You gotta swirl it around
a little bit first, right?

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.215
Okay go ahead now.

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.226
(party music)

00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:11.583
That's a really dainty sip.

00:03:11.864 --> 00:03:14.138
- No it wasn't!
- [Skyy] Okay, well go on.

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:17.970
- [Sophia] I like it.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.597
- You like it?

00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:19.712
- It's really sweet.

00:03:19.712 --> 00:03:20.501
- Ahuh.

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.730
- Which is usually not my favorite but--

00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:24.749
no it's really good.

00:03:26.013 --> 00:03:28.193
- Let me tell the reason why I made this

00:03:28.221 --> 00:03:30.056
because a lot of you
guys out there in Europe,

00:03:30.056 --> 00:03:31.216
other parts of the world--

00:03:31.216 --> 00:03:32.377
even here in America,

00:03:32.377 --> 00:03:34.096
do not have access to cake vodka.

00:03:34.588 --> 00:03:36.143
Cake vodka-- and it's super popular

00:03:36.143 --> 00:03:38.721
but then we live in Los
Angeles and so everything new

00:03:38.721 --> 00:03:40.135
comes here first

00:03:40.183 --> 00:03:42.111
but if you live in other places

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:44.641
it's hard to get cuz I've
read a lot of comments

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.267
about cake vodka.

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:47.846
So I decided that I'd show you guys

00:03:47.846 --> 00:03:49.680
how to make your own home made version--

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.539
- And it's so simple.

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:52.789
- Yeah, just remember white cake, okay?

00:03:53.093 --> 00:03:53.767
- It's super simple

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:55.692
and it tastes actually really good.

00:03:55.833 --> 00:03:57.226
- Tipsy Bartender!
- [Sophia] Cool.

00:03:57.226 --> 00:03:58.780
- [Skyy] Thank you for coming out, okay!

00:03:59.594 --> 00:04:01.566
I'm just gonna chill with this
little ratchet German here,

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:02.497
we have fun.

00:04:02.497 --> 00:04:03.960
Do you even know what ratchet means?

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.094
- I was gonna ask you after the show.

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.490
- It's a tool that you
use to tie down stuff.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.347
Google it.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.643
(both laugh)

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.172
And there you have it

00:04:18.172 --> 00:04:20.884
Ritchie Incognito's Rage!

00:04:22.071 --> 00:04:23.093
Go ahead!

00:04:23.653 --> 00:04:25.417
- I'm scared, I'm scared of this rage.

00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:26.393
- That's a pretty potent drink.

00:04:26.393 --> 00:04:28.064
Way to change the color of
the whole damn drink now.

00:04:28.064 --> 00:04:31.199
- Well I'm not gonna--
I don't know, I guess

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.008
this isn't a lot of alcohol,
I didn't have to do that.

00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:35.376
But there's a lot of alcohol
that we used in there.

00:04:38.859 --> 00:04:40.274
Holy shit!
