This excerpt from the Public Television program
The Piano Guy is brought to you by the Roland Corporation

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.740
(music)

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.580
(music)

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.420
(music)

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.949
You know what I would like to do right now
is walk you through the tune I Left My Heart

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.660
in San Francisco.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.410
It's a great tune obviously Tony Bennett,
it was really his signature tune, kind of

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.340
an interesting side note, his accompanist
Ralph Sharron who's one of my all time favorite

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.489
piano accompanist is who actually brought
him the tune originally and it ended up being

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.149
one of his biggest hits.

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.230
What I want to do in working through this
tune is not focus on all the little stylistic

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.719
interpretations things, but instead get right
down to the meat and potatoes of what it is

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.829
to get this tune learned and underhand in
your head.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.059
Which is just the melody line and just the
chord changes and to do that we obviously

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.200
use a lead sheet.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.989
So, lets go ahead and start with our right
hand, now this melody is really pretty darn

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.929
simple, its a really pretty lyrical melody
but its not that hard to play, so let me just

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:07.700
play a couple of measures

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.979
(music)

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.229
You know and if you have never read a music
in your entire life ever before, you probably

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.590
aught to get to that basic step of every good
boy does fine, and some of those things but

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.560
quite frankly even if not if I could say this
starts on an E, I bet you could probably hunt

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.119
and peck it if you knew the tune well enough
just by singing.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.709
So don't ever be afraid to let your ears guide you. I think sometimes we put the

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.829
cart before the horse and think that the reading
is more important than the playing and boy

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:40.829
that's just not the case. So use the reading
as a guide to help you get something underhand.

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:45.020
(music)

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.509
(music)

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.509
And on and on. There is nothing really in
this that's going to trip us up. You just

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.439
need to work your way through it and just
kind of get it underhand. its not a tough

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:00.939
one.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.969
Lets shift onto the other hand now to do our
chords. Now with our left hand we are going

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.889
to start out and I'm gonna give away some
of these chords. I'll tell what they are and

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:11.879
I'll play them, but before I do that I want
to give a little caveat and tell you I really

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.099
think its best when you are learning chords
to get chord diagrams in front of you. Weather

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.629
thats in a book or an electronic chord finder
or online somewhere, however you can find

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.000
it do it like guitar players do. You know
how they always read those little fret charts

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.739
when they are playing chords. Well on piano
I suggest doing the exact same thing for your

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.530
left hand and you just need to knuckle it
under and get some of those things learned

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.549
if you haven't learned them yet. The great
news and a bunch of you that have seen me

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.319
a bunch of times already know this. Once you
learn a chord you've really got it locked

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.780
in for the rest of your life. It's not like
you are starting from scratch on every single

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.209
tune, you really can come into most tunes
with a good base of knowledge and then your

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.209
snowball keeps getting bigger and bigger as
you learn new chords.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.159
So, moving on here we go...

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:50.569
(music)

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.980
It starts out with a C major 7, and then goes
to a E flat diminished 7, that's maybe one

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.900
you haven't had before. That ones not
so standard.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.900
So it's............then do a D minor 7,and
to G 7, sorry I'll do it in root position.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.689
I"m going to move the melody line up and octave
so that I can get my fingers out of the way

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:13.579
(music)

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:20.430
G 7, back to C Major 7, to G 7,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.430
There's a B Minor, actually I added a 7th,
you can just play the B Minor, to E 7,

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:39.840
Ok, so really then it just repeats. This tune
is kind of an odd one from a structure stand

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.180
point that it doesn't ever really go to a
bridge or a whole second section. It just

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.889
kind of A, A it just kind of plays through
a couple times.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.959
But let me tell you what, I'm just checking
to make sure I got through all the, there's

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.819
another E flat. I think I did we got through
all the chords.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.540
Let me play a couple measures for you, kind
of up tempo and I"m very intentionally not

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.090
going to do anything sneaky. I'm not going
to use the Ralph Sharron lick, the......

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.840
(music)

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.450
You know some of those other things you remember.
That's something you can do later, once you've

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.709
really got it underhand. But for now I'm just
going to use the root position chords, just

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.259
exactly like you would look them up in a chord
finding book of some sort and I'm going to

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:20.989
play a one note melody with it. I think you'll
find that it sounds pretty darn good. I'm

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.060
going to go ahead and keep the melody line
up one octave from where its written just

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.160
cause I feel like playing it up there.
So here we go.....

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.160
(music)

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.639
(music)

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.539
(music)

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.430
(music)

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.330
(music)

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.229
(music)

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.120
(music)

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.020
(music)

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.060
(music)
And then on and on, it will kind of repeat
it's self through the second part of the tune.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.410
There you go, that's a pretty darn easy tune
to get underhand. The chords aren't really

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.069
you know, number one there's not a ton of
chords in the tune and they are not particularly

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.669
tough chords and the melody's pretty straight
forward.

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.639
This is really a beautiful one to focus on
just the niceness of the tune which is a really

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.099
gorgeous melody line. So have fun learning
to play San Francisco and getting down these

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.539
basics and once you do that you will have
a really good platform set to start adding

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.740
some tips and tricks on top.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.819
Have Fun Playing
