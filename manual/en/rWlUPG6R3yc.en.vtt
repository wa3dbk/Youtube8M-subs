00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.930
Persona 3 was a strange bird.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.610
Sure, the entire MegaTen series could fit
under that description, but P3 just did so

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.090
many things... differently.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.480
The aesthetic changed drastically, the already
grimdark plot became even grimmer and darker,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.680
sidequests piled upon social quests piled
upon sexual conquests, and the game hyperextended

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.180
itself into a campaign likely to take even
a skilled player near the 100-hour mark.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.010
For this effort, it was recognized as one
of the best PS2 RPGs of its day, and saw an

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.910
updated re-release and PSP port.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.800
So how do you follow such a success?

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.110
Simple.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.680
You change the colors, make the mechanics
even better, and do it all over again.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.630
Persona 4 chronicles another near-mute high-school
protagonist, left to live with his uncle and

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.590
little cousin in the sleepy rural town of
Inaba for a year.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.860
Of course, this being a Persona game, one
year is all you need for a grisly string of

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.470
murders, supernatural events, bonds of friendship,
and... lots of fog.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.920
Fog that kills people.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.220
By throwing people into televisions and forcing
them to face the manifestation of their dark

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.220
desires.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.409
The “One More” battle system returns from
Persona 3, rewarding critical hits and weakness-striking

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.090
exploits with a bonus turn; subdue all your
foes in such a manner, and you can bring in

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.690
your entire party for a Tex-Avery-esque beatdown.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.560
These battles are facilitated by the eponymous
Personas (which doesn’t seem like the correct

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.750
plural, but I’ll run with it anyway), manifestations
of the psyche which grant the use of magical

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.880
powers.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.850
Each has its own elemental as well as statistical
strengths and weaknesses, and whereas your

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.840
party members only have the option of upgrading
once, your main character can gather, switch,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.850
and fuse personas at will, according to the
needs of the moment.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.890
By this process of fusion, new and stronger
Personas can be made without defaulting to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.090
the familiar level grind, and even further
enhancement can be gleaned from the friendships

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.060
and relationships you form with the residents
of Inaba, your team members, classmates...

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:31.879
and a fox.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.230
That said, P4 isn’t for everyone.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.680
The rating right on the box says so, qualifying
its M with everything but the kitchen sink:

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.920
Language, blood, gore, sex, more blood and
gore... and yet, the game never feels as distinctly

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.860
exploitative as, say, Agarest War or Hyperdimension
Neptunia.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.120
It’s on the pulpier side of teen drama,
but nothing seems really out-of-place...

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.410
except for the things that seem completely
out-of-place by dint of being psychologically

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.980
repressed urges.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.790
This is a game that doesn’t just demand
your attention for 100 hours or so, it demands

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.410
your interpretation.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.069
It wants you to think about the things that
are happening.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.080
And if you have the fortitude to make it through
- because, I’m not going to lie, you don’t

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.959
start actually “playing” the game until
almost an hour in - you’ll see why Persona

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.239
4 may just be the best JRPG of the PS2 era.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:29.530
And that’s not even getting into the aesthetic
brilliance.
