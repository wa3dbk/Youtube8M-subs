00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.119
This is the Lindo cajon. This
percussive instrument is a great asset

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.199
to any drummer or percussionist looking
for an easy to transport drum

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.190
Lindo uses a modern-day design utilising
two different woods in its construction.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.500
The playing face of the cajon is thinner than the rest and is made of birch wood

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.300
where the rest is platanus hispanica

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.800
A cajon is primary played using your
hands and slapping the playing face

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.820
but some percussionists use brushes, beaters or sticks.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.019
Striking the face in different places
gives different tones

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.540
and with the addition of snares this really
is a portable drum kit

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.000
The snares are also adjustable so you tailor the amount of rattle to your taste

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.860
There is also a sound hole cut at the back of the cajon

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.729
which acts to amplify the sound so this can
be used for busking

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.730
or acoustic performances without the
need to be mic'ed up
