00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.610
Today, we're going to do an
everyday casual back-to-school look.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.110
Now, let's go ahead and get started.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.880
I'm going to start off up with
the Ready Set Gorgeous foundation.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.714
This is 215 Warm Beige.

00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:13.380
Now, I'm going to build it up in
the areas where I need it most.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.420
I have panda circles under my eyes all
the time, even when I'm well-rested.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.285
So I'm definitely going to put it on
a lot there and also around my nose

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:29.420
and beneath my chin and definitely
making sure to hide those blemishes.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.670
Now, here's a quick tip.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.222
You can use an actual bronzer product.

00:00:33.222 --> 00:00:36.180
But like I said, I want something
that is going to be smooth and clean.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.080
So I just end up using a foundation
that is a lot darker than my skin tone.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.410
This is 315 Tawny.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.667
And this one, I'm going
to apply with a fan brush.

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:47.750
And then I'm going to just
dip my brush like this.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.340
I'm going to go underneath my
cheekbones for some sculpting,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.810
underneath my jaw bones to
narrow out my round face.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.850
Also, I've broken my
nose, like, five times,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.340
so I'm going to put a little bit right
around the edges to thin out my nose

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.600
and try to straighten out my nose.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.350
I broke my nose so many different ways.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.475
You're probably wondering,
wait, five or six times.

00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:14.730
What's wrong with this girl?

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.790
Really, really good
luck, let me tell you.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.180
I'm also going to put a
little bit on my neck,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.550
because you don't want to have
that really yucky line down here.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.500
And also, my neck never tans.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.180
So I'm just going to give
it a little boost of color.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.060
Now, I'm going to take
a dry, flat top brush,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.240
and I'm going to blend it all in.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.970
And I'm using circular motions so
that I can get that matte finish.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.505
You just kind of want that healthy
glow, that really subtle sculpt.

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:47.310
All right, now I'm going
to pick up my concealer,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.070
go back to those panda circles.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.150
Now, you might not have
the problem that I do,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.930
but we're working on me right now.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.929
So I'm going to use my concealer, go
under my eyes where it's the darkest,

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:58.970
and work my way outwards.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.250
This is also just going to give me some
extra highlight above my cheekbones,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.040
keep the contouring going.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.449
And then, I'm also going to go into
my tear ducts to brighten up my eyes.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.940
And I also think that
this makes a great primer.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.500
So I'm going to go ahead and
put it on my eyelids, as well.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.930
I know I look kind of like a crazy
person right now, but, trust me,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:20.722
it's going to work.

00:02:20.722 --> 00:02:23.013
I'm going to go ahead and
just use my fingers for this.

00:02:23.013 --> 00:02:24.060
You can use a brush.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.990
But since I do need a lot of
coverage, I let the concealer set

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.065
and dry up just a little bit,
and then I blot my finger

00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:35.845
so that I can get that maximum,
maximum coverage and highlight.

00:02:35.845 --> 00:02:38.220
When you are working around
your eyes, you want to press.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.095
You don't want to pull.

00:02:40.095 --> 00:02:45.750
I'm going to use a concealer
brush just to blend it in.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.670
Now moving on to eye shadow, this
is my favorite CoverGirl Quad,

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.440
really pretty shimmers and neutrals.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.625
This is definitely a Quad that
you can take from day to night.

00:02:55.625 --> 00:03:00.860
I'm going to take a little bit of
the dark brown and the medium brown

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.660
and just outline my
eyelids to open them up.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.030
Good morning.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.112
Hello.

00:03:08.112 --> 00:03:09.820
And I should probably
let you know that I

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.910
save most of my blending
for the very end,

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.720
so you don't mind my jagged corners.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.370
And the Quad really does outline
exactly the order that I go in.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.429
So I'm working from dark brown
to medium brown, now to the gold,

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:25.220
and then I'll get to
the yellow eventually.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.500
So some of the medium and the gold,
I'm going to fill that in on my lid.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.285
I love these colors.

00:03:31.285 --> 00:03:33.160
And like I said before,
if you want something

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.340
that's a little bit more subtle, you
do not have to go this dark at all.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.310
Now I'm going to use the yellow gold
in my tear ducts to open those up.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.470
Check out that color.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.270
Wow.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.720
Underneath my brow bone a little bit and
then always brightening under my eyes,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.342
too.

00:03:49.342 --> 00:03:51.300
And this is where we do
the necessary blending.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.780
So I'm going to put this down
and go all over my eyelid.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.753
Bring that shimmer
outwards, and then I'm

00:03:57.753 --> 00:03:59.680
going to make sure to
round out these edges

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.380
so that I don't have
a crazy, painted look.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.570
Now, I'm going to move over to eyebrows.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.600
I have not always had brows like this.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.490
I had spaghetti brows with
lots of holes in between,

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.390
because I did not know what
I was doing with tweezers.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.190
So a nice trick to growing them out is,
first want to work with what you have.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.020
Fill in your natural shape.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.750
And then as far as those
little empty spaces,

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.310
or I like to bring my
arch up just a little bit,

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.910
you don't want to go
more than one little hair

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.670
length bigger than your natural shape.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.911
Otherwise, you are going
to look all kinds of crazy.

00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:38.910
And by the way, for those of you who
don't think that filling your brows

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.430
make a difference, it makes all
the difference in the world,

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.940
even if you have full brows.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.030
See a difference?

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.044
Hello.

00:04:46.044 --> 00:04:47.038
Big difference.

00:04:47.038 --> 00:04:53.690
Take my spool here, blend,
filling in my arch on this side.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.514
So now I'm going to finish up the
blending and the taming of the brows.

00:04:59.514 --> 00:05:04.140
All right, next I'm going
to do some eyeliner.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.220
This is the brand new Intensify Me!

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.980
eyeliner.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.610
And for me, especially for an everyday
look, I want my eyes to look a big

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.550
and awake even if I'm not.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.610
So I want to start off
really thin on the inside

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.880
and then build up the
thickness as I go out.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.420
And check out that color.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.790
Unlike pencil, you don't
have to pull on your eye

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.165
to get that really precise line.

00:05:26.165 --> 00:05:28.260
If you're just starting
out, rather than trying

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.950
to do a straight line
all at once, just push it

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.000
in little dots all the way
across until you get comfortable

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.523
with your hand position and what
you want to do with your face.

00:05:38.523 --> 00:05:40.550
All right, it looks good to me.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.960
It does not have to be exactly perfect.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.986
OK, now I'm going to curl my eyelashes.

00:05:45.986 --> 00:05:51.040
Just one long steady pump,
maybe one to two more.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.500
Now I'm going to do some
mascara, my favorite.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.440
This is the Super Sizer.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.990
And as you can tell by the brush,
there will be no lash left behind.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.950
Top first.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.030
Now, I have a push and
a roll method so that I

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.125
can keep that curl going
strong, gelling it into place.

00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:10.890
So I push, push, push.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.700
And as I work my way up my
lashes, I roll on the brush,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.390
combing out every single lash.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.655
Before, after.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.410
I feel like a human.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.510
OK.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.930
Lower lashes now.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.610
Again, this awesome brush, tiny
enough to pick up even those baby

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.345
hairs on your lower lash line.

00:06:36.345 --> 00:06:41.120
I grab my eyeliner brush, take a
little bit of brown eye shadow,

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.710
and I'll just line the outer
edges of my lower lash line

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.220
to pop them just a little bit.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.800
OK, we're almost done here, I promise.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.270
Now, I'm going to take some blush,
wake up my cheeks, just on the apples,

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.870
a little on my nose.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.210
And then lastly, I'm just
going to do a light lip.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.800
Now, a lot of people skip liner when
they want to do a light, subtle lip.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.070
But in my opinion, you might
want your lips to look nude,

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.570
but you don't want them to be naked.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.420
So I think liner is always an important
step that you never, ever want to skip.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.190
So I'm going to line the outer edges.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.600
And I need to exfoliate my lips.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.450
They are dry.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:27.430
But luckily, the lip color I'm
about to put on is full of moisture.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.821
This is the Jumbo Gloss
Balm in Berries N' Cream.

00:07:31.821 --> 00:07:34.695
And I love it, because it's full of
color but it's also moisturizing.

00:07:34.695 --> 00:07:38.960
So hopefully, it'll help get rid of
those crackles throughout the day.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.140
Here's my final look.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.970
I'm feeling good.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.720
Thank you so much for
watching this video.
