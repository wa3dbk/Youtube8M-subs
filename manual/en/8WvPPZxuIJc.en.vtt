St Joseph’s School for the Deaf, Cabra

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.830
Around the time of the Great Irish Famine
(1847-1849) when most people were very poor

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.650
and the famine made many of them sick, two
parish priests, Monsignor William Yore and

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.230
Father Thomas McNamara, wanted to help deaf
children by setting up schools for them.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.580
The first school was started in Glasnevin
in 1845. At first, only four boys went to

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.460
this school but the number of boys soon increased
and the parish priests needed a bigger building.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.610
In 1856, a big school was built beside Cabra
Cross. It was named St Joseph’s School for

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.070
the Deaf.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.079
Many people helped to keep the school open.
Monsignor William Yore even sold all the books

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:54.079
from his own library to raise £1,500. This
converts to €850,000 today .

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.340
In this school the Irish Christian Brothers
taught the boys Irish sign language. Sign

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.129
language lets people communicate with each
other by making symbols with their hands.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.129
The boys also learned reading, writing, tailoring
(that is making clothes), shoemaking, printing,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.540
baking, carpentry, gardening and painting.
This helped them get jobs after school.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.439
Sport was very important at St Joseph’s.
The boys used to play Gaelic football on the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.240
playing fields in the Phoenix Park. They did
gymnastics, athletics and played handball,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.630
table tennis and soccer. Peter Desmond who
played for the Irish soccer team in the 1940s

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.229
was a pupil of St Joseph’s.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.950
In 1987 a new school was built beside St Joseph’s.
This school is called Edmund Rice School after

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.460
the founder of the Christian Brothers.
