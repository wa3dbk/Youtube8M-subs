00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.780
I knew that I wanted to stay in one location.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.470
From the beginning of my career to the end
of my career.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.860
So being very close to the neighbourhood,
I feel part of this community.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.300
It's a nice, tight-knit community.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.750
What we strive to do is set ourselves to one
patient at a time.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.070
So while I'm treating a patient, my assistant
is with me the whole time, and I'm with that

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.890
patient the whole time, so that way if there
is even the slightest bit of fear or stress,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.470
pain, anxiety, I'm there to actually take
care of it.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.079
I recall this one patient I actually had to
see them in the waiting room, I couldn't even

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.320
bring them into the dental chair because of
their level of anxiety..Well, simply because

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.381
I had that time alloted for that one person
and there was no one else in the office, we

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:52.520
were able to have a private conversation and
not even come into the dental chair and that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.620
persons anxiety level immediately came down.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.990
Conscious sedation is a method that we can
use to manage deeper levels of anxiety.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.030
Typically we bring someone to a point of about
30% conscious and the experience seems to

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.390
lapse within moments, without any memory of
the appointment at all.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.600
Biggest thing that people talk about aside
from fear is money, and we take the guesswork

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.940
out of that point, and that point specifically.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.700
You will always know how much something is
going to cost.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.500
There is going to be no surprises - we bill
your insurance directly so that when your

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.700
bill is received at the front.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.510
You only pay what your insurance does not
pay.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.780
All that paperwork, all that insurance communication?

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.190
We take care of that.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.570
Over the years I've managed to find a phenomenal
team, they've also become family, as my patients

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.570
are.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.610
We grow together, make each other better professionals
so that we can provide better care.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.470
Should I hold that?

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.750
(laughing)

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.760
I've never stopped going to school so that
we can keep everything in house.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.810
Oral Surgery, Sedation, Wisdom Teeth, Implantology,
Periosurgeries..it doesn't matter what will

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.130
happen in your treatment over the course of
your life, you'll be treated here at Seaside

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.170
Dental.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.480
I get excited at that, so that I can continue
to hone my profession, continue to perfect

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.390
my skills, and uh, be able to keep doing exactly
what I do.
