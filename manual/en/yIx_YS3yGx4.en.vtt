00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.990
The bailing is without a shadow of a doubt
the best thing about the parlour.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.330
The biggest thing with it naturally... In
the last parlour, the first thing we'll say

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.930
is the cows enter a parlour.
In my last parlour they could go in to space

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.320
number, they could go in to unit 4, they could
go into unit 7, wherever they wanted to go.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.650
Whereas in this parlour they have to go up
to the top and the second cow has to go follow her.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.030
She can't go in anywhere else, she has to go up to the top.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.760
So that's the single biggest
thing.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.020
Do you know you've cows going up in an organized
pattern.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.850
No cow can pass each other out like they could
in the last parlour.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.510
Heifers, of course, first calvers... In my
last parlour a first calver, depending

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.749
you could have your first calver that
would be that bit more afraid then another

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:47.120
heifer would.
She could pass out and crush out over or inside

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.829
the next, and often it would happen, they
would pass out and get inside another animal

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.260
but in this parlour she's set there and she
can't go anywhere.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.019
That's the biggest thing, she can't move forwards
or backwards, she just has to stay put.

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.879
Well at present I'm milking 70 cows which
90% would be heifers.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.439
So as these were all just purchased in the
last 3 months if today was yesterday I would

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.460
have bought 100% heifers, if i had realised
the Swiftflo Bailing was such a good, excellent

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.049
at restraining heifers.
Absolutely no problem milking heifers with

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.570
Swiftflo Bailing.
I find it excellent for, you've great control

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.380
over the cow or the heifer when she's being
milked.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.469
Its just very easy access then you just pull
the lever there and the bailing rises up and

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.039
all the cows exit very fast.

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.460
Bailing is the biggest thing. Ya, definitely
I couldn't go without the bailing. I'd sacrifice

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.829
everything for the bail system on its own.

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.409
There's one advice I would give to any farmer,
definitely starting out putting up a new shed

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.090
like I was here, don't do it without the Swiftflo
Bailing.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.929
I would leave everything else out. If your
definitely putting up a new building I would

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:01.929
strongly advise bailing.
