Hi there!

00:00:01.049 --> 00:00:03.310
I am Hilah, and welcome to Hilah Cooking.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.920
So one of the goals of our show is to sort
of go over the basics kind of cooking 101

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.019
if you will.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.720
So today I am going to show you how to make
scrambled eggs, super-duper easy, and it's

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.730
a great thing to know how to make if you want
to make breakfast for yourself or you want

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.199
to make breakfast tacos or any number of things.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.869
So I will show you starting right now.

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:41.340
Okay, so basically all you need is eggs and
butter.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.219
Some people like to add milk or water to their
eggs, personally I don't really notice the

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.530
difference when I do that, so you can do it.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.210
I don't know.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.440
I think maybe the extra liquid just helps
you break up the egg more better.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.980
I don't really know.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.440
I have heard explanations, but I don't necessarily
believe it.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.330
Anyway, it is important to get some air mixed
into your eggs, so when you beat them, you

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.330
can use a fork.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.620
I am gonna use a whisk because it's kind of
more fun, but you just want to do it a lot,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.890
and it starts to turn sort of a lighter yellow,
a lemon yellow.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.500
Get in there air!

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.480
Get frothy on me.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:39.750
Then we add a little salt and pepper and we
ready to cook.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:50.230
All right, let that pre-heat while I get my
S&amp;P in there, that's salt and pepper, and

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:59.420
mix that up again, and another very important
thing when you're making eggs is to use the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.430
proper sized pan.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.820
Since I just have two eggs here, I am using
my little baby skillet because I don't want

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.240
them all spread out and then you end up with
sort of a, they cook to fast, and then you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.790
get sort of tough eggs.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.210
So I want them to cook slow and kind of deep,
and I've got on our high heat right now while

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.870
the butter melts, and the butter is going
to melt, and then it's gonna kind of fill

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:32.020
them up a little bit, and that's when I know
it's hot enough it will start to bubble.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:45.450
One final wham-bam and then I am gonna pour
my eggs in.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.940
Okay, now don't stir them right away.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.830
Let them acclimate to their new environment.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:00.530
Turn your heat down to medium-low, and it's
starting to cook around the edges here, but

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.040
I don't want to mess with it just yet.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:13.840
Now I do.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.959
I am using a rubber/silicone spatula.

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:28.200
You can use a metal spatula because I want
to be gentle with my baby eggs.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:44.330
Now I can start stirring them a little more
vigorously to break up the little clumps,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.380
and when they're, I like my eggs fully done,
but you want to take them off before they

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:58.380
are to the point of your liking, so like this
looks, turn that heat off and just keep stirring

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.510
them around for just a few more seconds.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.650
You don't want to overcook, and then there.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.800
They still look a little moist and ready to
plate.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:19.870
Go ahead and get them on my plate and perfectly
cooked, scrambled eggs.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.639
All right, see here we have large curds that
are still moist and delicious and fluffy.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.069
Mmmmm!

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:30.499
Perfect.

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:31.499
There you have it.

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:32.550
Perfectly cooked eggs.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.050

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.339
