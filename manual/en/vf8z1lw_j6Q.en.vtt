00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.470
Here we are inside the famous number one warehouse
at Laphroaig distillery.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.610
Now, we're in a warehouse here so as you can
imagine there's lots of fantastic smells in

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.610
here.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.660
Just out through the wall to my left we have
the Atlantic Ocean so lots of kind of sea

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.250
atmosphere in here.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.640
Then with the casks maturing away a lot of
alcohol in the atmosphere as well.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.360
So them mixed with the dark, damp atmosphere
in here - a fantastic smell.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.860
Now as the casks are maturing away with the
big sleep what happens is there's a kind of

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.109
expansion and contraction through the seasons
and with that the spirit goes into the cask,

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:50.319
draws out the wood flavours and then it contracts
back in the winter.

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:55.859
Now while the whisky is maturing away we do
lose a lot through evaporation, we call this

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.219
the Angel's Share and because we're right
in the Gulf stream of Islay as well we do

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.469
have higher loses than you'd have in mainland
Scotland.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.410
Now you might have noticed as well I've got
a different size cask to my right here.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.780
This is a quarter cask and these are completely
unique to Laphroaig as well.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.670
Now what happens is, with one of our brands
called Quarter Cask we get the bourbon barrels

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.729
ages 5 up to 11 year old, we'll mix them together
and we'll double mature them in these casks.

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.860
And you might be thinking well it's not a
quarter of a bourbon barrel you can see behind

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.790
me, it's actually quarter of a sherry butt.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.930
A sherry butt is a cask used for European
Oak use, for the sherry industry.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.859
Quarter Casks are basically a reintroduction
of a very kind of old process, these would

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.729
have originally been used about 125 years
ago, one on each side of the pack horse as

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.460
you go to market and the reason they're that
side is two people could lift them up onto

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.460
the side of the horse.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.520
So smaller volume, but easier to lift.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.070
We've reintroduced this process and it's become
one of our fastest growing brands over the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.280
last few years.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.969
What I think we should do now, I think we
should basically pull the bung out of one

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.689
of these and I can show you the colour that
has come in since the spirit we produced in

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:08.689
the still house.

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:16.980
This is a quarter cask barrel, and then behind
me you can see the sherry butt as well so

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.710
you get to see the scale and the difference
of the size of a sherry butt.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.150
I'm just going to open this one up.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.870
Hopefully I'll be able to do this first time!

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:38.610
Ok, so that's the bung out now we get the
valinch into the cask here, give it a wee

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.740
mix to mix the flavours up.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.780
So this is the liquid.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.960
As you can see, fantastic colour - this liquid
will be going for bottling in the next two

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.500
or three weeks or so, so it's almost finished
it's journey.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.850
If we smell it - oh fantastic smell, even
though it's really cold in here, it's almost

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.040
closing the whisky, you still get lots of
vanilla, lots of oak-y flavours coming through.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.980
A real kind of bread effect in this one as
well, and it's enveloped by the smoky, peaty

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.630
flavours you'd associate with Laphroaig as
well.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.900
This is ready for bottling and so what we
should do now, we need to go to the Friends

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.450
of Laphroaig lounge and I'll take you and
show you the rest of the family.
