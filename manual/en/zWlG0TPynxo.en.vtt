Hi, I'm Fionna, author of 25 Foods Kids Hate
and How To Get Them Eating 24, and welcome

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:12.880
back to my Videojug Cooking For Kids series.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:20.699
Ok, I think this recipe is foolproof.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.980
It's my spinach pesto, or Popeye's Pesto.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.029
So, a great tip is, if your kids don't like
a certain vegetable, like spinach for example,

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.200
think of foods and dishes that they do like,
and try and figure out ways of incorporating

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.520
those vegetables into those dishes.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.880
I can't think of many kids who don't love
pasta pesto.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.410
So, first of all I have got some fresh, baby
leaf spinach.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.540
All you need for this recipe, by the way,
is a food processor, or a hand held blender

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.860
is just as good.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.980
Pack it in; and it does go right down, I promise.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.990
It seems like a lot but actually it does,
you know, blend right down.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.990
Of course, as ever, for the full ingredients
and details and measurements, head to the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.050
description box.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.609
Basil.

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:11.609
Smells divine.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:12.700
I love basil.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.119
In it goes.

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.280
I've also got some parmesan cheese, in it
goes.This really is just a case of putting

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.920
things into your food processor.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.430
I'm going to use about five tablespoons of
olive oil, maybe you can use a little bit

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.430
more if you want to.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.859
Rapeseed oil is great, too.

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.640
Five generous spoonfuls, tablespoonfuls, by
the way.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.350
A bit of seasoning.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.439
Don't be afraid to season your kids' food;
you know, too much salt's a bad thing, but

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.630
a little bit does help.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.859
So, two big pinches, about a quarter of a
teaspoon is what you're looking for, a tiny

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:56.990
bit more.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:06.619
And the juice of half a lime gives it some
zing.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.260
If your lime isn't that juice, sometimes it
just depends what you get, feel free to use

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.780
the other half, which actually, I think I'm
going to do to do.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.310
See this technique?

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.080
I'm squeezing the lime through my fingers
to catch any pips.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.500
And really, that's it.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.350
Lid goes on, and we whiz it up.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.980
Right.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.880
There you go!

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.180
How easy is that?

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.620
It's like, blink and you'll miss it.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.100
That's how you make pesto, you just bung it
all in and you whiz it up.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.480
So I'm going to,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.980
safety first, turn it off, give it a quick
test.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.140
So fresh, really delicious.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.070
Ok, and then literally, you just serve it
up.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.590
I've got some pasta right here that I have
precooked, and that was the timey thing, you

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.930
know, that's the thing that takes all the
time.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.400
And you just take it off, and you spoon it
on.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:29.760
So there we have it, my spinach pesto.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.970

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.430
channel, follow us on Twitter at VideojugFood,
or find us on Facebook, because we love to

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.420
hear all of your comments and ideas of all
of our recipes, and maybe some of yours, too.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.130
But for now, I think that this is so much
nicer and fresher than the standard jar of

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.700
pesto that you can buy in the shops, and to
prove it, mmm!

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.770
It's tea for hungry kids, or lunch for a hungry
mum.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.770
Enjoy!

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:01.770
That's it from me.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:22.760
Hope to see you next time for another Videojug
