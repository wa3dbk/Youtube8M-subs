Hi, this is Kyle and contrary to what it might
look like, I'm not actually

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:05.120
a hit man.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.480
What we've got here is a shotgun microphone.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.980
Now lots of
people buy shotgun microphones as their initial

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.570
investment for their film
audio, but they neglect to buy the accessories

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.000
that go with it and a lot of
people say "Well, I've heard about wind noise

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.240
and all that, but I'm just
going to get a foam wind screen and slide

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.710
it over the top and that should
do the trick".

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.730
Well, I'm here to tell you that if you're
going to film

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.019
outside, that's not going to do the trick.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.039
Let's do some demonstrations of what I'm talking
about here.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.689
So we've got
the shotgun microphone on, we have some audio.

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.110
We're going to turn on a
fan to simulate wind noise.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.140
Let's turn that fan on.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.520
Now I've got the
microphone pointed up and away from the wind,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.500
but listen to what happens
when I bring the microphone into the wind

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.620
pattern.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.320
Pretty strong rumbling
there, so we're going to mute the microphone

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.120
for just a second, we'll slide
the foam wind screen on, we'll turn the microphone

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.660
back on same level and
we're going to do it.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.050
Still got some wind noise in there.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.220
So the next thing we're going to do is we're
going to try a blimp, blimp

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.320
wind screen followed by a fuzzy rat or a fuzzy
wind screen or a wind muff.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.790
It goes by many different names, so let's
see what that looks like.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.440
Now we
have the blimp wind screen, which creates

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.950
a dead air space around the
microphone on the same microphone on the same

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:25.950
shock mount.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.040
Let's hear what
that sounds like.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.330
Pretty dramatic reduction in the noise.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.220
Next we're
going to do the fuzzy wind screen on top of

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.220
that.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.660
So let's see what that
sounds like.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.660
All right.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.100
Finally, we have the wind muff or fuzzy rat
or Chewbacca's dead foot, as I

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.190
like to call it.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.190
Here we go.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.230
Significant difference in the sound quality,
isn't it?

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.460
So next time you buy a shotgun microphone,
make sure and buy all

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.510
the accessories.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.710
If you're going to film outside, they're a
must.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.770
Good
luck out there.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.750
This is Kyle saying goodbye.
