00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.760
Morning! I am at the gym right now and I
want to share with you the solution that

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.399
I came up with to created and iPad holder for a

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:17.169
stationary bicycle,

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:17.879
treadmill

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:20.339
or stair master. If you're like me,

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:24.699
I'd like to preoccupy my mind when I'm
at the gym during my cardio sessions

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:25.879
every morning

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:30.219
and I used like to read the newspaper
but I stop the newspaper once my wife

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:33.560
got me this iPad because I said, I just gotta start
watching

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.460
videos and

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.270
reading magazines and even the paper

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.870
and consuming digital content

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.800
with this instead but as you can see I'm here on the treadmill I liked to go on a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.910
very steep incline

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.540
and I can't really hold this and
hold the iPad at the same time. Now

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.720
some gyms have that great little
plastic holder where you can slot it in for a magazine

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.030
or book but

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.390
this gym didn't, I couldn't find any in Singapore.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.030
So the situation I face was how can I
come up with this iPad holder using

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.760
just the things that I bring to the gym
which is this water botter which

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.240
conveniently has this clip on the end and my
iPad. So I realize that my first

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.580
gen iPad is rather heavy but it's

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.450
pretty much the same weight as this
water bottle and

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.380
if there was some way I could attach the water
bottle to the other hand, I could just fold

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.170
this over on

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.689
the treadmill or stationary bike

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:32.740
display

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.510
console and it would balance and then my hand would be free to slide on the iPad

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.390
or just swing when I workout, whatever.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.960
So I went to Daiso which is a two dollar store here in Singapore. They have dollar

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.140
stores in the States and even in China they have ten Renminbi stores

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.740
so you can find

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.580
stationary things really cheaply.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.330
I went to the stationary area in Daiso
and found this brown book end that

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.470
conveniently has these two holes here

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.510
and it slides right

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.239
into where the paper

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.089
can go in the iPod. Then I found these
rings

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:20.089
in the other part of the stationary area
and these

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:23.959
rings, just slot them into the holes, I just use three of them. I got the size that was big enough 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.510
to where I could create a sort-of triangular

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.259
system

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.999
because I want the water bottle to
be weighted in the very center of the iPad

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:34.389
so

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:41.389
it would be nice and balance

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.149
and wallah!

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:46.579
One thing to note is I like you to do my half hour cardio sessions without

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.719
taking any water during them and then at
the end, reward myself and have my water

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.809
then.

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:56.009
Quite convenient, you can watch videos, read

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:00.739
then have your hands free. Hopefully you have
found this video useful. If you have any

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.999
questions whatsoever, just comment and I'll go ahead

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:07.819
and respond back and if you have a
solution other than this, I'd love

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.299
to see it, do a video response.
