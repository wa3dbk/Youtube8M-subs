WAKE UP GUYS!

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.440
The title of this episode "Wake Up Guys!" is a bit

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.460
provocative. Often we are too focused

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.320
on the theoretical technical move and on our thoughts while skiing and we are not able 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.080
to use the dexterity that we could leverage on.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:04.920
"Wake Up" means that we should try to be prompt and ready, without worrying too much about the correctness

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.680
or to look for the technical perfection based on our learning.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:24.460
Just few meters of slope, a small skilift, a comb of short gates are enough to have a lot of fun.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.400
This really wakes us up, because trying and trying again we can "stay in".

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.980
We can experiment different paths.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.140
In this case there are 3 aligned tufts

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.700
and other 3 shifted. Then the pattern is repeated.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.940
This allows to turn with a ground shifting

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.860
following this longer turn

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.660
Here leftwards.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.660
Here rightwards.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.960
We will carry out this excercise with more and more

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.860
speed, until reaching the maximum,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.600
so to raise our limits in the next runs.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.660
The same can be done in every kind of route

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.200
We can also make mistakes! Here, for example,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.700
I miss the coordination, missing the arms

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.700
and the feet, when arms miss coordination, cannot proceed.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.040
Paolo is great in remaining in the path biting the bullet.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.880
Here a very easy comb, carried out first turning a lot

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.080
around the tufts, and then trying to find the shortest line.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.140
This is a direct line, where feet turn extremely fast.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.420
The speed of the feet looking for direction

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.020
and calling the muscles to contract and decontract

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.580
on the basis of the rhythms that we have decided

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:11.200
is one of the most important elements to be always ready to change our rhythms during the run.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.460
This becomes very important in poor visibility conditions

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.420
because in this way the skier is much more ready to face any hitch.
