"Oxygenating Blood With
Nitrate-Rich Vegetables"

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.690
It's great that we can improve athletic
performance eating a few beets,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.590
but so what if you run 5% faster?

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.720
It can be a fun experiment
to eat a can of beets

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.580
and maybe shave a
minute off your 5k time.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.440
But these are the people
who could really benefit

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.160
from a more efficient use of oxygen:
those suffering from emphysema.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.010
Yeah, young healthy adults
eating greens and beets

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.590
can swim, run, and cycle
faster and farther,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.420
but what about those who get out
of breath just walking up the stairs?

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.760
Do nitrate-rich vegetables
work where it counts?

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.650
Yes, significantly extended time

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.910
on the treadmill after
two shots of beet juice.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.280
It's great that beet
juice can decrease

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.910
blood pressures in
young healthy adults,

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.670
but what about in those who really
need it, older overweight subjects?

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.149
Just one shot of beet juice a day
versus berry juice as a control,

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.960
and in a few weeks a significant
drop in blood pressure.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.710
But within just a few
days after stopping

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.239
after three weeks
of beeting themselves up,

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.380
blood pressures went back up.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.270
So we have to eat our vegetables
and keep eating our vegetables.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.520
Why did it take until
2015 to publish a study

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.450
on lowering blood pressure in
people with high blood pressure?

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.679
You'd think that'd be
the first group to try it on.

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.889
Who's going to fund it,
though — Big Beet?

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:29.909
Blood pressure medications rake in
more than $10 billion dollars a year.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.619
You can't make billions on beets.

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.229
But that's why we have charities
like the British Heart Foundation,

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.979
which funded a study to give
folks with high blood pressure

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.670
a cup of beet juice
a day for four weeks.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.579
After all, high blood pressure
may be the #1 risk factor

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.969
for premature death in the world.

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.779
In ten years it could affect nearly
one in three adults on this planet.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.369
But put them on beet juice
and blood pressures dropped

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.200
and kept dropping until it
was stopped after a month.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.090
With so many people with high blood
pressure even despite treatment,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.689
an additional strategy, based on the
intake of nitrate-rich vegetables,

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.249
may prove to be both
cost-effective, affordable,

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:12.510
and favorable for a public health
approach to hypertension.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.220
What about those with
peripheral artery disease?

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.780
Tens of millions with atherosclerotic
clogs impairing blood flow to their legs,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.190
which can cause a cramping pain
in the calves called claudication

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.660
due to lack of blood flow
through the blocked arteries,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.630
severely limiting one's ability
to even just walk around,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.310
but just drink some beet
juice and walk 18% longer.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.560
Now this is really neat;
I've never seen this before.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.610
They measured the actual oxygenation
of their blood within their calf muscle.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.630
Placebo's in white; beet is in black,
showing how they were able to maintain

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.050
more oxygen in their muscles
with just vegetables.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.730
The nitric oxide from vegetable nitrates
not only improves oxygen efficiency

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.120
but oxygen delivery by
vasodilating blood vessels,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.030
opening up arteries so
there's more blood flow.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.400
I’m surprised beet 
juice companies

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.320
aren’t trying to position 
themselves as veggie Viagra.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.860
It could certainly explain why
those eating more veggies

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.940
have such improved
sexual function,

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.210
though this study was
a snapshot in time,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.290
so you can't tell which came first.
However, it seems more reasonable

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.710
that low fruit and vegetable consumption
contributes to erectile dysfunction,

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.130
rather than the other way around.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.260
What about the most
important organ, the brain?

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.150
Poor cerebral perfusion – lack of
blood flow and oxygen in the brain –

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.600
is associated with cognitive
decline and dementia,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.840
and they showed that
the nitrate in vegetables

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.030
may be beneficial in treating
age-related cognitive decline.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.960
They showed a direct
effect of dietary nitrate

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.870
on cerebral blood flow
within the frontal lobes,

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.990
the areas particularly
compromised by aging.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.490
This is a critical brain area for
so-called executive function,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.569
basic task and problem solving,
important for day-to-day functioning.

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.959
The nitrite from nitrate
has been shown

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.569
to not just increase blood
flow to certain areas of the body,

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.230
but also acts preferentially
in low oxygen conditions,

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.410
allowing it to increase blood flow

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.400
precisely in the areas where
it's needed the most.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.509
And that's what they
found in the brain:

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.880
increased blood flow to the
at-risk areas of the aging brain.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.710
And the only side effect
of beeting your brains out?

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.000
A little extra color in your life.
