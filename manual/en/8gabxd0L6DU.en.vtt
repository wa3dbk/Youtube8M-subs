Hello HikariKnight here.
In this video i will show you how to

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.410
allocate more memory to the RuneScape
Client on Mac OSX.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:25.750
First you go to your Utilities folder
and you open the Terminal.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:32.480
The reason we are going to use the
terminal for this is because of an issue

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:43.150
 with the TextEdit application
on Mac OSX Lion and Mountain Lion.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:52.770
The issue is that if you open a file through
TextEdit on the terminal it will tell you

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.760
that you do not have permission to open
it.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:03.530
So instead of making 2 tutorials, we
make 1

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.010
which is identical on
all versions of Mac.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:43.290
So first off you type in "nano /Applications/
RuneScape.app/Contents/Info.plist"

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.960
And then press ENTER and you will see 
something like this.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.990
Use the arrow keys to go to the bottom of
the file and you should see something

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:05.900
like
&lt;string&gt;-Xmx256m&lt;/string&gt;

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:15.640
What you should do is change the
numbers

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:31.250
to something higher, we suggest 512
this will allocate at least 512mb of memory

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:43.540
to the java binary and will help
solve several issues like the client

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.210
just randomly crashing, 
once you have written that you

00:02:50.210 --> 00:03:10.940
press CTRL o and press enter to save the
changes and then press CTRL x to exit

00:03:10.940 --> 00:04:23.040
the editor. *end of guide*
*me just showing the result now*
