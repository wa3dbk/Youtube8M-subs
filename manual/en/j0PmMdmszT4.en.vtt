Hi, this is Karen for Expert Village. Now
let's separate the eggs. You can separate

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:15.339
the eggs by cracking them open and very carefully
pulling the shell apart holding the yolk in

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:22.500
one shell and then just transfer the yolk
to the other shell letting the egg white drop

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.369
into a clean bowl. You want to make sure that
the bowl is absolutely clean and free from

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:35.440
any grease or fat and you don't want any of
that yolk to get in there. And you can save

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:46.550
the yolk over there, you may want to crack
your eggs into a separate bowl in case an

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:57.379
egg yolk breaks and you'll avoid getting the
egg yolk into white and ruining all your whites.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.449
Another way you can separate the eggs is just
to drop it into your hand and let the yolk

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:15.020
fall through your fingers like this, the white
will just fall right through your fingers

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:25.470
and the yolk stays in tack.
The trick is opening that egg very carefully

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:35.270
so that you don't pierce the yolk and get
all that white. If any yolk gets into the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:43.560
white and if it's only a tiny bit sometimes
you can take just a paper napkin and do this

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.490
and soak up, any little tiny bit of yolk.
But you want to make sure that you get every

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.060
bit of yolk out of there, if you get a lot
of yolk in your whites, then you're best just

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.100
discarding the whites and starting over again,
because any yolk in that white will cause

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.869
the white not to whip up.
