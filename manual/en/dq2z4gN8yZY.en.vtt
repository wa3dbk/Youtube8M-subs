Hi I am Dave and today I am going to answer
your questions about pistons. The most common

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.060
question we hear regarding pistons centers
around piston material. Basically, what is

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.210
the difference between a cast and forged piston?
Well the difference mainly lies within the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.230
manufacturing process. With a cast piston
you basically melt down aluminum or alloy

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.879
and then poor it into a mold and quickly cool
it. With a forged piston, they start with

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.639
a lump of aluminum or alloy and then stamp
the piston directly out of that material.

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:44.579
So what are the advantages to each? Well a
cast piston is generally more affordable,

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.859
lighter in weight and often plenty ample for
street applications. A forged piston is typically

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:56.129
much stronger than a cast piston and we recommend
those for a high horsepower or higher rpm

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.519
applications. So when exactly do you need
to step up to a forged piston? There really

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.550
isn't a threshold you need to cross in order
to step up to a forged piston but if you are

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.870
going be running high boost, high rpm or high
horsepower on your engine, your definitely

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.170
going to want to air on the side of caution
and step up to a forged piston. Another question

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.940
we hear quite often is what are hypereutectic
pistons and how do they differ from cast pistons?

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.620
Hypereutectic pistons are a nice mid-level
compromise between cast and forged pistons.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.730
During the casting process a silicone mix
is added to the molten aluminum before cooling,

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.810
this silicon gives the pistons increased strength
and improved thermal characteristics so there

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.010
is not as much thermal expansion during engine
operation. This allows you to run much tighter

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.970
tolerances. If you have a question regarding
pistons or any other high performance related

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.970
