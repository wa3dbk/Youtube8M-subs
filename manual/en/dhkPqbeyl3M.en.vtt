00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.879
Hi, I'm Ashli, and I'm currently attending
a 600-hour Esthetics program at Spa Tech Institute

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:15.250
in Ipswich, Massachusetts. On November 15,
I'll complete my 600-hour program so I can

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.240
license in almost any state.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.100
I decided to go into skin care because I've
always been interested in it, and

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.869
I had a lot of questions before I started. So, what
I'm hoping to do with this video is to educate

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.869
you on the basic steps in your skin care ritual.
I know when you go to the store, there's a

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.269
lot of question about products, which is better,
which is worse, but hopefully I can walk

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:35.430
you through some of that.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.620
Before we get started, there's some basic
science that you need to understand about your skin.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.140
You have a natural pH of 4.5 to
5.5, and it's really important to keep your

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.960
skin healthy and happy. When that pH becomes
upset, that's when you start having problems

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.579
like dryness or acne. So again, the better
able you are to keep that pH neutral, the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.149
better the condition your skin is going to
be in. So here are me and some of my friends

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.009
to educate you on that.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.100
No !!!!!!

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.470
So cleansing is the first step in your daily
care routine. You want to make sure that you're

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.830
doing this twice a day with a gentle pH balanced
cleanser. Bar soaps aren't going to do anything

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.750
but dry your skin out, and they're going to
exacerbate problems that you might already

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.920
have, like acne.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.220
I really like this Earth Science brand. It's
really gentle. It has a lot of natural ingredients,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.280
and this one also contains hyaluronic acid,
which is anti-aging and also has healing benefits.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.770
Make sure you look at the ingredients in the
products that you're using, because many of

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.490
them will contain ingredients like lots of
alcohols that are really just going to dry your skin out

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.750
Toning is the second step in your daily care
routine. It should be done twice a day after

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.280
you cleanse, use a mask, or use an exfoliant.
And the purpose of toning is to really keep

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.310
the pH of your skin neutral. This is important
because it's going to add to the overall health

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.160
of your skin, and it's also going to protect
the acid mantle. You want to make sure that

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.690
you apply it with either a cotton pad or a
cotton round, and you apply it directly to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.740
your skin. You should never rinse it off.
It has to remain on your face.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.060
Now, there's a big difference between an astringent
and a toner. A toner is just really gentle,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.530
and again, it's just going to keep the pH
of your skin neutral, and it's also going

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.930
to add to the overall health of your face.
You should use this

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.860
if you have normal, dry or sensitive skin.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.250
An astringent is better if you have oily skin
because it's more alcohol based. If you use

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.980
an astringent when you have any other type
of skin other than oily or a combination,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.940
it's just going to add to problems that you're
already having. So basically, the point of

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.170
toner is to keep the peace on your face, and
here's Alyssa to talk about how toning kept

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.140
the peace on her face.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:57.320
It was the summer of 2009. War was breaking
out all over my forehead.  Oil had caused abrasions,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:04.320
and toner had brought new peace to all the
inflammation. You dig?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.440
[SOUND OF ELECTRIC SHAVER]

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.580
Excuse me. Did you moisturize?

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.140
I don't ever moisturize.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.040
Moisturizing's for everybody.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.420
Even this guy!

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.260
Moisturizing is the third step in your daily
care routine. Now, a lot of people think that

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.460
if you have skin problems like acne, moisturizing
is just going to add to the problem. But that's

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.350
not true because a lot of problems can actually
be worsened by not moisturizing.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.850
You want to make sure you use a product appropriate
to your skin type, and products that are gentle

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.840
with extra vitamins and nutrients are even
better. I like this Calendula skin repair cream

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.720
Because Calendula is anti-inflammatory,
it's healing, and it's also hydrating.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.840
Hey, everybody! Let's go to the beach! I've
never been there before!

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.850
I'm so excited!

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.190
Let's go. Do we got that sunscreen?

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.200
No, but we have baby oil.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.870
Oh, yeah.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.870
It's even better.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.100
Keep the tan on for all the babes. Yes, I'm
so exited.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.270
OK, let's go. I'll trust you. Never done this before.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.730
We've all heard it a thousand times, wear
sunscreen! But it's really important to do so

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.310
Because sun damage can be pretty much
irreversible without costly services.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.600
Now, this should be the last step in your daily
care routine. You want to make sure that you

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.940
apply sunscreen every day before you go out
into the sun, and if you're going to be sweating

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.570
or if you're going to be swimming, you want
to make sure that you reapply throughout the day

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.760
When you get your sunscreen, make sure that
it's broad spectrum, and it also should contain

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.570
only two active ingredients. That's titanium
oxide and zinc oxide. You think you can go

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.900
to the store and just by any old sunscreen,
but that's not necessarily true.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.540
Research has proven that many of the active ingredients
in sunscreen now can actually harm your skin.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.060
I really like this Daily Defense Ultimate
Preventative Moisturizer. It's an SPF 35,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.350
and it's also broad spectrum. You also want
to make sure as a last condition that you

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.430
don't rely on just the sunscreen in your moisturizer
or in your makeup, because that's just not going to do it

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.610
Hey, Alyssa, you doing something new with
your face? It's looking kind of red.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.050
I'm trying out this new exfoliate. It's supposed
to give me this rosy glow, but if anything,

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.570
I'm feeling more agitation.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:23.570
That doesn't sound good. You should probably
get that looked at.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.720
Exfoliating is the final step in your skin
care routine. You shouldn't do this every

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.639
day, only two to three times a week depending
on your skin condition. Exfoliating helps

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.690
to break off the dead skin cells that are
on your face, which gives you a much healthier

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.150
glow, but it also helps your product to penetrate
deeper because it can get through all those

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.199
dead skin cells on your face.

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.910
When you look for an exfoliator, look for
something that's gentle and where the beads

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.710
will actually break up. Jojoba's really good
for that. I personally prefer an exfoliator

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.169
that I make at home using apple cider vinegar,
green tea, sugar, and honey.

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.160
Now, apple cider vinegar is naturally an exfoliator, and it
helps to soften your skin as well.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.860
Honey is moisturising and healing, and green tea has
antioxidants in it. Sugar is a great exfoliator,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.830
especially brown sugar, because it's natural
and it's cheap. So I recommend trying that at home.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.220
Anyway, good luck on your skin care.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.610
Thanks a lot for watching my video. I hope
that had some laughs. We definitely had a

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.910
lot while we were making it. I also hope that
you learned something from this video, and

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.419
that you're going to be better able to take
care of your skin, and you'll be more confident

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.220
in your regimens. I really appreciate the
support, and especially the help that I got

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.419
from Shelby, Alyssa, Kelsey, and Phil today.
If you have any questions, feel free to message

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.350
me on my Facebook, and I'll be happy to answer 
them to the best of my knowledge.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.350
Thanks &amp; good luck
