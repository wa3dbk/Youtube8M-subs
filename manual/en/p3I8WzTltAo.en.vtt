00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.430
Soldiers in the 18th century were given rations
of meat, either pork or beef, salt or fresh.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.460
Something else that they were given sometimes
was fish, salted fish. So here we’ve got

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.960
some salted cod we’re going to cook up into
a very simple yet delicious meal.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.200
We’ve chosen salted fish today, because
it’s something you can take to an event

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.370
that doesn’t need to be refrigerated or
cooled. You can make an 18th century dish

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.610
with it and it’s something you can also
purchase locally. If you go to a good grocery

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.820
store you’re probably going to find these
little wooden boxes in the fish section, very

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.649
similar to what they had in the 18th century.
The salted fish right out of the box is much

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.259
too salty to cook with. It needs to be soaked
to draw the salt out so the day before you

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.299
want to use it, you want to start soaking
this. You want to change the water 3 or 4

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.779
times and then after it’s soaked overnight
it should be ready to use.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.720
So we’ve gone ahead and done some preparation
here. I’ve taken about 6 ounces of the cod

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.509
and we’ve shredded it up into little pieces
and I also have some potatoes that I’ve

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.469
already boiled up so that they’re just soft
enough to mash.

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:38.329
I’ve got about the same amount of potatoes
here in the bowl as I do fish in a bowl over

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:45.719
there. We want about equal amounts and we
want this mashed up nicely so it will mix

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.319
in with your fish and the fish, something
you have to remember about the fish is, number

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.029
one, it may have bones or skin and if as you’re
tearing it up you find that there are any

00:01:55.029 --> 00:02:00.310
bones and skin, you want to discard that.
Also, you can soak it too long. If you soak

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.740
it too long it’ll remove all the flavor
and all the saltiness from the fish so you

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.680
want to taste it and make sure that it’s
not tasteless before you use it or else you’re

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.599
going to have to add some spices to bring
that flavor back.

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:24.750
Now let’s take out 1 egg and put that into
our potatoes and then we’ll mix it in with our fish.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.000
If potatoes weren’t available, it’s likely
they would have tried to use bread crumbs

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.860
or possibly flour as a good substitute for
the potatoes. You want to make sure that your

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.880
butter is nice and hot. Let’s see how we’re
doing here.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.780
Well, these of course were popular. They look
like a great breakfast thing. Of course they’d

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.250
be eaten all day long. Let’s see how these
turned out.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:33.540
I’m going to cook up the rest of these.
Mmm. All the utensils and all the clothing

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.490
you’ve seen here in the video today, it
can all be seen on our website or in our print
