00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.500
My turn, we had a question come in from someone
who's using Super Coder so they're doing some

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.280
research and they came across some statements
on this particular article.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:29.330
Let me see if I can pull that up successfully.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:37.679
This is SuperCoder.com, if you go to CodingCertification.Org/supercoder
that will talk you to their page with different

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.360
pricing information.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.140
But this is a very good encoder, one of my
favorites.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.519
I like SuperCoder and FindACode, and there's
a third where I'm going to be doing a review

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:55.559
of my three favorites so people can see how
I use them.

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.929
We met them at a conference, did we not, for
the first time?

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.000
Yes, she's a great gal.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Yup.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Jenny came over.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.620
And I love Super Coder; they had a great booth
there.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.680
Down on the bottom, it's talking about these
two codes.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.370
This is what she's talking about this statement
here.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.210
Let me show you in the answer sheet how we
work this out.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.040
On the bottom of the page where I just showed
you, the scenario describes both impedance

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.000
and pH test being performed in one session.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.939
"If you think coding it is as easy as billing
91038 and 91034, you're wrong."

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.040
-- So she's quoting the article.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.220
"Dodge a potential audit by looking into another
important factor CCI Edits..."

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.500
It goes on to talk about these two codes.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.880
She is confused by the articles.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.800
What I want to do is show you I do CCI Edit
kind of research for myself to see if there's

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.200
a bundling issue and how I chose which code
to report.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:09.100
So, I'm going to grab these two codes and
I'm going to back to my SuperCoder.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:17.879
Up on the top when you pay for this, you'll
get things like CCI Edit Checker.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.480
You just go in and in this box, you put in
your codes and you need to separate them by

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:34.310
a comma instead of the word "and" and you
just click on "validate".

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:44.249
So, here's the two codes, 91038 and 91034.

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.950
We've got this red big flag.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.219
So this is telling me, "Nah-ah, I'm not going
to get away with coding both."

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:58.989
So, I'm going to read what the box says and
it says, "The 91038 is a column two code for

00:02:58.989 --> 00:02:59.989
91034.

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.450
These codes cannot be billed together in any
circumstance.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.540
Code 91038 is bundled into 91034.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.150
Code 91038 cannot be billed with 91034."

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.390
Basically what I do is I look at the RVUs.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.989
This one is worth 14.50 RVUs.

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.400
This one is worth 5.93.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.379
So, depending on where you live and whatever,
this gets multiplied times a conversion factor

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:28.750
to come up with the dollar amount.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.010
The higher the RVU, the more money the code
is worth.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.290
I normally, when I have between two codes,
we'll go with the higher code, the 91038 because

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.670
it's worth 14.50 RVUs.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.670
That's what you're looking for.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.680
If your documentation sounds like it supports
both, and you pop up both of those codes into

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.359
your CCI Edit Checker and it comes up as you
can't bill both of them together, then bill

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.609
the more comprehensive one.

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.389
So, the smaller or lesser RVU one is the one
that's bundled into it.

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.849
Let me go back to the rest of my answer.

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.930
So this is what she was struggling with.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.660
I just kind of comparing the two codes here
to see visually what they share in common,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.970
so in green, I did that.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.470
They both say gastroesophageal reflux test
with nasal catheter.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.919
They both say recording analysis and interpretation.

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:37.030
The 038 code, the higher RVU one is called
an esophageal function test and it's little,

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.729
apparently more involved that talk about greater
than one hour, etc.

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:47.599
So, if your documentation supports greater
than one hour etc., then go with the 91038

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.169
and do not report the 91034.

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:57.320
Or else you would be violating the CCI Edit.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.729
This sentence here should be reversed.

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.169
Check out the CCI Edit's table and you'll
see 91034 described as the more extensive

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.169
code.

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.470
It actually should say 91038 is the more extensive
code.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.380
So I can see why that would have tripped someone
up.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:23.720
So focus on the RVU values and you just need
to ask yourself: Does my documentation support

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.800
the higher RVU one?

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:47.639
If that's the case, then go ahead and report
that and forego the lesser RVU one.
