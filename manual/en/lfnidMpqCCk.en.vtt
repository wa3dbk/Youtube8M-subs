JOE WILES: We're going to take a look at number
49 which is Jimi Hendrix's Purple Haze. This

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.420
song begins on the 6th fret of your E string.
Here is your pinky on the 8th fret of your

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.450
D string. We're going to skip the string in
between. We're going to go back and forth

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:22.300
between those. It sounds like this.
Not much to it, okay. The next bit, we're

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.990
going to slide our ring finger into the 9th
fret of the D string, index finger on the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:37.120
7th fret of the G string, middle finger on
the 8th fret of the B string and give it a

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.770
little bend. Bring our index finger back down
to the 7th fret of the D string. That riff

00:00:44.770 --> 00:01:01.920
together sounds like this. Again, the answer
riff comes down here. I'm going to use my

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.570
pinky and ring finger, slide up for the 3rd
fret of the A and D strings up to the 5th

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.320
fret.
And then, I'm going to slide my ring finger

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.900
from the 5th fret on the A string to the 7th
fret, okay. That riff starts out by plucking

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:37.140
the D string and sliding in. Again, pay attention
to this hand on the picking.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:02:01.410
Those three sections put together, sound like
this.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.950
In our next segment, we're going to talk about
"Brain Stew" by Green Day.
