00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:09.060
Do my new windows or doors cause
condensation?

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.559
The simple answer this question is no.
When condensation forms

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.710
you might think that it's the window's fault,
after all that's where the moisture is.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.250
However this is not the case, in fact
condensation is a sign that windows and

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.550
doors are doing their job.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.140
replacing drafting windows and doors
reduces airflow in your home

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.980
making it tighter. Tighter homes actually
retain more humidity.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.460
Before you replaced your windows, dryer,
colder cool air used to leak in your

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.890
home

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.700
and mixed with the warmer more humid
inside air. This lowered the overall

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.289
relative humidity of the air in your
home. Your new draft-free windows have

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.930
actually caused the humidity level to rise
in your home.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.980
How does condensation form?

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.219
Condensation forms when colder, cool
surfaces like Windows

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.730
chill the adjacent humid air, and the
water vapor in that air changes back to

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:59.500
liquid water.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.989
in very cold climates the interior glass,
metal or plaster surface can get so cold

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.000
that the condensation turns into ice or
frost.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.670
Condensation on either the interior or
exterior paint is normal,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.869
especially when the interior and
exterior temperatures and humidity are

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:14.990
far apart.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.850
To put it another way in the summer when
you pull something cold and refreshing

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.860
out of the refrigerator

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.150
the air is warm and humid. That cold and
refreshing beverage container suddenly

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.970
becomes wet

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.579
just as soon as it is exposed to the air. What
has happened is that the temperature of the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.140
container fresh from the refrigerator is
below the dew point temperature of the air

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.450
which is caused by condensation on the
outside of that container. Can I reduce the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.990
condensation on my windows?

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.470
Yes. In order to reduce condensation
humidity levels in the home must be

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.240
controlled and air movement must be
generated.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.020
What steps can I take to reduce the
humidity in my home? Use exhaust fans in

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.700
your kitchen,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.530
laundry and bathrooms, vent gas burners
clothes dryers and other appliances to

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.409
the outdoors.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.640
Shut off furnace humidifiers and other humidifying 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.689
devices in your home. Also a
dehumidifier can help dry out the air.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.090
Be sure that the ventilating louvers in your
attic, basement or crawl spaces are open

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.319
and amply sized. Open fireplace dampers
to allow an escape route for moisture

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.050
laden air.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.050
Air out your house a few minutes each
day.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.080
