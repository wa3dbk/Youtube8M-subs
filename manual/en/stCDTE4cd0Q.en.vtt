00:00:02.413 --> 00:00:06.018
It is now time to fill the wall openings with doors and windows.

00:00:06.403 --> 00:00:11.426
Actually, there are no windows in this particular layout, only pivot and sliding doors.

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:15.623
The process of building doors and windows is pretty much the same though.

00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:21.161
It is also covered in another tutorial named "Working with AEC Objects".

00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:24.888
To create a door, first zoom in on an opening.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:32.081
Next enable the Snap tool, either on the main toolbar or by pressing the S hotkey.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.050
Right-click the snap tool and make sure it is only set to Endpoint mode.

00:00:39.086 --> 00:00:43.176
From the Create panel, choose Geometry &gt; Doors.

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:45.563
Click the Pivot button.

00:00:46.106 --> 00:00:53.251
A door (or a window) is created by first defining a width, then a depth, then a height.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.140
The width is defined by using a click and drag and using the snap tool on the walls around the opening.

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.104
You can then use the snap tool again to define the depth with a simple click,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.930
and the height with yet another click.

00:01:11.877 --> 00:01:16.451
In the Modify panel, you can make the necessary adjustments to the door.

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:20.489
Start by opening it a bit, to see its direction,

00:01:21.237 --> 00:01:26.494
then adjust parameters such as Flip Swing or Flip Hinge as you see fit.

00:01:27.197 --> 00:01:31.362
For the entrance, you can even opt for a double door.

00:01:34.044 --> 00:01:38.132
Right-click the gray area next to the main toolbar and choose Layers.

00:01:38.662 --> 00:01:44.262
Notice the Layers list: you have four layers with the 3D prefix incoming from AutoCAD.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.360
You also have Layer 0 which is the default layer and is set current at this time.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.310
Therefore any new objects you create such as the entrance door lies now on Layer 0.

00:01:57.012 --> 00:02:02.452
In the spirit of proper layer management, you ought to have a separate layer for doors and windows.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.450
With the door still selected, click the Create New Layer button on the Layers toolbar.

00:02:09.132 --> 00:02:12.467
Give the new layer a name, such as 3D-Doors.

00:02:13.138 --> 00:02:20.205
Notice the Move Selection to New Layer option. This ensures the current door is moved to the 3D-Doors layer.

00:02:21.017 --> 00:02:25.372
Click OK. A new layer is created and the door is now on that layer.

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:27.615
Deselect the door.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.123
Make sure the new 3D-Doors layer is current and take a moment and create other interior doors where you need them.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.240
Adjust them to your liking.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.030
For the closets, use Bifold instead of Pivot doors.

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:30.241
When you're done, take a pause before creating the balcony doors.

00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:34.994
Interior doors are usually of a uniform color, or texture.

00:03:35.496 --> 00:03:40.016
Most are painted white whereas others are made of maple or oak.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.070
This means you can easily create a simple Standard material based either on a Diffuse color or map,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.350
select all doors using the Select all Objects in Current Layer button,

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.209
and apply the newly created material to the selection.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:04.852
All doors turn white according to the diffuse color chosen in this instance.

00:04:05.386 --> 00:04:08.222
The exterior sliding doors are different however.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:16.730
Their creation process is exactly the same but these patio doors are typically based on a metal structure with glazing.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:26.800
This means you can't apply a simple Standard material to them; otherwise, they will be totally opaque.

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:30.919
Instead, you use a Multi/Sub-Object material.

00:04:31.607 --> 00:04:37.444
All doors and windows have default material IDs. There are five sub-materials in total.

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:44.257
Most importantly, polygons representing glazing are always on Material ID #3.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:54.560
Other polygons, representing Front, Back, Door Frames and Bevel faces are on IDs #1, 2, 4 and 5 respectively.

00:04:55.692 --> 00:05:02.900
Most often with patio doors, the metal part is made of the same material or color, usually painted aluminum.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.910
In that case, IDs #1, 2, 4 &amp; 5 are based on the same material.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.720
To see this better, create a Multi/Sub-Object material based on five sub-materials.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.750
Apply the newly created material to the three patio doors.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.900
Create a semi-transparent Standard material, 

00:05:52.355 --> 00:05:55.148
and link it to the third channel.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.220
The glazing is now transparent.

00:06:07.165 --> 00:06:12.838
Create another Standard material based on a shiny bronze or brown diffuse color, 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.328
and instance it to the remaining four channels.

00:06:22.873 --> 00:06:26.195
The patio doors now look more convincing.

00:06:30.036 --> 00:06:33.543
If some faces still appear dark, you may need a refresh.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.600
Simply select a door and pan the view a bit to let the viewport's "Realistic" mode refresh itself.

00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:46.239
In the next and final movie, you'll use Polygon Modeling techniques to build the curtain wall.
