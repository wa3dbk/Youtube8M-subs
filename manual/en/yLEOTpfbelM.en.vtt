- True.

00:01:17.102 --> 00:01:20.534

00:01:35.482 --> 00:01:37.563
participate in research?

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:41.558
- Ooh, I'd say about maybe 20 percent.

00:01:41.558 --> 00:01:42.981
- Little bit higher.

00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:44.001

00:01:58.174 --> 00:02:00.463
And, I'll tell you the
answer is in pounds,

00:02:00.463 --> 00:02:03.683
so that's what we're looking at.

00:02:03.683 --> 00:02:04.619
