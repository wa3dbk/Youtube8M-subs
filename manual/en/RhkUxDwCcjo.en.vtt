Hello my name is Melissa and on behalf of
Expert Village today we´re going to be talking

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.770
about how to prevent a cavity and how to save
your smile. In this clip let´s talk about

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.990
how to prevent a cavityby using mouth wash.
Now there are so many dfferent types and brands

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.919
of mouth wash on the market, there should
be no excuse that you don´t use mouth wash.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:26.119
Interestingly enough there is, many dentists
will say to finish with mouth wash, I personally

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.550
after 30 years cavity free and more than 30
years actually cavity free, I start with the

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.300
mouth waesh because I like to start off honestly
with a clean mouth or cleaner than just brushing

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.929
your teeth because the best part I think is,
you use the mouth wash, you get rid of all

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:49.290
the bacteria that´s on the surface at least,
so your toothbrush can get even deeper. It

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.140
doesn´t have to worry about all that, especially
if you been eating something like chocolate

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.699
or you´ve been eating something that´s relly
sticking to your teeth, like candy or caramel.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.679
All of that substances that bacteria really
likes to grab onto, that doesn´t wash away

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:10.320
easily. So I think starting off with some
sort or form of mouth wash like a listerine

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.260
product in the beginning is the way to go,
and again there are so many different types

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.790
of mouth wash. You´ve got Advancless dream
plus that can keep your teeth whiter, they

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.850
put extra things in to whiten them. The big
thing with mouth wash: Don´t swallow it,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.710
not a good idea to swallow it though. We´ve
got Fresh Butz Listerine, we´ve got Cool

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.810
Citrus, there are evenb whitening listerines
that you startoff. This one does say to, it´s

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.980
a pre-brush treatment but no matter what with
all the mouth washes I like to start of with

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.560
it. You can also finish with it too, but you´re
going to have a fresh mouth afterwards with

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:52.000
the toothpaste so why not start off like this?
It´s very interesting, I think, a lot of

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.450
people also water own their mouth wash. You´re
diluting it, you´re taking away all of they

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.030
goodness that this will do by diluting it.
Yes it will, not necessarily burn, but it

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.710
does tingle a little bitand also follow the
instructions. Don´t just rinse for 5 seconds

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.550
and spit it out. A good 60 seconds, one minute,
is really key when you´re using mouth wash.
