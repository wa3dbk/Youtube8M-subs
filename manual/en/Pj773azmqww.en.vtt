Hello I am Sarolta Eke. Hello I'm Tamas Kassai,
we are here on behalf of Expert Village. We

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.621
are going to show you how to dance Waltz.
Okay, let's see now how to dance this with

00:00:14.621 --> 00:00:24.220
partner. So the hold is almost the same as
used before, the man's right arm on the lady's

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:39.030
left shoulder blade and his left hand is holding
the lady's right hand and the steps are as

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:48.110
we have learned before. It's 1-2-3-2-2-3-3-2-3-4-2-3.
When we are turning to the left just keep

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.900
in mind that when you step forward, when the
man steps forward with his left leg, then

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:00.620
stay close to the lady's left leg. So don't
follow her right, but try to stay close to

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.270
the left leg and then step to the side and
when the lady is stepping forward with her

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:24.890
left leg and she's trying to stay close to
the man's left leg. 2-2-3-3-2-3-4-2-3. Once

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:46.340
more 1-2-3-2-2-3-3-2-3-4-2-3. Let's try this
step to music, 1-2-3-2-2-3-3-2-3-4-2-3, without

00:01:46.340 --> 00:02:07.249
turning 2-2-3-3-2-3-4-2-3. The closer you
are to each other, the easier it is to do.

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:12.090
1-2-3-2-2-3-3-2-3-4-2-3.
