00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.920
Genetics and imaging are both very exciting
fields. I mean, they're both brand new and

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.410
there's a lot of information in both types
of data. But it's very difficult to see what

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.070
genetic changes do to the brain. And so we
all have millions and millions of base pairs

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.240
in our genome and you can imagine asking,
"Well, how am I different from other people?

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.480
How are these genetic changes affecting my
brain and my behavior?" One of the ways that

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.480
we've done it with this Enigma project, is
we've collected 20,000 images and 20,000 genomes

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.949
and it's amazing, you can actually see effects
on the brain of single letter changes in your

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.129
genome. And that's very exciting, you know,
engineers and mathematicians can mine through

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.150
the data and try to understand what makes
a brain healthy and what makes the brain at

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.559
risk for Alzheimer's disease and other disorders.
And so often what we do is find correlations

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.830
with genes that might cause disease. And very
often we use other databases to find out what

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.100
the genes do. So if a gene causes migration
of axons you can begin to build a story about

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.940
what that gene actually does in the brain.
In translational experiments, like knockout

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.920
mice, you can look at removing the gene and
seeing if the function is lost. And so often

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.700
the imaging establishes the correlations,
it just finds a pattern of connections, but

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.460
then you go to more translation experiments
and wet lab work to really delete the gene

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.780
and see if that made any difference.
There is a gene that was discovered recently

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.729
that 1 percent of us have and it's called
Trem 2, a variant of this gene, and it doubles

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.090
your risk of Alzheimer's disease and this
was only discovered very recently and it's

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.229
very important. So if you think in the US,
that's 3 million people that carry this very

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.859
dangerous gene. So one of the things that
we were able to do with images is figure out

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:45.829
how this gene affects the brain. And what
actually happens is, it speeds up the rate

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.899
of tissue loss in the brain, so we may not
notice this and in fact while we're healthy

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.340
this is going on all the time. Now there is
a positive message in all of this, if you

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.229
could find these people that have this gene,
and you very easily genotype them and find

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.159
them, you could preferentially enroll them
in a drug trial and they could have all of

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.509
the Alzheimer's medications available today.
And you'd have much more power in finding

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.940
an effective drug in these people than if
you did a study of regular, normal people.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.330
The reason is most normal people aren't losing
brain tissue very fast, so it's really hard

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.830
to see whether a drug's working because there's
not a lot happening in the brain. So one of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.909
the positive messages with genomics is, you
can find people at risk and do something pretty

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:29.030
much straightaway. So it gives you really,
a leg up into drug trials where normally they'd

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.280
be very expensive and you could really scan
the people that are declining the fastest.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.299
The Europeans are involved in very large scale
genomic projects; the Australians we work

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.700
with are very busy collecting data from twins,
which is very informative from a genetic point

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.799
of view. So I think it keeps giving us a lot
of new insights and a lot of new information

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.629
about what's happening to the brain in research
worldwide. I think one of the benefits with

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.310
imaging is that so many people have collected
data already, that a grad student can come

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.250
into a lab and just explore images and look
at the diseases they care about and they don't

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.450
have to scan thousands of people themselves.
So it's a little bit like we're standing on

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.310
the shoulders of other people's work and it's
much more efficient.
