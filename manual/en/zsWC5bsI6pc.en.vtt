Hello, I'm Matt Cail and on behalf of Expert
Village I'm gonna show you today how to draw

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.320
a Santa Clause cartoon. Moving on into coloring,
I'm gonna quickly cover the main areas, basically

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.340
the main shades you are going to use. The
first of course, is like the skin color on

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.960
the face. You are gonna have to watch you
don't necessarily want to be too dark but

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.490
at the same time you don't want to be too
light either. Yeah, I mean Santa; he's out

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.170
there getting some sun at the North Pole.
So, it's O.K to go, you know a medium to maybe

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.120
just a touch dark shade. Now, for coloring
definitely kind of lightly almost tap in the

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.340
color. You don't necessarily want to be like
resting a pen over everything for ever. That

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.969
will result in a lot of really deep splotches
that you don't like. You want to have a big

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.039
brilliant red for all of Santa's clothes area,
his hat, coat, I mean every, every, almost

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.039
everything that is not going to be white or
black on Santa's person is going to be this

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:08.980
nice red color, big big brilliant color. We're
also gonna have blue on his bag which some

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.480
people actually like to draw on this end brown.
I like, I like the blue it's something a little

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.120
different. It's also kind of cold like the
North. Sometimes what people will do is draw

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.490
in the stretch marks in a darker blue and
will actually draw in on the main bag in a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.670
lighter blue. You can kind of choose yourself.
There's definitely a lot of options available

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.540
to you. You can also throw in some smatterings
of green, which I think they are a lot, a

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.031
lot of fun. Because you know again like green
Christmas color. So, sometimes you can maybe

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:43.520
even have like toy that is peeking out be
a green bear. Maybe he is ready for St. Patties

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.150
Day this year or something. You can also have
the patches if you'd also like being green.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:59.220
Lastly, there are the areas in black and these
areas are gonna be Santa's gloves and as well

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.360
as Santa's boots. Now on the gloves optionally,
but definitely on the boots you can have lighter

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.080
regions like kind of like to show some shine
and for that you basically kind of pick out

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.110
a rectangular region and have a little bit
of have one of the sides of it not be perfectly

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.450
straight like so and that will basically represent
like a nice sheen that this is shiny material

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.920
on Santa.
