Small PCs are continuing to evolve to meet
the varying needs of every consumer. There's

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.830
no doubt that small PCs are becoming some
of the most successful creations in the history

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.060
of computing. Apart from their tiny size,
their most compelling feature could just be

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.789
their budget-friendly prices.

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:28.350
Recently the world's first nine dollar computer
was launched as a Kickstarter project.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:35.350
This low price computer is named as CHIP,
and it is created by the company Next Thing.

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:43.109
Some are calling the $9-CHIP a Raspberry Pi
killer. Just like its competition, CHIP has

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.760
all the functions of a full computer and yet
it's only as "big" as a credit card.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.720
CHIP is equipped with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and
optional ports for HDMI and VGA. At such a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:08.360
tiny size, it's quite amazing to think that
it packs 512MB of RAM, 1 GHz processor and

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.880
4GB of storage. It's also compatible with
a light version of Debian Linux

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.060
we can use C.H.I.P. with LibreOffice to edit
spreadsheets, create word documents, or craft

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.640
The $9 C.H.I.P. comes pre-loaded with Scratch
- an easy to learn language that teaches the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.859
basics of programing by making stories, games,
and animations.

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.070
We can also play games using a Bluetooth controller

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.070
And, We can Use the Chromium browser to surf
the web. Check out websites, send emails,

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.229
watch videos, and more.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.229
C.H.I.P. comes preinstalled with dozens of
useful applications, tools and amazing games.

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:07.049
Beyond those, C.H.I.P. can run THOUSANDS of
free applications from the open source community.

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:14.939
Next Thing has also introduced the $49 Pocket
CHIP, a handheld computer that the CHIP can

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:24.700
plug into, complete with a 4.3-inch resistive
color touch screen , a 3,000 mAH battery and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.760
"clickey" keyboard.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The Pocket CHIP is not meant to replace a
smartphone, but it could bring portable computing

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.630
to the masses for a very affordable price.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.420
This is CHIP, the world's first nine dollar
computer. connect over composite

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.230

you might have noticed

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.260
CHIP looks a little different than every other
computer, because we built CHIP to

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.820
fit into your projects

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.370
