00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.799
The Dann Wine Closet Part 1. You're looking
at a photograph of the completed Dann wine

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.449
closet. This is a custom wine cellars Dallas
Texas project that we completed that used

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.099
to be a pantry of the kitchen.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.099
We're going to begin by showing you the drawings.
This is the overhead or plan view. Each elevation

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:27.730
is designated by a letter: elevation A to
the left, B to the back, C also to the back

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.189
and elevation D to the right.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.620
You can see that this wine cellar should hold
496 bottles. Upon completion Mr. Dann was

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.620
actually able to fit 514 bottles in this wine
closet.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.840
Elevation A, the left wall, is a waterfall
rack. This pantry is under the staircase so

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.429
there is a slanted ceiling on the left side.
So we follow the line of the ceiling with

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.730
the wine racks. These are all 750 bottle wine
storage.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.730
What you're seeing here is a support rack
for the back of the wine closet where the

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.690
double deep section comes out and this is
just to support the other racks above which

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.690
are not visible. You'll notice that the racking
is 13 1/2 inches deep, it has 1 1/2 inch toe

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.570
kick and base molding and we have 2 1/4 inch
crown molding at the top.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.950
Elevation B, the back wall, is a double deep
X-bin storage. It is a solid storage with

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.320
a horizontal rack above. Here is where your
horizontal display rack shows your bottles;

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.350
they are actually 3 deep in these racks, a
little table top so that Mr. Dann can set

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.350
his bottle there when storing his bottles
or choosing one for the evening.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.880
Elevation C is also a back wall. This section
here is where the ceiling is still slanting.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.410
Here we have a straight up ceiling area. This
is cut out where your grill cover and box

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:13.410
comes out from the right wall; and again you
can see we have a 13 1/2 inch rack depth.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.159
Here we have a display row, a high reveal
display row where Mr. Dann can display some

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.769
of his bottles.

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:30.569
Elevation D is the right wall. This is six-inch
deep rack because the doorway comes quite

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.349
close to this wall. These are the horizontal
display racks going all the way up and a large

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.849
grill cover and box.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.519
The grill cover and box is much larger than
usual because of the way we have to run the

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:50.519
lines for this cellar. The drain line could
not go straight down to the drain with the

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.819
gravitational flow so we have to add a condensation
pump below the cooling unit to pump the condensation

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.090
up before it could run down.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.079
This is an overhead view of the custom wine
cellars Dallas Texas showing where the doorway

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.760
is, your horizontal racks here, the grill
cover and box, individual racks on the left

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.760
and the back and the table top and the horizontal
racking on the back. This shows looking in

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.909
from the front; this is looking in from the
front as well, what the racks look like. These

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:34.909
are just some 3D views showing the racking
here and this is looking out and if there

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.849
were no roofs looking at the back going in.

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.689
I hope you've enjoyed looking at the drawings
for the Dann Wine Cellar. In the next video

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.279
I'm going to show you photos of the Wine Cellar
Builders Dallas Texas project before, during

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:53.510
and after. Click on the second video to continue.
