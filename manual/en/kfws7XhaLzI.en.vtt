00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.740
Andrew: The name just flowed. It was just
Vintage Electric. That was before even I thought

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.119
it was going to be a business. It was like,
"I want to build a vintage electric bike."

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.790
Then, bringing it around and getting people's
interest, and thinking I could actually build

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.490
them for customers, deliver, and make them
as happy as I was when I first rode mine.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.780
It was easy, just Vintage Electric.
Shea: At first impression, it's almost like

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.640
owning a witch's broom. It's like flying.
It's just free power. It's crazy. Wind in

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.440
your face, you get up to speed real fast,
and it puts a big smile on your face.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.640
Andrew: The approach we've taken with Vintage
Electric is to create an item that gets people

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.070
out of their cars, and allows them to feel
the freedom of their first bicycle, leaving

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.969
your parents' house and riding around the
block, but it brings it to an older generation

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.700
where people can hop on a bike, go down to
the coffeeshop, meet up with their friends

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.119
and ride 30, 35 miles per charge. It's really
a great commuter. You can ride to work. It

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.720
only takes an hour and a half to recharge
when you get there, and then ride right back

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.850
home.
Shea: I think we just need it to be a lot

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.350
more bicycle-aware, which is cool. I think
we're going to be a big advocate for that

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.360
in the future, and get people on the streets
in a safe manner, and make it more feasible

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.060
for people to really enjoy electric bicycles.
Andrew: We built the prototype in my parents'

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.450
garage. I was determined to beat my buddy
with his 125 gas motor with this electric

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.689
bike. Shea really helped out. He was helping
out with a lot of the welding and manufacturing

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.320
the forks and the front end stuff. It was
all really happening right in the garage.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.070
Shea: Me and Andrew teamed up. I ended up
moving all my tools, all my motorcycle stuff,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.430
all my fabrication stuff into this spot with
him. He was going to do the design side. Then,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.680
the bike thing took off, so now it's all melded
into one little piece. We use my shop, and

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.860
the design studio and everything to make a
good team, where we can all be creative, let

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.090
ideas flow, and we can build cool stuff.
Andrew: I started this thing off wanting to

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.159
design bikes. That's really what I feel that
I'm good at. This team has gathered around

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.700
me to pick up all the pieces that I leave
in the wake behind me all day long, shipping

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.000
and handling, making sure that new models
can be engineered to perfection and actually

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.440
work. It's one thing to draw it on a piece
of paper and say, "This is what I want it

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.230
to look like", but people from our team step
up and they make that a reality.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.390
Shea: It's cool to see something being up
on the wall that I've just welded, two days

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.540
later being back in a rolling chassis with
a crazy color combo or some sort of weird

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.200
anodizing going on. Things are really rolling
over here. It's cool to come in every other

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.390
day and see how much change has happened.
To put your time and energy into something

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.950
that has a lot of emotion involved in it and
to see it given back with the success of being

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.540
in Wired magazine, and BBC website. It's cool
to see all that pan out from this little idea

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.420
that has risen. I think the team we have here,
we're all on board to really see our goals

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.220
and our dreams achieved.
The main thing here is we want to bring back

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.950
that technology and that innovation that's
happening in the electric industry, and throw

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.530
it back into the bicycle. We came up with
this heat-sink aluminum box that went in there.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.989
Everything else from there was fit and finish.
We spent a lot of time looming each wire so

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.519
that it had a nice little finished piece to
it. I think just building longevity into the

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.790
product and showing that the fine details
are the most important part to us, the leather

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.810
and all the ties, all the wire routing's all
been thought out. I think that's the most

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.709
important part of doing all this. I went through
a couple of different designs. I think we've

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.140
really fine-tuned the way it is now.
Andrew: We really create these bikes and build

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.730
them from the ground up. First step in that
process would be doing all the metalwork,

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.319
so manufacturing the frames, manufacturing
the forks, milling out all the crowns. As

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.980
soon as that's done, everything gets shipped
off to powdercoat. Once it's powdercoated,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.129
everything comes back. Final assembly, gets
put together, tested, gone through a whole

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:08.129
series of tests, make sure every one is perfect
for the customer. Then, out the door it goes.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.930
I think the coolest feeling of doing this
whole Vintage Electric is dropping a bike

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.359
off. When you hand it off, it's your baby.
It's been in the shop. You've seen it, "Oh,

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.430
this color is so great." When you give it
to the customer, they're happy. That email

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.570
you get one month or two months later of how
happy they are, and the way it's worked, and

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.169
the way it's changed their lives, allowed
them to go out and do more things.

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.810
Shea: What we want to drawn on is we want
to have a quality product that lasts, that

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.280
is a strong piece that can fall off the back
of your truck, and you can get it fixed. You're

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.030
not just going to break all the plastic apart
and be like, "That's a piece of junk." We

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.990
want it to be reliable. We want it to be strong.
We want it to be something that you're going

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.530
to cherish for a long period of time.
Andrew: The idea of going back to building

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.389
and creating products that are meant to last,
something you can pass down to the next generation.

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.220
You look even at a toaster that my grandma's
had for the last 60 years. It was designed

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.610
so well. It looks great, and it still works.
I think the whole idea of planned obsolescence

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.560
is total bullshit. It shouldn't happen. It
shouldn't be around. Every product we build

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.310
should be built to last, and built to upgrade.
That's what really inspires me is always the

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.240
vintage stuff that has such quality built
into it. That's why bringing quality back

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.240
with the vintage design is important to me.
Being 22 and trying to convince people to

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:31.350
fund you, to really believe in you, you have
to work twice as hard to make people believe

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.509
that this is a real company, it's the real
deal, and we ship these bikes out to everybody.
