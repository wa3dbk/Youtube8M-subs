00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:06.479
What is a slice?

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.519
A slice is kind of the direct opposite of
a topspin stroke.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.309
If topspin the ball is rolling forward, slice
the ball is rolling backwards.

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.650
The advantage of slice is that the ball can
stay low.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.390
The disadvantage is it's not a power stroke.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.900
It's an off speed shot.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.140
It's a shot designed to make your opponent's
life a little more miserable.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.529
How do we hit it?

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.110
It's a high to low stroke as opposed to the
topspin which is low to high.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.960
So, when Joe turns, and pivots, and takes
his racket back, his racket head is above

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.960
the ball.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.710
Once he steps he swings down through the back
of the ball, not the bottom of the ball, the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.570
back side of the ball, and then he finishes
up.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.370
So, it's high to low to high again.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.399
And my face, if you'll notice, is open, because
I need to get that slice.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.699
I won't be able to slice if I'm hitting the
ball like that, with the face closed.

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.320
So, the face has to be open, and I have to
be hitting the back of the ball and then underneath

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.170
the back of the ball so I create that backspin.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.840
And the ball bounces like when you throw a
stone on a pond, and you see it skip along

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.400
the top of the pond, that's the way the ball
bounces when you hit a really good slice.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.400
Continental grip recommended for that?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.700
Continental grip is absolutely recommended.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.009
You can also hit a slice on the forehand side.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.440
It's not used that often, but sometimes in
desperation you'll see a tennis player chop

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.440
at a ball.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.270
Again, it's this high to low motion.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.770
Hitting the back of the ball and chopping
through it.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.340
And it creates that low bounce.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.509
It can also be used on a shot called the drop
shot where you hit a tremendous amount of

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.429
backspin very soft and high.

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.899
The ball goes slowly, but it's spinning violently.

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.129
It bounces and can even bounce back towards
you, because the spin is spinning towards

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:52.129
you.

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:56.020
When you first start to hit slices, if the
ball's going too high you're hitting the bottom

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.030
of the ball instead of the back of the ball.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.729
So, to hit the effective slice, slice through
the back of the ball.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.279
And that's the basics of slice.
