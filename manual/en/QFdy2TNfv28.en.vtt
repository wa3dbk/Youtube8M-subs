Don't worry, we all make mistakes when we
type. Luckily, PowerPoint includes an easy-to-use

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.430
spell check that can help you create professional,
error-free presentations. All you have to

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.390
do is go to Review, then click the Spelling
command.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.239
PowerPoint will cycle through every error
in your presentation, giving you the chance

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:36.910
to type the corrections yourself, or select
one of their suggestions. Click Change to

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.820
accept the correction and move on to the next
error.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.730
Spell check isn't perfect, though. Sometimes
it'll say something's spelled wrong when it

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.010
isn't - like people's names, or proper nouns.
If that happens, you have a couple options.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.940
Ignore will skip the word one time without
changing it; Ignore All will skip the word

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.940
every time it appears in your presentation;
and Add will add the word to the PowerPoint

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.170
dictionary so it never comes up as an error
again. Just make sure the word is spelled

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.390
correctly before you go with this option.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.229
Now I'd like to close this dialog box, so
we can take a look at the auto-check that's

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.540
going on. You may not even need to run a separate
check because, by default, PowerPoint marks

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.100
spelling errors automatically, using these
red wavy lines.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.180
So, let's take a look at what I did wrong I spelled the word "June" correctly, but forgot

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.610
to capitalize it. To correct the error, all
you have to do is right-click, and choose

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.610
the proper spelling here. Looks like I also
misspelled "spectacular."

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.530
If you're curious about changing the spell
check settings, just go to the Backstage View,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.530
then Options, and Proofing. Here, PowerPoint
gives you the ability to change the way it

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.530
addresses spelling errors, including the auto-check
(or Check spelling as you type), and the use

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.140
of contextual spelling. Contextual spelling
can help you find words that are spelled correctly,

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.360
but may be used the wrong way - like the word
"no," as in "no thank you," versus "now I

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.750
know my ABCs."

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.220
Check the box here if want PowerPoint to hide
the red wavy lines that mark any spelling

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.000
errors in your presentation. This is the same
as turning off the auto-check; notice how

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.640
the box is checked and disabled now? In this
mode, you can still find and correct spelling

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.700
errors using the command on the Review tab.
I prefer to leave the auto-check on, however,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.379
because this affects all of PowerPoint, not
just what you're currently working on.

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.799
Click OK when you're done to return to your
presentation. It's still a good idea to have

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.640
someone look over your work before you present
it to an audience, just to be safe. Happy

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.640
proofing!
