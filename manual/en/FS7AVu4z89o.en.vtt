Hey guys! My name is Andrew

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.109
I'll be hosting this tutorial instead of Alex this week.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.719
Today we're going to learn how to do a

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:22.429
back hand spring over the block.

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:27.050
and the final progression is going to look
like this

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.999
And now we're going to break this down into few easy steps.

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:34.940
First of all, you need to know how to do a simple cartwheel

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.320
If you don't know how to do this

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.970
then check this out:

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.940
First you need to imagine a line in front of you.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.640
You put both your arms on this line

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.570
Then you push your leg up

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.160
and try to reach the ground

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.640
on the same line

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.240
and you finish your cartwheel

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.880
Next you should try to do the same cartwheel, but from the back standing position. Like so.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.710
The technique here is simmilar with the
previous one

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.809
Here we're jumping up with both our legs

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.990
So you should focus more on your arms

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.990
Now we're going to learn how to do a back hand spring. You can see the progression here:

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.480
Firstly we do a cartwheel from the back standing position

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.010
like in the previous explanation

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.800
Then, on the second step, we must swing out hands not through the side

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.390
but over our head, like so.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.710
the final stage of this progression will be a straight back hand spring

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.170
over a head

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.079
Now, as we're getting closer to our final progression, you need to understand that

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.140
this is a difficult move, so

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.750
you will need adding some height and work on your presiccions more, to build up

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.750
confidence in yourself. Or you can get seriously injured.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.279
Okay guys, finally we are here

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.859
First of all you need to find an appropriate place to do this move.

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:16.680
You get into the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.919
comfortable position

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:22.229
And dont forget to spot the block over your shoulder. So the first step will be

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:29.229
doing a cartwheel from the back standing position

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.079
And now you're going to do this more straightly

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:43.079
slowly comming to the straight back hand spring

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:55.709
So

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.259
I hope this tutorial will help you with your back hand spring progression, and I'll see you next week!
