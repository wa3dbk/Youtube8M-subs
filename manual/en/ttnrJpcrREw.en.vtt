00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.100
Creativity of some kind is necessary for all
people.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.760
You don't have to be talented.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.130
You have to find some way to tap into your
own creative spirit.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:31.330
You've got to have that to be a whole person.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.739
Why is it here?

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:33.910
It's such a fluke...really.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.030
The infrastructure on all levels is so difficult
and improbable.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.670
It's just amazing that it is here at all.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.739
It's Eureka.

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.559
And to the truest sense of the word.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.440
You either find it or you don't.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.052
And it has got as much negative as it has
positive.

00:00:54.052 --> 00:00:59.059
One of the most active places...really one
of the reasons why it does attract a lot people

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.072
whether they realize it or not.

00:01:00.072 --> 00:01:06.060
And there is so many different artists.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.020
You can be who you are and be as odd as you
want to be or just be as normal as you want

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.020
to be.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.060
After a while you are accepted.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.571
There are reasons why people are drawn here
that have to do with how beautiful it is and

00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:25.830
then there are reasons people stay here that
have to do with how supportive it is.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.140
Those creative people that's what makes it
interesting.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.880
Basically I think it's the artists who reflect
who we are in every society.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.000
You can't say that art should do this.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.750
It just pushes.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.960
The artist pushes the rules.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.070
We don't have a really good reputation ... artists.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.580
Cause we are a little high maintenance and
apt to say something without thinking.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.310
There's a lot of passion here and sometimes
people are on different sides of the fence

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.530
with their passions but they do have the love
of Eureka Springs in common.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.810
It is not just a place.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.810
It's a way of being.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:18.070
You wake to the sound of birds singing not
coughing it's wonderful.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:39.171
Eureka is a small little place that is like
every place where humans &lt;expletive&gt; up and

00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:45.500
do good things to.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.660
Shut up!

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:58.719
Shut up you!
