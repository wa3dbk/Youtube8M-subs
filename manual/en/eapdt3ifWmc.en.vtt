00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.660
Earlier this morning, we caught those beautiful barramundi.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.880
I said we're going to do a barramundi cook-up, but
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put a bit of

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.210
a twist on it. A bit of a Kimberley twist
actually. And I'm going to call it 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.240
barramundi boab stir-fry.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.650
And we're doing it here at the beautiful

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.690
Dusty bar and grill

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.440
at Home Valley Station. Awesome setting, mate,
this place is gold.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.500
I'll tell you what, it is a little bit...

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.490
a pretty flash joint for All 4 Adventure
but we're camped down by the river anyway

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.350
So it's not too bad.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.290
But anyway, what I've got is...

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.230
I'll show you my ingredients here. I've got some
barramundi already dusted with some flour

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.090
and a few bits and pieces, but the
one in particular that you want to have a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.160
quick look at is the boab root.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.440
Now that's what it looks like when 
it comes out of the ground washed.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.180
And this is what I've done. I've peeled it
like a carrot, and I'll just chopped it up.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.860
Now it has the consistency of a water
chestnut. So let's not muck around, 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.880
because I hate mucking around
when I'm cooking.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.160
I want everything flash, fast, done,
out the door, because I've got some hungry crew,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.740
that'd be Simon,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.250
ready to eat this awesome dinner.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.700
So, I've got hot oil on the pan here.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.140
Let's go.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.360
So what I do is...

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.070
youse want that barramundi in hot oil.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.110
Alright, so you want to fry that up
so it's nice and golden brown. 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.700
You need to be very careful with it,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.540
because it will fall apart because barramundi
is a very white tender flesh.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.469
We've got a bit of entertainment
going on in the background.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.599
So what I've got is I've got my nice
barramundi all browned up.

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.439
Another hot frying pan with 
a little bit of oil.

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:18.439
And what we're going to do is, 
we've got some garlic,

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.539
a big slab of garlic,

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.979
don't be shy with the garlic.

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.279
Don't be shy with the garlic.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.979
Onion.

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.139
Now... so I've got those ingredients in there
and we're just going to cook them a little bit

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.749
to soften them.

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.439
But you don't want to cook them too long,
because you don't want to boil them

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.439
We're not boiling veggies today.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:53.209
We're going to do a stir-fry, so it's quick,
stir it, fry it, hot wok

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.949
or hot frying pan.

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:01.099
Now we'll just get ready with some sauce.

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.289
But what I've got is I've got a
little bit of fish sauce,

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:12.289
a bit of sweet-chilli sauce,

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.539
About that much, that'll do.

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:20.799
See how this is going.

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.259
That's looking good. Looking real good.

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.259
But what i get it now is

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.859
I get my barramundi in.

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.079
Now you need to be

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.489
extremely careful with the barramundi.

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.589
Otherwise it will fall apart on you.

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:39.429
So we put the barramundi in

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:43.349
and then we get our sauce in.

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.879
Oh, that's smelling good now.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.930
Obviously using fish sauce with fish

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.829
works very well. It's got that salty taste to it. 
You don't actually need to salt it.

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.629
The fish sauce is doing that.

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.789
Now we just carefully fold it,

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:05.789
because we don't want to break apart
the barramundi.

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:10.180
Now that is looking good.
It even smells good.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.669
So it's looking pretty good now.

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.239
So all we need now is to chuck it
on a bed of rice

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.129
and we're good to go.

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.310
Now we're going to be very gentle with it.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.339
And basically, stick it on a bed of rice

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:24.750
And look at those colours.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.129
You'll see I've used green and red 
just to give it a bit of colour.

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:35.210
Oh, look at that. That looks like gold.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.380
Well, I could tell you how good it is 
all day long

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.110
but let's get Simon's opinion. He's usually 
pretty good. Come on, mate. Here you go.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.259
- You've cooked us up a storm over here.
- As always.

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.030
- What have we got?
- Barramundi boab stir-fry.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.650
Baramundi and a tree.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.199
- You know that barramundi I caught today?
- It's hot.

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.599
You know that barramundi that I caught today?
You know that one?

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:06.599
That's him.
-It's good. Hot. It's really good. Surprising.

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.099
Well done, mate.

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.550
-Thanks, mate.
-Can't speak with my mouth full.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.360
No worries. Thank, mate. Where you going?

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.889
You want me to stand up here and eat it, eh?

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:28.289
Alright. See ya. Done.
