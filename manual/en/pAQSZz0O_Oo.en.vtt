Hey everyone, this is Justine from Canadian
Outback Adventures &amp; Events here with a corporate

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.410
update for our team building section.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.140
So we just finished running an awesome Minute
to Win It event here in Calgary, Alberta.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.460
We ran it in our core for a group of about
30 participants today and they are an Energy

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.590
and Resources group out here.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.490
So yeah, basically we got the group started
and they already started coming up with the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.221
team names, the team chants and slogans and
mottos and all of that good stuff; ways to

00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:33.320
kind of make their teams standout throughout
the day.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.379
From there they moved in to their rotations
of the 12 challenges where they have to utilize

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.389
household items and complete these seemingly
simple tasks, however, once they got started

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:49.019
they did see that it called for quite a bit
more precision and strategizing that they

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.209
might have originally thought.

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:54.879
So ultimately the teams were super successful,
high energy level, and they had a really really

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:55.879
great time.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.489
What was great about this event is that it
almost appeared to be kind of an ice breaker

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.859
for the group, in the sense that they came
in, you know, not too sure what to expect,

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.100
they were still ready to rock and have a great
time, and by the end of it, every single person

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.490
had really, really engaged and you can tell
that they pushed their comfort zones, they

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.789
definitely came out of their shells and every
participated to the absolute fullest.

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.469
We saw really, really strong team work on
this one even if the challenge only called

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.579
for a couple of people on the team to step
forward.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.549
The teammates were really, really good at
either providing support or physically engaging

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.850
somehow to, whether it’s help hold teammates
up if they had to participate in a certain

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.479
challenge or encouraging them or whatever
they had to do.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.729
So really, it just seems like they organically
kind of assimilated roles within their teams

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.189
and they just, they ran with it, so that was
excellent to see.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.030
Another great thing about this event was that
we actually came to the client, so we didn’t

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.070
run this event at an outsourced venue.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.079
We came right to the client’s office here
downtown which works really well if you’re

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.939
working with a shorter timeline or they don’t
want to factor in an alternate venue into

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.509
their event plans, we can easily come to them
and make a great event happen and that’s

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:05.829
what we did here today!

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.739
