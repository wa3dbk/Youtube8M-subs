00:00:05.396 --> 00:00:10.740
Here is the 12.1-inch tablet. Its screen is quite nice, I'm quite surprised.

00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:21.683
I don't know yet what technology is used, but viewing angles are not bad at all, from all sides.

00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:26.347
It's much better than a TN screen for instance.

00:00:27.387 --> 00:00:30.362
That screen is pleasant to look at.

00:00:31.153 --> 00:00:38.122
There's first a black frame that enables to hold the device.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:44.424
And there's a second frame with some relief

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:56.368
that enables the device not to slip out of your hands.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.239
Let's have a look at the connectors.

00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:13.394
On the right side, there's nothing except a tiny speaker.

00:01:14.418 --> 00:01:20.137
On bottom, nothing at all, no connector.

00:01:21.283 --> 00:01:26.539
On the left side, there's the other stereo speaker and many other things.

00:01:28.586 --> 00:01:43.879
First, you have the two real USB ports (no miniUSB) you can access behind trapdoors.

00:01:47.512 --> 00:01:56.070
They're well integrated. There's a small reset button.

00:01:57.942 --> 00:02:05.718
Here is the SDHC card reader.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.207
There's a big air hole.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.734
A headset/mike port: one port for the input and the output.

00:02:18.552 --> 00:02:22.521
There's a mini-HDMI port to send the signals to a bigger screen.

00:02:23.575 --> 00:02:28.775
And there's the volume button. And the power supply port.

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:39.431
On top, there's the power button, a button for the keyboard

00:02:40.464 --> 00:02:44.887
and a button to prevent the screen from rotating.

00:02:45.863 --> 00:02:58.903
It deactivates the accelerometer. Let's deactivate it.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.134
Two last things: there's two air holes, on top and on bottom.

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.774
I think it's to use the device in all directions.

00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:19.864
The texture of the device is pleasant.

00:03:20.926 --> 00:03:34.081
Last thing: here's the stylus, which is well integrated.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:43.114
So the stylus is here, directly integrated inside the device.

00:03:44.121 --> 00:03:49.506
It's very well done in order not to loose it. Well done!

00:04:01.505 --> 00:04:04.456
I finally found what this button is for when trying it:

00:04:05.305 --> 00:04:10.680
it's simply to enable you to do ALT+TAB with the device,

00:04:11.634 --> 00:04:22.200
so that you can go from one program to the other. It's useful, it's very easy that way.
