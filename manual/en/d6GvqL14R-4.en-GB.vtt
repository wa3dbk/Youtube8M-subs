around the inside of your glass.

And I present to you the Toblerone Cocktail.
Cheers

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:13.529
It looks alot like a chocolate milk shake,
its very sweet chocolatey and creamy. If your

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:18.319
not a fan of Kahlua or Coffee liqueurs as
am I myself you actaully can't really taste

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.949
it. It tastes more like a Toblerone chocolate
bar, you can really taste the cream and frangelico

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.149
and baileys more than you can anything else.

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:30.639

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:46.410
