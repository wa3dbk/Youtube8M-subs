00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.480
We are propagating salvia leucantha or Mexican
Bush Sage from cuttings and we are going to

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.370
need to water them in once we have got them
put in the cells and in the potting soil but

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.520
not keep them so wet, that they get, that
the leaves stay wet. They need to have good

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.420
air circulation so that the leaves will dry
off so that they won’t grow a fungus and

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.689
all that. It will take several weeks for these
to root down, what I usually do to find out

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.011
whether or not I’ve got, got roots coming,
you can pick up these, these flats and you

00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:40.059
can see the little holes down here. These
roots will go very deep and the very first

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.210
roots that come out will make a beeline for
one of these holes right here and you will

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.710
see white roots sticking out of these holes
and you will know that they have rooted down

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:55.489
and that you have got conceivably enough plants,
enough roots to conceivably set to another

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:02.579
location or to a larger pot. But you want
to pull them up and take a look, if you grab

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.150
a hold of the plant and the plant basically
comes, where it looks like it wants to pull

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.600
out without lifting up into the soil you probably
don’t have as many roots as you think you

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.860
have got. Of course salvia leucantha can be
grown a number of ways, this pot right back

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.780
here has a plant that was dug up or actually
pulled up during some cultivation practices

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.990
and had a whole bunch of roots on it and I
just put it in some potting soil and I expect

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.610
it to do quite well. Much like dividing a
clump of the plant and making numerous plants

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.890
out of a root ball this is kind of the same
idea. Salvia leucantha is a Texas native and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:53.380
it is a very tough plant, makes a beautiful
purple almost fox-tail looking bloom that

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.880
comes on in the fall. It is quite striking
and I believe it is even used, it is a sage

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.659
and I believe it has been used as a seasoning
by the old-timers.
