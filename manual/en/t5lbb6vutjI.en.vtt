Hi I'm Charles Stewart Jr., and I'm going
to show you how to rip protected audio files

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.830
into an MP3 format. This first I want to say
this isn't technically legal. It's kind of

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.590
a a debate on both camps. A lot of people
feel if you've purchased the music, you should

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.680
be able to do what you want with it. But the
law says you know you only can do so much

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.230
with that. So technically you're not supposed
to do this. But again it's a gray area, and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.941
I'll let you decide for yourself what you
think is OK to do. But what you want to do

00:00:33.941 --> 00:00:40.469
is you want to burn your make a list for this
case I've already taken the Lincoln Park CD

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.239
I've had and burned it that I purchased off
iTunes. And I burned it onto a CD. So I burned

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:53.659
the whole CD onto a CD-R that I could play
in my car. So I mean I bought it electronically,

00:00:53.659 --> 00:01:00.089
and I burned it onto a CD-R that I can take
with me in my car. And but now let's say I

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:05.710
want to put it onto a I don't have an iPod
I have a you know Zune or something and Zune

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.049
will not take the the the file format that
iTunes store recorded it in. Well the best

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.220
way to do that is to put your CD back in.
And as you can see I've already done that.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.840
It's in there, and it's ask from there you
can pretty much import that CD. Right there

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.939
at the bottom of iTunes there's an import
CD button. And you just click import CD. Now

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.859
to make sure it's importing in the format
that you want which is an MP3 which is a good

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:40.460
universal format for just about any player.
You'll go to the preferences pane. And go

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.359
to your advanced tab and look under the importing
tab. From there is where you would choose

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.909
which how you want to bring in files from
there. Like whether you're importing CD or

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.330
just dragging files into iTunes. So I've chosen
MP3 with a hundred and ninety-two kilo-bits

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.170
per second which is a a really good quality
to have. And then you just hit OK. So now

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.830
when I hit import CD, it's going to start
importing those songs. And you can pretty

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.690
much apply this to any protected content.
Again it's not it's not really legal. So again

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.480
it's up to you whether you want to do this
or not. But this is one way to go about doing

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.300
it if you're trying to transfer protected
content into an MP3 format.
