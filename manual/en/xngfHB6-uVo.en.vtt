00:00:00.157 --> 00:00:02.967
- Hey guys, so I finally
decided on my Halloween costume.

00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:05.196
This year for Halloween, I'm going to be

00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:07.053
The Fabulous Doctor!

00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:08.678
♫ Oh my god, I don't have a clue

00:00:08.678 --> 00:00:10.652
♫ These paradoxes are hard to construe

00:00:10.652 --> 00:00:12.881
♫ My mind is blown I bet yours is too

00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:14.692
♫ But I guess this is

00:00:14.692 --> 00:00:17.223
♫ Doctor Who

00:00:17.223 --> 00:00:18.639
♫ It's the Big Bang Two

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:20.706
♫ And I need to review

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:22.772
♫ What on earth just happened

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:24.955
♫ Before my eyes

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:26.813
♫ Time has gone askew

00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:29.576
♫ The universe has too

00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:31.480
♫ I'll try and explain to you

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.775
♫ The Big Bang Two ♫

00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:37.205
So, how did this costume come about?

00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:38.900
Well, a few years ago I had an extra

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.827
Tenth Doctor Sonic Screwdriver,

00:00:40.827 --> 00:00:44.054
and so I thought wouldn't it
be cool if I bedazzled it?

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:45.122
And so I did.

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:47.212
But then my Eleventh
Doctor Sonic Screwdriver

00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:49.511
seemed kind of lonely and plain.

00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:51.368
So I bedazzled that one as well.

00:00:51.368 --> 00:00:53.203
Sorry I didn't get that
much footage of making

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:55.524
the actual Sonic Screwdriver,
but to be honest,

00:00:55.524 --> 00:00:57.800
it's just hot gluing rhinestones over and

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.309
over and over again.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.585
So, it wouldn't really have
been all that interesting.

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:03.465
I'm so happy I finally
found all the colored

00:01:03.465 --> 00:01:04.742
rhinestones I needed, though.

00:01:04.742 --> 00:01:06.646
The silver ones are easy enough to find,

00:01:06.646 --> 00:01:08.666
but I had to go to a dedicated bead store

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.547
to find the plastic black ones and

00:01:10.547 --> 00:01:12.916
the Swarovski copper and matte white.

00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:14.866
They told me in the store
that the matte white

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.327
is actually discontinued,
so if that's true,

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:19.185
and you want to make one, I would suggest

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:20.485
buying them up quick.

00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:22.482
But what's a bedazzled Sonic Screwdriver

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:24.432
without an outfit to go along with it?

00:01:24.432 --> 00:01:26.150
Let me take you through
the rest of the costume.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.101
Starting at the bottom,
I'm wearing black boots

00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:29.680
with plain, black pants.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.351
Then I have a peach tank
top, and I was going

00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:33.070
to wear suspenders, but
I didn't want to have to

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.136
tuck the tank top into my pants,

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:37.829
so instead, I sewed sequins
directly onto the shirt

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.408
to mimic the suspenders.

00:01:39.408 --> 00:01:41.057
The jacket is from Forever 21.

00:01:41.057 --> 00:01:42.891
I didn't really have to do anything to it,

00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:45.236
but I bought it like two
days ago, so it's probably

00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:47.303
still in stores if you want
to pick one up as well.

00:01:47.303 --> 00:01:48.835
Okay, now the fun craft projects.

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:50.321
Rather than wear a bowtie,

00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:52.504
I decided to make a bowtie necklace.

00:01:52.504 --> 00:01:54.594
Even though bowties are
cool, sequined bowtie

00:01:54.594 --> 00:01:56.567
necklaces are fabulous.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:58.680
I made this by cutting the
shape out of museum board,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.584
painting it red, hot
gluing on the sequins,

00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:02.720
and then just attaching a necklace chain.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.555
And finally, the fez.

00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:07.062
I wanted to make kind of
a mini fez that sits off

00:02:07.062 --> 00:02:08.989
to the side, I think it's really cute.

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.102
I made the shape out of a cereal box.

00:02:11.102 --> 00:02:13.494
Sorry I don't have a pattern,
but I kinda freehanded it,

00:02:13.494 --> 00:02:15.189
since I knew I was going
to be covering it all

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.534
with sequins anyway, so it
didn't have to be perfect.

00:02:17.534 --> 00:02:19.902
I painted it red, and then
I hot glued the sequins on

00:02:19.902 --> 00:02:21.481
until I had covered the whole thing.

00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:23.385
And then I used wire to
attach it to a headband

00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:26.102
so that it would actually
balance on my head.

00:02:26.102 --> 00:02:27.193
And that's the whole outfit.

00:02:27.193 --> 00:02:29.097
The thing that I like
about this costume is that

00:02:29.097 --> 00:02:31.837
you can break it out into
different, everyday pieces.

00:02:31.837 --> 00:02:34.530
Like I might not wear a
red, sequined fez everyday,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.040
but I could totally wear this necklace

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.572
with any regular outfit.

00:02:37.572 --> 00:02:40.335
And I never would have picked
this jacket out on my own,

00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:41.821
but I actually really like it.

00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:44.189
Im sure I'll keep wearing
it outside of this costume.

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.117
But do you wanna know what
the most stressful thing

00:02:46.117 --> 00:02:47.231
in the world is?

00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:48.833
Not knowing if you have enough supplies

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:50.157
to finish a project.

00:02:50.157 --> 00:02:52.037
So, with the sequins,
they sell it by the yard,

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:54.011
but when I got to the store,
there wasn't very much

00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:56.472
left on the spool, maybe like six yards?

00:02:56.472 --> 00:02:58.353
So, I just bought all of
it, and it ended up being

00:02:58.353 --> 00:03:01.395
exactly the amount I needed
to finish this costume.

00:03:01.395 --> 00:03:02.741
Like, there is nothing left.

00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:04.483
I used exactly all of it.

00:03:04.483 --> 00:03:05.946
How does that even happen?

00:03:05.946 --> 00:03:08.198
But that is my 2012 Halloween costume.

00:03:08.198 --> 00:03:10.589
I'm actually really excited
to have the matching

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:12.447
bedazzled Sonic Screwdrivers now.

00:03:12.447 --> 00:03:14.072
Maybe I should make the whole set.

00:03:14.072 --> 00:03:15.953
Anyone know how many of the Classic Who

00:03:15.953 --> 00:03:17.555
Sonic Screwdrivers they've released?

00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:19.297
So, let me know in the
comments what you're

00:03:19.297 --> 00:03:22.222
going to be for Halloween, and
what exciting plans you have.

00:03:22.222 --> 00:03:24.730
And if you missed last week's
Halloween crafting video,

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.446
I make three Halloween themed necklaces,

00:03:27.446 --> 00:03:29.513
so you can check that out right here.

00:03:29.513 --> 00:03:31.463
