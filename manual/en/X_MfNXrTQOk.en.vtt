Hi, I'm Jay French at jayfrenchstudios.com,
and I'm going to show you how to draw snowy

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.170
pines in colored pencil. All right, we're
going to start out in pencil beforehand just

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.240
to get ourselves a rough idea of something
to follow. Let's get a little snow dune going

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.980
on here, and let's just do one major tree.
Now even though a lot of pines, their leaves

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.140
stick upward, when they're weighted down with
snow they're going to hang, they're going

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:36.699
to hang over like that. So, we're going off
the page, and it's going to make the whole

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:44.420
tree lean a bit too. So once you got at least
some general idea of where your, where your

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.620
limbs are going to be, you're going to be
thinking about, the limbs, you're going to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.010
be thinking about the snow as kind of random,
hanging on there. But you can do that without

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.170
actually having to draw that stage. You do
that by using an olive green here, and pines

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.580
use it great because again in nature you can
be a little imprecise and you really can't

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.100
tell if you got it wrong. So what we're going
to do is we get the underside of the branch,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.800
with the pines and then we get the shape of
the snow on top, and then we'll show you how

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.740
to do the top edge, but you just keep doing
that, we're just going to do one side to show

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.250
you. Remember there's not going to be any
snow on the under side. And normally I'd probably

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.460
be sharpening this pencil as I go along, but
we go up here too and some of it's actually

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.790
going to be on the top of some of these, shorter
limbs will still get some upward point to

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.220
them because they're shorter and there's not
as much length to weigh down. Make that bottom

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.980
edge where the snow is uneven, you could even
do it like that, do the snow edge first, although

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.060
it's - then you have to follow the lines,
it's a little trickier. So I'll tell you one

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:26.139
more level down and then we're going to use
a very pale blue to do some rough shading

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:35.480
on that bottom edge there. And then use that
to make the top edge and it doesn't have to

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.760
be as extreme, it can be a little softer as
a sketch there, and where the top edge of

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:51.969
the snow is. Now if you want to get real realistic
and detailed, go over this blue with a gray

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:59.450
and then blend it with a blending stick, a
blending pencil, or a white pencil. And get

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.540
a little lumpier on the snow up there. And
when you get to the opposite side to get this

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:15.290
all to mesh together, you'll want some areas
that just fill in between, and you can have

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.010
some more snow showing in between there too.
And I'll just show you a little bit there.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.860
And again you have the soft under side, the
outline for the top edge, and we got some

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.989
going on over here behind, and some you can
just see through. And we'll continue like

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:43.620
that. Some of these snow areas will even go
on to the next limbs like that, making them

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.549
connect across, and some of them will actually
be in front. And that's how you get started

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.189
with drawing colored pencil snowy pines.
