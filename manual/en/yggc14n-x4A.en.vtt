Welcome to step number six of the invisible
part sew in hairstyle is that I will show

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:14.590
you how to cut and style your hair the supplies
you will need will be a pair of flat irons

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:21.749
hair cutting scissors and a hair comb to begin
styling my invisible part sew in I will simply

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:28.170
take sections this near the front of my head
and layer them at an angle once I trim the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.230
that I would like I will simply take flatirons
and flat the hair in a way from my face so

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:44.620
to begin I want to take my comb and I and
going want to grab a section right here doesn't

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:56.110
have to be perfect and 
I'm going to start layering the hair a about

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.620
two thirds of the way down my actual hair
so and hold with my fingers when you take

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:14.210
my scissors and I'm going to begin to cut
and skim down the hair by doing that I create

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:24.460
layers in my style now to continue to layer
sections until I get about right here my head

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:32.130
and then I'm going to do the same thing on
the other side is going to comb down to see

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:45.509
where hairs fall and I am going to take this
section comb out the hair hold it at an angle

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.439
about two thirds of the way down the hair
take my scissors and began to trim at an angle

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:27.470
until I reached the bottom 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.920
now section by section I will take small pieces
of hair want take my flatirons and then I'll

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:43.560
simply curl them under until I flip the very
tips so now you just take a little bit of

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.900
hair from the side you are going to slide
your flat iron down at an angle so that the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:59.439
hair is facing up and then you simply slide
all the way down to the take another strand

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:06.920
of hair place your flat iron on turn flat
iron so the hair sticks up and then just slide

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:17.579
straight down or you can slide at an angle
take another piece place your flat iron on

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:52.299
and turn your hair up and you can even tilt
at an angle and slide all the way down 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.810
so now I am going to do the same thing I did
on the left side of my head to the right side

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:10.819
I am going to take a little piece place your
flat iron on it with the flat iron up so the

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:48.430
hair sticks up and then slide it down at an
angle 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.500
in this styling step that I showed you how
to cut and style your hair first you want

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.100
to make sure to take small sections and cut
your hair at a slight angle to create layers

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.900
next you want to take small pieces of your
hair and curl your hair down and out ward

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:13.190
