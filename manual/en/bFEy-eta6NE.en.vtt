00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.100
Hey everybody, Luis Perez here
with 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.120
an accessibility tutorial for
iBooks Author and this is going
to be a quick tutorial 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.180
on how to create a glossary for
your iBooks documents. 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.260
A glossary is important because
it will allow you to point out
key terms that students 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.300
can use to study, especially
using the new Study Cards
feature 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.350
in iBooks which we're going to
look at a little bit later. So
to add 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.440
a new glossary entry, here I'm
going to select a key term that
I want 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.480
my students to remember. So I'm
going to select American
Enlightenment

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.540
here and the key to adding
glossary entries in iBooks
Author 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.780
is to make that you can see the
Glossary Bar.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.830
So if you don't see that go up
to View and then select 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.910
Show Glossary Bar.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.930
Once the Glossary Bar is
visible you can select 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.980
any of the text that you want
to include as the key term 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.060
and then just go up to the
Glossary Bar and click on Add
Term

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.090
and that will make it into a
new glosssary entry. 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.150
So I'll go ahead and do that
and you can see now that

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.240
the text is in bold to indicate
that it's a new glossary entry.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Over on the table of contents,
on the left side I can

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.320
click on Glossary and I can see
the new entry that I've added. 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.400
So here I'll select the key
term and then over on the right 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.440
side I'm going to see the
definition and there's some
placeholder 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.500
text already that iBooks Author
has added for me. I'll 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.540
select that placeholder text
and then I'm going to paste
some text that I've copied 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.580
over from a Wikipedia entry. So
now 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.650
I have my key term as well as
my definition and that's how
easy 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.680
it is to add a new glossary
entry in iBooks Author. 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.710
So now let's take a look at how
a glossary works on the iPad. 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.790
(Music) 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.880
Here I've opened my iBook

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.900
on the iPad and as you can see
the text for the glossary entry
is

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.960
in bold. When I tap on the text 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.030
a popover will come up showing
me the definition. 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.080
Now if I have a lot of glossary
entries at the bottom of this
popover 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.400
I can tap on Glossary Index and
that will take me to

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.490
a list of all the glossary
entries. The entries will 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.670
appear on the left when I have
my iPad in the landscape
orientation 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.740
and then the definitions will
appear on the right. 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.850
So the other thing I can do
with glossary entries is 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.890
I can use them to study using
the new Study Cards feature.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.960
So I'll tap on my iBook once to
reveal

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.990
the controls and then I'll tap
on the Study Cards 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.040
icon which is the third one
from the left in the upper left
corner.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.130
So here I can go ahead

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.150
and tap on Study Cards and now
I 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.200
will basically have a
flashcard. On one side is the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.280
key term that I used for the
glossary entry and over on the 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.330
lower hand corner there's a
flip icon and I can

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.390
tap on that icon to see the
definition. When I'm finished

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.480
I can go ahead and just tap
anywhere on the card 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.540
and that will flip it over
again. And then when I'm
finished with all the cards 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.600
I can tap on Done in the upper
right hand corner to end 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.730
my review session and then Done
one more time to go back 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.770
to the book. So these glossary
entries are really helpful 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.840
for students because they point
out key pieces of information 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.850
that they may otherwise skip
over. 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.890
