Hi! I’m John Junger. I do the paintings
that we’re going to be talking about, the

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:15.849
watercolors. I’m here representing expertvillage.com.
I’m laying in a little heavier more___ colors

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:23.949
to give you a little more feeling of contrast
between what’s in the foreground and the

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:31.330
background. As you can see, the brush strokes
are not spreading out. They’re still spreading

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.170
out, but they’re not spreading out like
they were earlier. This would be like an under

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:49.839
painting, as far as the detail in it. Again,
I’m getting a little more contrast in my

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:59.339
brush strokes and what I’m laying down.
If you’ve been out in the fields and seen

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:08.390
that the fields are not one color. There is
a variety of colors in everything. Little

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.330
violets, little things happening in the field
where you need a little more shade. There

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.280
are little more textured. Sometimes, they’ve
gotten to the point where they’re turning

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:29.969
brown, where part of it is still green. So,
a monotonic kind of painting, with just one

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:37.070
color value, is very boring. If you look at
the fields, look at the trees, and look at

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.760
face, you see many colors. You have to use
your imagination a little bit. Mother nature

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.119
is really wonderful that way. There’s not
one flesh color; there’s not one tree color,

00:01:51.119 --> 00:02:06.759
and that’s kind of object to companies putting
a paint called flesh tone. Well, it is a flesh

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:13.319
tone, but it’s only one of them. I think
it gives the novice the idea of they can just

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:22.840
put that down, and they won’t have to mix
up a flesh tone, which is very difficult.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:32.180
I think I would leave that go right now for
my washes on this. I would want to work dry

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.060
into dry.
