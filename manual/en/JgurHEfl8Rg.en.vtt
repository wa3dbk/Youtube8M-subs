00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.410
Now I'm finishing the necklace and as you
can see here we've got the centerpiece right

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.299
at zero. You kind of want to make the same
distance from the zero to what this is here,

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.170
with the clasp. And you can see where the
beads are ending and it's like a little bit

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.769
above eight. So I just want to make sure,
looks like I need to add just a few more beads,

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.189
to make sure it lines up just right to get
to this line, because this is where I started.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.300
You want to end approximately the same distance
to make sure this is in the center. So a few

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.970
more beads I need to add. Now we're finishing
the end of the necklace. We're putting two

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:46.800
crimps on. And then we'll put the toggle clasp
on. We're putting the crimps around both wires

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.460
as well as the end of the toggle clasp. This
would be finishing off our necklace. Just

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:05.081
string it on.
And then what we do is we get the end and

00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:18.000
we string it through the crimps, the two crimps,
so that we'll be crimping the end of the necklace.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.980
So then we push it through and then we can
see how I have it double looped just like

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:44.280
that. And we pull it, snug it, a little tight.
We have a nice tight necklace. Sometimes it's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.060
a little bit easier to use your needle nose
pliers, the flat or the rounded and kind of,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.210
hang on to it here and kind of pull your wire,
so you're making it snug. And you want a little

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.170
bit of room there. You don't want it too tight,
just enough so the clasp can move around.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.539
You just pull the ends here, this little snug.
And what you want to do now, to finish it

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:20.840
off, you got to crimp it. Crimp it down, nice
and tight. Look at it, pull on it a little

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.870
bit, make sure it's nice and tight. And if
you have enough room what you can do is string

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.090
your other ends through here, if your hole
is big enough. If it isn't, you need to just

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.510
go ahead and finish it off by using your wire
cutters and cutting it as close as you can

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.810
to the end here, so that you don't poke anybody
in your neck when you have it on. Just go

00:02:45.810 --> 00:03:00.069
ahead and trim it. That's the end of your
necklace. So go ahead, string it through here

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:07.680
to your toggle clasp. And here is your necklace
all strung up, nice and pretty.
