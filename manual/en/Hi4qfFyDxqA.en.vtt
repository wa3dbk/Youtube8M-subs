00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In my first video I'm gonna talk about Brazil vs Germany, semi-final of 14' World Cup. 

00:00:13.954 --> 00:00:14.954
Here we have the odds from Pinnacle. 

00:00:14.954 --> 00:00:17.000
For those who are not familiarized with the terms

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Odd means the amount we get paid for a given bet

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.400
As we can see in the money line, where the draw is available

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.534
Brazil is a small favourite, as in DNB

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.960
Where the money returns if there's a draw

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.360
In the goals market, I usually bet at Under\Over 2.5 where there's no draw.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.920
But as the Over 2 odds are pretty high I decided to bet on this market

00:00:57.034 --> 00:00:59.714
Storically Germany is no match for Brazil

00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:03.194
They never won this match outside Germany. 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.220
4 wins in 21 matches

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.720
Brazil is unbeaten in home soil for 41 matches. 

00:01:10.393 --> 00:01:12.713
Which is expressive for a soccer bettor. 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.040
Brazil has Neymar and Thiago Silva out

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.000
And I don't think he can be properly replaced. 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.700
Germany has a very strong side

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.500
With lots of offensive variations and talented attackers. 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.880
Muller, Schweinsteiger, Özil, Götze

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.500
Which will cause a lot of trouble for brazilian defense. 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.620
Brazil hasn't played well in this world cup

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:48.586
On the contrary, has had very poor matches

00:01:52.088 --> 00:01:53.828
There hasn't been any 0x0

00:01:55.154 --> 00:01:57.114
Historically it's a game with lots of goals

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.660
I wrote it wrong, it's 13 overs and not 18.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.260
This market depends on game pace, which I think will be fast since the match will be played ay 17pm

00:02:18.954 --> 00:02:34.794
So, my picks are those above, but 2 units on Over 2 and not 3 as written. 

00:02:35.747 --> 00:02:40.307
Good luck Brazil and good luck to all bettors.
