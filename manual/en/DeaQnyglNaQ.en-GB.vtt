00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.920
In such a short amount of time -

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.240
Planting,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.820
... seeing it grow,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.480
... and then only weeks have past -

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.720
... and I've looked at what's actually growing here, at the moment,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.120
... and I've gone "Wow!"

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.340
One of the first things that we said to each other when we arrived here -

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.120
'it's just like being in the countryside'.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.720
It is fantastic, on your own doorstep, you know,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.320
... you can get away from the hurly-burly and lose yourself in a little piece of the countryside here.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.400
Who wants to sit indoors watching the TV all day when you can be up here in the fresh air?

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.420
It's lovely!

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.520
We spend a lot of time up here. A lot more time outside ...

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.760
So we've got a tan!

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.820
Everyone's always "where have you been?!" ...

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.760
The Allotment! ...

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.060
The 'Costa del Allotment!' is what we say.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.540
One of the most beneficial things I get out of it is the actual physical exercise.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.240
And this is like kind of proper hard work - Old-fashioned Exercise!

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.040
It's immensely therapeutic for me actually working with the earth -

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.600
... it's something I've never done before in my professional life.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.320
Feet on the earth: handling the earth - it's such a rewarding thing to do!

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.860
And I know that, during this year, when i haven't been so well,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.080
... coming up here and just planting a few things ...

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.520
.. and clearing &amp; doing a bit of weeding ...

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.440
Even just sitting and looking at the view has really, really helped.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.780
We quite like healthy eating and that ...

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.580
... so it's been quite nice having all the vegetables coming in -

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.860
... knowing where they've come from &amp; everything.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.540
We've actually got our first dinner guests at the weekend,

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.700
... and we're planning that ninety per cent of the food is coming off the allotment!

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.080
It's been quite nice meeting people - everybody's been really friendly.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.880
I think there's a barbecue planned, in a few weeks time here as well.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.660
So yeah it's quite a nice atmosphere really.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.140
We've only been at it since January really,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.720
... so still loads to do.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.720
Yep! Loads!!

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.420
You're forever learning - if you've got an allotment you're always, always learning.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.340
Always picking up tips, yes.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.140
There's always something to do - something new, all the time.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.520
It's sort of like - tranquility.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.780
And I've never actually experienced that before.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.380
It must do something to your well-being, having an allotment

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.640
Just harvesting the crops and having dinners from the things we've grown is a really nice feeling.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.840
There's nothing simpler, or more pleasurable, than watching something that you've planted grow.
