Hi guys, Ashley here.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.200
So today I'm going to be a doing a review
for you guys.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.560
This is actually my first video product review
so that's kind of exciting I guess.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.219
The product that we are going to be talking
about today is a few of the liquid lipsticks

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.430
from LASplash Cosmetics.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.130
So you may not have heard of LASplash Cosmetics
yet.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.470
They're not really a very big company but
they've been getting increasingly quickly

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.349
popular lately because of these liquid lipsticks
and they are amazing.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.290
So the liquid lipsticks that I purchased from
them are..

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.470
I got two of the Lip Coutures.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.830
I got them in the shades Phantom and Ghoulish.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:48.860
And then I also got one of their Smitten Lip
Tints and this is in the shade Charmed.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.210
Now all three of this products are liquid,
matte, long-wearing lipsticks.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.119
To me the formula seems the same.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:58.780
They seem to wear the same.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.769
They smell the same.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:07.000
The descriptions for the Lip Coutour versus
the Smitten LipTint on LASplash's website

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.390
was..it was like the same just worded a little
differently.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.250
So I cannot quite figure out the difference
between the Smitten LipTints and the Lip Coutures

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.140
because to me they seem pretty much identical.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.240
Now I've got to start off this review by saying
I really, really love these!

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.530
These come in a whole bunch of colors, I don't
know how many exactly, but I think there is

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.640
like 40 shades or something of these all together
and I wanna go out and buy every single shade.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.120
I mean these are hands down the best liquid
lipsticks that I own!

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.750
So each of these just comes with, you know,
your basic doe-foot applicator which I really

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.170
like because they're easy to get a really
precise, clean line with.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.810
So these lipsticks are long wearing lipsticks
and when they say long wearing, they are not

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.920
playing around!

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.560
These babies last forever!

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.610
So one of the best things about these lipsticks
is that they are virtually transfer proof.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.300
The other day I was eating an apple with one
of these on and by the end of it, my lips

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.300
still looked perfect!

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.350
So you can eat with these on, you can drink
with these on, you can kiss people with these

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.319
on, you can do whatever and you don't have
to be worried about it fading and looking

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.720
weird and needing to go touch up and stuff.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.030
Now these are really long lasting so if you're
not eating really greasy food or something,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.650
because you know, oil breaks makeup down,
so if you're not eating something like really

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.410
oily then these lipsticks can last 8, 10,
12 hours and still look really, really good.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.819
I find that a lot of time liquid lipsticks
can be really drying.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.010
For example, I have the Kat Von D Everlasting
Love Liquid Lipsticks and while they're good,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.099
they last a long time, they are kind of drying
and it sometimes gets uncomfortable by the

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.099
end of the day.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.810
These however are not drying!

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.800
And when you put them on and they dry down
to their matte finish, it almost feels like

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.650
there's nothing on your lips, I guess.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.400
It doesn't really feel dry, it doesn't feel
moisturizing, it doesn't feel super duper

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.860
matte and papery, It just kind of feels like
you're not really wearing anything.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.480
Now I've seen some people complaining about
the scent of these.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.080
They don't have your typical fruity or vanilla
lipstick scent.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.030
They actually don't have any added fragrance!

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.240
But they do smell pretty chemically.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.090
It's not exactly pleasant.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.400
But at the same time, it doesn't really bother
me that much and once they dry down to their

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.080
matte finish, which is really quickly, I think
it dries down in under a minute, and once

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:44.130
they dry down the chemical smell and taste
just goes away.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.270
Okay so this is LASplash Charmed and it is
this really pretty sort of muted pink color.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.400
I'm gonna swatch this for you guys!

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.970
So yeah, this is Charmed.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.410
A really pretty sort of muted pink.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.709
And next up on the list we have Ghoulish,
which I love!

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.620
Ghoulish is kind of hard to describe.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.060
It's like a greyish, pinkish, brownish color
almost.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.970
So let's see Ghoulish.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.739
I absolutely love this color.

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.509
So yeah, there is Ghoulish.

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:25.120
It's just a really pretty, kind of greyish
brownish pinkish color.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.639
Now Ghoulish and Charmed, a lot of people
are saying they're good dupes for Lime Crime's

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.879
Velveteen in Cashmere although Charmed is
a little more pink than Cashmere and Ghoulish

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.259
seems a little more brown.

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.130
But they're still both decent dupes!

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.330
Okay, now the shade that I'm wearing today
is called Phantom and I am super excited about

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.270
this one because I've been wanting like a
really purple purple lipstick for a long time

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.879
and I couldn't really find many things that
were purple enough!

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:03.439
But then I saw Phantom on LASplash's site
and I was like "I have got to order this!"

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.289
So I did and I'm really excited about it!

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.449
As you can see, Phantom is like super duper
purple!

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.289
And it also makes your teeth look pretty white!

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:13.789
And so there is Phantom.

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:21.319
It's just like a really bright blue toned
purple.

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:28.569
So these are priced at $11.98 so they're pretty
affordable, especially considering the prices

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.863
of other good, popular liquid lipsticks on
the market.

00:05:31.863 --> 00:05:36.029
And I think they're worth every single penny!

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:41.159
Like I serious want to go out and buy every
single one of them because they are so amazing!

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.449
These are just like a really low maintenance
lipstick.

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.889
Okay, another important note about these is
that they are hard to remove!

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.650
Once you put them on, they're on!

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.020
And on that note, once you put them on it
takes about a minute or so to dry but during

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.439
that minute don't leave your lips pursed together
or like, you know, don't apply too much pressure

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:07.689
to your lips because these lipsticks can kind
of like glue them shut a little bit.

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:09.539
It's like really serious business!

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:12.639
And they're also like really difficult to
remove.

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.199
I think they actually sell a remover for these
but it was out of stock at the time of my

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.999
order so I didn't order it.

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:26.210
And you know, despite being difficult to remove
I don't really think you need the remover.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.259
Most makeup removers don't really seem to
remove this for me.

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:34.339
I can't like wipe it off with a Neutrogena
wipe or just like regular makeup remover or

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:35.339
something.

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:39.460
The way I remove these is to take a little
bit of coconut oil, or any other oil pretty

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:45.110
much will do, and just dab it onto my lips
and leave it on there for like 20 seconds

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.110
or something.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.409
Then I usually get my Makeup Eraser, but you
can probably use a wash cloth for this, especially

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:56.529
if you're using oil, and I just use my Makeup
Eraser to gently massage my lips til this

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:57.529
stuff comes off.

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:02.150
So yeah, if you're still on fence about these
LASplash liquid lipsticks, I would 100% recommend

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.150
these!

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:08.669
They are amazing, they are long lasting, they
are transfer proof, they come in like a bazillion

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:09.779
colors and they are the bomb!

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:14.199
Alright, well I hope you guys enjoyed this
product review and I will be talking to you

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:15.199
soon!

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.199
Bye!

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:17.199
No transfer!
