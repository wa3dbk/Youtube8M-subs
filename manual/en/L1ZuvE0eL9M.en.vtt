00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.670
CASEY CORMIER: Okay, so we remember our major
scales had the pattern whole step, whole step,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.890
half step, whole step, whole step, whole step,
half step: Whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.940
And if we remember, for the E major scale,
let us use our intervals to create that one.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:29.810
We had E, F sharp, a whole step away, G sharp,
a whole step away, A, a half step away. B,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:41.250
C sharp, D sharp, a whole step, and then a
half step. Whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.890
to get back to the octave. That is just one
octave. Now, we want to have those same notes

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.720
an octave up from each of them but we want
to do this in a proper fingering so [PLAYS

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:01.420
SCALE 2 OCTAVES]. This is what this would
look like. Let us explain what just happened.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:09.330
We played E, F sharp. G sharp, A, B, C sharp,
D sharp, and E like before but now we are

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:18.070
going to keep going. E, F sharp, G sharp,
1st fret of A, remember this is just like

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:28.380
the beginnings of a moveable major scale but
now on the D string. Now, it is B, while we

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.040
did not get to C sharp. Let us move with our
first finger because [INDISCERNIBLE] C sharp,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.950
D sharp, and end on E. So we really want to
find out what is a convenient place to move,

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:50.760
which will be after this B. We could also
move earlier. E, F sharp, G sharp, A, B, C

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.200
sharp, then move our first finger up to play
D sharp on the A string 6th fret, then play

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:06.700
the moveable major scale to close things off.
Anyway you do it, you are going to have to

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.590
move your hand, and it is all about finding
a convenient place to jump.
