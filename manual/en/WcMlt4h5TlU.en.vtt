00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.450
Sony Xperia acro S.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.980
Expected Q3 2012.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.259
The Sony Xperia acro S is a powerful Android
smartphone that is also water and dust resistant,

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.830
featuring a 4.3" display and a 12 megapixel
camera plus a lot of other high-end features.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.399
In most respects, the Xperia acro S is very
similar to the Xperia S that was released

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.980
a couple of months ago.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.530
Waterproof smartphones are quite common in
Japan, and indeed Sony's own similar Xperia

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.820
acro HD has been the best selling smartphone
for the past couple of months in that market.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.949
Sony say (confusingly) that the Xperia acro
S is IP55 and IP57 rated, which means that

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.249
the handset can be immersed in up to 1 metre
of water for 30 minutes, it can withstand

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:02.489
water from a nozzle and it is dust resistant.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.530
The display is also scratch resistant and
coated in mineral glass.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.200
The display is a high-resolution 4.3" 720
x 1280 pixel TFT screen, which should be very

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.740
sharp in use.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.470
This also enables HD playback on the phone
itself or through an optional HDMI cable.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.350
The Xperia acro S's display also supports
wet finger tracking.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.010
On the back is a 12 megapixel camera with
auto focus, an LED flash and 1080p HD video

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.030
recording and all the usual enhancements that
you'd expect in a Sony smartphone.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.350
On the front is a 1.3 megapixel camera capable
of 720p video calling.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:55.340
Inside is a 1.5GHz dual-core CPU with 1GB
of RAM and 16GB of internal flash memory (11GB

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.590
is available to the user).

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.140
If that isn't enough, then the Xperia acro
S has a microSD slot as well.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.499
There's a large 1910 mAh battery that is quoted
as giving up to 7 hours talktime and 13 days

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:09.090
standby time.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:18.970
The Xperia acro S measures 126 x 66 x 12mm
and weighs 147 grams.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.890
This is an Android 4.0 smartphone, so it will
be up-to-date out of the box.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.300
Other features include GPS and GLONASS positioning
support, an FM radio, HSPA+ and WiFi support

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.819
and all the usual Android features that you
would expect.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.099
Overall, the Xperia acro S looks like a good
package.

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.730
The 4.3" display is about as big as most people
want, but it has the advantage of being very

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.209
high resolution too.

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.159
The camera looks like one of the best in its
class, and internally it has enough processing

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.330
power to do anything you want.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.750
Sony say that the Xperia acro S should be
available during Q3 2012 in black, white and

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.750
pink colours.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.450
No guidance was given on price, but we would
expect this to launch at around â‚¬500 SIM-free

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:13.190
including taxes.
