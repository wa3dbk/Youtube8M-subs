Hello &amp; Welcome to Archana's Rasoi!

00:00:03.544 --> 00:00:05.155
Today I am going to show you how to make egg rolls.

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:07.560
It will be something new that you can do with eggs.

00:00:07.968 --> 00:00:12.624
And it looks so beautiful and crispy that you 
 will want to keep watching Archana's Rasoi! 

00:00:20.304 --> 00:00:31.013
For 8 egg rolls, the ingredients required are, oil for deep frying, 3-4 boiled &amp; mashed potatoes, 2 egg whites boiled and cut into 4 pieces.  

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:43.946
1 bowl of bread crumbs (made in the mixer), chutney of green chillies, coriander, coconut, garlic &amp; ginger and salt to taste (made in the mixer). 

00:00:44.197 --> 00:00:51.696
Salt to taste, 1 egg whisked (batter) and 2 egg yolks. 

00:00:52.138 --> 00:01:05.843
I am going to start with mixing the 
 egg yolks with the green chutney. 

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:15.942
I have just mixed the yolks with the chutney, mix it well together. 

00:01:16.293 --> 00:01:28.355
Mix it well together and remember, when mixing this, avoid adding water to the chutney, keep it dry. If need be, add very little water. 

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:33.620
Now I am going to apply this mixture to the egg whites.

00:01:41.327 --> 00:01:44.610
In this manner, I have applied the chutney mixture to the egg whites. 

00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:50.820
Now I am going to take the mashed potatoes 
 and wrap the filled eggs with it. 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.490
I am going to add salt to the 
 mashed potatoes and mix it well. 

00:02:04.227 --> 00:02:08.460
Now that I have added salt to the mashed potatoes and mixed it well, I am going to start making the egg rolls.  

00:02:08.846 --> 00:02:11.060
I am making the potato covering now. 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:31.990
On the covering, place a filled egg and 
 cover it from all sides.  

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.400
Make all the rolls in the same way, as I have shown. 

00:02:39.582 --> 00:02:45.970
As I keep making the rolls, I will as 
 always, heat enough oil for deep frying. 

00:02:51.658 --> 00:03:03.080
I have made all the egg rolls. Now I am going to 
 dip it in the egg batter and the bread crumbs. 

00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:13.810
Put the bread crumbs in a larger bowl or flat 
 plate. I have also taken the egg batter. 

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:30.340
So first I am going to pat the egg roll once again 
 and then dip it in the egg batter.   

00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:34.550
Then roll it in bread crumbs. 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:42.890
Ensure that the roll is covered with the batter and crumbs from all sides properly so that they don't break. 

00:03:43.485 --> 00:03:59.520
The oil is hot, so drop the roll into the oil 
 and fry till they turn golden brown.  

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:10.840
Coating the roll with the egg batter helps keeping it intact and because of the crumbs, the rolls look beautiful and become crispy. 

00:04:11.623 --> 00:04:19.920
They look absolutely stunning and once they turn 
 golden brown, remove it from the oil.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:27.350
Try and drain the roll of the oil completely 
 and now they are ready to serve. 

00:04:28.357 --> 00:04:33.720
The egg rolls are ready. These are best served with pudina chutney or tomato sauce or whatever you'll like.   

00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:41.530
