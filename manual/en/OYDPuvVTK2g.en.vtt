Hello again, my name is Matt Bauer and welcome
to this week’s video in the HOW My Computer

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.840
Works series. You may remember a fairly recent
video explaining some commonly-used computer

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.439
terms. In this video, I’ll provide a few
more.

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:23.050
Ethernet –The term Ethernet is just another
name for a high speed network (usually within

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.109
a small area, such as a building) using cables.
Those Ethernet cables are sometimes called

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:35.080
CAT5 cables and they look kind of like oversized
telephone cables. They are typically used

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:42.100
to connect a cable modem to a router, and
to connect a router to a computer.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.449
Firewall – A firewall is usually found in
the form of software on your computer. A firewall

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.120
acts as a barrier between your computer and
the Internet. In short, it acts as a bouncer,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.290
letting good traffic in and keeping bad traffic
out. There is a firewall built right into

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.589
Windows, but there are various third-party
firewall applications available. In our experience,

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.470
the Windows Firewall is more than sufficient
for most users.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.010
Operating System (OS) – This is the main
program that runs on your computer. Without

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.490
an operating system, your computer would essentially
be useless as it would have nothing telling

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.900
it what to do. The most popular operating
system is of course, Microsoft Windows.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:28.470
URL (Uniform Resource Locators) – You may
hear this term thrown around here and there.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:38.150
A URL is basically just another name for a
website address, such as google.com or mycomputerworks.com.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.040
Driver – A driver (sometimes called a DEVICE
driver) is a program that tells Windows how

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.120
to use a particular device, such as a printer
or scanner. Drivers are usually found on the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.390
CD or DVD that came with the device when it
was first purchased. However, it is very important

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.630
when installing a device to install the latest
version of the driver. You can usually find

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.470
the latest driver on the manufacturer’s
website. For example, if you need to install

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:12.450
an HP printer, you can visit the HP website,
click on the Support &amp; Drivers tab, click

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.470
the Download Drivers and Software button,
then enter the printer’s model number and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:29.140
click GO.
You may need to select your specific model

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:42.120
from a list. You will then select your operating
system, and a list of applicable software

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:51.240
will appear, including the driver. There may
be multiple files in the Driver section. This

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.680
is usually because HP provides a full version
with all HP software included, and a much

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:05.510
smaller version with just the software for
basic functions like printing and scanning.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.400
I’ll cover more terms in a future video,
but if you have any training suggestions or

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.630
comments, I’d like to hear from you, so
