00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What ails you, brother?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's nothing.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What do you know about the gambling quarter?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's no place for you, Yudish. Or any other honest man.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
They'd eat you alive.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Gambling and you? Terrible idea.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
He was a control freak. Thought every detail through. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But there were some things he couldnâ€™t control.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The real world cannot be perfect. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Even King Yudish failed sometimes.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Imagine, then, the comfort of a game, of control.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Even for Yudish, most virtuous of kings, I knew 
 it was only a matter of time.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What drove him to the city's most dangerous quarter? 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
His own weakness, or some larger design?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Whose hand that set this chain of events in motion,

00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:24.741
this deadly stream that flowed into the greatest battle this earth has seen?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Yudish waited nervously in the gambler's quarter. The fool thought he was in diguise.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
-What an unexpected pleasure, your High..
-Silence

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
No one must know who I am.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Of course, of course. This way.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
That answer is simple.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Mine was the hand. Ha ha ha! Mine the subtle design.
