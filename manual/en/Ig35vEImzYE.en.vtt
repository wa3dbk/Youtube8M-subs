00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.920
If you’ve watched a video or two of mine,
by now, you’ll have recognized that I am

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.920
a physicist.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.250
And not just any kind of physicist.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.020
I’m a particle physicist, which means that
I get all excited about quarks and leptons

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.000
and big, monster particle accelerators.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.610
I mean- this stuff is totally cool.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.369
By processing an enormous amount of data taken
by the LHC, my colleagues and I can learn

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.050
a great deal about the laws that govern the
universe.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.230
That phrase “processing the data” is not
something easily accomplished.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.370
To do that requires tremendous computer resources
and that’s the point of today’s video.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.460
So how much data are we talking about?

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.270
Just how much information is recorded by an
LHC experiment?

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.890
I could make this a short video and just say
twenty petabytes a year.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.350
But if you’re not a computer wonk, you probably
won’t know what that means.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.550
So let’s get some context.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.009
Computer information is stored in a series
of ones and zeros.

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.420
Eight ones and zeros is called a byte.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.469
After that, we use the metric system to name
larger and larger sets of data.

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.330
A kilobyte is a thousand bytes of information,
a megabyte is a million and a gigabyte is

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.990
a billion.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.820
And a gigabyte is already a lot of information.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.220
A gigabyte is seven minutes of HD-TV.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.130
Two gigabytes is the information stored in
a shelf of books 60 feet long.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.590
And a standard DVD can hold 5 gigabytes.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.650
However, gigabytes are small potatoes in the
LHC world.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.420
A terabyte is a trillion bytes and a petabyte
is a quadrillion bytes.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.280
In other words, a petabyte is a million gigabytes.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.870
And a petabyte is the most relevant unit for
the LHC data.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.250
So how big is a petabyte?

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.159
Suppose that we represent a single byte by
a floor tile that is half a square meter.&nbsp;

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.470
That’s a square 70 centimeters on a side
or a little over two feet square for my American

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.800
viewers.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.390
&nbsp;
A kilobyte is then 500 square meters, which

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.980
is an eighth of an acre, or half the size
of the size of the parcel of land your house

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.269
sits on if you’re a typical American suburban
homeowner with a quarter-acre lot.

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.470
&nbsp;
A megabyte is much bigger and corresponds

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.410
to the size of the Pentagon if you include
the parking lots.&nbsp;

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.100
That’s half a square kilometer.&nbsp;

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.310
It’s also about the size of Vatican City.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.940
&nbsp;
A gigabyte is a thousand times bigger still

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.810
and is the size of Tulsa, Oklahoma, a fine
town if ever there was one, and birthplace

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.440
of Route 66.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.420
It has an area of about 500 square kilometers.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.560
&nbsp;
A terabyte is equivalent to half a million

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.830
square kilometers.&nbsp;

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.840
That’s about the same as the combined area
of four U.S. states: Illinois, home of Fermilab,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.190
my favorite laboratory, plus Indiana, Wisconsin
and Ohio.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.910
If you’d like to imagine a singe country
instead, that’s the area of Thailand.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.000
&nbsp;
But to get a petabyte, this is represented

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.819
by half a billion square kilometers and, for
that, you need the surface of the entire Earth.

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.510
&nbsp;
I hope this cements just how big a petabyte

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.510
is.&nbsp;

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.000
If a byte is as big as a floor tile, a petabyte
is the surface of the entire planet.&nbsp;

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.660
And remember that the LHC experiments record
lots of petabytes per year, and that is a

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.100
ton of data.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.350
CERN is ready for this enormous amount of
data.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.660
Combined with the Wigner data center in Budapest,
Hungary, CERN has available 150 petabytes

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.849
of disk storage.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.450
That’s enough to store over a thousand years
of HD movies.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.019
The CERN computing facility can absorb up
to 10 gigabytes a second.

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.450
And each year, the LHC experiments generate
over 50 petabytes of data that is stored to

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.450
tape.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.980
So I’ve just been talking about storage
capacity, but you also need computers to crunch

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.209
the data.

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.450
For the CMS experiment, we’re talking about
100,000 independent CPU cores, spread across

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.150
the globe in a giant network called the Grid.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.580
The Grid consists of over sixty independent
computer centers, distributed across the world.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.010
If you try to run a computer program that
analyzes LHC data, the system scours the world

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.130
for un-utilized computers and runs your program
on the distant computer.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.190
When the computer is finished, it ships back
the result to you.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.729
If you’re going to be shipping data all
across the world, you need excellent connectivity.

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.020
You really do need primo networks.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.840
To give you a sense of scale, if you needed
to send a petabyte of data from Europe to

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.449
the US using DSL, it would take ten years.

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.740
Even using the network cable connection you
might have to your house would take eight

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.740
months.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:51.560
However, using the state-of-the-art Transatlantic
links that run at 340 billion bits per second,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.990
we can transfer a petabyte of data in under
seven hours.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.330
That’s smokin’.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.860
When you get right down to it, the discoveries
of the LHC rely crucially on computing systems

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.160
around the world.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.810
And that trend will continue.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.169
So the next time you feel the need to swear
at the network responsivity of your home computer,

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.119
keep in mind the problems of the LHC computer
professionals.

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:31.500
Your problems could be way worse.
