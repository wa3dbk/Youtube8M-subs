00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.869
Never played Robot Rescue? Boy, are you in
for a headache. I mean, a treat.

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.550
A headache-flavored treat.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.660
I mean, chocolate.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.820
It�s Robot Rescue 5G...I mean, 3D.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:48.180
So if you had a DSi, you might recognize Robot
Rescue. The original game and its sequel were

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.890
both released on DSiWare. And here they are.
They�ve been repackaged in one compilation

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.949
with Robot Rescue 3D. Not only that, there�s
also a bunch of new levels reworked in 3D

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.720
and called, simply, Robot Rescue 3D. So you�re
essentially getting a third game, as well.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.610
And you�re getting it all for two dollars.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.450
So the value here is fantastic. All together,
there�s more than 120 puzzles in Robot Rescue

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.170
3D, and again...if you�ve never played Robot
Rescue, holy sh*t balls, you�re in for a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.920
kick to the brain. These games have some of
the most maddening puzzles in the history

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.820
of puzzles. They will literally make you nauseous.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.230
And I mean that as a compliment.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.910
Listen, don�t be a pussy. Drink some pink
bismuth.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.720
Across all three games, the puzzles basically
take the same approach. Lots of doors, lots

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.099
of switches, lots of conveyor belts...lots
of headaches. Robot Rescue is obviously about

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:49.619
rescuing robots, so there�s a very mechanical
approach to the levels. It�s like figuring

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.050
out how to put Mouse Trap together. Remember
that?

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.200
And then you�d just knock it over. Haha!

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.380
Robot Rescue can be a lot to handle, uh, both
mentally and visually. We�ll get to the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.340
visual part later, but seriously...these puzzles
are brutal. I actually mentioned this in our

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.069
review of Robot Rescue 2, but the levels almost
feel like they were designed by some smart-ass

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.390
dork with a level editor. They just have a
chaotic, messy look...which is actually very

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.390
daunting.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:28.880
It takes thought just to make sense of the
puzzles, let alone solve them.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.680
Another part of the challenge comes from the
fact that...you�re controlling multiple

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.090
characters at once. And if just one of them
bumps into something they shouldn�t, it�s

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.150
game over. Eventually, there are tons of them
on the screen, and it�s an incredible challenge

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.120
to move them safely in sync.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:51.150
None of the Robot Rescue games f*ck around
with story or any extraneous nonsense. They�re

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.760
all about the puzzles. Unfortunately, that
seems to come at the cost of all other things.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.480
Specifically, graphics. Listen, it�s not
a matter of, �Oh, bad color use. Have you

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.060
no concept of color harmony?� It�s more
like, �Uh, those colors look so bad together,

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.290
they�re literally making my eyes hurt.�

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:22.360
Even in 3D, Robot Rescue looks like crayon
vomit.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.360
The Robot Rescue games have always had strengths
and weaknesses. Strengths in these awesome,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.140
complex puzzles about transporting robots.
Weaknesses in the paint jobs used for those

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.209
puzzles and robots. There�s actually not
much replay value here, either. But for two

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.930
bucks? I mean, at that price, Robot Rescue
3D is a no-brainer.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.640
See, because...you�ll tear yours out.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.520
This game is ridiculous.
