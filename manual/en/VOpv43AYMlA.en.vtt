00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:44.018
Those people talking
What would their trouble be

00:00:44.592 --> 00:00:50.735
Are they laughing at me 
Or are they not looking

00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:55.608
From sometime there 
Are a lot of lingering friends

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.829
You put your hands on my shoulder
Who are you guys

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:08.651
Then you gotta stay the same
I know you're trying to sit on me

00:01:09.094 --> 00:01:14.934
'cause I'm really good at this
to downtown, I deserve to go

00:01:15.306 --> 00:01:20.716
there's no reason not to go
for what I said so long ago

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.066
that's not a fault of yours
I wanna wanna be like this

00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:38.826
Why always try to leave me alone
I keep my head up and keep my mouth shut

00:01:39.217 --> 00:01:50.697
why always need to wait for so long
I keep my way, do things my own way

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.415
What should I say
It’s always been difficult

00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:25.115
I don’t know myself
How do you know me so well?

00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:33.509
Even if I get abandoned easily 
Again I’ll smile at it

00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:38.398
You have me in your arms

00:02:39.324 --> 00:02:44.271
Then you gotta stay the same
I know you're trying to sit on me

00:02:45.124 --> 00:02:50.243
'cause I'm really good at this
to downtown, I deserve to go

00:02:50.996 --> 00:02:56.418
there's no reason not to go
for what I said so long ago

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.142
that's not a fault of yours
I wanna wanna be like this

00:03:03.574 --> 00:03:15.067
Why always try to leave me alone
I keep my head up and keep my mouth shut

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:27.136
why always need to wait for so long
I keep my way, do things my own way
