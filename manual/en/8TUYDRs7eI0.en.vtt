00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.719
An ingrown toenail occurs when the side of
the nail grows in towards the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.429
skin, resulting in pain, inflammation, and
swelling.

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.180
If the nail penetrates
the skin, this can result in an infection,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.650
which is a serious condition.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.970
The most common causes of an ingrown toenail
is improper nail care, cutting

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.140
your nails too short on the sides of the nail,
picking and pulling the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.440
nail, nail trauma, and sometimes just congenital.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.520
You may be born with the
tendency of your nail to grow in more on the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.190
sides than others.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.649
So how do you prevent an ingrown toenail?

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.829
Proper nail cutting is
essential.

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.699
When you cut your nails, cut them straight
across.

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.860
Don't cut
them in on the sides.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.040
Don't pull in on the sides.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.810
Cut them straight across
and file them gently.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.420
It's best to cut your nails after a bath or
a shower

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.579
when they are soft and supple.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.149
This technique is correct for the majority
of the population.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.440
However, if
you have an incurvated nail, you may need

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.190
to cut into the corners to
prevent them from ingrowing.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.490
If you have thickened or fungal nails, cutting
your nails can be extremely

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.490
difficult.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.890
Go see your local podiatrist who can cut it
for you safely.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.520
If you are diabetic, have circulation problems,
or have a compromised

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.450
immune system, you should also seek medical
attention in caring for your

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.450
nails.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.920
If you develop pain and swelling around the
nail, you should start soaking

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.920
immediately.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.090
I usually recommend a dilute Betadine solution
or a solution

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.140
with a little Epsom salt.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.009
Soak a minimum of 10 to 15 minutes.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.640
Take your foot
out of the water, dry it, and apply a little

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.810
antibiotic and cover with a
Band-Aid.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.750
If this doesn't relieve the condition, seek
medical attention.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.470
If your toe
becomes infected and starts to drain, seek

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.110
medical attention immediately.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.110
Typically, when someone presents with an ingrown
toenail to our office, we

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.000
do a local anesthetic block, followed by excision
of the nail border that's

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.250
growing into the skin.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.570
If you have chronic ingrown toenails, there
are

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.060
procedures that we can do where we destroy
the matrix where the nail grows

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.280
from and prevent the nail from regrowing.
