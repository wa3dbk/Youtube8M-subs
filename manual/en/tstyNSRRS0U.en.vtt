00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:19.000
Yeah.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.490
I seem to get stuck with the weird anime-related
games.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.519
But I’m comfortable with my lot in life.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.019
But then Felicity in Worcestershire sent us
something I’d never heard of.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.680
Not in a million years.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.510
A strange, kid-friendly platformer based on
an anime that ran for 37 episodes in 1991.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.079
And after scouring Youtube to find a couple
episodes, I can say this... we weren’t really

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.079
missing much.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.940
It centers upon this kid Ashibe, who does
**** ALL in this game, and his pet harp seal

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.500
pup who does all the heavy lifting, despite
being a **** SEAL.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.920
And for whatever reason, they’re in an amusement
park.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.530
And for whatever reason, they have to collect
things and then get to an exit, because of

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.769
reasons.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.920
I may be oversimplifying, but a more likely
reason is that there’s just not much to

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.920
this game.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.470
You progress through a number of stages, which
contain eight... things... that you have to

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.470
assemble to open up the exit.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.470
Could be apples.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.970
Could be stars.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.330
Could be octopi or rabbits or anything else.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.670
Some are sitting out in the open, and some
have to be jarred into play by headbutting

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.110
objects that may or may not be background
decoration.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.740
You don’t really know until you try.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.930
Unfortunately, for the rare times that you
come up against a hostile creature, your headbutt

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.560
does NOTHING to dissuade the beast (“beast”
in this case possibly meaning “kindergartener”)

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.420
and, instead, you go flying and lose an arbitrary
number of collected things.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.000
Kinda like Sonic losing rings, only you still
don’t die even if you lose your last collected

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
thing.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.210
See that extra-life tracker down there?

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.450
I didn’t actually find any way to LOSE lives.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.920
Instead, the difficulty comes via tricky platforming,
crappy control (especially on ice, which is

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.190
ridiculous for a creature native to CANADA
AND GREENLAND), irrational physics, and the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:16.810
occasional ridiculous request, like headbutting
basketballs into a hippo’s mouth.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.580
Four times.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.810
But for as juvenile as the subject material
may be - emphasized by Goma-chan (the seal)

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.630
making cute noises to the camera if left idle
for even a couple seconds - at least some

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.710
effort went into the game.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.840
Case in point: cite me one other game of its
era that includes different hanging-off-the-edge

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.100
animations depending on which way the character’s
facing at the time.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.560
I can’t think of any.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.790
It’s obvious this is a kids’ game, but
it’s refreshing to know that it’s not

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.720
the kind of absolute shovelware that such
a designation might imply today.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.360
And, it gave me a reason to watch videos of
baby seals of different species, for research

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.450
purposes.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.430
You try that, and it’s called just slacking
off.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.410
I was doing DUE DILIGENCE in ascertaining
that’s a Harp seal.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.310
You’re welcome, internets.
