00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In Parshat Behar, God gives Moses

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
some advice

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
on a rather unexpected subject:

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
sustainable farming practices.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
At first, this doesn't seem

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
like a very logical thing

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
for the Torah to talk about.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Specifically, Behar comes in the wake

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
of some very un-flower-bed-like ideas.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Like last week, in Parshat Emor,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we learned about rules for priests,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
how to celebrate the holidays,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and the killing of blasphemers

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
- pretty heavy stuff.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Whereas salads, on the other hand,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
are well, light and delicious.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It comes as quite a curveball

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
when God tells Moses

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that the Children of Israel

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
will farm the land for six years straight

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and then take the seventh year off

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
as a year of rest.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Moses and the people are in the desert!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
There is no water –

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
let alone mineral-rich soil,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
seeds, and all the other good stuff

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
you need to start a farm.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But the Torah is always looking ahead

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
with long-term plans.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So, once the people have land,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
God says to grow fruits, vegetables,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and till the ground for six years.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Enjoy the all of the wonderful bounty

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that comes out of the land

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and savor the taste

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
of this freshly grown food.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Then, on the seventh year, stop,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
for the seventh year shall be

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
a year of complete rest for the land.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
There will be no growing of wheat,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
no harvesting grapes for wine,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and all of the cultivation of the land

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
will come to a complete halt.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You can’t own or sell anything

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
it will fall off the trees and the vines

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and it must lie there for anyone’s taking

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
you, your workers, your neighbors

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and all the animals around.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This seventh year will give

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the soil and the farmers

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
a much needed rest.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Just like Shabbat, the seventh day,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
when humans are commanded

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to stop working and take a break,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the land should do the same thing.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The year of rest is called "shmita"

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
which literally means "release,"

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and refers to the full year of rest

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that occurs every seventh year.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Also, after seven cycles of seven years –

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
on the 50th year - there's a huge Jubilee!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
In that year, which is like 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
a Shabbat of Shabbats,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
not only can you not plant, sow, or reap

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
from the soil, but all the plots of land 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
go back to their original owner.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The people are in the desert now,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
but in the future, God tells Moses,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
every family will receive a piece of land.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Sure, you can rent or sell your plot.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But when the Jubilee year rolls around,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
the land reverts back

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
to those original owners.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
That way, no one ends up land-less,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and there will be no real landlords or tenants,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
only people with a 49-year rent agreement.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Because really, God says, the land is mine. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Behar’s strict rules

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
about shmita can be really confusing&nbsp; -

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
but incorporating the ideas

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
of rest and release

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
into our lives is important.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Farmers need to take the time

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to rest and sustain themselves,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
their bodies, and the soil they cultivate

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
year after year.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
By physically taking a break

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
from farming and tilling the land,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
this gives our bodies&nbsp;

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
a chance to relax and recuperate.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
By letting the land rest,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
this gives the earth a chance

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
to breathe deep and let the rays of sunshine

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and heavy raindrops penetrate into the soil.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
If you live near farmland

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
or a farmers' market

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
you notice the seasonality of the crops

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and what's available at certain times of year.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Once the nighttime gets cooler

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and the first frost comes,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
there are no more tomatoes on the vines

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and the strawberries are long gone.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
We’ll have to wait patiently

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
for those red fruits to magically reappear

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
in the spring.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
By giving the land and the farmers

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
a much needed rest every seventh year,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
it helps us stop and greatly appreciate

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the earth which holds the rich soil

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that provides us with precious food

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
that comes out of the ground

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
year after year.
