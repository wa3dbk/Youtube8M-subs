00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:07.161
- Weather said 70.

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:09.904
I should probably wear a sweater

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:13.389
and bring a jacket for later.

00:00:16.357 --> 00:00:17.987
- I feel really good about this.

00:00:18.443 --> 00:00:20.023
Just the right amount of cats.

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.391
- Fruit intake for the
day, one clementine.

00:00:26.628 --> 00:00:28.455
I should eat some protein before three.

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.854
- Mmmm. I think I just made a new flavor.

00:00:34.807 --> 00:00:37.024
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

00:00:37.178 --> 00:00:39.393
- Okay. You wanna get
dinner? Maybe like dimsum?

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.806
- Hey, you okay?
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:45.848
- You don't seem fine.

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.644
- Actually, I'm having a really weird day.

00:00:48.644 --> 00:00:49.920
- No.
- Yeah, I don't know ...

00:00:51.943 --> 00:00:56.091
- 20% of 17.45 divide by ten

00:00:57.167 --> 00:01:00.029
- 17.45. I'm just going to give her ten.

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:02.927
She was great. Follow your dreams, Donna.

00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:06.921
- I just think it's kind
of weird that I've never

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:08.472
Oh! Do know where we parked the car?

00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:11.243
- Yeah. We're on the second floor, row B.

00:01:11.243 --> 00:01:12.792
It's quite near the elevators, but...

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:14.897
- I know we parked by a red car.

00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:16.897
I think it might have had
lightning bolts on it.

00:01:16.897 --> 00:01:18.964
- Which floor?
- Um, I don't know.

00:01:22.062 --> 00:01:23.556
- Yeah, I mean, I think
I'm going to see him again,

00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:24.302
cause, he's, you know,

00:01:24.302 --> 00:01:26.517
he's from the Northeast,
his family's healthy,

00:01:26.517 --> 00:01:28.528
they don't have any
history of heart disease,

00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:30.291
and he wants to have kids.

00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:32.978
So if that's not compatibility,

00:01:32.978 --> 00:01:35.411
eventually followed by
love, I don't know what is.

00:01:36.168 --> 00:01:37.488
- Yeah, I don't know, it's just

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.488
my heart feels really light,
I guess, when I'm around him.

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:43.434
Does that make sense?

00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:47.783
- This movie is full of plot holes.

00:01:47.783 --> 00:01:49.349
- Yeah, but it looks incredible.

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:51.704
- Sure, but how can he be her sister?

00:01:51.704 --> 00:01:55.580
- Just let it go. Just let it
go. Just focus on the colors.

00:01:58.106 --> 00:01:59.629
- [Allison] I can't.

00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:06.711
- Are you an alien? You have
to tell me if you're an alien.
