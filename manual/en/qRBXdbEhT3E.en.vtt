00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.500
The Seoul Metropolitian Government has officially
launched a new bus service that will be operating

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.200
in the wee hours... from midnight to 5AM everyday.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.850
While most are in favor of the so-called 'Owl'
buses... there are those who are not.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.720
Connie Lee has more.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.430
It's a little past midnight... and the first
night bus of the day, is off.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.750
This N37 will be making more than a dozen
stops before it ends its route at 5AM.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.079
Branded as the "Owl Bus," these night buses
shine its owl logo on the front and side...

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.540
to signal their nighttime duty.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.469
The city of Seoul is currently running two
night bus routes in a trial run,... but come

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.379
Friday... seven more routes will be added
to the list,... making it nine routes in total.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.520
The trial run of the first two routes was
a success, with more than 2-thousand passengers

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.210
using the bus each day.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.059
"It's a little past 2AM here in Seoul,...
but as you can see behind me, this night bus

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.500
is full of passengers."

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.159
"I'm using the night bus for the first time
today after hanging out with friends.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.740
I think it's great and convenient.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.310
The bus stops near my house and it's also
cheaper than taking a taxi."

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.280
It costs 1,850 won,... or about a dollar and
70 cents-- much cheaper than taking a taxi,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.990
which has a starting rate of about 2-dollars
and 60 cents after midnight.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.560
In a survey, the government found 88 percent
of Seoul residents in favor of having more

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.990
of these buses.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.540
But there are also those... who are not so
pleased.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.560
"...For taxi drivers like us that get a lot
of business in the late hours, these new buses

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.729
are going to affect our business."

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.799
Government officials, however, disagree.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.299
"The people who use the night buses are different
from those who take taxis.

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.530
Passengers who don't mind the waiting time...
will take the night buses.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.729
But those who want to get to their destinations
quickly... will take taxis.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.620
So we don't think taxi drivers will be that
affected."

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.900
The wait for each bus could in fact be pretty
long -- 40 to-45 minutes on average.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.230
And, as safety is a concern, especially late
at night,....

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.930
Owl Bus drivers can only drive under the speed
limit of 70 kilometers an hour, and they cannot

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.290
have worked during the day.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.980
