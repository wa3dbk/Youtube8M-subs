00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.170
NARRATOR: What makes
this photo so unusual

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.830
is not the fact that this
guy is suspended hundreds

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.260
of feet above the ground off
the edge of the sheer cliff.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.760
No.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.000
It's that he's hanging there
with some sort of giant drill

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.150
gun.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.980
It seems like an odd place
to do construction, so

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.650
what exactly is he doing?

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.229
The photographer rappelling
right above him was this guy.

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:26.270
MATTHEW PARENT: Hi there.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.640
My name is Matthew Parent.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.320
I am a freelance photographer
and filmmaker based out

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.980
of Los Angeles, California.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.650
This photo was taken just
outside Chihuahua, Mexico,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.650
in a climbing area
called Nuevo Majalca.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.580
This photo is of my good
friend and fellow climbing

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.370
partner, Gaz Lee.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.890
He is a prolific route setter.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.140
NARRATOR: Route setters
aren't the people you normally

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.640
think about when it comes to
the sport of rock climbing.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.370
That's because whenever
you watch a person climb,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.490
the routes have most likely
already been set before them,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.620
but people like Gaz go
searching for untouched cliffs

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.400
and boulders and design
their own routes to traverse.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.470
And that's what Gaz was
doing in this photo.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.940
He used the drill to
set bolts in the rock

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.250
as anchors for climbers
to latch onto for safety.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.750
MATTHEW PARENT:
Climbing development

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.410
is a very serious thing.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.680
There are a lot of
ways you can mess up,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.340
and if you don't
do it correctly,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.430
someone can die on your route.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.150
To get this photo,
we actually had

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.770
to haul about 30 to
40 pounds of gear

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.020
up the backside of this
loose gravelly cliff.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.370
Swapping lenses 200
feet off the ground

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.310
is one of the most interesting
experiences I'll ever have.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.860
NARRATOR: Not to
mention dangerous.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.276
You've got to have a lot of
trust in your climbing partner

00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:43.610
to reach heights like this.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.280
It's a bond that's often
built over years of friendship

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.660
and climbing experience,
but for Matt and Gaz,

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.260
the day this photo was
taken, it was the first time

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.140
the two had ever met in person.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.180
The two were at
Nuevo Majalca working

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.620
for the nonprofit, Escalando
Fronteras, an organization that

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.920
connects kids living in at
risk and underdeveloped areas

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.260
to rock climbing.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.355
MATTHEW PARENT: We just
kind of linked up online

00:02:05.355 --> 00:02:07.660
and decided that, hey, we should
probably go on this adventure

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.270
together.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.169
So I flew in.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.199
He picked me up.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.090
We drove immediately
to Chihuahua,

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.110
where he was teaching
a bolting clinic

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.940
for local Mexican climbers.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.630
NARRATOR: The sport isn't
very popular in Mexico,

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.330
but this is exactly why
Matt and Gaz were there--

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.010
to carve out new
routes that had never

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.375
been climbed before for a small
community eager to learn how.

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:29.750
MATTHEW PARENT:
It has to be said

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.541
that the local climbing
community in Mexico

00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:33.540
is absolutely beautiful.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.880
I mean the people you
meet when you travel

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.920
are more often than not the
most friendly, hospitable,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.690
warm people you could
ever possibly meet.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.050
And with Mexico, especially,
this is no exception.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.974
People take you in.

00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:48.170
They feed you.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.396
They laugh with you.

00:02:49.396 --> 00:02:50.270
They drink with you.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.470
Every moment is just
absolutely fantastic,

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.482
and they're so excited
to show you around

00:02:54.482 --> 00:02:56.610
and to show you
this climbing area

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.820
that they feel
like ownership for.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.360
It's a breathtaking area,
and to capture moments

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.850
like this that show a side of
the world and a side of society

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.764
that not many people were
aware of is a wonderful thing.

00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:13.305
