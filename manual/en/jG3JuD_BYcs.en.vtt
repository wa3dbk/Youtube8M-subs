Presenter:
Hey, everyone, it’s going to 104 degrees

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.130
today.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.130
Crazy hot.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.059
So I thought I’d get up a little early and
make a Potato Crust Breakfast Pizza for you

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.010
on the Cooking Everything Outdoors show.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.510
Announcer:
The Cooking Everything Outdoors show is sponsored

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.269
by Camp Chef and www.OutdoorCooking.com and
www.IslandGrillstone.com.

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.730
Presenter:
So the original recipe came from my friends

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.810
at Klondike Brands.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.990
It’s their potato crust pizza.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.570
And it’s basically just a potato crust and
you put all your flavorings on top of it.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.930
And I thought what a perfect idea for breakfast
pizza and that’s we’re going to make today.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.020
So, for our ingredients for our potato crust
pizza you’re going to need about 2 pounds

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.060
of shredded Klondike Gold Potatoes, about
a 1/4 teaspoon of salt, 1 egg scrambled, 1/4

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.370
cup of caramelized onion, some vegetable oil.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.670
And I’m going to be adding some fresh cracked
rainbow peppercorns.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.110
The first thing we need to do is we need to
shred our 2 pounds of potatoes and do this

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.100
however you need to do it, but I just about
basically a shredder box here.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.150
So now we need to get the moisture out of
our shredded potatoes.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.250
And I’ll just use a flower towel.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.420
You can use paper towels.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.900
You can use your hands.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.920
But we’re just going to dump those out and,
you know, there’s a lot of water content

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:42.090
in potatoes and we’re going to bring out
as much water possible can.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.940
So let’s mix this up and get our crust ready.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.479
So I add our salt.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.530
Our egg.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.540
Our onion.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.010
And the rainbow peppercorns.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.870
And then you want to save the oil.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.670
I’m going to show you what that’s going
to be used for in a little bit.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.679
Just get in there and blend this all up.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.599
So at this point you have a couple of options.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:17.319
You can layer your potato crust pizza in a
pie pan, which works really nice or you can

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.410
use a pizza pan, which I like to use.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.430
And this one has a little bit of lip, but
I don’t think I have enough to go out that

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.799
far.

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.129
So, take a little bit of the vegetable oil
or some spray oil and let’s coat the bottom

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:37.590
of the pan, and then we’re going to spread
our potatoes out really thinly.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:45.819
And I look for roughly a 1/4 to 3/8 of an
inch.

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.980
So, to cook our potato crust breakfast pizza
I’m going to be using the Camp Chef Somerset

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.900
Gas Grill and the Italia pizza oven accessory.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.209
We’re going to cook the potato crust first.

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.469
So I’m going to preheat this.

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:05.900
I’m going to get it cranked up 450-500 degrees
and then we’ll put this in the oven.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.470
Well, we’re at 475, creeping up to 500.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.389
It’s right where I want it.

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.620
We’re going to put our potato crust pizza,
our base.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:26.549
We’re going to put that in the pizza oven
for about 20 minutes.

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.290
So our potato crust pizza is just about done.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.709
I’m going to start working on my toppings.

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.650
Now this is your breakfast you do it your
way, this is what I’m going to be doing.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.849
I have some nice mushrooms, some red pepper,
some green onion, some yellow onion, and some

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.959
sausage, and of course, some eggs will be
going on the top of this.

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.870
Skill is hot, let’s get some sausage going.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.999
And I want to get my onions in there, too.

00:03:54.999 --> 00:04:06.200
These are going to 
take the longest to cook.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:20.229
Let’s add in the rest of our ingredients,
red pepper, mushrooms, green onions.

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.159
Now we need to oil our pizza crust.

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.639
Just a little bit of oil on the top of this
and the reason we’re doing that is because

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.150
it’s good to crisp it up just a little bit
more.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.389
So, put that back in our pizza oven.

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.389
Keep an eye on it.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.440
You don’t want to burn it.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:43.810
And we’ll brown that up a bit more.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.650
Put our toppings on and finish this bad boy
up.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.669
Alright, let’s load this up.

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:59.260
Let’s add our eggs.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:07.620
I’m going to add some cheese when it’s
done.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:18.509
Let’s get this back in the pizza oven.

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.620
Our breakfast pizza should be ready.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.000
There you go.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.060
Let’s sprinkle on a little bit of cheese.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:35.240
And that’s it, my friends, it’s the Klondike
Brands Potato crust breakfast pizza recipe.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.939
I hope you like this.

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:38.700
I know I’m going to like this.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.319
I’m going to slice up a couple of pieces
here in just a second and give it a shot.

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:47.389
Look at that.

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:55.770
If you haven’t tried to potato crust pizza
before, you need to try this.
