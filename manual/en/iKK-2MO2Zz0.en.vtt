We used to say 5, 10 years ago that people
without mobile phone, no mobile no life

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.456
but in the future mobile is life,
that's where I see things heading.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.510

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.460
Eric Schaffer -  All of a sudden people were empowered

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.740
All of a sudden it changed the ability
of people to connect, to function;

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.223
I don't know how we would survive in the
emerging markets without mobile devices.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.973
And we see huge differences, we're
working in the townships in Africa

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.456
and it means something different
there than in India.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.290
It has -- each area has adapted and used
that technology to empower their culture.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.353
Speaker Apala Chavan - In Peru, Kenya, exploring -- what
does it mean for poor farmers to engage

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.723
through technology, through the mobile phone,
to engage with financial services, fascinating.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.080
They do not like the fact that they feel
intimidated when they go to the branch

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.213
because they feel they are poor, they are
wearing clothes that aren't good enough

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.133
to be built to wear inside that bank
branch, they seem so intimidated

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.043
that they are very willing
to adopt this mobile phone.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:13.830
Now the mobile phone is a mediator between
a situation that is uncomfortable for them

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.503
and being able to use services of that
bank so they look at this technology

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.370
with such awe and with such hope.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.776
speaker Kristina Hook - Design has to be seriously researched,
it's not that because we're looking at play,

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.396
we're all just playing at work, sometimes we
do that too but it's actually that we're trying

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.010
to do a serious study of the unserious.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.476
new speaker - I'm sure even the networks will
be more user centric than just how

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.013
to get us a broadcast medium and
the device should know more about me

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.356
than me getting to know more about the device.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.820
new speaker - It can add as a secondary brain, use the
part of mobile in the context that it has to,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.200
you know, empower me to be more efficient.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.660
Speaker Kristina Hook - Now why we are here in India is this
is because is where mobile is happening

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.970
and as you say, you're leapfrogging and
you're innovating in an interest way

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.200
that we find absolutely fascinating.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.440
Speaker Atul Saraf -  everything has moved way forward
in future and there are a few things

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.950
which are stuck way way back,
it is unbelievable contrast.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.226
Speaker Kristina Hook - Oh, that's amazing.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.153
Speaker Atul Saraf - In a similar village next to
that, something slightly embarrassing

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.646
but they have these open toilets
right,in India there are lot of spaces

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.890
where they don't have facilities at home but
the strange phenomena is that that the spot

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.290
where they go keeps shifting and later, the
people realize that that the pattern is more

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.936
because they like it better or as dirtier but
it is because of the signals of mobile phones.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.510
[ Applause ]

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.766
In general the trend is that the need --

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.660
the social need for being
connected is topmost for people.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.953
Speaker Kristina Hook - It's not enough for us anymore to design
things that are local around the mobile,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.350
one person, so on because this is sending
data up here which means that we can see --

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.756
look at patterns from many
people and use that to feed back

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.323
into our applications and change them.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.630
So you have this cloud lining
that is connecting us.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.573
New speaker - You can collect and then you can
also crowd source back to these users

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.893
by having a collaborator platform,
achieving whatever you want.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.743
So I think mobile will play a huge role
in the emerging markets in the future.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.276
Speaker Apala Chavan - We also realized in our work in the future that even we all are looking at the present

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.940
`

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.393
And we're looking at what's
going on now and maybe in solutions

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.633
when I guess we better start predicting
where the future is going to be.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.673
New speaker from Sweden - We really don't have something to carry
anymore, maybe we can just go ourselves

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.170
and use anything as an interface.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.506
New speaker from Sweden - It's like having it
everywhere and for all purposes

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.396
Speaker Atual Saraf -  A true mobile has been -- you have
already looked for it to find out.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.296
It is so pervasive that you would
not be able to differentiate

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.546
with yourself or your things around you.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.810
New speaker from Sweden - We traveled from Sweden to
India so there's your answer there,

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.376
I think the future of mobile is in India

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.510
