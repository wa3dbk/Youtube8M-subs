Hi, I'm Jennifer from Workroom Social and
I'm going to show you how to use a blind hem

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.110
foot on your sewing machine.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.720
Before we start, we need to prepare the fabric
that we're going to use when using this foot.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.340
I have this piece of fabric and I just want
to make a fake hem.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.930
We're going to do a double-turned hem.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:31.400
I'm just going to fold this half up and give
it a little press.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.160
Then I'm going to take it and fold it again
so that this raw edge is enclosed and we cannot

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.820
see it, and then give it a little press.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.610
Great.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.980
If you look from the front side, we just have
a nice, clean, finished edge.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.900
Now, before we use our foot, we need to prepare
this further.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.720
What you want to do is take, from the wrong
side of your fabric, the side with the fold,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.670
you want to flip it over so that your finished
edge is on your left and the rest of your

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.070
garment or your fake edge if you're doing
a test like this, is on your right.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.380
Then you want to take your garment and pull
it back to the left, so you kind of make this

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.860
shape here on the edge of your fabric.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:44.560
Now, from here, we want to measure about a
quarter of an inch, so get your seam guide

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:54.840
out and measure about a quarter of an inch
and we're going to give this a slight press.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.460
We don't want to press this too hard because
we don't want to make a crease in the fabric.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.950
But, as you can see, this is bubbling a lot
and so, when we put that through the sewing

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.170
machine, it's going to be a little obnoxious.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.239
If you hover your iron across the top so just
some steam gets on the fabric, it's going

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.519
to just flatten that out a little bit.

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:33.419
Then what you can do is get your pins out
and pin your seams together to hold everything

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.040
in place.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.020
Now we've prepared our fabric and we're ready
to go to our sewing machine.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.550
We have our hem prepared and now we're going
to attach our blind hem foot.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.820
When you do a blind hem on a sewing machine,
your sewing machine stitches several straight

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:59.510
stitches and then it does one zigzag stitch
to the left to kind of catch the fabric.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.570
On the blind hem foot we have a little gauge
on the side that kind of helps align your

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.700
fabric so that the bite that the zigzag takes
only catches the very edge of the fabric.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:19.320
Take your foot and you're just going to put
it down on your machine, attach it like so.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.790
Make sure you take your top thread and put
it underneath and both threads to the back.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.220
The blind hem foot, because every sewing machine
is different, it has a gauge so you can kind

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.410
of move it to the left or right.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.310
You should do some tests at home first to
make sure that you've got it in a good position.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.840
Right now I'm going to take my prepared piece
of fabric and I'm going to put the quarter

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.220
inch on the right, underneath the foot.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:59.750
Then I'm going to take this little attachment
here and put the fold on top of it, and then

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.070
I'll lower my presser foot.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.419
What you want to see is that the attachment
I have here on the right is actually sitting

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.950
underneath the fold on the left.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.130
Before you start stitching, make sure you
go to your stitch selector and select the

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.730
blind hem stitch.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.700
On mine, it looks kind of like mountains and
valleys.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.380
You want something that's kind of got a couple
of things going sideways and then up in a

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.690
triangle, and then sideways again.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.380
Then you should pick your stitch length; I'm
just keeping mine at a 2.5.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.420
Then you are ready to stitch.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.350
I'm going to do a couple of stitches and then,
when I get to my pins, I'm going to stop,

00:04:47.350 --> 00:05:05.330
pause and take my pins out because we don't
want to sew over our pins.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:15.660
When you're done, just pull your project out,
clip your thread tails and now, from that

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.820
side where we just hovered the iron for a
little bit of steam, this is what that side

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.480
looks like.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:35.430
Now, when you unfold this, this is what your
blind hem stitch looks like.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.770
Now we're going to take this to the iron,
press it flat, and it's going to look really,

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:40.770
really professional.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.610
Okay, now that we've made our stitch, we just
want to press this out so it's nice and flat.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:54.940
We'll just go to our fabric; if you're pressing
on the right side of your garment, make sure

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.200
you do some tests first to make sure that
the iron won't create a sheen on the fabric.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:10.460
We'll go to the back and just give it a nice
little iron.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.930
Then here's your blind hem stitch.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.300
Now we can see all the little bites that our
sewing machine made when it did that little

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.230
zigzag over to do the blind hem stitch.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:27.170
But, if you match your thread to your fabric
(for us blue), you really hardly notice these

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.170
stitches at all.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.500
So it's a really nice way to finish a garment
for a really professional look.
