00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.940
One stat you'll hear referenced from time
to time during a football game is called

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:14.210
Passer Rating. Which is a single number that seeks to describe how effective the quarterback, or whoever has been passing the ball,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.170
has been with his passes. It must be kept in mind the passer rating

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.160
only attempt to describe the passing
rather than the overall performance

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.039
of the quarterback, which would include how well he can keep a play alive, the rushing yards he might have, or even his play-calling ability.

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:38.920
The most confusing aspect of the passer
rating is probably that it's on a scale from 0 to 158.3.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.050
But maybe we can reduce some
of that confusion by breaking it down a bit further

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.390
and looking at the things that go into finding the number.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.700
Passer rating is calculated based on

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:56.680
five common stats: passes attempted, passes completed,
yards gained, touchdown passes, and interceptions.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.239
and more specifically, from those numbers
we can calculate: completion percentage,

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.049
average yards per attempt, percentage of
touchdown passes, and percentage of interceptions.

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:12.560
These percentages and averages are then plugged into a formula that compares them to a standard

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.320
that has been established based on
passing performances over the years.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.119
As mentioned earlier, the highest possible rating is 158.3, 
which is considered a perfect passer rating.

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.090
Though it's difficult to achieve, a
quarterback does not have to throw a touchdown with

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.790
every pass or even have to have an 100%
completion rate to get a perfect rating.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.170
For a perfect single-game rating a
quarterback must attempt at least ten passes

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.820
he can't throw any interceptions, and he must have a minimum

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.770
77.5% completion, 12% touchdown pass percentage,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.200
and gain at least 12.5 yards per attempted pass.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.290
It's not an easy task although some
quarterbacks have achieved the feat multiple times

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.500
there will probably be one game out of an entire
NFL season in which someone achieves a

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.060
perfect passer rating. Short of being perfect,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.079
any game and certainly any season in which a quarterback has a

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.629
passer rating over 100

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.200
is an excellent performance.
An average passer rating would be around 70.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.920
Now if you want to get technical, the passer
rating formula was developed in the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.310
1970s and it looks something like this:

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.120
Don't worry, it's not scary is it looks,
because as we said it is comprised of four parts.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.209
Completion percentage, average yards per attempt, percentage of touchdown passes, and percentage of interceptions.

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.050
The score in each of those four
categories can range anywhere from 0 to 2.375.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.720
And that makes one about average. The
best way to really understand this is

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.379
probably to run through example

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.690
so let's take a random game from Aaron 
Rodgers that he had back in 2009;

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.349
he has traditionally had one of the
strongest passer ratings of any quarterback.

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:01.360
On this particular afternoon Rodgers and
the Packers played San Francisco. Rogers ended up completing

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.580
32 of 45 passes attempted, which was good for 344 yards.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.030
Two of the passes were touchdown passes 
and he threw no interceptions.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.050
Part one is completion percentage.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.540
To get our number, we take our completions
and divide it by the number of attempts to give us

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.620
71.1% completion percentage,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.180
or in decimal form 0.711. Our formula next tells us to subtract 0.3

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:39.200
from this, and then multiply that number by 5.
Which comes out to 2.055.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.620
Part two is yards per attempt, so we take our 344 yards divide it by the 45 attempts--and note that this is passes attempted,

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.840
not just the passes completed--and this
gives us 7.644.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.260
From this number we subtract 3,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.330
to get 4.64 for and then divide that number

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.110
by 4 which gives us 1.161.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.220
Next is touchdowns per attempt, so 2 divided by 45

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.890
tells us that nearly 5% of the passes ended up in the end zone.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:21.820
We then multiply that number, which is technically 0.044,
by 20 which gives us 0.88.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.639
Finally we take our interceptions, which
Rodgers threw none of on this afternoon, and divide that by 45.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.990
So we get zero. And then we multiply that
by 25 which once again gives us zero.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:46.090
But since zero interceptions is good, we take this sum and we subtract it from the maximum score of 2.375, which leaves us with that 2.375.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.250
It's worth repeating here that the
maximum total any one at these numbers

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.639
can be is 2.375. Even if a quarterback
were to complete 100% percent of his passes,

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.680
and that would mean our value in that
category would come out to be 3.5, but

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.530
when we run through the next part of our
calculation we would only give him the

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.500
maximum value 2.375 in that category.
We would not give him 3.5.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.070
And this is so that we don't give any one category too much weight

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.430
over the others. The same thing applies with the minimum,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.979
which is zero. Even if we get a negative
figure we would give him a total of zero

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.710
in that category.
But let's get back to Rogers.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.130
Our next step is to ad these four
numbers up. So 2.055 +

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:38.100
1.161 + 0.88 + 2.375, that gives us 6.471.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:51.740
We then divide this number by 6 to get 1.078. 
Finally we multiply that by 100 to get our passer rating 107.8!

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.050
So it was not a perfect afternoon for Rogers,
but the Packers were able to defeat the 49ers

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:06.390
and a passer rating 108 is a pretty great day, 
but you can 'double check' the math if you want to.
