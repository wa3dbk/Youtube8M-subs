00:00:13.337 --> 00:00:16.363
Frankie, I need to speak
with you a minute. Please?

00:00:16.507 --> 00:00:19.340
- I got to go, Ma.
- No, sit down just a minute.

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:22.037
Would you please
come back a little later?

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:23.373
Thank you.

00:00:23.514 --> 00:00:25.482
- Ma, I got to go. All right?
- Just a few words.

00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:26.845
Listen to me. I got...

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:28.781
Please, sit down.
Just a few words.

00:00:29.387 --> 00:00:30.979
I've been thinking
about some things.

00:00:31.088 --> 00:00:34.615
If you'd been a preacher, your
brothers would have been preachers.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:35.783
Right.

00:00:35.893 --> 00:00:39.829
If you'd been a soldier, they'd
be soldiers. You know that.

00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:43.560
They came here because of you.
You called and they came running.

00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:44.690
Right.

00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:48.236
That's because
they look up to you.

00:00:48.372 --> 00:00:52.172
They always expect you
to know what's best.

00:00:52.944 --> 00:00:54.912
But even they know

00:00:55.212 --> 00:00:57.009
you don't shoot cops.

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:00.710
Even I know that.

00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:03.353
- Eva knows it.
- All right, Ma.

00:01:03.454 --> 00:01:05.945
The only one who doesn't seem to know is you!

00:01:06.057 --> 00:01:09.185
All right, Ma. I got to go. I promise
you, I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

00:01:09.293 --> 00:01:13.059
I never asked you where all this came
from because I didn't want to hear you lie.

00:01:13.197 --> 00:01:15.290
I didn't want you to worry about
it. Now, come on, I got to go.

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:16.866
Don't lie to me!

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:22.872
Don't do that.

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.875
Do you want to
make things so bad

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.812
for your family that they'll
leave you? Because they will.

00:01:30.915 --> 00:01:31.939
They'll understand.

00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:34.381
She will leave you.

00:01:34.485 --> 00:01:35.509
All right, Mama.

00:01:38.456 --> 00:01:40.083
I will leave you!
