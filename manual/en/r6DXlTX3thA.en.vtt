00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.000
French sections are ways of playing areas
of the wheel. The most popular of them, the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.430
best known of them, is called the Tiers Du
Cylindre, often mispronounced but not by me.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.250
If you look at your Roulette Wheel, the numbers
27-33 inclusive make up a nice little chunk

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.119
of the Roulette pie and that's twelve numbers
together on the wheel. Tiers Du Cylindre translates

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.580
from the French as "A third of the Cylinder",
so you've got a third of the numbers in your

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.030
favour, more or less, without discounting
the zero and you can place them on the table

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:47.600
as such; 5-8, ,10-11,13-16, 23-4, 27-30,33-36.
They're all what we call Chavals or Splits,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.650
when you're splitting your stake between the
two numbers. In total then, there are twelve

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.150
numbers on the Tiers Du Cylindre. You place
them nice and evenly, so for each six chip

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.790
outlay that you put, you're gonna treble up
and win eighteen chips. If you play the Tier

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.189
by one, a six chip outlay, an eighteen chip
return. And it's all those numbers pushed

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.740
up at the zero on the Roulette Wheel between
27 and 33 that are your winning numbers on

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.299
the Tier Du Cylindre.

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.900
French sections, lovely way of playing an
area of the wheel in your favour. There are

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.290
three of them; the Voisins Du Zero, the Tier
Du Cylindre and the Orphelins. The biggest

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.530
of the French sections is this one here that
we've got placed at the table. It's called

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.140
le' Voisins Du Zero, it covers every single
number on the Roulette Wheel, starting at

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.360
25, moving through the zero in the middle,
moving all the way round to 22 on the other

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.390
side of the wheel. 17 numbers of the 37, almost
half of the wheel are being backed by you.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.700
So you really want that ball to drop near
to the zero. It's a beautiful, lovely old-fashioned

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.440
way of playing. There's a classical chip placement
on the table here for you to do so. What do

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.440
you do? You place two chips on 0-2-3,chip
on 4-7, one on 12-15,one on 18-21, one on

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:07.400
19-22,a couple of chips on 25-9 Corner there,
covering those four numbers and the two numbers

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.060
here, 32-35 complete it. You need multiples
of nine chips, you can get some bigger returns,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.190
some slightly smaller returns here. It's a
little bit uneven, it's called the Voisins

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.170
Du Zero, the Neighbours of the zero. As I
say, starts at 25, zero in the middle, all

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.659
the way round to 22 at the other side. You're
covering a nice big chunk, almost half of

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.770
the Roulette Wheel. Nearer to zero the better,
when you place in the Voisins Du Zero.
