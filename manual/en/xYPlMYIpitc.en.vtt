Um, Ryan and I, this kid over here, he and I are getting married!

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.780
I really hope that you will join us along this wonderful
adventure of wedding planning...

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.660
...bliss...

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.770
...and we'll just see what happens.  I think it'll be good.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.470
Hey!

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.680
I am here with Ryan.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.840
Yep, I'm here in this one.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.970
Yep, he finally came home from school.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.670
Yeah, 'bout time.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.240
Yeah, 'bout time.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.540
And we are about... how many days away from getting married?

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.040
Twelve?

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.360
Twelve.  Yes, twelve days away.  That's crazy.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.360
I acted like I didn't know but really I did.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.950
Twelve days.  And so we are doing and the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.649
finishing touches on a lot on the
wedding stuff.  One of which

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.579
is setting up an entryway display,
which we're gonna do out of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.820
crates.  Ryan's gonna be here and he's gonna film the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.660
whole thing so just know that he's
on the other side of the camera and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.900
if I'm asking opinions,

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.850
he's the one that I'm asking them of.  So if you hear a voice it's Ryan.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.120
Right?  That'll be him.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.080
So, as you can see, we have some lovely green crates here

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.650
and these come in a set of two

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.320
So you've got the little one

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.600
and the big one, and the great thing you
can do with these crates

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.410
is that you can stack them in all sorts of different ways to get

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.430
just different displays.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.150
It looks really nice too if you place them in front and stuff too so you

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.880
get a little bit of

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.180
dimension and stuff going on there and
then

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.100
And then, as you can see along as the wall we,
have a bunch of

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.960
different knick-knacks and things.  And we don't have all the stuff we're going

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.050
to use quite yet

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.550
but you can get the idea of what it
will look like you've got

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.970
stuff put inside there.  

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.939
And then we've got some pictures that you
can display

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.600
Look at how darling Ryan was as a child.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.940
So adorable.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.940
I've got this birdcage...

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.900
...let's see here...

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.790
...trial and error, that's what you've gotta do.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.070
Look.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.000
We're gonna invite people to Instagram at
our reception, so

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.200
we've got a little invite thing going
on

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.500
Anyways, you get the idea

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.940
we don't have all of our stuff that
we're going to use for the entryway

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.110
ready quite yet, so the main

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.590
thing though is that you can do really
cool things would be crates.  Just stack

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.170
'em in all sorts of different ways

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.600
and you can get them in different
colors, different sizes,

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.000
and it just makes a really interesting
display.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.900
There you have it!

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.920
