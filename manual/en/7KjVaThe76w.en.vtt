00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.130
Hi folks and Pro Evolution Soccer fans,
My name is Andre Bronzoni

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.570
We are here in São Paulo 
at DPN Santos studios

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.810
Today, we're going to show you how Mauro Beting and Silvio Luiz 
bring the realism of a football match into the video game

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.080
To PES 2014.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.150
Attention! Recording 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.009
Come on Silvio, it's live man!

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.390
Hey, Hey, you, PES friend. 
We are here once more…

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.989
Mauro, tell us what is different 
in this PES 2014?

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:40.180
On this year, 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.320
I'm saying clubs and player names,
something that didn't exist in the past

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.770
It brings even more realism to us

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.770
In this case, inside the broadcast booth 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.500
So this is something really cool and at the same time it's a  
challenge because you need to maintain the same standard 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.840
You record a player name and after in 
another day you record your comment 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.120
or this comment is already recorded 
and saved in our database since 2010

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.970
And from a pre-established script
which I can't modify that much 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.350
You leave something yours in the game
that you're actually not seeing

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.500
So, it's a huge challenge

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.480
One big crazy thing. Silvio Luiz 
is crazier than me 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.530
And Konami is even more crazier to 
hire us for so long

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:19.700
This is all crazy but it is also a great success 
through all this infrastructure

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.970
Where are we at today, Mr.Hair?

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.230
Look my master, Silvio Luiz, 
We are here at broadcast booth

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.689
From PES 2013 to PES 2014, 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.360
What are you using this year that 
is different from the past?

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.860
The Keyword for PES 2014 is the realism  

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.630
We are trying to achieve the maximum of realism 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.780
This was defined and ordered by Konami

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.399
We have miking, 
special miking

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.590
This is the same microphone used by narrators and 
commentators at football stadiums

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.080
There is an off tube commentary

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.129
For those who doesn't know, it is when the commentator and pundit  
aren't in the same location where the event is going on 

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:58.559
They are inside of a studio 
broadcasting 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.210
There is also a crowd sound recorded behind

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.100
Which we're going to give to 
our professionals, Silvio and Mauro

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.559
This crowd sound, cheering is very important

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:13.150
Because it helps our professionals 
to execute better their job 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.200
Even I who is terrible playing PES and football 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.800
Would be very excited if I heard 
this theme "Pan Pan Pan Pannn"

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.649
I'm glad it isn't a vuvuzela
But let's come back to the game

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.459
How is working with Mauro Beting again? 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.899
I'm already used to it, man

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.089
4 years together, looks like wife and husband

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.000
Marriage hã?

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.259
Yeah, but he sleeps closer to the wall 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:37.999
And we talk during the night 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.419
What am I going to say at home, pal? 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.349
And now, Mauro will talk with me during the game

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:48.300
How about your sound bite? Are you going to keep with your catchphrases? 
Will be there new ones? 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.000
New phrases, maybe will have 2 or 3 plus the old ones 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.779
Buy the game and will see new catchphrases

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:00.249
Olho no lannnnnnnce

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.609
I love you Silvio

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:02.900
Me too 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.349
Bye

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.229
Bye

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.919
That's it folks, we are done
for today.

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:10.179
PES 2014 is coming out soon 
for all of you!

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.300
Keep tuned and see you later. Bye!
