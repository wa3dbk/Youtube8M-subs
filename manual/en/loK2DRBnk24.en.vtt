00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:01.835
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME BACK!

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:06.507
SO RECENTLY WE SENT OUR INTREPID
REPORTER JASON JONES

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.910
OUT TO THE FIELD TO
EXPLORE THE PHENOMENON OF A

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:15.015
CERTAIN WASHINGTON D.C.'S
FOOTBALL TEAM'S CONTROVERSIAL

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.116
NAME. WE LEARNED
LATER THAT SOME OF THE

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.218
INDIVIDUALS WHO PARTICIPATED IN
THE PIECE, THEY DIDN'T

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:19.887
ENJOY THE EXPERIENCE.
(LAUGHTER)

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.890
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS A
LOT LESS THAN YOU WOULD THINK.

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:24.725
BUT WE TAKE THE COMPLAINT
SERIOUSLY.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:27.194
WE GENERALLY DON'T WANT PEOPLE
WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE SHOW TO

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.595
HAVE A BAD EXPERIENCE.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:32.799
WE WORK VERY HARD TO FIND REAL
PEOPLE WHO HAVE REAL BELIEFS AND

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:36.703
WANT TO EXPRESS THOSE BELIEFS ON
TELEVISION AND WE WORK HARD TO

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:40.974
MAKE SURE THAT THE GIST OF THOSE
BELIEFS ARE RESPECTED

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:45.779
ACCURATELY -- ALBEIT SOMETIMES
COMEDICALLY ON OUR PROGRAM.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.515
(LAUGHTER)
IF WE FIND OUT THAT SOMEONE IN A

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:53.253
PIECE WAS INTENTIONALLY MISLED
OR IF THEIR COMMENTS WERE

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:56.690
INTENTIONALLY MISREPRESENTED, WE
DO NOT AIR THAT PIECE.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.393
WE WOULD NOT AIR THAT PIECE.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:04.731
SO THAT BEING SAID, I HOPE YOU
ENJOY THE FOLLOWING PIECE.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:09.002
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; FOOTBALL IS BACK, AND ONCE

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:11.839
AGAIN, THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS
ARE GETTING THEIR ASS KICKED.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:12.272
BUT THIS TIME INSTEAD OF COWBOYS
AND PATRIOTS, IT'S BY LIBERAL

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:15.175
ACTIVISTS.

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:18.278
&gt;&gt; A MOVE IS UNDERWAY TO CHANGE
THE NAME.

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:22.115
CRITICS SAY IT'S OFFENSIVE TO
NATIVE AMERICANS.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.154
&gt;&gt; BUT ACCORDING TO CHIEF DANIEL
SNYDER OF REDSKIN NATION, THE

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:27.754
ONLY CRIME HIS PEOPLE HAVE
COMMITTED

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:29.556
IS BEING MISUNDERSTOOD.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.726
&gt;&gt; THE NAME OF OUR TEAM IS THE
NAME OF OUR TEAM AND IT

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.562
REPRESENTS HONOR, IT REPRESENTS
PRIDE, IT REPRESENTS RESPECT.

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:36.997
&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT DOESN'T SOUND THAT
BAD.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.835
SO WHY WAS THIS GROUP OF NATIVE
AMERICAN ACTIVISTS SO UPSET?

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.041
&gt;&gt; IT'S A NAME THAT IMPAIRS,
DISABLES, DISENFRANCHISES OUR

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:49.209
POPULATION.

00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:52.513
&gt;&gt; THE MOST POPULAR MASCOTS IN
THE COUNTRY ARE INDIANS AND

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:53.013
ANIMALS.

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.081
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:59.052
BECAUSE WE ALL LOVE ANIMALS AND
WE ALL LOVE INDIANS.

00:01:59.086 --> 00:01:59.586
&gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT MASCOTS.
&gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT MASCOTS.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.554
&gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT MASCOTS.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:03.924
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A DICTIONARY
DEFINED RACIAL SLUR.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:04.391
&gt;&gt; YEAH BUT THAT'S ACCORDING TO
WHAT?

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:05.526
&gt;&gt; THE DICTIONARY.

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:08.462
&gt;&gt; OK BUT PLENTY OF WORDS IN THE
DICTIONARY HAVE MULTIPLE

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.631
MEANINGS. IT JUST TURNS OUT
THIS ONE DOESN'T.

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:13.934
HELP ME OUT, WHITE MAN.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.436
&gt;&gt; TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT, YOU CAN
TAKE THINGS OUT OF CONTEXT ALL

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.405
OVER THE PLACE BUT IN THIS
PARTICULAR CASE IT IS WHAT

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.974
IT IS, IT'S VERY OBVIOUS.

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:22.809
THAT THE NAME REALLY MEANS
HONOR.

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:23.844
&gt;&gt; HONORING WHAT?

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:28.415
&gt;&gt; YOUR STRONG, PROUD,
COURAGEOUS, BRAVE HERITAGE.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:31.185
&gt;&gt; REDSKINS IS A BOUNTY.

00:02:31.218 --> 00:02:32.886
&gt;&gt; IT MEANT PROOF OF INDIAN
KILL.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.055
&gt;&gt; WELL WHEN YOU PUT IT LIKE
THAT, IT SOUNDS TERRIBLE.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:40.160
PUT IT IN CONTEXT ON SUNDAYS --
&gt;&gt; AND SATURDAYS AND FRIDAY

00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:41.161
NIGHTS.

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:41.895
&gt;&gt; AND MONDAYS.
&gt;&gt; AND LIVING IN D.C. EVERY DAY.

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.698
&gt;&gt; AND THURSDAY NIGHTS.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.867
&gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
BE A NATIVE IN THIS TOWN?

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.135
&gt;&gt; I DON'T. I DON'T. TERRIBLE.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:51.104
&gt;&gt; TO WALK DOWN THE STREET EVERY
SINGLE DAY AND BE SURROUNDED BY

00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:54.908
THAT IMAGERY AND BEING TOLD
TO GET OVER IT?

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:56.043
&gt;&gt; NO BECAUSE...
&gt;&gt; CAUSE, CAUSE, CAUSE...

00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:57.211
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO, JUST
BECAUSE I'M UNCOMFORTABLE

00:02:57.244 --> 00:03:00.514
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO MAKE
FUN OF MY UNCOMFORTABLENESS.

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:04.251
YOU DON'T SEE ME DOING THAT TO
PEOPLE.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:08.088
&gt;&gt; SURE THESE NATIVE AMERICAN
ACTIVISTS MAKE A COMPELLING

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:08.789
CASE. THAT IS UNTIL YOU
HEAR WHAT IS AT STAKE

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:12.359
FOR THE TRUE VICTIMS. THE FANS.

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:13.460
&gt;&gt; IF THE REDSKINS NAME IS
CHANGED AND I HAVE

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:16.230
CHILDREN ONE DAY, WHAT WOULD I
PASS ON TO THEM?

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:19.066
&gt;&gt; IT'D BE TOUGH. IT WOULD BE
LIKE LOSING A FAMILY MEMBER.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.936
&gt;&gt; AND THEY'VE ALREADY LOST SO
MUCH, 58 STARTING

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.471
QUARTERBACKS, 28 HEAD COACHES,
12 UNIFORMS WITH TEN LOGOS,

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:27.908
PLAYING IN FIVE STADIUMS AND TWO
CITIES.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:32.045
THEY EVEN CHANGED THEIR NAME
ONCE BEFORE SO FORGIVE THEM FOR

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.749
CLINGING TO WHAT FEW TRADITIONS
REMAIN.

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:37.484
(SINGING FIGHT SONG)
&gt;&gt; SING IT.

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:39.653
&gt;&gt;(SINGING) FIGHT FOR OLD D.C.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:43.724
&gt;&gt; I HAVE AN OLDER COMPUTER. I
PULLED IT UP ON NETSCAPE.

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:47.361
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU DIDN'T SAY
THE WORD "SCALP 'EM."

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:50.631
&gt;&gt; IT ALSO SAYS WHOMP THEM, TOO.

00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:51.732
&gt;&gt; OH, SO THE SONG CHANGED.

00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:52.833
&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS
CHANGED FOR SENSITIVITY REASONS.

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:54.568
&gt;&gt; AND THE TEAM SENSITIVITY
HAS PAID OFF. I MEAN,

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:57.804
RIGHT HERE ON THE HOME PAGE OF
THE WEB SITE DANIEL SNYDER PAID

00:03:57.838 --> 00:04:03.610
FOR, IT SAYS THAT, IN 2004, A
POLL FOUND THAT 90% OF NATIVE

00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:06.346
AMERICANS DID NOT FIND THE NAME
OFFENSIVE.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.317
&gt;&gt; THE ANNENBERG REPORT, THE
FUNNY THING ABOUT THE ANNENBERG

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.518
REPORT IS THAT IT WAS
CONDUCTED IN PENNSYLVANIA BY

00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:14.621
SELF-IDENTIFYING INDIGENOUS
PEOPLE WHICH MEANS IT COULD HAVE

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.890
BEEN ANYBODY OFF THE STREET THAT
SAYS OH YEAH, MY GREAT GREAT

00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:18.525
GREAT GRANDMOTHER WAS A CHEROKEE
PRINCESS.

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:21.228
&gt;&gt; COME ON. WHO WOULD DO THAT?

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.529
&gt;&gt; MY GREAT GREAT GREAT
GRANDFATHER WAS FULL BLOOD

00:04:22.563 --> 00:04:25.265
CHEROKEE.
&gt;&gt; SHOW OF HANDS, WHO HAS

00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:26.934
HAS CHEROKEE HERE? ANY NATIVE
AMERICAN.

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:28.302
BRIAN, WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN YOU?

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:29.136
&gt;&gt; CHEROKEE.

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.537
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH OR
LITTLE.

00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:33.040
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:34.975
&gt;&gt; I'M ACTUALLY ONE-TWELFTH.

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:35.943
&gt;&gt; ONE-TWELFTH CHEROKEE.

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:37.077
&gt;&gt; AS ONE-TWELFTH CHEROKEE I AM
NOT OFFENDED.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.580
&gt;&gt; WHICH MEANT THAT THERE
WAS ONLY ONE QUESTION FOR THE

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:42.850
OTHER 11/12. AREN'T YOU
BEING A LITTLE SENSITIVE?

00:04:42.883 --> 00:04:46.320
&gt;&gt; AFTER EVERY SINGLE THING THAT
AMERICAN INDIAN PEOPLE HAVE

00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:48.322
BEEN THROUGH, HOW CAN YOU
POSSIBLY SAY THAT WE ARE

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:50.324
THIN-SKINNED AND OVERSENSITIVE?
WE HAVE TO SAY THINGS LIKE,

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:52.259
CULTURAL SENSITIVITY BECAUSE AS
WE SAY RACISM OR RACIST --

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.261
&gt;&gt; NO ONE SAID RACIST.
&gt;&gt; THE WHOLE ARGUMENT SHUTS

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:57.264
DOWN.
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. NO ONE SAID RACISM.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.267
&gt;&gt; THE TERM IS RACIST.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.336
&gt;&gt; OK, I'M SHUTTING THIS
CONVERSATION DOWN.

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:03.504
&gt;&gt; OK, SO REDSKI -- ALL RIGHT,
THE WASHINGTON TEAM NAME WAS

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:05.339
STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE
INSENSITIVE. WHAT WAS I MISSING?

00:05:05.372 --> 00:05:07.341
&gt;&gt; WHAT I WOULD SAY IS, COME TO
A FOOTBALL GAME, MEET SOME

00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:19.820
FANS, COME SEE WHAT OUR
CONTEXT IS ABOUT AND I THINK,

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:28.795
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO WAY YOU
WOULD LEAVE THAT OFFENDED.

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:29.830
&gt;&gt; SO I WENT TO A GAME. AND YOU
KNOW WHAT, IT WAS TRUE

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:31.431
I WAS IMMEDIATELY WELCOMED INTO
THIS RICH CULTURE,

00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:34.501
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT
WAS, BUT THE MORE TIME I SPENT

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:39.206
WITH THESE PEOPLE, THE MORE I
BEGAN TO FEEL WARM AND HAPPY AND

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:42.509
NUMB AND, THEY WERE RIGHT, THAT
LOGO IS COOL!

00:05:42.543 --> 00:05:44.378
BUT THEN I MET WITH TRIBAL
ELDERS.

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:45.379
&gt;&gt; THIS IS OUR CULTURE.

00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:47.080
THIS IS WHO WE ARE.

00:05:47.114 --> 00:05:52.119
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU CALL A NATIVE
AMERICAN A REDSKIN?

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:54.488
&gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW ANY NATIVE
AMERICANS?

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.789
&gt;&gt; YEAH, ABOUT EIGHT OF THEM.

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:57.124
&gt;&gt; AM I NOT NATIVE AMERICAN?

00:05:57.157 --> 00:05:59.259
WAS I NOT BORN IN THIS COUNTRY?

00:05:59.293 --> 00:06:00.894
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO AUTHORIZE
THAT.

00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:02.129
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:05.199
THIS WAS A CULTURE SO PROUD THEY
DIDN'T EVEN WANT THEIR FACE ON

00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:09.036
TV EVEN AFTER THEY HAD SIGNED
OUR RELEASE FORMS.

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:10.037
&gt;&gt; I WENT TO A GAME.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.140
LET ME ASK YOU, IF YOU BROUGHT A
NATIVE AMERICAN,

00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:14.308
WOULDN'T THEY BE A LITTLE UPSET?

00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:16.276
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE CONVERSATION
THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.947
THAT WE NEED TO BE SITTING DOWN,
TALKING TO THE PEOPLE THAT

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.515
ACTUALLY ARE OFFENDED.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.717
&gt;&gt; A LITTLE LATER, WE DID JUST
THAT.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.887
BUT IT TURNS OUT THESE FANS
WEREN'T COMFORTABLE HAVING THAT

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.121
CONVERSATION.

00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:31.525
IN FACT, AFTERWARD, THEY RELAYED
TO "THE WASHINGTON POST" THAT

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:35.095
THEY FELT AMBUSHED, IN DANGER
AND DEFAMED AND, YES,

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:39.733
THE CONVERSATION WAS HEATED AT
TIMES BUT THERE WERE ALSO

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.635
HANDSHAKES AND EVEN THE
CEREMONIAL HANDKERCHIEF.

00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:46.173
IN THE END, THEY SAID THEY STILL
WOULD HAVE GONE ON THE SHOW HAD

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:49.309
THEY KNOWN THERE WOULD BE
A DEBATE BUT AT LEAST ONE OF

00:06:49.343 --> 00:06:52.546
THEM WOULDN'T HAVE WORN HIS RED
SKINS JACKET WHICH FORCES THE

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.015
QUESTION --
&gt;&gt; IF THEY CHANGE THE TEAM NAME,

00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:57.584
WOULD YOU STILL ROOT FOR THEM?

00:06:57.618 --> 00:06:58.619
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

00:06:58.652 --> 00:06:59.520
&gt;&gt; UNEQUIVOCALLY.

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:01.922
&gt;&gt; I WOULDN'T HIDE MY REDSKINS
MEMORABILIA.

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:05.392
IT WOULD STILL BE ON THE WALLS,
THE BELT WOULD STILL BE ON THE

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:08.128
SHOULDER. THEY'LL ALWAYS
BE REDSKINS TO ME.

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:09.363
&gt;&gt; THERE WE GO. PROBLEM SOLVED.

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:12.165
HEY, HE WHO STANDS ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF HISTORY,

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:15.669
CHANGE THE (BLEEP) NAME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:17.704
&gt;&gt; Jon: JASON JONES. WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.
