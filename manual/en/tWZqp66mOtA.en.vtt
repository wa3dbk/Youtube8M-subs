00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.600
- The Grammys are
a part of the awards season,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.866
which is a busy time of year.

00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.066
Luckily, Dunkin' Donuts helps
busy people

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:08.600
keep themselves going every day
with really great coffee.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.600
And you're all gonna get
a $150 Dunkin' Donuts gift card,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.733
so that you can...

00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:18.700
[cheers and applause]

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.133
Thank you, Dunkin' Donuts.

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:25.100
[cheers and applause]

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.866
Yep.

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:27.966
Isn't that nice?

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.066
You know what?
I'm feeling guilty.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.300
I'm sitting here with coffee,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.633
and you don't have coffee.

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:34.133
Luckily, Dunkin' Donuts
sent over coffee for all of you.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.833
So, Java, our coffee girl,

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:38.566
come on out
and bring everybody's.

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:43.233
[cheers and applause]

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:46.033
Careful.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:47.800
Do not spill that, Java.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.100
Do not spill that.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.500
Right now,
we're gonna play a game

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.733
thanks to our Grammys show
sponsor, Dunkin' Donuts.

00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:56.500
It's a game we call
"You Munch-kin' Or Ya Can't."

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.833
[dance music]

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:00.900
[cheers and applause]

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:06.933
Baby, baby.

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.700
All right.
We need someone to play.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.700
Where is Maddie Vasquez?

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.966
[cheers and applause]

00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:15.633
[dance music]

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:19.666
Hello!

00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.366
Hello.
How are you?

00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.033
- Good, thank you.
- Good, okay.

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:24.266
Here's what's gonna happen.

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.200
You're gonna get behind
that line over there,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.533
you're gonna take a munchkin,

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.166
you're gonna toss it
into this bucket here.

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.466
You have to start
from the first one

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.400
and eventually get to
the furthest once back.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.833
For each one, you get a prize.

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:36.333
And the furthest away is
the biggest prize.

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.400
So, let's stand over here,
and...

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.366
Java is gonna tell you
what you win

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.933
if you get it in
the first bucket here.

00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:43.966
Java, what do they win?

00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:47.966
You win a delicious
Boston cream donut and a coffee.

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.766
- Whoo!

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:51.200
Yeah!

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.600
- Hot, iced, or frozen
Dunkin' coffee gives you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.533
the boost you need.

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:57.866
- All right,
you take a munchkin,

00:01:57.866 --> 00:01:59.466
see if you can get it in there.
Good luck.

00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:00.733
[drum roll]

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:03.933
Oh, you did it!

00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:05.033
Take another one.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:06.100
Java, tell her what she wins

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.200
if she gets it in
bucket number two.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.566
- A lamp.

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:14.500
- Whoo!

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.933
- Oh, that's pretty.
All right.

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:18.300
Toss the munchkin in there.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.000
Hopefully you win
that pretty lamp.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.066
Oh.

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:25.066
- Oh!

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:32.300
No!

00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:35.900
Oh!

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.566
[laughter]

00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:42.566
[applause]

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:50.500
[cheers and applause]

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.333
Java, tell her what she wins.

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:54.800
- Ooh, two tickets to see
the Grammy Awards.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.000
- Oh!

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.700
[cheers and applause]

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.766
Let's see what happens.

00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:01.933
You have about 100 in here.

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:02.933
- Okay.

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:04.833
[drum roll]

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:06.833
Oh.

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:11.366
- Oh.
Closer.

00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:14.366
- Oh, my God,
I'm the worst thrower ever.

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:19.200
- That's--
- Oh!

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.733
- We have--we have better odds
if we do it this way.

00:03:21.733 --> 00:03:22.833
- Oh, I did it!

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:24.133
- Yay!

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:25.833
You win!

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:28.466
You did it!

00:03:28.466 --> 00:03:29.900
You get to go to the Grammys.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.233
I want to thank Dunkin' Donuts,
Jessica Alba, Terry Crews,

00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:33.600
LL Cool J, and Hozier.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.266
Have a wonderful weekend,
everybody.
