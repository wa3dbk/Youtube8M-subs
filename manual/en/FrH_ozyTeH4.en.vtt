00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.710
We start with the Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome or MERS outbreak in Korea.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.640
Let′s go straight to Kim Ji－yeon who joins
us at the news center.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.860
Ji－yeon， what′s the latest？

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.840
We′re at a total of 30 MERS cases， with
five new patients confirmed today.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.960
That′s including secondary and tertiary
patients.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.580
Currently， more than 13－hundred people
are quarantined in their homes or in state－run

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.880
facilities to prevent the disease from spreading.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.780
As another preventative measure， 585 Korean
have decided to temporarily close for this

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.780
week.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.360
And for the time being， the military has
announced that any soldiers who are suspected

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.050
cases may delay their mandatory service.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.149
Ji－yeon， what details do you have on President
Park Geun－hye′s emergency meeting with

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.760
ministers and doctors？

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.489
The government announced the establishment
of a task force comprised of health authorities

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.489
and local experts.

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.399
It′ll serve as a control tower to deal with
the MERS outbreak，...

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.490
and will be in charge of coming up with containment
measures and the sharing of critical information

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.570
among ministries.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.780
It′s also responsible for strengthening
care for confirmed patients.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.780
At the meeting，...

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.900
President Park Geun－hye called for better
information.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:31.270
″We need to discuss how the patients are
being treated， the infection route... and

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.490
the subsequent movements of the doctors treating
the patients.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:44.200
And then， those who were in contact with
the patients.″

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.600
In response， the task force announced that
it would first designate a number of regional

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.910
medical facilities that will be responsible
for the care of MERS patients in that area.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.310
The group also vowed to share useful and accurate
information to reduce public fear about the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.310
outbreak.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.180
Looking ahead， the task force said it would
increase the number of infectious disease

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.230
experts，... in order to increase the country′s
ability to deal with similar cases in the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.230
future.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.370
Speaking of sharing information... why is
the government not announcing the names of

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.170
the hospitals that are treating confirmed
patients？

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:30.230
The task force said it has decided to withhold
that information because it would do more

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.520
harm than good.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.010
They′re concerned that people who suspect
they might have the virus might delay treatment

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.269
out of fear of going to one of these hospitals.

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.910
The task force reassured the public that the
hospitals are now fully aware of the MERS

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.840
outbreak and have taken necessary measures，...
including cordoning off special containment

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.050
wards.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.820
Although there are 30 confirmed cases， and
numbers in quarantine are growing， the task

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.209
force believes the virus can be contained
with the measures they are putting into place.

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:01.890
Back to you.
