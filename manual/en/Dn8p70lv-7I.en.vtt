00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.250
Do you know what a laparotomy is?

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.250
You don't?

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.350
Come join me, I'm going to share with you
exactly what a laparotomy is.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.349
Hi, I'm Gerry Oginski I'm a New York medical
malpractice and personal injury trial attorney

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.919
practicing law here in the state of New York.

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.790
A laparotomy means that a surgeon is going
in and surgically removing something inside

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.790
of you.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.690
Whether that's cancerous tissue, whether itâ€™s
an organ that's not working properly.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.590
That's what a laparotomy means.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.920
Sometimes they're known as diagnostic laparotomies
where the doctors going in to find out what's

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.000
going on.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.960
Other times they know definitively beforehand
and now are going in to do a surgical procedure

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.550
in order to remove the affected organ.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.699
Now, what is a laparoscopy?

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.140
A laparoscopy means that a surgeon is going
inside to the do the same thing however they're

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.640
using different tools.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.989
A laparotomy a surgeon will literally take
a knife and cut into your belly and make a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.449
large incision.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:57.329
A laparoscopy is a surgery where the doctor
is going to use fiber-optic tools and cameras

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.139
and create puncture holes into the belly and
once they put a puncture in one side then

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:04.890
they'll put another one in the other side.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.080
This will allow them to insert surgical instrument
in one side and a camera in the other and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.900
now they can look on a monitor and see exactly
what's going on inside of you, that's known

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.570
as a laparoscopy.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.030
Again there are different types of laparoscopies.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.040
You can do a diagnostic laparoscopy just to
go in, take a look, see what's happening.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.910
Or you can go in and do a surgical removal
of some diseased tissue or an organ.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.420
And that can be done the same exact fashion
but using a different procedure known as a

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.420
laparoscopy.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.460
So that's it for today's question and answer
about what is a laparotomy and what is laparoscopy

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.860
and by the way if you have legal questions
