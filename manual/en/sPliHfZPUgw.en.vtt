00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.540
Last week, Steve Jobs passed away and to cover
anything else on the Reel Web this week just

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.679
feels like it would just pale in comparison
to the impact that guy had on the online video

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:12.679
world.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.010
So this week, let’s just take a look at
some of the innovations that he pioneered

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.400
that allow you and I to do what we do in online
video.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.590
Hey guys, my name is Tim Schmoyer and welcome
to another week of the Reel Web where we take

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.820
a look at the online video world’s news
and happenings.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.120
Of course, this week, everyone’s news revolves
around Steve Jobs’ passing away and rightfully

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.120
so.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.969
That’s guy’s work, his passion, his creativity
has changed and influenced so much about the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.519
way you and I communicate, the way we talk,
the way we work and just how we enjoy our

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:47.519
entertainment.

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.600
Today, let’s take a brief look at his influence
in video creation and distribution starting

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.440
with the Apple Super Bowl commercial from
1984.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:07.830
(Video playback) On January 24th, Apple Computer
will produce Macintosh and you’ll see why

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.530
1984 won’t be like “1984.”

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.290
As most of us probably already know, Steve
was let go from Apple and so he turned around

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.440
and started another computer company called
Next.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.730
But in 1986, he bought Pixar movie studios
off of George Lucas for 10 million dollars.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.530
At first they specialized mostly in making
commercials but they made some short films

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.730
on the side.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:37.000
But when one of their short films called Tin
Toy won an Academy Award in 1988, Steve Jobs

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.870
started to shift the company’s focus to
movie making.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:48.500
Moving forward to 1999, Steve Jobs was back
at Apple and he introduces a little program

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.940
we know as (video playback) “I think this
is going to be the next big thing.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:04.600
I think it’s going to be just huge and that
is that all the iMac DV models with all those

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.280
amazing features from the iMac, all the amazing
features you’ve seen in iMac DV, the ability

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.590
to play movies, the iMac DVs also have the
ability to make movies.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.730
Let me take you through this.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.620
We have written some software called iMovie.”

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.380
But Apple didn’t stop there, in 1998, they
acquired Final Cut from Macromedia and in

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.630
1999, they announced Final Cut Pro.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.130
(Video playback) “Hi my name is Randy Ubillos,
I’m the technical lead for Final Cut Pro,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.000
a new video editing product from Apple Computers
that will be out soon.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.670
This product combines features that were previously
only available in several different products

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.670
all into one.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.920
Very easy to use interface, I think it’s
going to dramatically increase the number

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.930
of people who will have access to creating
great digital video.”

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.840
In 2003, Apple announced the iSight cam to
be used in conjunction with their new program

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.170
called iChat.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.151
And in 2005, they actually just started putting
those iSight cams right into the Mac.

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:08.490
(Video playback) “The new iMac has an iSight
built in.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.819
This $150 video cam built in and you can see
it up there on the top bezel.”

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.290
2005 was a really big year for Steve Jobs,
Apple and the video world because two things

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.290
happened.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.970
First of all, on May 5th, Apple announced
iTunes version 4.8, which allowed users to

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.340
now import their video clips and organize
them all.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.470
Later that year on October 12th, iTunes version
6.0 came out and now it allowed people to

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.640
actually buy and watch video from the online
iTunes music store.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.440
Second of all, despite Steve Jobs himself
mocking the notion that people would actually

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.330
want to watch video on their iPod, a year
later, they come out with the video iPod.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.010
(Video playback) “Today we are announcing
the new white iPod as we head into the holiday

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.300
season, and it’s a stunner.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.770
The new white iPod.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.540
And yes, it does video.”

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.500
Later in 2007, Apple TV was introduced, they
wanted to name it iTV but there’s a broadcaster

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.130
in the UK that apparently has rights to that
name.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.270
So Apple TV it is.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.370
(Video playback) “It’s on your iPod.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.320
Now, it’s on your TV.”

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.590
Since then, the iPhone has come out, the iPod
Touch and most recently, the iPad, all of

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.940
them allowing users to consume online video.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.020
We also have Steve Jobs and Apple to thank
for pushing HTML 5 forward.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.130
I mean, regardless of which side of the issue
you fall on with the HTML 5 or with Flash,

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.630
you have to admit that HTML 5 video would
not be where it is today if it wasn’t for

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.630
Apple’s stance.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.190
We’d love to hear which one of these innovations
from Steve Jobs influenced you the most.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.100
For me, it was when I first got a Mac that
had iSight built in along with iMovie.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.930
I mean, I had made some videos and stuff before
and posted them on the web but I did so very

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.410
infrequently and they were very poor quality,
it was such a hassle.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.340
But then when I got my first Macbook, the
iSight cam was built right in, I had iMovie,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.680
it just made it so simple to sit in front
of my computer, shoot a video of me talking

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.770
and then just get that edited and uploaded
to YouTube and share it with the world.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.750
I really have Steve to thank for a lot of
the creative limitations I was experiencing

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.770
with other video editing platforms.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.820
And if it was not for him and my Macbook and
iSight and iMovie and YouTube, you would definitely

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.389
not be watching this video today.

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:33.750
But what’s your story?

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.950
How did Steve’s video innovation affect
and influence you personally?

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.990
I would love to hear your stories, leave them
as a comment below this video or leave a video

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.990
response.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.610
If you’re not sure how to leave a video
response, I’ll put a link in the description

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.040
below so you can just click it.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.770
If you haven’t yet watched Steve Job’s
commencement address from Stanford University,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.610
I highly recommend that you do so.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.080
It is just so fabulous and inspiring on so
many levels, I’ll put a link to it below

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.870
this video on YouTube or at ReelSEO.com, wherever
you’re watching this.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.670
I’ll leave you with a clip from it but first
before I go, I encourage you to subscribe

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.070
Bye.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.030
(Video playback) “Remembering that I’ll
be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.940
ever encountered to help me make the big choices
in life.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.860
Because almost everything, almost all external
expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.410
or failure, these things just fall away in
the face of death, leaving only what is truly

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.580
important.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.970
Remembering that you are going to die is the
best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking

00:06:49.970 --> 00:07:07.650
you have something to lose.”
