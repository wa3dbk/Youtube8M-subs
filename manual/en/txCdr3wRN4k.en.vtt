00:00:01.413 --> 00:00:03.224
Today I'm going to review treading water.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.133
We will go over the sculling motion,

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:06.168
eggbeater kick,

00:00:06.608 --> 00:00:07.374
the full stroke,

00:00:07.616 --> 00:00:08.858
and treading alternatives.

00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:15.538
Treading water is often one of the first skills that parents want me to teach their child.

00:00:16.227 --> 00:00:21.995
However, treading water properly with a relaxed sculling motion and eggbeater kick is a more advanced skill.

00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:27.880
From a safety perspective, a comfortable relaxed back float is your most critical life-saving skill.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.692
It's not uncommon for young swimmers to be able to back float or even swim backstroke for longer than they can tread.

00:00:36.427 --> 00:00:40.942
Maintaining a vertical up and down body position requires a good feel for the water.

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:45.774
Most beginners want to use dog paddle arms and running legs.

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.833
This can get tiring over a short period of time.

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:54.955
You want to use your hands like fan blades.

00:00:55.228 --> 00:01:00.907
The angle of your hands and how it moves through the water can create downward pressure without pushing down.

00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:07.025
If I want to put this candle out I certainly don't want to push straight down.

00:01:07.543 --> 00:01:10.801
However, a quick side-to-side motion surprisingly does the trick.

00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:16.857
By changing the angle of my hand I create downward air pressure that puts the candle out.

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:27.603
In the water, a slower yet similar hand motion helps create the downward pressure that is needed to stay afloat while treading.

00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:34.142
I often introduced the sculling or finning motion when teaching back floats.

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:37.487
It gives kids that are grabby something to do with their hands.

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:43.635
Notice I'm using the side-to-side motion with my arms while changing the angle of my hands.

00:01:46.213 --> 00:01:51.067
Here I'm utilizing the same hand and arm motion in a vertical treading body position.

00:01:51.826 --> 00:01:53.954
My hands scull out and together.

00:01:54.638 --> 00:01:55.800
Out and together.

00:01:56.488 --> 00:01:59.941
I can feel the pressure of the water against my hands throughout the stroke.

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:03.982
If I speed it up I can lift myself farther out of the water.

00:02:06.491 --> 00:02:09.474
In general though, I'm just trying to keep it slow and steady.

00:02:12.311 --> 00:02:16.781
As we move on to the kick, if I want to crush this can, would I use a pointed toe?

00:02:18.648 --> 00:02:21.074
No. I keep my foot flat.

00:02:24.554 --> 00:02:28.260
Similar to breaststroke, we push or kick with the sole of our foot.

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:34.663
Eggbeater kick gets its name from the motion of the legs.

00:02:35.286 --> 00:02:38.633
First time pushing down and out. Then bringing my leg in and up.

00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:40.489
One leg at a time.

00:02:40.852 --> 00:02:42.182
Down and out, in and up.

00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:44.000
Down and out, in and up.

00:02:46.472 --> 00:02:48.120
Here I'm doing the kick in the water.

00:02:48.628 --> 00:02:50.904
Stay nice and tall. Don't curl up in a ball.

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:55.483
While my knees are bending significantly, I'm not bringing them up to my chest.

00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:58.029
I'm kicking from the waist down.

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.028
My kick is kind of lazy here.

00:03:00.326 --> 00:03:02.750
But you only want to kick hard enough to stay afloat.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.280
As I hold up the diving brick, the egg beater motion is much more noticeable.

00:03:16.591 --> 00:03:19.136
I'm getting kind of cocky here and trying two bricks.

00:03:19.694 --> 00:03:21.367
But I couldn't keep that up for long.

00:03:26.654 --> 00:03:29.907
As I put the arms and legs together, I want to finish my kick,

00:03:30.406 --> 00:03:34.946
or, stomp as I finish the out-sweep and/or in-sweep of my arms.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.084
Stomp! Stomp!

00:03:37.445 --> 00:03:38.547
Kick! Kick!

00:03:38.732 --> 00:03:40.239
Sweep out! Sweep in!

00:03:44.817 --> 00:03:48.909
While treading water is an important safety skill, there are alternatives.

00:03:49.681 --> 00:03:52.910
A good back float with some light finning can be just as effective.

00:03:55.833 --> 00:04:03.604
The current Boy Scout and US Navy Swim Test emphasize Prone Floats or Survival Floating for 5 minutes as opposed to treading water.

00:04:04.682 --> 00:04:06.629
Figure out what works best for you.
