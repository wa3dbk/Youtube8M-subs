Hi. This is Yolanda Vanveen on behalf of Expert
Village. In this series, we are talking all

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.269
about how to start your own compost heap.
In this segment, we are going to discuss turning

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:19.010
trees into compost. Here we have our pile
of wood chips, or wood clippings, or wood

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.240
compost. This last summer, we had quite a
few large trees and a couple of them were

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.240
on their way out, dying, and we wanted to
build a shop in that area, so we had some

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.230
trees we had to dispose of. So, the first
thing we did was we hired an expert to cut

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.249
down the main tree from the top to the bottom
into big hunks, so that we could use it for

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:47.589
firewood. Then, we had all the branches cut
off and we didn't know what to do with them.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.870
So, my husband rented a chipper at the local
rental equipment store and we brought it home.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.519
It wasn't very much to rent it for a day,
we were very surprised to find out it wasn't

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.770
as much as we thought it would be. And we
took all of the branches and ran it through

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.310
the chipper and as a result, we have a pile
of wood chips. I love my wood chips. I'm using

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:14.479
it for everything; between our raised flower
beds, we had some pest barrier (which is plastic)

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.250
down and we were going to put rocks on top
of it, but we decided to put the wood chips

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.799
on top. No weeds have come up and it's really
nice in between the raised beds too. It's

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.689
making it really warm in between, and everything
is growing really well. Now, when I'm starting

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.640
some new raised beds, I'm just putting a little
layer of the wood chips on the bottom of the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.540
raised bed. That way I know there is going
to be great drainage and none of my plants

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.780
will rot. So, I'm going to put compost on
top of the chips. So, I just find that whenever

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.380
you have trees that you need to get rid of
or anything else that is woody, you can always

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.469
rent a chipper and turn it into wood compost
that you can use for many years. Next we will

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.369
talk about how to use leaves and grass clippings
in compost.
