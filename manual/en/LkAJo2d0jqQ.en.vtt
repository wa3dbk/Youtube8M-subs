00:00:00.493 --> 00:00:02.267
I'm telling you this is liquid...

00:00:02.267 --> 00:00:04.183
Look, don't you see it's solid?!

00:00:04.183 --> 00:00:05.704
Wait...

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:10.107
Oh you're right, it's solid!

00:00:11.312 --> 00:00:13.193
QUOI?!

00:00:18.123 --> 00:00:20.554
Actually, this is neither a liquid nor a solid.

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:26.452
Well yes, it is a liquid but it has particular properties we can play around with.

00:00:26.988 --> 00:00:30.149
A fluid, whether it be a gas or a liquid, is called "Newtonian" if

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:38.022
the constraints you encounter when trying to move around in it (the "resistant forces") are a linear function of the speed at which you move.

00:00:38.022 --> 00:00:42.886
To make it simple, with Newtonian fluids like air or water,

00:00:42.886 --> 00:00:48.167
if I move my hand in it at some speed, I will feel a certain force of resistance - the constraint,

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:53.267
and if I move twice faster, I will feel exactly twice as much opposing force.

00:00:53.751 --> 00:01:01.971
Another property of those fluids, is that their viscosity - the slope of this line - is constant and does not depend on the speed you're moving at.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.014
If I move slowly or quickly in it, it doesn't become more or less viscous suddenly.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.345
Oh yeah, that's liquid!

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.502
Accordingly, the fluids we call "Non-Newtonian" don't respect those rules, for their viscosity changes depending on the speed you're moving it.

00:01:18.502 --> 00:01:26.170
Two main types of Non-Newtonian fluids exist: the shear thinning (pseudoplastics) fluids; their viscosity will decrease if you move faster,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.384
for instance ketchup; if you gently press the bottle it remains clogged and viscous, but if you press harder it splashes all over the place!

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:41.446
The second type - that we have here - is shear thickening (dilatant) fluids, whose viscosity will increase as you try to move it faster.

00:01:41.452 --> 00:01:45.820
If you move slowly, it's not very viscous and you don't feel much constraints,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.595
but if you double the speed, you're not just doubling the constraints and viscosity, they're multiplied by much more!

00:01:51.595 --> 00:01:56.610
And this is why you feel like it's solid and viscous when you wiggle your hand in it.

00:01:57.434 --> 00:02:03.538
Ok kids, now I'm gonna teach you how to make Non-Newtonian fluid at home, all you need is water and cornstarch!

00:02:03.538 --> 00:02:04.960
Let's go!

00:02:25.904 --> 00:02:27.860
I'm taking out the lumps.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.301
In terms of proportions, you need to mix about 2/3 cornstarch with 1/3 water (mass).

00:02:35.303 --> 00:02:46.466
My advice is to pour water in slowly until it reaches a good consistency, but 
 be careful not to add too much or you'll have to let it dry...

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:47.929
How much do we have here?

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:51.100
About 4kg (8.8lb) of cornstarch.

00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:56.550
So now we have to add the water progressively, but I guess we will need more than 2L (.5 gal).

00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:01.880
Also if you want to, you can add food dye to the water before you mix it all up to give it colors!

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.176
I let you knead the dough!

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.250
Oh yes, knead it well...

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.908
Ok, just a little bit more water and it should be fine!

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.601
There you go, your Non-Newtonian fluid is ready!

00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:26.270
If you move it slowly, it's a liquid, but if you strike it...

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.120
It's solid...

00:03:33.324 --> 00:03:36.540
Now I suggest we move on to a few experiments.

00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:41.250
First up, the ultimate strength test with our tiny mechanical hammer!

00:03:41.251 --> 00:03:43.250
3... 2... 1...

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.631
Wow, it holds...

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.970
It's really sticky!

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.005
I'm cutting the cake!

00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:58.745
I want a piece!

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.774
Oh... It doesn't work... How crazy is that!

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.378
Do you think it's bulletproof? If I shoot it with the air rifle...

00:04:09.663 --> 00:04:13.120
I may not aim properly, don't blame me!

00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:15.560
Let's see what it does...

00:04:15.562 --> 00:04:17.530
I bet on a bounce.

00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:23.900
I believe it went in and didn't come out!

00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:28.380
The pellet has enough force to penetrate, but I think it's still inside.

00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:30.627
What do you have Sloane?
- I've got your pellet!

00:04:30.627 --> 00:04:36.860
Indeed it slows the bullet as the fluid becomes solid when it's hit, but it ain't bulletproof...

00:04:36.865 --> 00:04:37.990
At all.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.271
Now, let's move on to some acoustic experiments!

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.839
I'm gonna support it with... Professional wedges!

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:56.590
The experiment we're gonna do now, is to pour Non-Newtonian fluid - colored in yellow - on top of this high-speaker,

00:04:56.594 --> 00:05:00.149
and make it vibrate at a low frequency, around 20-30Hz.

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:10.135
And for an interesting optical illusion, we have set up a ray of LEDs connected to a signal generator, and we will get them to blink at the same frequency as the speaker.

00:05:10.135 --> 00:05:18.500
What we'll get is called "Stroboscopic Effect"; the speaker will seem to be standstill or very slow if the frequencies are equal or close enough.

00:05:18.504 --> 00:05:24.864
You'll see the Non-Newtonian fluid dance without the speaker moving, it's just an optical illusion but it should be nice.

00:05:25.243 --> 00:05:28.456
We will start with no stroboscopic effect, just with ambient lighting.

00:05:28.456 --> 00:05:31.590
It'll sweep from 20 to 40Hz...

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.958
Oh, there was something!

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.132
And now nothing...

00:05:42.763 --> 00:05:46.230
It looked good at the beginning, around 25Hz or something...

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.940
After a few tests we've had a hard time, so now we're simply gonna drop the goo on it with no stroboscopic effect.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.809
THAT'S AWESOME DUDE!

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:03.173
Oh! Thumbs up!

00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:08.470
The constarch-water mixture is Non-Newtonian because it's made of microscopic particles;

00:06:08.473 --> 00:06:14.226
when you go in slowly, the starch particles have time to move past each other thanks to water but as soon as you go faster,

00:06:14.226 --> 00:06:19.000
you're chasing all of the water in between and the grains get stuck up against each other, and it becomes solid again.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.862
This time, the speaker is directly connected to the LEDs, so the stroboscopic effect will be present at all time,

00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:31.528
it will look like the speaker is not vibrating, and we're gonna throw in a square wave so it's gonna sound horrible and everything might burn up but...

00:06:31.528 --> 00:06:33.766
Never mind, it's for Science!

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.160
It's alive!

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.620
That's awesome!

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.463
Catch it!

00:06:45.463 --> 00:06:47.469
Make it spin!

00:06:52.307 --> 00:06:54.160
It's like ficello!

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.689
There's more spread out on the table than on the speaker!

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.671
You've decided to break it, huh?

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.292

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.120
Oh Vincent, hi there!

00:07:25.665 --> 00:07:28.257
You need to add water!

00:07:28.257 --> 00:07:28.660
DU!

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.960
Don't do that, put it down!

00:07:33.962 --> 00:07:37.042
SCIENCE, BETTER WHEN IT'S DIRTY!

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.200
Hoho!

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.059
Oh yeah that's definitely solid!

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.433
You f***ing kidding me!?

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.289
We're loosing ingredients!

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:45.289
...let me dunk my face in it.

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:46.469
No that's me!

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.895
It's cold!

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.415
It brings back memories...

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.758
That's what I call cooking!
