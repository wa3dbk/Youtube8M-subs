00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:24.808
V: What is that?

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:26.288

00:00:26.288 --> 00:00:27.998

00:00:27.998 --> 00:00:29.912
R: You climb buildings and...

00:00:29.912 --> 00:00:32.805

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:35.005

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.840
R: This is $800!!

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.113
R: I don't even know who they are, but they're pretty.

00:00:39.113 --> 00:00:41.413
R: That's kind of an interesting store decoration.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.540
S: Yeah, I love it.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.900

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:50.385
R: Omg, look at the giant Alien!

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:53.465

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:54.740
J: Really?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.420

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.160

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.780
R: This is really cool! Someone made this out of something.

00:01:00.272 --> 00:01:02.672
R: Look at this skill made of skulls.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.460

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.860

00:01:06.513 --> 00:01:07.793

00:01:07.793 --> 00:01:10.175
R: Omg, look at the Ninja Turtles backpack!

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:12.793
R: It's a turtle shell, with turtles on it.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.420
R: I would know this symbol anywhere!

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.095
J: What's that?

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.960
R: Star Wars.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.840
J: Oh, Star Wars?

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.860
R: Do I look like a Ninja Turtle?

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.014
J: What's that?

00:01:23.014 --> 00:01:24.214
R: A Ninja Turtle.

00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:25.693

00:01:25.693 --> 00:01:26.793

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.380
R: Omg, that's awesome!

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.133
R: You could be like the protagonist of a show.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.960
R: It's so cute!

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080
R: I wanna see you in your school uniform.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.580
J: What?!

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.340
R: It'd be adorable.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.740
R: This is so cute!

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.760
J: I like those more professional ones over there.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.673
J: Were you into those stuff?

00:01:49.673 --> 00:01:52.446
R: Yeah, I'll have to ask my mom to look through our pictures,

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:55.611
R: see if she can find any embarrassing gothic Rachel photos.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.900
R: I tried watching Evangelion and I only got through a couple episodes,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.400
R: but whenever I see these adorable figures, it makes me want to watch it more.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.893
R: Look, she's a ballerina! Asuka, right?

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.840
J: Yeah, Asuka.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.960
R: I want this figure of her as a ballerina, and I've never even seen it.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.515
J: Because she has red hair as well?

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.240
R: I guess so!

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.080
J: You just relate to her?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.840
R: I'm a little biased.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.073
S: Pricey watches.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.960
R: Why are there so many watch stores here?

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.710
R: Do you want to look at any of the watches, Jun?

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.650
S: This one's $39,000.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.650
R: (Jun loves watches!!)

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.760
R: A $40,000 watch!

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.120
R: Victor's talking to the clerk again.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.000
R: It's a giant ice tray!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.534
R: What do you do with something ice that's this big??

00:02:33.534 --> 00:02:36.194
R: They have old, collectible figures here, on the card.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.560
R: My family actually has a huge collection of vintage toys.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.500
J: I watched some of the movies and...

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.360
J: Yoda is like the master of...

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.370
J: the... I forgot the blade thing.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.940
J: Lightsaber!!

00:02:55.994 --> 00:02:58.374
J: Okay, I don't care about those girls' names.

00:02:58.374 --> 00:02:59.894
J: Can you tell me the names of those cats?

00:02:59.894 --> 00:03:00.714
R: Luna and Artemis.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.220
J: Wow.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.960
R: Okay, well, in America,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.280
R: back when anime started showing on TV,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.353
R: it was mainly on a Cartoon Network program called Toonami.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.000
R: And Sailor Moon and DBZ were kind of like the first two big ones

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.586
R: that they played, and I watched all of every of it.

00:03:18.586 --> 00:03:19.924
J: DBZ... oh, Dragonball?

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.300
R: Yeah, DBZ. Dragonball Z.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.800
J: Z.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.080
R: Not Dragonball.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.020
R: Look at Squall! He's so cool!

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.520
R: We're trying to find our way out now

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.860
R: and also find Victor, who gets easily distracted and wanders off.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.354
S: So distracted, all the time.

00:03:36.354 --> 00:03:37.394
R: We need to put him on a leash.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.400
S: We need to put him on a leash.

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:42.493
