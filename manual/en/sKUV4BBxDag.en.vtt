Hi. My name is Cole with Expert Village and
I'm going to be talking about the Buoyancy

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.519
Compensator Device, or also BCD. The BCD,
basically, it looks pretty technical, but

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.740
it's nothing more than a glorified life preserver.
At the surface, it's inflated using this blue

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.319
button so we can float there and hang out
nice and easy. You don't have to kick or struggle

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:25.099
or anything. Then, when you're ready to go
down, press the black button, and it deflates

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:33.150
and you sink on down. Now, one thing also
that it is used for is to make the diver neutrally

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.691
buoyant underwater so you're not banging against
the reef and not floating back up to the surface.

00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:42.359
And so, you do that usually by just tapping
little bits of air into the jacket and inflating

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:49.200
it. It can also be manually inflated, should
the mechanism start to fail or the hose become

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.309
cut, whatever.
And then when we're ready to go down, we simply

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.131
press the black button and the water pressure
squeezes the air out of the jacket, and we

00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:06.979
can sink on down real nice and slow. Most
BCDs also have D-rings on them to attach various

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:16.790
accessories, such as slates. You can also
attach signaling devices and stuff like that.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.810
And attachments for hoses. Depending upon
what style of BCD, you can either have the

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.490
back inflates where the inflation bladder
is in the back, or you can have the jacket

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.270
styles where the inflation bladder actually
wraps around your body. The jacket style holds

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.270
you a bit more upright, but the back inflate,
there's just a lot less on you. That's why

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.290
I prefer it. It doesn't really feel like I'm
wearing a jacket. Also, with a lot of the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.960
jackets today have the weight integrated pouches,
which are really nice because the weights

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.100
slide right in here, this slides right into
the pouch, and nowadays, lots of the use clips

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.950
instead of Velcro. This is a slightly older
jacket, and because clips are more reliable

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.700
than Velcro, or in time Velcro wears out.
