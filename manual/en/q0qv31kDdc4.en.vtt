Hi I'm Donna Wolfe from naztazia.com Today
I'm going to show you how to dye yarn with

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.190
Kool-Aid. You'll find a lot of things on my
website dyed with Kool Aid, since I could never

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.489
find the exact color yarn I want in
the stores. To dye your yarn a single color,

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:27.020
you'll need some Kool-Aid, and some gloves.
Since we'll be microwaving the yarn, I like

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.860
these Ziploc large containers the best. If you wish you can use Pyrex glass instead.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.410
Kool Aid packages can look similar, so the
key is looking at the glass of Kool-Aid the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.840
character is holding to tell you what color
the yarn will end up looking like. This one

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.820
will end up red. Most importantly you'll need
yarn, but not just any kind. 100% wool is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.300
the best for this project. Now you can use
a yarn that has only 20% wool in it - however

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.910
the color will be not quite as vibrant. Before
you begin, cut 2 pieces of yarn to serve as

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.250
ties. It's best if our yarn forms a circle,
so I like to wind the yarn either around a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:14.380
chair, or around my arm. For your first time,
just wind about 35 to 50 yards of yarn. Tie

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.539
the circle of yarn at the top and one at the
bottom to hold the circle in place. Next I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:28.189
like to use baby shampoo to gently wash the
yarn. And rinse with lukewarm water. This

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:36.270
is not an exact science, but I like to use
3 packets of Kool-Aid with 8 ounces of water,

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.299
and 50 yards of yarn. Feel free to adjust
this amount either more or less. Take your

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:49.700
still wet yarn and toss it right into the
Kool-Aid bath. Next, place the container in

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.450
the microwave and microwave your yarn on high
power, for 2 minutes. The heat helps the dye

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.459
bond with the protein fibers in the yarn.
After 2 minutes, take your yarn out and place

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:09.039
it to rest for another 2 minutes. Be careful
because the yarn and water might be hot. After

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.440
2 minutes, place the yarn back in the microwave
and heat it for 2 more minutes. And then let

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.470
it rest again. Do this maybe once or twice
more until most of the color has been absorbed

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.570
by the yarn and the water is somewhat clear.
Then let your yarn cool down completely. Wash

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.420
and rinse your yarn again. Then either hang
it on the clothes line or place it on a towel

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.750
to dry. By the way, the written instructions
for this video are on my website naztazia.com.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.050
Let's move on making a hand-painted, multi-color
yarn. I like filling these squeeze bottles

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.580
with 3 Kool Aid packs and a few ounces of
water. I'm never too happy with the yellow

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.970
dye in the Kool Aid, so I enhance it with
a few drops of yellow food coloring to really

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.970
make it vivid. Then shake it up. Do this for
2 or 3 more colors. Next take out some plastic

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.110
wrap and lay it on your table. Then place
your yarn in the center of it. I like to place

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.120
my work in the container now, but you could
do it later. Take your squeeze bottle, and

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.200
squeeze out small amounts of kool aid over
a few inches of yarn. You might need to press

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.670
it into the yarn to get it to absorb nicely.
I'm moving onto the next color now. It's quite

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.130
fine if the colors touch, as they will blend
into each other. However if you don't want

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.570
a muddy brown color to form in between your
colors, try to move along according to the

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.710
order of the rainbow, such as red orange yellow
green blue and purple. Once you are done,

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.040
wrap the plastic wrap around the yarn the
best you can. I do like my colors to blend

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.790
into each other, so I'm going quickly with
this. But you can be more careful and keep

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.740
them somewhat separate. Into the microwave
like before with 2 minutes heat followed by

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.840
2 minutes rest a few times. And once completed
wash and rinse your yarn and let dry. You

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.270
might be wondering if you can use just food
coloring instead of kool-aid. The answer is

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.910
yes, with one small addition. Kool Aid has
citric acid in it, which helps the dye bond

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.470
to the proteins in the yarn. Since food coloring
by itself does not, you will need to add 1

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.550
or 2 tablespoons of vinegar to the dye bath
first. And the Easter egg dyes the kids use,

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.620
yes, they work too with the addition of vinegar.
One more thing, if you are using only one

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.889
color and have a nice sunny day, forget using
the microwave. Just place your Kool-Aid and

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.980
yarn in a glass jar and let it brew in the
sun for most of the day to get a very pretty

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.010
color yarn. By the way, to view this video
