00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.830
Hellooooo. That's my Julia Childs thing. I'll
get to the news in a second. But first, hey,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.870
I have a question. When you signed up for
your account on youtube, did they ask you

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.720
"are you dumber than dirt?" No? dirt? no?
dirt? no? Not all of you, most of you have

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.150
good taste. I mean, hey, you come back for
more of me each week, so you must have good

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.590
taste right? I have no taste at all. I mean,
I believe that Heidi Montag is the next Madonna.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.750
Watch. I get over 1,000 emails a day but the
one thing I get asked the most is how long

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.870
have you been a guy? One thing I get asked
the most is, would you PLEASE do me a favor

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.260
and tell people about me on your show? What
I say back to them is "Are you famous? Are

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.929
you stupid? Cause you have to be both to be
mentioned on this show. You definitely got

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:58.929
the one thing, but not the other. But these
requests keep coming in. So, just to make

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:06.830
all of them happy, here is my shoutouts to
all of those people. Support them, go to their

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.540
channel, sub them. You'll be so happy that
you did. yadda, yadda, yadda. Oh, and hey.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.229
If anybody knows how to get me on Digg, I'd
appreciate letting me know. Thanks. And let's

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:29.690
get on with the news.
It's official. Tiger Woods will be back to

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.799
the Masters this month. When asked if Elin
will be there by his side, he quickly replied,

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.399
"Not a good idea. As much as I enjoyed it,
it's taken me this long to get that nine iron

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:45.340
pulled out of my ass!"
Meanwhile, former Bush press secretary Ari

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.540
Fleischer has been hired to try and revive
Tiger's golf career. Good idea? Well, let's

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:01.009
take a look at how that's worked out for Bush.
Sunday became an historic and happy day this

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.310
week. Historic for the health bill that was
finally passed through congress by a narrow

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.769
margin, and happy because Rush Limbaugh promised
to leave the US if it did pass. Anybody want

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.849
to drive him to the airport?
The Oscars were aired recently, and as always

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.069
the stars celebrated at one of several different
after parties. And which actress was seen

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.340
with the biggest boobs? That would be any
actress that was seen talking with this boob.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.920
And now it's happened. Hell has frozen over.
It must have when we all found out that somebody

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.769
crazier than Glenn Beck has appeared on his
own show. And that would be congressman, Eric

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.340
Massa. Being accused of groping staffers,
he shrugged it off as simply being a tickle

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.140
fight. Hoping that this story can maintain
itself to the next holiday season, Mattel

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.540
is already making plans for their next hot
new toy for the kiddies, "Tickle Me Massa."

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:06.080
"I'm just tickling staffers! It's my birthday!
Tickle me! I'll tickle you back! Again, again!"

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.250
Heidi Montag fired her husband and hired a
Psychic to now manage her career. Wait, I'm

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:21.240
getting a psychic impression, oh not, it's
gas. Nope, it's an impression. Heidi, if she's

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.739
a real psychic, she would have seen your career
end with you being kicked off of MTV's I'm

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:38.890
a Celebrity. Do ya think? I predict there
will be more Toyotas sold this year than Heidi's

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.700
new CD, barely.
Daylight savings time was observed last weekend

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.319
meaning that we set the clocks ahead one hour,
except for Howard Stern who with this haircut

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.950
set his clock back to 1980.
Jessica Simpson this week did several interviews

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.329
talking about her sex life, her weight problems
 , and uh, I think she has a new show. I've

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.610
arranged with Youtube to set up some special
software to measure what you guys think of

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.989
Jessica Simpson. So on your number pad just
push the numbers one through nine to mark

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.110
how you feel about the following items about
Jessica Simpson, with 1 being the lowest and

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.229
9 being the highest.
Played Daisy Duke.

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:29.229
Putting on some weight.
Admits to being Sexual Napalm.

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:35.240
Wants to have a baby.
Without any commitment.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.419
Doesn't brush her teeth.
McKenzie Phillips revealed this week that

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:49.970
she had paid $50,000 for a new face, but unfortunately
it turned out to be this face.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.700
The worlds oldest woman in the world died
this week at age 114. Contrary to popular

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.770
belief, it was not this woman.
And the world's shortest man measuring only

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:10.500
29 inches also died this week, now making
Ryan Seacrest the shortest man in the world.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.180
And finally, Erin Andrews faced her stalker
this week who had secretly filmed her naked

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.220
in her hotel room. In response to him only
receiving a 30 month sentence she said, "I'm

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.680
very upset and I'm tired of being in the spotlight.
Oh and uh, make sure you watch me this month

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.150
on Dancing With The Stars.
And that's the news. I'll see you here again,

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.229
next week. And make sure you watch me on Boxee.
