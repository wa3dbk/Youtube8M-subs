This week the President
wrapped up the trip to

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.310
Panama, and while there, he

Phil Donahue.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.586

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.098
On Friday the President was
in Panama.

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:34.134
That morning he stopped by
the Panama Canal before

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:37.203
participating in the Seventh
Summit of the Americas.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.606
The summit began with the
signing of a trade deal

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.641
between Boeing and Copa
Airlines.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:42.642
The President: Twelve
thousand jobs in the United

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:43.643
States this stands for.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:44.677

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:45.812

which includes the leaders
of the countries in

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:50.984
Central America.

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:52.352
Later that day, the
President sat down for a

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.754
discussion on economic
development, education,

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:58.491
and governance at the CEO
Summit of the Americas.

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:00.994
Later, the President spoke
at a Civil Society Forum.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:02.695
The President: When the
United States sees space

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.632
closing for civil society we
will work to open it.

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:08.535
When efforts are made to
wall you off from the world

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.336
we'll try to connect you
with each other.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.105
When you're silenced we'll
try to speak out

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.573
alongside you.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:14.674
(applause)

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:15.942
And when you're suppressed
we want to help

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:17.076
strengthen you.

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:19.112
Narrator: On Summit Saturday
the President held a series

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:21.448
of meetings, first with the
leaders of the 35 member

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:24.117
states, then one on ones
with the Prime Minister of

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:28.988
Canada, the presidents of
Brazil, Colombia, and Cuba.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:33.092
The historic meeting between
President Castro and

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:34.194
President Obama served as
the next step in normalizing

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:35.962
relations between our two
countries.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:37.363
The President: I think if we
can build on this spirit of

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:42.669
mutual respect and
candidness that, over time,

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:45.905
we will see not just a
transformation in the

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.373
relationship between our two
countries,

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:50.343
but a positive impact
throughout the hemisphere

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:51.478
and the world.

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:53.146
Narrator: On Monday the
President and Secretary of

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:55.315
Agriculture Tom Vilsack met
with eight members of the

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:58.751
National 4H community in the
Oval Office.

00:01:58.751 --> 00:01:59.819
The President: And you're
from what state?

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:00.353
Geneva Wright: Alaska.

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:01.054
The President: Alaska.

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:01.821
You came a long way.

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:02.689
Come in.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:03.957
Narrator: There they got to
hear about the efforts to

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.860
open doors of opportunity
for kids all across

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.127
rural America.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:09.429
Jacob Jensen: At our club we
donated

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.798
1, 000 pounds of like
vegetables and

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.600
(unintelligible) that we
just grow in our garden.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.602
Geneva Wright: We obviously
realize how much poverty we

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:17.203
have in that village.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.906
We only have one store and
most of the things on the

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:21.875
shelves are expired.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.376
So 4H has gone through our
school and we're going to

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:26.679
make a garden for the
community this spring.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.780
The President: That's great.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.682
Narrator: In the afternoon
the President conducted a

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:31.284
round of television
interviews with the anchors

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:34.521
from Columbus, Harrisburg,
Madison, Portland,

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.055
and Sioux Falls, all to talk
about

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.490
middle-class economics.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.259
The President: People like
me who don't need tax breaks

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.362
are getting tax breaks, and
ordinary folks end up paying

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:45.632
more to pay for it; and
that's just not fair.

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:48.334
It's also not, by the way,
how we grow our economy.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.136
Narrator: On Tuesday morning
the President met with Iraqi

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:51.738
Prime Minister Abadi.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.672
The President: We are
committing an additional

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:57.043
$200 million in humanitarian
aid to help stabilize

00:02:57.043 --> 00:03:00.246
communities and to help
those who've been displaced

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:02.749
from their homes, have lost
their jobs,

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.817
have seen their property
destroyed.

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.286
Narrator: Throughout the day
the White House was buzzing

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:09.522
with the sounds of gospel as
rehearsals were underway for

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:12.692
a concert that evening.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.894
Between rehearsals, the
stars participated in a

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:17.363
workshop with students from
across the country who are

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.132
interested in the music
industry.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:25.371
Audience: Oh happy day, oh
happy day; oh happy day,

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.473
oh happy day.

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.943
Narrator: That evening it
was show time.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.778
The White House was
transformed into a vibrant

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:34.948
and joyous concert as the
legendary artists paid

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:37.150
tribute to gospel music.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.818
The President: Gospel music
has evolved over time,

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:42.322
but its heart stays true.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:45.425
It still has an unmatched
power to strike the deepest

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:46.693
cord in all of us.

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:47.994
Narrator: On Wednesday
morning the President met

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:49.963
with the presidents of
Liberia, Guinea,

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:52.832
and Sierra Leone, continuing
their efforts to get to zero

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.367
Ebola cases.

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:56.502
The leaders discussed
long-term strategies to

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.605
prevent future epidemics.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:00.273
Then the President headed
south to one of the

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:02.308
fastest-growing cities in
America, Charlotte,

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:04.510
North Carolina, for a town
hall meeting hosted by

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.946
BlogHer and SheKnows.

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:08.715
On Thursday the President
marked the eighth annual

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:11.084
Wounded Warrior Project
Soldier Ride.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.452
This cycling event
celebrates our

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:13.419
wounded warriors --

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.188
(shout)

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:16.656
-- and raises awareness of
the physical and

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:18.691
psychological damages of
war,

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.793
and honors the courage and
resilience of

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:21.894
America's veterans.

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:23.229
The President: Everyone,
I've got my warrior on.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.468
(unintelligible) true, it's
not quite as good as yours,

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:31.337
warrior (unintelligible).

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:32.739
Narrator: Then the President
hosted a meeting with

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:34.173
Champions of Change.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:35.908
These are advocates from
across America who are

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:38.845
leading the charge for paid
family leave, equal pay,

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.647
fighting pregnancy
discrimination,

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:42.415
and other issues that are
critically important to

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:43.716
working families.

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:44.884
The President: We shouldn't
have to choose between the

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:47.387
rewards of work and raising
a family,

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:49.222
and we've got to fight for
that change.

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:51.457
These Champions of Change
have made a difference in

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.358
this area.

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:53.559
Narrator: Thanks for tuning
