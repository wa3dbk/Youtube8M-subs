Hi, I'm Bob from Toronto Canada this video is about how to play an easy Jimmy Page attack solo

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:15.199
solo from heart full of soul by The Yardbirds

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.059
The song was also played by Rush with the exact same at our soul

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.060
other CD called feedback

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:32.709
I'll play the solo once with a backing guitar track, and then I'll explain how to play the solo for note their goals

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.410
Soyal starts with an open 4th string do you know?

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.519
That's the third string seventh fret

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.229
Twice

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.339
Seventh fret slaps in the night strap

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.110
So true

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.849
District 7

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.930
Once again slowly

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.420
Let's play twice then it moves up to the tenth fret position

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.039
Fourth string twelfth fret

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.040
Play twice

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
Third string 10th fret

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.079
Twice RIT

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.329
10th fret

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.509
Back to the fourth string twelfth fret

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.950
So that part is once again

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.349
Then it's once again fourth string 12th fret play twice

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.580
Third string 10th fret

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.700
12th fret

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
Then adapt

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.170
It's the second string their key threat

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.919
Then 10th fret on the first string so once again that part

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.589
Then it's fourth string twelfth fret play twice

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.829
Third string tenth fret well

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.199
For a string 12th fret so once again

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.210
And then it's the 11th threat of force shrimp

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.220
And twice on this warrant

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.290
Gertrud 10th fret

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.949
The last your notes the 12th fret third string thumbs up

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.420
Once again that part

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.459
Let's seesaw so once again, I'll just play it again slowly

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:48.439
Now you want to play along the solo, I'll play the backing guitar track

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.778
There's my a note if you want to come to my guitar

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.829
Alright it goes 1 2 3 4

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.700
And that's the solar

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:43.099
Well, I hope this lesson has been helpful, and they have a guitar bus and websites there were fifty videos on it

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.640
