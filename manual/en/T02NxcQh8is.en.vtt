HoM 65: Hollow Earth Explored 01 September 2007

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.010
This is Jack.Is Earth hollow?

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.400
It was, though it‟s not now anymore.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:41.210
The reason I say that, is because in the centre of the Earth, a long, long, long, long time ago –

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.680
when the Atlaneans and Anu were still busy deriving their plan;

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.090
when Anu brought [his planet]up here, right next to Earth to be able to extract gold in the making of gold,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.330
and the manifestation of gold from the lava within the centre of Earth –

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.770
the interdimensional gravitations placement in the center of Earth –

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.180
manifesting gold, all within the Earth‟s core,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.210
and above, and in the centre, etcetera –

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.890
they did create, like, a… – this was now before everything became manifested – please, human beings, hear me –

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:28.660
before everything became manifested, they placed an interdimensional metallic placement within the centre of the Earth‟s core.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.600
The reason for this is:

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.520
that‟s where the beings „remained‟,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.000
of the Annunaki, that‟s where they„remained‟

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.220
while extracting gold from the Earth‟s core, which they manifested with the crystalised diamonds that were in the four corners of the world.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.300
So, that‟s where they stayed – though, Nibiru was still separate from Earth;

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.490
next to Earth, but not in Earth.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.880
So, that‟s where some beings from the Annunaki race „remained‟ – only some, not the entire planet, only some –

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.510
and this metallic placement was put around to make sure that the Annunki‟s race doesn‟t correlate,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.830
or form a relationship with the Atlanean race.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.380
Because remember, that was said,

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.690
that the Atlanteans did not feel comfortable with the Annunaki inhabiting their planet,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.080
because of the inter-relationship that may occur,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.150
and may influence the Atlaneans‟ expression, and the Annunaki‟s expression, etcetera.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.120
So, this metallic layer within the centre of the Earth

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.300
basically made sure that this intercorrelation doesn‟t exist,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.020
or inter-relationship –

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.900
so that the Atlaneans and the Annunaki don‟t influence each other‟s expression within existence.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.090
So, this metallic placement within the center of the Earth‟s core basically

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.740
separated and formed a complete interdimensional vacuum

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.730
within the center of the Earth‟s core,

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.290
so that the Atlaneans and the Annunaki race don‟t influence each other.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.230
Though, I told you that the Annunaki race, through time,

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.290
then inevitably had to leave – so, they left,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.020
and there was, like, a hollow space in the centre of the Earth‟s core –

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.810
but it‟s not there anymore, because it was an inter-dimensional placement.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:31.120
So – in terms of: as everything solid manifested, the interdimensional manifestation manifested as together with the Earth –

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.120
but in terms of the lava and everything.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.870
It still exists interdimensionally, this metallic placement, it‟s still there –

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.460
though, the Earth is not hollow, no.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.320
Thank you very much.
This is Jack.
