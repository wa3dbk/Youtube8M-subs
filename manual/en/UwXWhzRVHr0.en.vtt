00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:01.037
- Hey guys.
(playful music)

00:00:01.037 --> 00:00:04.706
So there's a lot more of you
now than there used to be

00:00:04.706 --> 00:00:08.212
because that video that I
did about looking like a slut

00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:10.720
kind of got featured everywhere.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.810
So that's cool.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.249
Hello, if you're new.

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.245
Welcome, I don't always
talk about things like that.

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:19.752
And today we're talking about books.

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.052
So that's cool.

00:00:21.052 --> 00:00:22.352
That's what we're gonna do today.

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:24.094
And I hope you like it and stick around.

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:27.274
So I got this really cool looking package

00:00:27.274 --> 00:00:30.223
in the post recently from Hot Key Books.

00:00:30.223 --> 00:00:32.808
And it arrived about a week
ago, but I've been away

00:00:32.808 --> 00:00:35.641
and busy and it's just been lying there

00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:38.868
and tempting me, but I
thought that I would wait

00:00:38.868 --> 00:00:41.004
until I could film to open it.

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:42.476
So I've no idea what's inside it.

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:44.882
And it's been tormenting
me for the last week.

00:00:44.882 --> 00:00:47.227
And I'm excited that
I can finally open it.

00:00:47.227 --> 00:00:48.156
I recently moved to London

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:51.057
and these are the only books
that I've managed to carry

00:00:51.057 --> 00:00:53.566
down from Manchester at the moment.

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.143
So, my bookshelf is looking really sparse,

00:00:56.143 --> 00:01:00.253
so hopefully this will
make it more exciting.

00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:01.838
Let's open this.

00:01:01.838 --> 00:01:06.598
Oooo, okay, so the first thing
I see is Dawn O'Porter's book

00:01:06.598 --> 00:01:09.409
"Paper Aeroplanes, the
Story of Friendship".

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.686
I quite like Dawn O'Porter.

00:01:10.686 --> 00:01:12.752
She's a cool, British celebrity

00:01:12.752 --> 00:01:15.562
that talks about sex
and feminism and stuff.

00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:18.023
"Thoughtful, introspective
Flo couldn't be more different

00:01:18.023 --> 00:01:20.748
"to extroverted sexually curious Renee."

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:21.978
I think I'm Renee.

00:01:21.978 --> 00:01:23.254
(laughing)

00:01:23.254 --> 00:01:26.042
"But what they have in common runs deep.

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:28.154
"Loneliness, frustration
and a longing for escape

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:29.571
"from their dysfunctional families."

00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:30.406
Cool!

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:32.287
I'll put that somewhere.

00:01:32.287 --> 00:01:33.967
Nailed it.

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:35.081
Next.

00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:36.799
Oh wait, I've got a note.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.355
"Hi hun, I hope you enjoy them

00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:40.306
"and you're settling in London, Jen."

00:01:40.306 --> 00:01:41.266
Thanks, Jen!

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.571
Oh, another Dawn O'Porter.

00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:43.785
"Goose".

00:01:43.785 --> 00:01:45.062
"Renee and Flo are 18."

00:01:45.062 --> 00:01:46.851
(gasps) They're getting older.

00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:48.407
Exciting.

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:52.538
"As Red as Blood" by Salla Simukka.

00:01:52.538 --> 00:01:54.141
This looks scary.

00:01:54.141 --> 00:01:57.532
"Lumikki Andersson is familiar
with secrets and lies.

00:01:57.532 --> 00:01:58.716
"But she also has a rule

00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:00.364
"not to mind other people's business.

00:02:00.364 --> 00:02:02.198
"When she discovers a lot of money

00:02:02.198 --> 00:02:04.892
"hanging blood stained
in her school dark room"

00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:08.120
(gasps) "that rule is
put sharply to the test."

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.396
Ooo, it's set in Finland.

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:11.858
"Criminal underworld,
dangerous web of corruption,

00:02:11.858 --> 00:02:12.833
"deceit and murder."

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:14.527
Ooo, that looks cool.

00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:15.433
- [Voiceover] I wanna read that--

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:16.686
- Yeah. (laughing)

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:18.104
Dodie's here.

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:19.015
- [Dodie] Hey!

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:22.683
- "Vivian Versus the
Apocalypse" by Katie Coyle.

00:02:22.683 --> 00:02:26.956
Ooo is this gonna be some like,
post apocalyptic fun thing?

00:02:26.956 --> 00:02:29.835
"Vivian Apple never believed
in the church of America,

00:02:29.835 --> 00:02:31.507
"unlike her fanatical parents.

00:02:31.507 --> 00:02:34.085
"And as for the so-called
impending rapture,

00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:37.893
"she knew she'd believe
that when she saw it."

00:02:37.893 --> 00:02:39.261
Okay great, I'm really good at--

00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:41.026
- [Dodie] She said she's believe
that when she saw it, yep.

00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:42.837
- (laughing) Is this, is that a sentence?

00:02:42.837 --> 00:02:43.753
I'm really confused.

00:02:43.753 --> 00:02:45.021
Nice!

00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:46.205
Nice!

00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:48.232
Oh, it smells good as well.

00:02:48.232 --> 00:02:50.229
Um, hold on, it's just.

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.017
Yeah.
- [Dodie] (laughing)

00:02:52.017 --> 00:02:53.364
It sounds like the way you (mumbling).

00:02:53.364 --> 00:02:55.546
- Yeah, do you not sniff books?

00:02:56.246 --> 00:02:57.783
It's so good, come in here.

00:02:57.783 --> 00:02:58.642
Sniff a book.

00:02:58.642 --> 00:03:00.244
I can't believe you're not a book sniffer.

00:03:00.244 --> 00:03:01.274
- This is gonna be, oh.

00:03:01.274 --> 00:03:02.566
(laughing)

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:04.182
- Get down.

00:03:04.942 --> 00:03:05.870
Sniff the book.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.636
- Ah, that's good.

00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:08.192
Especially the ends in the background.

00:03:08.192 --> 00:03:09.260
I'm kinda just.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.444
(laughing)

00:03:10.444 --> 00:03:13.474
- No, oh no I'm so small.

00:03:14.244 --> 00:03:15.444
(sputters) Get off, get off me.

00:03:15.444 --> 00:03:16.582
Get off me, great!

00:03:16.582 --> 00:03:19.042
Vivian and the Apocalypse, sounds cool.

00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:22.201
And finally, ooo "We Were Liars".

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:23.709
I've read this already.

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.172
And I like it a lot.

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:26.101
- [Dodie] It's so good.

00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:26.960
- Have you read it?

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.913
- [Dodie] Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:03:27.913 --> 00:03:30.072
Very good book.

00:03:30.072 --> 00:03:34.600
I already have a copy
of this, so giveaway?

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.458
- [Dodie] Yes!

00:03:35.458 --> 00:03:38.198
So, wait how should we do this?

00:03:38.198 --> 00:03:39.382
What should the rules be?

00:03:39.382 --> 00:03:41.552
If you wanna win this I
will send it to you in post

00:03:41.552 --> 00:03:43.191
and I'll ship worldwide, I don't care.

00:03:43.191 --> 00:03:44.909
It's gonna be a Twitter competition,

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.858
'cause then it's easier for
me to get in touch with you.

00:03:47.858 --> 00:03:51.109
So, go follow me on Twitter and tweet me

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.853
which of these books I should read first

00:03:54.853 --> 00:03:56.641
and your opinions on them.

00:03:56.641 --> 00:04:00.061
Use the hashtag Hannahisaliar

00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:02.754
and so I will be able to
see all of the entries

00:04:02.754 --> 00:04:04.613
and then I will pick one of you

00:04:04.613 --> 00:04:07.012
and I will announce the winner on Twitter

00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:09.150
and then I will DM the winner.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.124
So make sure you follow me,

00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:11.193
so I can DM you.

00:04:11.193 --> 00:04:12.840
Cool, thanks for Hot Key Books

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.234

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:15.984
to add to my empty bookshelf.

00:04:15.984 --> 00:04:16.834
So thank you.

00:04:16.834 --> 00:04:18.529
I wanna start doing more book videos,

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.294
so let me know if you like this.

00:04:20.294 --> 00:04:22.871
Because I wanna be more book.

00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:25.379
