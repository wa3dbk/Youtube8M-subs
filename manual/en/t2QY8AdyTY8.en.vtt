Welcome back everybody from Expert Village.
Now, we're moving onto the next process of

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.599
the meal, which is the preparation of the
meat. As you can see, this is the meat that's

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.889
been marinating for a few hours here. We have
a few spices. A lot of Joya products. One

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:22.060
things that traditional about all Latin foods.
Lemon juice, season salt, adobo, little bit

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.920
of red peppers, and you see a little bit more
con cilantro y achotes. This has been sitting

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.439
for a good time, so that means it's going
to be nice and flavorful. What I'm going to

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.030
do is I'm going to pull this out right here
and I'm going to dice it up into some nice

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:47.969
little pieces.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:01:02.129
Fun, fun, fun. Cut them up nice and smooth.
There you go. Kind of like Chinese food. You

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:12.580
know how they cut their meat up. We do the
same thing. But they don't marinate it like

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:24.220
us. There we go. The meat is being chopped.
If you get some little pieces of fat there,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.610
you can just go ahead and toss them to the
side., but you know what, they sometimes make

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.720
it even better but it's not too healthy. I
like to pull them out. This mi amigos is el

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.560
ultimo tanto de chuleta, pork chop. Marinated
pork chop, which we know as chuleta. I'm going

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:56.070
to dice the last one up right here.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.670
Awesome. Now my friends, we are ready to cook
this meat up.
