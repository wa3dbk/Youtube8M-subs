00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.620
My name is Joanna and I am currently studying the masters

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.800
in education in childhood autism course, here at the university.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.990
Before I came to the university here, I was practicing as an occupational therapist,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.990
for four years, I had been working in an early education centre,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.030
with children ranging from about age three to seven

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.030
with a variety of needs and difficulties

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.970
and several of those children had autism, which is one of the reasons I pursued this course.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.160
I think what I enjoyed most about the course was just the diversity here, of the whole experience,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.720
the different people that you meet, from all different cultures and countries,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:50.720
being in a new country, really embracing all the different sorts of opportunities that come at you throughout the year,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:58.720
and really having an experience that both professionally and personally grew me.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.720
I think the learning experience that I have had over this past year was absolutely amazing.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.720
There was so much diversity in the course like I said, so much opportunity to meet people from all different places,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.720
and just to sort of learn a bit about autism from an international perspective, which was really, really cool.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:29.720
And yeah, a lot of topics and discussions that were covered were really interesting and really gave me the opportunity to

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.720
think and reflect about how that impacts me as a practitioner and how I think that could

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.720
help me adapt and grow in my approach.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.720
What I enjoyed about the campus and the city, was just how, everything was new and refreshing and exciting

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.720
because I came from Canada and I was sort of just plunked into this new environment

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.720
and at the beginning it was sort of overwhelming perhaps

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.720
but just really embracing that excitement and the challenges that come with it perhaps,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:10.720
but I think the university is beautiful, the campus is beautiful and I really loved having that student-campus feel.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.720
I think my advice would be to, when you are here studying, is to really embrace all the different opportunities

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.720
that you can. There are lots of different study groups or projects, or visits to programmes and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.720
I think definitely if you can, do those things. Because they add to the programme, they add to the experience

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:45.720
and my other piece of advice would be, just to really remember the importance of self motivation and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.720
being open to the support which are available to you, so you can be successful.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.720
So after I graduate I plan to return to Canada and I definitely feel that this programme has richly added to

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.000
my knowledge base and to the opportunities that are now open to me. I think this programme opened

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:16.000
lots of new doors career-wise and so I think I'm excited to see where it will lead and it's been one of those experiences where you know,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.720
you kind of come with a million questions and you leave with two million more

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
which is not necessarily a bad thing because it just really motivates you to keep learning and keep

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.720
on this journey of self discovery. So I think that, yeah, it's been an awesome part of that journey for me
