Hi, I'm Noopur on behalf of Expert Village.
In this clip, I'm going to tell you how to

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.370
make potato sandwich. Now, let's begin. To
make potato sandwich, we need boiled potato.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:39.420
Mash it first, then add some onion, some coriander
leaves, some pepper and salt. Mix this well

00:00:39.420 --> 00:01:00.800
so that a nice mixture is prepared.
The potatoes should be mashed properly. Then

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:13.770
apply this paste on a slice of bread so that
the entire slice is covered. Place another

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:23.960
slice of bread on this and then place it on
the toaster and leave it for three to four

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:34.649
minutes. So now, after four minutes, your
toast is ready. So, let's see. Now we take

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:45.509
this toast, since it's properly toasted, place
it on a plate, and then we can have it with

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:57.950
either tomato ketchup or maybe mustard sauce,
as per your wish. So here you go, your toast

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.600
is ready.
