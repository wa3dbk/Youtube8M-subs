00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.491
- Hey guys, so cherries are
at the peak of their season,

00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:05.951
and one of my favorite
desserts to serve with them

00:00:05.951 --> 00:00:08.726
is a classic French cherry clafouti.

00:00:08.726 --> 00:00:10.503
If you're not familiar with a clafouti,

00:00:10.503 --> 00:00:12.152
it is an egg custard dessert

00:00:12.152 --> 00:00:13.871
that's typically served with cherries,

00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:16.114
although you can use
really any fruit you like.

00:00:16.114 --> 00:00:18.436
You typically see them a lot
in the markets in France,

00:00:18.436 --> 00:00:19.853
and you'll see big slabs of them,

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.931
or sometimes even turned into a cake.

00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:22.988
It's the perfect little snack

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:24.198
when you're shopping the markets,

00:00:24.198 --> 00:00:26.671
and definitely always keeps my kids happy.

00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:27.634
So the first thing we're gonna do

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:29.840
is create the batter for our clafouti.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.753
So in a large bowl you're going to add

00:00:31.753 --> 00:00:34.105
3/4 cup of all-purpose flour,

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:36.622
and then you're slowing
going to whisk it in

00:00:36.622 --> 00:00:39.330
1 /14 cup of milk.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.530
You want to do it slowly
so that you're able to

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.346
really incorporate that flour well

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:44.823
and that you don't have any clumps.

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:49.198
And then to that we're gonna
add 3/4 cup of heavy cream.

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:50.211
You can stir that in.

00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:52.710
And then we're also gonna add

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.250
two eggs and two egg yolks.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.072
Now I like to add the
egg yolks because again,

00:00:58.072 --> 00:00:59.350
it's just gonna create a really

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.870
delicious richness to our clafouti.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.924
And then we're gonna add
a 1/2 a cup of sugar.

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:07.273
And two tablespoons of kirsch.

00:01:07.273 --> 00:01:08.622
Now if you're not familiar with kirsch,

00:01:08.622 --> 00:01:12.087
it is a cherry liquor that
just brings out the best flavor

00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:14.588
of the clafouti, but if you
don't drink, that's okay.

00:01:14.588 --> 00:01:16.342
You could definitely leave it out,

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.408
and instead you might want to add maybe

00:01:18.408 --> 00:01:20.185
a 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract.

00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:21.717
That would actually be really good.

00:01:21.717 --> 00:01:24.029
You're also gonna add
one teaspoon of vanilla

00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:26.521
and a 1/4 teaspoon of salt.

00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.703
Just to brighten all those flavors.

00:01:28.703 --> 00:01:32.226
Go ahead and whisk it up, and
basically your batter is done.

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:34.380
Okay, so here comes the
hardest part of this recipe.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.671
It's not really the hardest, just tedious,

00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:37.582
which is pitting the cherries.

00:01:37.582 --> 00:01:39.564
And this is where I break with tradition,

00:01:39.564 --> 00:01:41.375
because I know in France
it can be traditional

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:43.399
to leave the pits in the cherries.

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.581
A lot of people say that
it actually brings out

00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:47.183
the best flavor in the cherry.

00:01:47.183 --> 00:01:49.621
For me, it brings out
my anxiety as a mother.

00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:50.840
Hello, choking hazard!

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.401
I do not want any pits in my cherries

00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:53.987
to desserts that I am feeding my kids,

00:01:53.987 --> 00:01:56.019
so I go ahead and take
the time to pit them.

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:58.174
Now to make this task go even easier,

00:01:58.174 --> 00:02:00.853
you are going to fall in
love with the cherry pitter.

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:03.696
It is this little contraption
that you put your cherry in.

00:02:03.696 --> 00:02:05.973
You press this gadget and voilÃ !

00:02:05.973 --> 00:02:07.830
Out comes the pit.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.950
I'll put a link in the description

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.865
if you guys want to know where to get one.

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:12.769
And then at this stage
you can bake your clafouti

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.789
either in an oven-safe casserole,

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.506
or what I like to do just because
it's a fun, rustic dessert

00:02:17.506 --> 00:02:19.706
is bake it in a cast iron skillet.

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:21.166
We're also just gonna lightly grease it

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:22.922
with some melted butter.

00:02:22.922 --> 00:02:24.617
And then you can go ahead
and place the cherries

00:02:24.617 --> 00:02:26.836
in a single layer on the bottom.

00:02:26.836 --> 00:02:30.786
And then we are going to pour
our beautiful custard on top.

00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:34.026
Then we are going to
pop this in a 350 degree

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:38.229
Fahrenheit oven for just
about 35 to 40 minutes.

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:40.277
We're looking for the clafouti to puff up

00:02:40.277 --> 00:02:41.624
and turn golden brown.

00:02:41.624 --> 00:02:43.481
That's how you'll know that it's done.

00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:46.278
And go ahead and allow it
to cool on your cooktop.

00:02:46.278 --> 00:02:48.101
And don't be alarmed, because as it cools,

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:50.156
it will start to deflate, but that's okay.

00:02:50.156 --> 00:02:51.340
Because that's what's going to make this

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.316
really dense and delicious.

00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:55.581
Okay, now at this stage
you've got two ways to go.

00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:57.745
You can either serve your clafouti warm,

00:02:57.745 --> 00:03:00.934
which is actually a popular
thing to do here in the States.

00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:02.811
However, for my husband who is French,

00:03:02.811 --> 00:03:05.587
that is a real deal breaker,
and it has to be served

00:03:05.587 --> 00:03:08.409
either room temperature
or preferably cold.

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.277
So you can go ahead and pop it
in the fridge just like that.

00:03:11.277 --> 00:03:13.831
Usually for about two to
three hours will do the trick.

00:03:13.831 --> 00:03:14.876
And then the finishing touch,

00:03:14.876 --> 00:03:17.047
and I think this is probably
just my American side,

00:03:17.047 --> 00:03:19.787
I do like to finish it with a
little bit of powdered sugar,

00:03:19.787 --> 00:03:22.234
just because I think it
looks pretty that way.

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:24.530
And because this is a
dessert that I usually serve

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.793
when we're entertaining in a
casual way, normally outside,

00:03:27.793 --> 00:03:31.276
I will just take a big spoon
and spoon it out onto a plate

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:33.616
and dollop with a little
bit of homemade whip cream.

00:03:34.504 --> 00:03:36.285
I will say this will
be the perfect dessert

00:03:36.285 --> 00:03:39.067
to go with our shrimp
rolls and corn salad.

00:03:39.067 --> 00:03:40.705
This is a great dessert for that meal,

00:03:40.705 --> 00:03:42.702
because this too could be served chilled.

00:03:42.702 --> 00:03:43.607
If you missed that video,

00:03:43.607 --> 00:03:45.662
you can click the annotation
and get caught up.

00:03:45.662 --> 00:03:47.426
I'll also put a link in the description.

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:49.018
I hope you guys give this one a try,

00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:50.400
and let me know what you think.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.897
And I will see you back here next week

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:53.490
for another delicious recipe.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.042
Until then, bye.

00:03:55.042 --> 00:03:58.292
(upbeat French music)
