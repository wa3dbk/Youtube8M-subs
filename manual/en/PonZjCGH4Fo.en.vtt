00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:02.669
Welcome to Borealis.

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.600
Borealis is unlike any other solar home.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.360
Not only is it net zero, visually captivating
and architecturally unique, Borealis is a

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.790
solution to a societal need.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.340
In Alberta, Canada we have the highest growth
rate of any Canadian province, with workers

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.450
relocating for opportunities in resource industries
such as mining, forestry and energy.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.820
However, due to this large population influx
quality, housing is in short supply.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.080
Team Alberta has addressed this gap by designing
a net-zero home that solves the needs of our

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.000
target market and is ecologically sustainable.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.300
Keeping in mind our target market of remote
communities, we set out to design a home that

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.130
could be constructed off-site and easily transported.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.960
So from the beginning, we knew that Borealis
needed to be a modular design.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.989
The two living spaces are for two individuals
who share the center unit.

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.670
The center unit consists of the mechanical
room, the bathroom and the kitchen.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.230
The kitchen is a shared space where these
two individuals can cook, work and collaborate.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.579
Borealis' modular design creates flexibility
and convenience in the interior.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.229
Each living space is furnished with an identical
set of pieces that are multifunctional to

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.130
suit entertaining or work needs.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.140
Our desire for Borealis to have a strong connection
with the outdoors year round inspired us to

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.939
install the living wall in the bathroom.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.310
The living wall naturally increases air quality
through photosynthesis and cools the surrounding

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.320
air through transpiration.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.420
We have also provided private outdoor deck
spaces for the users to enjoy the natural

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:31.680
surroundings.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.990
Placing the mechanical room in the center
module fit with our engineering design philosophy

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.320
where we specified that site connections for
electrical, HVAC, plumbing and sprinkler should

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.630
be kept to the absolute minimum.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.430
A photovoltaic array was sized for 10KW and
paired with 40 micro inverters to provide

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.450
AC electricity for use in the home.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.820
The primary method for heating and cooling
the home is with a two tonne heat pump.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.679
Evacuated collector tubes and an insulated
hot water tank were also added to maximize

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.149
our harvest of solar energy.

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.369
We angled our two side modules in order to
maximize solar exposure on the panels.

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.840
We alternated the angle of the center module
in order to create high ceilings above our

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.750
kitchen and the two bedrooms in the house.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.110
It also gave us an opportunity to create passive
ventilation in the home by having strategically

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.810
placed high windows at the high points of
the home so we take advantage of stack effect

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.170
so as hot air rises it is actually pulled
out of the home where we have placed these

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.420
windows.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.220
Every living space within the home can use
daylight as a primary source of lighting.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.770
To supplement the natural light we chose to
install LED fixtures.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.600
LED lighting is also installed in the design
of the exterior deck spaces.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.050
We knew that working professionals would want
a convenient, intuitive system for managing

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.750
the lighting, heating and electronics in Borealis
so we integrated user friendly controls.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.370
There are daylight sensors that automatically
adjust the lighting levels in the living spaces

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.010
and an occupancy sensor in the bathroom to
reduce energy consumption.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.280
One of the unique elements of Borealis is
the high velocity climate control system.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.510
This allows the homeowner to set five separate
interior climate zones which can be controlled

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.290
by any mobile device as well as the thermostats
in the home creating an incredibly comfortable

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.880
living environment.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.040
Borealis is perfect for working professionals
as it requires very little maintenance and

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.260
the life expectancy of equipment is 20-25
years.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.980
You've heard Team Alberta discuss in detail
how Borealis offers comfort, privacy and sustainability

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.900
for its inhabitants, providing a solution
to a societal need in Alberta, Canada.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.390
Thank you for joining us on our journey in
solving housing needs in remote resource industries.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.230
Borealis is a Home away from Home.
