00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.189
Welcome! My name is Sisira and I am from Sri Lanka.

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.770
This is my home country Sri Lanka.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.700
I am really proud of my country, it’s full of varieties of birds, animals and flowers.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.081
Full of nature!

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:35.944
I have done Bachelor degree in political science and public policy at the University of Colombo.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.147
It’s very important for Sri Lankan students to gain international experience.

00:00:40.147 --> 00:00:49.614
I feel really lucky because I get the opportunity to do my Master degree programme in Germany.

00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:08.178
Here we are at the University of Kassel, right in the middle of Germany.

00:01:08.178 --> 00:01:12.779
I am studying the international Master programme called &lt;i&gt;Global Political Economy&lt;/i&gt;.

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:18.321
So, in this programme I met German students as well as international students

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:20.476
who are coming from all around the world.

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:25.289
It’s a really great international experience in my academic life.

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.233
The university’s professors and lecturers are really open-minded.

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:31.203
We can argue with them and we can criticize them.

00:01:31.203 --> 00:01:35.783
And they are giving good feedback to our thesis and our papers.

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:42.866
The university has a really nice campus. It has a good atmosphere for studying and learning.

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.024
It’s really green.

00:01:45.968 --> 00:01:50.093
In sum, I have a great experience studying in Germany.

00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:52.118
Let’s go to see the city!

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:05.236
Apart from studying inside of the university, I made a lot of international experiences inside the German society.

00:02:05.236 --> 00:02:09.900
I met a lot of German friends in my student Wohnheim.

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:15.609
We are sharing a kitchen and cooking together. We organized a group picnic.

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.943
This is the intercultural experience I get.

00:02:18.943 --> 00:02:23.080
What I observed is that the German people are very punctual.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.637
So if you are coming to Germany, you should bring a watch!

00:02:26.637 --> 00:02:30.560
Personally, I made good experiences in Kassel and in Germany.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.480
So I would like to recommend people who want to study abroad that Germany is a good place.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.452
So, wir sehen uns in Deutschland. Tschüß!
