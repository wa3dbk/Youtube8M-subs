00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.098
Now we've had three
previous incarnations,

00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:05.530
...and this time he comes
fo(u)rth to the 20th century,

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.999
...and the trenches of
the First World War.

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:10.497
So while you have a look at
the making of the program,

00:00:10.498 --> 00:00:13.539
I shall go off scouting around
the corridors of Television Centre.

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:15.764
Rotters.

00:00:17.027 --> 00:00:18.847
OK opening titles...

00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:21.458
Two, one...

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.303
I think Baldrick has got
stupider and stupider...

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:27.139
...as the centuries have gone on.

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:30.950
In the first series he was actually
the brightest out of Baldrick and...

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:32.775
...out of Baldrick, Percy,
and Blackadder.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.270
And then he got a bit stupider,
and now, he's terminally stupid.

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:40.730
It's impossible to see how he
actually gets through a day.

00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:45.155
Hugh, just remember to
look the other way, OK?

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.340
Five, four, three...

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.830
I don't find it terribly
difficult to be stupid.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.520
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with...

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:01.545
...M.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.620
Uuhhmmm...

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.540
Mmm...

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.030
Ma... ma...

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.630
Mug!

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.190
Oh I say, sir.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.520
We wanted a place and a time that
could reproduce to a certain extent

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.570
...the claustrophobia, and the
sordidness of medieval England.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.320
And the best way to do that
is to set it in the middle of a war.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.192
It seemed the perfect place
for the kind of plots...

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:36.938
...that we like in The Black Adder
where the Black Adder thinks...

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.004
...that he's going to get out of
trouble by doing a cunning plan,

00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:42.410
...and then gets into more so.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.420
Good sitcoms, so the
com wisdom guys,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.500
set in places were you can't get out.
Porridge in prison, Fawlty Towers...

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.740
Basil's trapped with a ghastly wife
that he can't escape from,

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.010
and a business which is oviously going
bust but which is his only livelihood.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.570
And we've set ours in a trench dug out
and there is only two ways to escape,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.386
one is forward to the
German machine guns,

00:02:04.387 --> 00:02:06.460
the other's backwards to
the British firing squads.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.239
Uhm, yeah...

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.189
The producer is basically a man
who has no talent whatsoever.

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.430
Except the talent to criticize
everyone else's talent.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.189
I hate to raise this, I mean we
worked on it for three hours,

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:21.569
but do you think it's a very good joke?
These orders Hugh's suggested?

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.010
This has nothing to do with me.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.699
- It was. - It was nothing to do
with me, I just wrote it out.

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.249
It's a good joke.
- It's alright, it's good, it's good.

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.910
All it was was that the pilau
sketch wasn't quite good, so...

00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:35.035
Because right at the end of the word

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.929
An order for six lengths of Hungarian
crushed velvet curtain material.

00:02:39.954 --> 00:02:42.228
- ...curtain material, that's good.
- You know, that's something...

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:44.680
Six lengths of Hungarian
crushed velvet...

00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:47.454
...curtain material.

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:50.779
in seresin banana.

00:02:52.446 --> 00:02:56.246
We don't do any rehearsals
like actors are supposed to do.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.450
Going over the thing again and again
and again learning your words.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.930
All we do is argue about
the best way of doing it.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.482
I'm still labouring
under the belief...

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:06.710
that no-one ever ordered anything
by the phone in 1917. I ...

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:09.235
It's true, it wasn't that
kind of country, was it?

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.210
- It was not a telephone ordering
country. - Certainly not pilau rice.

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:16.279
The rehearsal process is a big chunk
of what makes Blackadder funny,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.878
...I think, because...

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:22.249
we have a business called tweaking
or sometimes known as plumpening.

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.669
If someone says, you know,
"I'm going to...

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.840
...the general" and somebody else
has the line "Why?", and then,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.819
let's say Blackadder has a reply,

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.410
will attempt to pep up "why", say, you
know, odds 'n bods, "I'm as confused

00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:39.749
as a man who's had his head cut off,
and put on the wrong way round.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.399
I have to say that the
writers are saintly men,

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:46.439
and who put up with an awful
lot of brutality. Richard's...

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:50.019
Richards Curtis' constant cry to me is,
"You wouldn't do this to Shakespeare".

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.099
And I said, I think I would. I think
a lot of those plays are far too long.

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.479
No hang on-hang on, there's
something wro... wrong here.

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:59.929
Because surely if you're ordering
a cab for a mr. Redgrave...

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:03.809
Oh, from Arnos Grove, in that case, it
should be rather than to Arnos Grove.

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:06.939
I thought it was mr. Redgrave
who was ordering the cab.

00:04:07.064 --> 00:04:07.738
But in fact,

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:15.239
what you're saying is that mr. Redgrave
expertise on the top bout

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.189
- Crazy Rowan and logic.
- No that's fine, just change it to 4.

00:04:23.503 --> 00:04:25.503
Who are we getting
to play the cab driver?

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.949
The hardest thing about writing
Blackadder is in the end, you know,

00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:31.416
when you love a joke and
when the cast don't love it,

00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:32.858
and you have to argue a way around.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.790
But the, the highest hope is that
eventually you'll come up together

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.679
with a line that they like and you
like more than the one you wrote.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.770
On the contrary George, we've had
plenty of orders. We've had orders for:

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.179
Six meters of Hungarian crushed
velvet curtain material...

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.120
4 pilau rice...

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.980
- And 1 chicken massala. - 4 pilau
rice and 1 chi-chicken massala.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.509
And a cab...

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.530
...for a mr. Redgrave, picking up
from 14 on Osgrove, ring top bell.

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:11.980
The rehearsal process certainly
is a wonderful therapy,

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.010
because you can laugh yourself sick
for forty minutes on end helplessly.

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:28.819
Come and join me Stephen,
come on, come over here.

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.430
It's very difficult to sit next to
Baldrick because he's so smelly.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.529
This is Stephen Fry,
who plays general Melchett.

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:41.369
Who is a complete
utter vicious duffer.

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:43.630
Ooh, now, you're just
going to be lovely.

00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:45.939
It's not true, it's not
true, it's not true.

00:05:46.464 --> 00:05:47.964
I'm really rather awful.

00:05:47.983 --> 00:05:49.783
Speckly? Aaah!

00:05:50.609 --> 00:05:52.649
You shot my Speckled Jim?!

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:56.415
I've never played him quite so mad
before, the previous Melchett,

00:05:56.416 --> 00:05:59.130
I played in Blackadder II
was rather sort of grave.

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:02.789
And uh... quite,
quite good, really.

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:05.889
Grey, I suspect, majesty.

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:09.240
I think you'll find it was
orange, lord Melchett.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.369
Grey is more usual, ma'am.

00:06:12.424 --> 00:06:13.824
Who's queen?

00:06:14.043 --> 00:06:15.843
As you say, your majesty.

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:18.829
There were these magnificent
orange elephants...

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:25.029
Whereas this chap is blustering and
really quite seriously deranged.

00:06:26.054 --> 00:06:28.254
He shot my pidgeon!

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:33.450
Blackadder always seems to work
best in times of absolute madness.

00:06:33.451 --> 00:06:36.479
When the whole world is mad,
and it's as though Rowan's character

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.970
is the only sane person. And I don't
think there are many times in history

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.776
that were madder than the period
around the First World War.

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.830
1978 springs to mind in Britain, I
don't know why, why am I saying that.

00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:48.555
Early '79...
- Early '79, yes, that's right.

00:06:48.943 --> 00:06:52.143
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with R.

00:06:52.168 --> 00:06:53.468
Army!

00:06:53.493 --> 00:06:55.893
For god's sake Baldrick,
"army" starts with an A.

00:06:56.018 --> 00:06:58.818
He's talking about something
that starts with an R, "rrr".

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.829
- Motorbike!
- What?

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:03.259
Motorbike starts with a 'RRR'.

00:07:03.584 --> 00:07:05.384
RRRRRRR!
- Right!

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:09.309
Right, my turn again, what starts
with "come here" and ends with "ow"?

00:07:09.541 --> 00:07:11.141
- Don't know.
- Come here.

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:12.166
- Ow!

00:07:15.053 --> 00:07:17.053
Sure. OK. Fine. Great.

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.719
Time for some poolside gossip.
This is what I found out this week:

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:24.725
Well, Rowan Atkinson's ambition
was to be a cameraman.

00:07:25.026 --> 00:07:28.859
He originally applied to the BBC to
be an engineer, and was turned down.

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:32.160
Tony Robinson really wanted
to be a romantic hero.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.429
He'd like to play Romeo
to Victoria Woods' Juliet.

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:36.528
Or vice versa.

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:40.539
Alexei Sayle whose "Staff" starts on
Thursday is a closet ballet dancer.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.390
He goes to a gym for dance classes,
but won't go to a dance studio,

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.590
...as he can't cope with the idea
of wearing pink leg warmers.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.809
And Michael Palin, while he was trying
to go around the world in eighty days,

00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:54.469
...which starred on BBC 1 last Wednesday,
he was spotted in Cairo,

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:58.299
and ended up with a small walk-on
part in an Egyptian gangster movie.

00:07:58.924 --> 00:08:00.959
Bizarre, hey? Well that's
all for this week.

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:02.717
Tune in next week,
when we'll be looking...

00:08:02.718 --> 00:08:05.479
at a new drama serial starring Diana
Rigg, and I'll be in the bath.

00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:06.904
So, cheers!
