00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Doug: Good boy!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Doug: Good boy!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Doug: Did you get that?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
COMM: With their ability to crunch through

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.039
human bone in a single bite, getting up close
and personal with a 1,300lb grizzly bear is

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.730
not for the faint hearted.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.660
But for 71-year-old Doug Seus, coming face-to-face

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.500
with the fearsome predators is all in a days work.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.500
Doug: Bart, off!

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.500
Doug: Good. That's good. Ah! Good.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Doug: Ah, ah!

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Doug: Good, ah!

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.120
COMM: Doug is one of Hollywood's foremost bear trainers.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.500
Doug: Ah, ah!

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.860
Doug: My passion for bears started in hiking and being

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.360
out in the wild with them, where the grizzly
bear lives. It adds dimension to the power

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.500
of the environment that you're in.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.000
Doug: Up!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.700
COMM: Turning his passion into a career, he

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.490
is one of the few people in the world who
can interact with these incredible animals.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.220
Doug: We spend enormous hours behind the scenes,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.470
that's the real fun of this. I teach him tricks, or whatever you want to call tricks or

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.500
behaviors, but getting into the heart and
soul of a bear.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.500
Doug: Good boy!

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.490
COMM: Here in Utah, USA, Doug lives with wife

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.000
Lynn and their three bears, Bart 2, Honey
Bump and Tank.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.500
Doug: Up! Oh, good boy!

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.930
The bears all boast an impressive cinematic pedigree,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.240
having worked with stars like Brad Pitt and
Morgan Freeman.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.280
And eight foot six inch tall Bart 2 recently starred

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.500
in an episode of US hit TV series Game Of
Thrones.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.169
The Seus bears are ambassadors for Vital Ground,

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:19.120
the charity set up by Doug and wife Lynn,
which has so far helped to protect and enhance

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.829
nearly 600,000 acres of crucial wildlife habitat.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.209
Doug: The health of our planet and our nest is

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.000
the most important thing to us and our
grizzlies.
