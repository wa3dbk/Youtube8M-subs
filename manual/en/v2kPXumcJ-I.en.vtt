00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:06.378
Korea - no gimmicks except the gimmick that
is Korea - that is, there aren’t mods

00:00:06.378 --> 00:00:07.778
But there are Sheep

00:00:07.778 --> 00:00:09.748
Too bad the Deer provide a better settlement

00:00:09.748 --> 00:00:14.377
There’s a raging river one-tile long between
the mountain and coast

00:00:14.377 --> 00:00:16.668
It means a Water Mill later

00:00:16.668 --> 00:00:18.478
Just gotta get some Great stuff first

00:00:18.478 --> 00:00:22.088
A Great Library would help out the quest for
knowledge

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.228
One turn left - hold your breath!

00:00:24.228 --> 00:00:25.268
Woo hoo!

00:00:25.268 --> 00:00:27.738
Gotta gamble with Artemis’s Temple too

00:00:27.738 --> 00:00:31.418
Wonders give tech boosts, tech boosts give
wonders!

00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:34.708
Lost the Great Lighthouse but moved onto a
Mausoleum

00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:37.268
Mausoleum complete, so Settling

00:00:37.268 --> 00:00:39.518
Northward bound, lil Settler

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:41.078
Almost got two towns!

00:00:41.078 --> 00:00:44.058
Zoom-in to check out the faithful Quarries

00:00:44.058 --> 00:00:45.247
And there just might be a Great Wall

00:00:45.247 --> 00:00:47.748
Woo hoo squared!

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:48.748
Circled?

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:54.298
Bonjour oui oui, actually it looks like a
bad day - foggy and cold

00:00:54.298 --> 00:00:56.528
Cold like the peaks of Machu Picchu

00:00:56.528 --> 00:00:59.358
Told like the profs at the National College

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:01.498
And holy church - it’s Notre Dame

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:03.658
Gonna need to “inquise”

00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:05.817
Inquise: to keep enemy Missionaries at bay

00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:09.247
It’s a bit of religious bullying before
the battling

00:01:09.247 --> 00:01:11.658
Oxford University gets tenure

00:01:11.658 --> 00:01:13.978
Seriously Scientific these days

00:01:13.978 --> 00:01:16.007
Hiawatha is number 1!

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:17.007
That makes him…

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:18.427
enemy number 3

00:01:18.427 --> 00:01:24.247
This lady rocks Korean clothes and she wanted
me to mention she’s been doing butt-robics

00:01:24.247 --> 00:01:26.707
Yes Maria, we get it - moving on

00:01:26.707 --> 00:01:30.408
…to war with the French - omelette du fromage!

00:01:30.408 --> 00:01:32.247
And we’ll do some Submarine warfare

00:01:32.247 --> 00:01:36.067
Seems Seoul is being targeted - luckily the
cities are strong

00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:38.647
So strong it keeps France from fighting for
a bit

00:01:38.647 --> 00:01:41.887
Enough time to build a Castle of Happiness
for Castles

00:01:41.887 --> 00:01:44.557
The Scout does not expect a warm welcome

00:01:44.557 --> 00:01:45.557
Errr

00:01:45.557 --> 00:01:48.767
Which is probably for the better since it’s
the brink of nuclear war

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:52.298
The Hubble Space Telescope signals the beginning
of the end

00:01:52.298 --> 00:01:53.298
Much like the Pyramids

00:01:53.298 --> 00:01:57.298
Hmm - I’m gonna “One More Turn” this
because things were too calm

00:01:57.298 --> 00:01:58.757
But first, numbers!

00:01:58.757 --> 00:02:00.287
And listed as Lincoln

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:04.567
The pre-war arrangements involved finishing
the Internet so the citizens can be distracted

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:05.898
by cat videos

00:02:05.898 --> 00:02:07.378
Then nuke the Portuguese

00:02:07.378 --> 00:02:10.458
To destroy them, use Destroyers

00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:11.778
Also beware the French

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:15.408
I’m thinkin’ Hiawatha won’t stick around
these tiles too long

00:02:15.408 --> 00:02:17.348
Capturing cities is cathartic

00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:19.328
But it’s sad to see them suffer

00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:22.248
Luckily Lyon comes from a ceasefire!

00:02:22.248 --> 00:02:26.468
What a great area to launch aerial attacks
from - thanks Mr. France

00:02:26.468 --> 00:02:27.918
And a Golden Age?!

00:02:27.918 --> 00:02:30.818
Just in time for that ceasefire to cease

00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:33.828
Only a few more turns until we head into the
blue

00:02:33.828 --> 00:02:37.488
Nuked it first - this is a warm vacation destination

00:02:37.488 --> 00:02:38.858
Smokey though

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:41.318
Paris is most beautiful when it’s Korean

00:02:41.318 --> 00:02:47.278
Since it’s a bunch of islands the bike race
will now be known as the Tours de Tours

00:02:47.278 --> 00:02:50.838
Gonna re-visit war with Maria in a second
here

00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:53.338
Pay no attention to the smokiness of Lisbon

00:02:53.338 --> 00:02:55.848
It’s now West Korea

00:02:55.848 --> 00:02:57.538
The North is also being claimed

00:02:57.538 --> 00:02:58.738
I r winner

00:02:58.738 --> 00:03:00.598
I r not doing math

00:03:00.598 --> 00:03:01.738
Bring on the croutons
