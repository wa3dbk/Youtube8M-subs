00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.190
Samsung ATIV S.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.660
Expected 2012.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.699
The Samsung ATIV S will be Samsung's first
Windows 8 smartphone, and indeed it is the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.060
first Windows 8 handset to be announced by
any manufacturer that we know of.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.900
The word "ATIV" is the Latin word "VITA" (to
live) spelled backwards (for some reason),

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.620
and the ATIV line is made up of smartphones,
tablets and computers all running the Windows

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.920
8 operating system.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.410
For the first time, the operating system on
PCs and handheld devices will be built around

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.300
the same core, allowing easier migration of
applications and also better ways to integrate

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.050
handheld devices into business environments.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.860
So, although the ATIV S maintains the familiar
interface from Windows Phone 7, underneath

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.830
everything is different because this is yet
another reboot of Microsoft's mobile phone

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.140
OS.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.220
The hardware specification is certainly a
step up from the older Windows Phone 7 devices,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.640
the ATIV S features a dual core 1.5 GHz processor
with 1GB of RAM, it comes with a large 4.8"

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.520
HD display (we think with 720 x 1280 pixels
resolution, although this has not been specified).

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.060
On the back is an 8 megapixel camera with
1080p HD video recording, plus a 1.9 megapixel

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.420
unit on the front for video calling.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.040
This is an HSPA+ capable device with download
speeds of up to 42 Mbps.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.860
The Samsung ATIV S also has all the features
that any other type of smartphone would have,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.179
including WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity,
GPS and GLONASS positioning systems plus a

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.639
wide range of built-in applications such as
a web browser and media player, plus a growing

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:04.590
range of apps to download from Microsoft's
online store.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.450
Inside is either 16 or 32GB of flash memory,
and Windows 8 on smartphones now supports

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.209
removable memory, so you can use a microSD
card as well.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:22.720
There's a large 2300 mAh battery, and the
whole unit measures 137 x 71 x 8.7mm and weighs

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.470
135 grams.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.280
The market responded indifferently to the
launch of Windows Phone 7, but now both Microsoft

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.470
and Samsung have refined their strategies
and this version looks more promising.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.450
Windows 8 will be given a further boost shortly
when Nokia announces their first device on

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.110
this platform, but in the meantime Samsung
have stolen a march on their Finnish rivals

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.500
with a complete line-up of devices.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.210
We don't know when the ATIV S will be available,
as this will largely depend on how far Microsoft

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.410
has progressed with their new operating system,
however we would hope to see this new handset

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.280
available by the end of the year.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.170
Will it succeed?

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.510
Our bet is that corporate customers will be
most interested in this device at first because

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.010
of the way that it can integrate with their
other Microsoft products, and Windows 8 smartphones

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.810
could well edge out BlackBerry from this market.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.440
From there perhaps consumer acceptance will
follow, although it is likely to be some time

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.060
before we see if Microsoft has a winner on
its hands.
