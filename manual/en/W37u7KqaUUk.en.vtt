00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.920
what's happening YouTube Omar here with
the s4 now in this video we're going to

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.150
be looking at how to record a phone call
with your Samsung Galaxy s4 now although

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.730
the phone itself has the functionality
to do this Google or Samsung haven't

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.650
allowed the user that option so you need
to download an application if you go to

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.170
the Play Store the application is called
mp3 in call recorder and voice now we're

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.830
obviously using to search for it and
download that I've already done that so

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.140
I'm just going to open that home and
we're just gonna we're just gonna do

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.940
that later now when you're going to the
application itself it'll show this

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.840
screen now I've already tested it with a
dis phone call which I'll be showing you

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.469
in a second but if we have a look at the
bottom here that's the basic

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.000
functionality of the application so it
also provides you with the ability to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.460
record voice just like the normal app
that you have with the the actual phone

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.590
if we said have a look at the COG the
basic settings if we go into the call

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.270
recorder settings that's basically just
the minimal settings that you can get

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.170
because this is the free version of
course if you buy the pro version you

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.250
can automatically record every call that
is taken or made from this actual

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.229
handset itself and at the moment with
the free version you can only do the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.180
manual and obviously can turn it off as
well and and of course it gives you an

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.860
option in the notifications area to play
the last call recorded one of the things

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.299
is that it gives you a button either
left or right of the screen of the core

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.810
screen and which you had to press to
initiate the recording and you have an

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.509
option here of a slider in the
notifications area apart from that and

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.040
pretty standard features here you can
opportunistic or from the microphone or

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.259
record from and the actual speaker
itself so both voices and you got a gain

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:05.250
level which you can set as well if I
just go on to this is a number the icord

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.099
it's just a basic time that we have in
the UK way if you if you dial one two

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.710
three four five from any phone in the UK
it will tell you the official time from

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:26.970
the capital Navy and select that and
then hit the play button I'm just going

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.810
to pause that now if I do show you the
screen up see you've got like a scope

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.700
here to show you um if there's any sound
and visually and then you've got a range

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.100
of sympathizers so you can actually
tweak this if this sound isn't quite

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.990
right if it's in too much distortion
whatever the situation is and of course

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.770
you can you know rewind and play and
stop on all that stuff say if you just

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.600
back out of that and of course you have
the option to delete that as well so if

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.890
we just hit the bin button select all
let's just say and hit the ok button

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.660
it'll delete all of that and this is
what I mean about the button so the cool

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.470
menu will come up like this and then
you'll get a button either there or you

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.370
have an option for the button to be
there and what happened then is that you

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.370
have to select that button for the call
to be recorded with so that was just a

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.140
