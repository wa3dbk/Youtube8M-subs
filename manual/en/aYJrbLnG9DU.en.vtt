Your privacy is at the heart of what we do,

Asalamu alaikum brothers and sisters, my name
is Souhail Wardi and I am the founder of Ahli.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:12.210
Asalamu alaikum brothers and sisters, my name
is Souhail Wardi and I am the founder of Ahli.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.270
You must be wondering by now how Ahli really
works, but before I tell you how exactly it

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.470
does and the need that Ahli is here to solve,
just imagine for a second a word where Ahli

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.740
does exists.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.631
It is a word where praying in Jama is extremely
easy, where with one look at your phone, you

00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:29.180
can find fellow muslims around you.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.880
It is a world where muslim communities are
strengthen, where our bond is stronger, where

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.200
a mobile applications serves to not only strengthen
your bond with Allah subhanahu wa ta3ala,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.430
and helping you gain more hassanate, and good
deeds but also helps you strengthen your bond

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.000
with fellow muslims around you.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.780
Ahli is a community catalyst.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.690
A world where Ahli exists is a word where
muslims can easily find support in the Muslim

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.880
community, where praying in congregation is
accessible and easy!

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.470
Ahli started from two simple questions?

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.360
How can we make praying in groups, Jamaa,
more accessible and convenient for everyone?

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.000
And the second one is: How can we unlock the
benefits of prayer in congregation?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.650
What I am presenting you with today is the
answer to those questions.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.840
Ahli is a mobile application that notifies
you before prayer time when fellow muslims

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.840
are near you.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.480
And you can use in two very straightforward
ways.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.150
Passively and actively.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.849
In passive mode you receive a notification
that for instance tells you that Asr Prayer

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.879
is in 15 minutes and that there are 20 muslims
near you.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.640
Those 20 muslims receive the same notification.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.510
Ahli is the bridge that will help you get
in touch with them, agree on a place to meet,

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.790
and pray!

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.709
It's that simple!

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.230
Active mode is pretty much the same thing,
the only difference is that you can at any

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.980
time look at your phone, find muslims around
you, reach out to them and pray!.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.799
In the process of this interaction and usage
of our application, not only do you get more

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.260
hassanat, but you are also more aware of the
muslim community around you.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.489
Praying in a group, despite all its advantages,
has become a rare happening.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.650
Time is scarce and mosques are not necessarily
on a walking distance.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.069
We ran on minutes, and it is often hard to
coordinate a group praying.

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.450
Ahli is a handy tool that will bring muslims
together and solve this problem - it also

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.120
doubles as a paryer time reminder and a Qibla
locator.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.560
We have been working tirelessly to make this
product a possibility, please help us make

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.170
it a reality without your help this project
will not be.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.139
We are devoted and certain of the success
of our application- your contribution will

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.200
inchallah help thousands of Muslims pray together.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.219
Please share this great intitiative with your
friends and family.

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.510
It is only through the efforts many that we
may come as one.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.489
Ahli is a movement, and YOU can be part of
it!
