00:00:10.046 --> 00:00:12.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Redwood Middle School
in Napa, California looks a lot

00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:15.756
like every other middle
school in the country,

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:20.356
except for one extraordinary
classroom disguised as a spacecraft.

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:25.726
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Ladies and gentlemen,
I am receiving a call from Earth.

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:26.686
Yes, Earth, come in.

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:28.696
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In her
popular art elective,

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:32.566
Sharon Campbell lets her class
experience everything from physics

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:36.646
to physical fitness in an environment
that is out-of-this-world.

00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:39.016
&gt;&gt;Sharon: So we have
decided that we are going

00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:41.886
to land close to the south polar cap.

00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:47.056
&gt;&gt;When I did my master's program,
I did it in classroom environments,

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:48.706
and I meant the physical
environments,

00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:52.746
because I believe a classroom is
the largest tool you have to teach.

00:00:52.746 --> 00:00:56.236
The color of an environment
is extremely important,

00:00:56.236 --> 00:01:00.736
and I chose the colors of blue and
purple because it's very relaxing.

00:01:00.736 --> 00:01:03.236
All of our classrooms are beige.

00:01:04.036 --> 00:01:08.576
What kid or what adult ever
wanted to live in a beige world?

00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:15.436
&gt;&gt;Sharon: Temperatures will range
between 70 degrees and negative 230.

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:15.746
Yes.

00:01:16.256 --> 00:01:21.536
&gt;&gt;What I've done is I've imbedded
science, math and history,

00:01:21.536 --> 00:01:26.046
as well as geography in my class
and made it a hands-on experience.

00:01:26.246 --> 00:01:29.636
&gt;&gt;Sharon: Anyone find
proof of manufacturing?

00:01:29.916 --> 00:01:32.556
&gt;&gt;So those kinetic
learners that we have,

00:01:32.556 --> 00:01:34.696
those that are having
difficulty in their other classes,

00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:37.976
they get to actually touch
and feel, manipulate,

00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:41.566
analyze and build in this class.

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:43.316
&gt;&gt;Sharon: Did you find
proof of an herbivore?

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:46.386
&gt;&gt;This one, because it
doesn't have that sharp teeth.

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:47.816
They're not that sharp.

00:01:47.956 --> 00:01:52.186
&gt;&gt;They can use the information they
got in theory in their other classes

00:01:52.616 --> 00:01:56.246
and actually put it into a
real-life experience in this class.

00:01:56.246 --> 00:02:01.086
&gt;&gt;Boy: I found hieroglyphics,
and I found out what it said.

00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:03.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Campbell's
students learn a dynamic lesson

00:02:03.346 --> 00:02:07.596
in ecology during every minute
of her class, pedaling a bicycle

00:02:07.596 --> 00:02:09.876
that generates electricity
for the classroom.

00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:13.946
&gt;&gt;Sharon: I've always said that
if I could just harness the power

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:18.646
and the energy in these 12-year-old
boys that I could run a city.

00:02:18.926 --> 00:02:21.416
Well, we built a kid-power bike.

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:25.766
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With more than 14,000
dollars of her own money, Campbell

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:29.616
and her husband connected a wind
turbine to a set of batteries

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:33.376
to create a mini-plant that
generates power and passion.

00:02:33.816 --> 00:02:35.486
&gt;&gt;Sharon: And we found
that 15 minutes

00:02:35.536 --> 00:02:39.856
of cycling stores enough energy
to run the classroom for an hour.

00:02:41.876 --> 00:02:48.316
I wanted to somehow be able to have
the kids experience what energy is.

00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:50.126
They pedal that bicycle.

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:55.876
They understand now that motion
can be changed into electricity,

00:02:56.956 --> 00:03:04.446
and when they understand that they
have the power to make energy,

00:03:05.796 --> 00:03:09.226
then it's real easy to say, "You
have the power to save energy.

00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:13.016
You have the power to
change the environment."

00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:16.706
This is all about giving
power to the students.

00:03:16.706 --> 00:03:18.026
&gt;&gt;People want to get on the bike.

00:03:18.026 --> 00:03:18.566
There's a list.

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:21.676
&gt;&gt;There's usually a line of 10
people that want to get on the bike.

00:03:21.676 --> 00:03:23.196
Right when you get in,
everyone runs to the bike.

00:03:23.416 --> 00:03:25.436
&gt;&gt;Yeah, because it's
just riding a bike, but--

00:03:25.436 --> 00:03:28.516
&gt;&gt; It's really cool to
be conserving energy

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:30.616
and saving energy for your class.

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:31.996
&gt;&gt;Sharon: Get ready.

00:03:32.176 --> 00:03:33.486
Put down your shields.

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:37.866
Ladies and gentlemen, we
are going to red light.

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:39.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Still harboring dreams

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:43.256
of becoming the world's most
senior astronaut, Campbell delights

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:47.576
in taking her students on mock
missions using high-tech tools...

00:03:47.576 --> 00:03:48.516
&gt;&gt;Sharon: Oh, my goodness.

00:03:48.636 --> 00:03:50.026
It's a spaceship.

00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:51.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...and low-tech gimmicks

00:03:51.956 --> 00:03:54.746
to keep her students
engaged in the experience.

00:03:55.546 --> 00:03:58.956
&gt;&gt;Sharon: You know, our 21st-century
students are very different

00:03:58.956 --> 00:04:00.866
than the students I had 20 years ago.

00:04:01.036 --> 00:04:07.176
Our kids have been taught to learn
by looking at a television screen.

00:04:07.406 --> 00:04:08.696
That's where their attention goes.

00:04:09.176 --> 00:04:11.926
And I'll tell you,
without technology,

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:13.796
I couldn't reach the students.

00:04:13.796 --> 00:04:15.786
&gt;&gt;There is some oxygen on Mars.

00:04:16.406 --> 00:04:20.406
There is an iron core, and the
entire surface is rust-covered.

00:04:20.806 --> 00:04:23.096
&gt;&gt;Sharon: If I can create something

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.226
that makes them curious,
I've got 'em.

00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:26.526
I've got 'em.

00:04:26.686 --> 00:04:32.256
&gt;&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, we
are having an asteroid storm.

00:04:33.296 --> 00:04:36.326
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While hiding from
asteroids, students discover

00:04:36.326 --> 00:04:39.306
and describe the artifacts
they find under their desks.

00:04:39.476 --> 00:04:40.766
&gt;&gt;Sharon: I would like each of you

00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:43.926
to estimate the temperature
inside your cave.

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:45.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For the teacher,

00:04:45.396 --> 00:04:48.026
it's a carefully crafted
interdisciplinary lesson.

00:04:48.446 --> 00:04:51.456
For students, it's learning
that's natural and fun.

00:04:52.216 --> 00:04:54.996
&gt;&gt;Sharon: Make sure that your
measurements are accurate.

00:04:55.606 --> 00:04:57.536
&gt;&gt;The students understand
that what you learn

00:04:57.536 --> 00:05:01.096
in your math class has
applications in your science class,

00:05:01.476 --> 00:05:04.496
and what you learn in your science
class definitely has applications

00:05:04.566 --> 00:05:08.336
in your art class, your language
class, your mathematics class,

00:05:08.536 --> 00:05:11.636
and I have the time to make
those kinds of tie-ins.

00:05:11.706 --> 00:05:13.516
So I've been given a gift

00:05:13.926 --> 00:05:15.986
by the school district
to be able to do this.

00:05:16.636 --> 00:05:18.156
&gt;&gt;Sharon: Satellite
One, Satellite One.

00:05:18.386 --> 00:05:22.836
Ladies and gentlemen, we
have a window of opportunity.

00:05:23.216 --> 00:05:26.216
All clear, all clear.

00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:33.186
Everyone come back.

00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:34.786
Watch your eyes.

00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:34.976
Okay.

00:05:35.046 --> 00:05:37.286
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For more
