Tony Lloyd, Exhibiting Artist, 2112 Imagining the Future.

00:00:07.897 --> 00:00:12.468
My name's Tony Lloyd. I'm an artist, a painter in particular.

00:00:12.468 --> 00:00:17.580
I live in Melbourne and I show regularly here and overseas.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.759
Sam Leach, Exhibiting Artist, 2112 Imagining the Future

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.150
My name is Sam Leach. I'm a painter based in Melbourne, in Brunswick.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.773
I paint in a mostly fairly realistic figurative style.

00:00:28.158 --> 00:00:34.698
Well, Linda Williams Came up with this theme of imagining the future and this date, 2112.

00:00:35.283 --> 00:00:37.838
The theme of this show, Imagining the Future,

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:43.369
is a fairly wide ranging theme and allows a lot of scope for different

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:48.959
interpretations and I think in a sense this show in particular really looks at work

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:56.353
that has a content that specifically tries to imagine a future scenario or condition some

00:00:56.353 --> 00:00:58.494
kind of response to future events.

00:00:59.157 --> 00:01:05.352
One work in the show which is called, Sometimes You Have To Leave Without Saying Goodbye ...

00:01:05.352 --> 00:01:10.857
... it's a small painting of a kind of beautiful landscape with a rocket taking off in the background

00:01:10.857 --> 00:01:13.579
and that rocket that I painted was ... it was ...

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:18.098
it's an actual rocket designed by NASA, it's called the Ares rocket

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:21.741
and it was set to take over from the space shuttle when the space shuttle program

00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:26.411
ended and the day that I finished the painting Obama cancelled the program

00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:30.335
on the Ares rocket, so that rocket never got built, so that's ... it was going to be

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:35.866
a painting of the future and now it's a painting of a past future, a future that never happened.

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:40.739
But also with the rocket taking off from this pristine landscape and the title,

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:45.251
Sometimes You Have To Leave Without Saying Goodbye, it suggests some kind of

00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:48.570
greater narrative there, that perhaps something's going to happen to the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.975
world and we have to leave.

00:01:50.975 --> 00:01:55.410
Even though it looks beautiful now perhaps it's not going to stay that way.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.731
I've got a painting in the show called, Why Do We Remember The Past And Not The Future,

00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:04.141
and that's a title from a physics book, a kind of a popular book on

00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:12.653
explaining entropy to non-scientific people and the thesis of the book is that

00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:16.087
we can remember the past but we can't remember the future so what gives

00:02:16.087 --> 00:02:23.532
time its arrow forward and this painting that I did is all about a really deep forward

00:02:23.532 --> 00:02:31.617
arrow into time. It shows a landscape that's eroded away, it's possibly in another ice age.

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:36.363
There are some ruins in the top corner but they're kind of futuristic looking buildings,

00:02:36.363 --> 00:02:39.738
so they're ruins of buildings that haven't even been built yet.

00:02:39.738 --> 00:02:46.337
So I really wanted a really deep ... I'm thinking beyond 2112, which this show is about.

00:02:46.337 --> 00:02:50.620
I mean the buildings are a little bit like Pine Gap, so you could almost imagine

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.901
what if the Great Australian Bite had eroded all the way up to Alice Springs

00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:58.863
and now Pine Gap's sitting on the edge of a cliff.

00:02:58.863 --> 00:03:08.448
My work about the future, in the context of this show, is a relationship between humans and the non-human world.

00:03:08.448 --> 00:03:13.979
The painting, We Have Never Been Modern, the title comes from Bruno Latour's book

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:21.779
of the same title and it ... in that painting I have a Griffin Vulture, which is the same type of vulture

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:28.499
I saw while I was travelling in Tibet last year consuming a human corpse. It's a traditional

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:34.216
burial right that they expose the body to vultures and it gets consumed. The humans in that painting

00:03:34.216 --> 00:03:40.026
are taken from NASA archives, they're three technicians building a satellite and I thought

00:03:40.026 --> 00:03:46.377
of this connection between humans being consumed by a vulture and their energy

00:03:46.377 --> 00:03:50.368
and intelligence being distributed through space through the means of a vulture

00:03:50.368 --> 00:03:54.122
and the connection with humans inserting their intelligence and energy into this piece of technology

00:03:54.122 --> 00:03:58.492
which then goes into space and distributes this human intelligence through space through that means.

00:03:58.492 --> 00:04:04.207
It also touches on some ideas of animism and this idea of objects and entities having agency.

00:04:04.207 --> 00:04:09.957
I think that when you look at engineers and NASA technicians and scientists they quite often invest

00:04:09.957 --> 00:04:14.118
the technology that they're working with with a sense of animism, they often think of this technology

00:04:14.118 --> 00:04:19.207
as becoming a liable being, a ... you know, naming these things, caring for them and

00:04:19.207 --> 00:04:20.187
ultimately releasing them.

00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:25.330
The painting, Clay Pruning, is about a technician who's working on a little clay diagram,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.532
which is ... he's literally pruning with a pair of scissors while the seal looks

00:04:29.532 --> 00:04:34.291
on in the background and the suggestion that I want to get across is there's ... on one hand

00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:38.457
there's this very pristine scientific environment and on the other hand there's this non-human animal,

00:04:38.457 --> 00:04:41.886
which in a sense represents the opposite of a pristine environment, in there in the lab

00:04:41.886 --> 00:04:46.926
but on the other hand there's this genetic connection between the seal and a human and, indeed,

00:04:46.926 --> 00:04:52.116
there are these Irish myths about the selkie where there are still families now who claim some

00:04:52.116 --> 00:04:57.122
ancestry from a seal, that these seals, you know, at a certain point would take off the seal clothing

00:04:57.122 --> 00:04:58.580
and boom, boom, there's a person inside.

00:04:58.873 --> 00:05:03.643
It was great to be included in a show like this and to be ... to have your work put next to

00:05:03.643 --> 00:05:11.679
other artists who do similar things, like Sam Leach, like Darren Wardle, and Patricia Piccinini's work also,

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:22.187
just staggering, staggeringly, amazingly realised and such a beautiful idea or provoking, thought provoking, idea.

00:05:22.557 --> 00:05:30.122
I particularly love Ken and Julia Yonetani's work, the salt sculpture which I think

00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:37.483
is just a ... just a beautiful, a beautiful work both in terms of its execution and the sense of

00:05:37.483 --> 00:05:44.850
fragility and imminent destruction that it has within it is something that I really enjoy.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.714
Another one that I really like is Kirsten Johannsen's Nomadic Nature Kit and for me, I'm a big science

00:05:49.714 --> 00:05:55.770
fiction buff, and this is exactly the sort of kit that you would take on your journey to colonise the

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:02.309
distant planet and I like ... I just ... I love having that artefact realised and there in the gallery.

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:07.565
What's great about it is she has this combination between the very high-tech perspex and plastic dome

00:06:07.565 --> 00:06:13.199
sitting on the stainless steel apparatus and feather dusters and very prosaic packets of seed

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:17.324
that it looks like she's bought from, you know, her local hardware store.

00:06:17.324 --> 00:06:23.425
So there's this very prosaic banal almost domestic element to it jammed into this

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:27.033
futuristic high-tech apparatus.
