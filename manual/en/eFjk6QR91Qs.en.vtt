00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:14.093
A tell-tale sign of hair extensions is the bad extension haircut.

00:00:14.717 --> 00:00:17.226
This haircut is a result of a common mistake.

00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:24.589
That mistake happens when the extensions are pulled out and then 
 cut as if they were normally grown hair. 

00:00:25.322 --> 00:00:29.536
In order to erase this mistake, we're going to use some common blending techniques.

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.469
Let's take a look at how that is done. 

00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:37.600
The first step in correcting this, is to split 
 the difference between shortest and longest layer. 

00:00:37.894 --> 00:00:41.148
So we are going to come in, using our razor tool, 

00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:44.974
and take off the bulky ends.

00:00:48.476 --> 00:00:52.559
Unfortunately there is no way to salvage the length on these pieces 

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:57.938
because there is no way to add in layers from 
 this short point to this longest point. 

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:14.170
Now that we've got that bulk removed, we are going 
 to switch over and do some point cutting. 

00:01:17.297 --> 00:01:22.271
For this, we are going to have our client 
 put their head all the way forward. 

00:01:22.976 --> 00:01:26.107
And this is going to expose your longest and shortest points. 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.110
Come down to the ends and we are going 
 to cut up and soften that line. 

00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:56.000
While we are doing our point cutting, we are also going 
 to straighten out any jagged edges from that haircut. 

00:01:57.952 --> 00:02:03.400
This side had a little bit more length, so we are just going 
 to take care of that in this step as well. 

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:12.430
Once you have corrected that bottom line with the hair all the way forward,

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:16.970
go ahead and have your client lean their head all the way back and 
 it is going to change the shape of that bottom line. 

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:23.560
You are going to pick up all of that hair, 
 and do some more point cutting on the ends

00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:24.820
just to soften that out. 

00:02:41.632 --> 00:02:45.580
Once you feel like you have a reasonable taper 
 there, go ahead and have them be upright.

00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:48.870
And the last step is to correct these layers.

00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:52.560
Because we still have some pretty harsh lines from our upper layers. 

00:02:53.118 --> 00:02:54.480
See that's right in there. 

00:02:54.812 --> 00:02:57.880
So, the next step is to correct that by razor cutting that out. 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.850
Take our razor tool, and we are going to 
 work a little bit at a time. 

00:03:07.057 --> 00:03:12.060
Find that line, and just cut right into it and taper off that point.

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:19.160
Once you have worked in these upper layers, your ends should be fairly tapered.

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:24.700
This is all going to go by feel, and make 
 sure that you don't have any chunky edges. 

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:31.350
The last step in correcting this cut is to make sure that 
 your front edges tie in with your bottom edges. 

00:03:32.276 --> 00:03:36.620
Making sure that there is no shelf, we are just 
 going to take this hair in the front

00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:44.910
and razor it down. And eliminate any inconsistencies and any blunt lines. 

00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:51.440
This is your last step. And that is how 
 you fix a bad extension haircut.
