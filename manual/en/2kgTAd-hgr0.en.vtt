00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:08.686
everyone welcome to this review others
viewfinder

00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:12.785
attention here for the sony expire then
you can get them for any

00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:15.125
india so our camera

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:19.415
uh... you're coming to get the kind made
clear specific and because i don't know

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:22.735
sees shape of the uh... l_c_d_
attachment here is the same for all

00:00:22.735 --> 00:00:24.905
cameras i don't believe it is

00:00:24.905 --> 00:00:26.915
of this wonders for it

00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:31.206
on my camera so trying always trying at
all that matches your camera

00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:33.405
i was a good idea now this one

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:37.625
as about thirteen dollars uh... on e-bay
and of course you could have taken a

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:41.656
d_a_ wire and i was thinking about it
for a while but it's been done before

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:45.936
and i think better buying up top and
then later at the end of dale

00:00:45.936 --> 00:00:49.986
of went from a laptops is i mean his own
provide the parks

00:00:49.986 --> 00:00:54.066
dolly the links to those videos of the
lower indentation here as you can see

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.075
with those videos were like but uh...

00:00:56.075 --> 00:01:00.235
this was so close and cost thirteen
dollars compared to a dollars today so

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:03.486
to go and buy it because they didn't
think it was

00:01:03.486 --> 00:01:07.336
uh... worth saving five bucks to it and
make one because it takes

00:01:07.336 --> 00:01:12.976
live efforts and uh... just was enough
savings for me so on and bought this one

00:01:12.976 --> 00:01:17.016
now this is a model has amended petition
wins and as you can see there magnifying

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:18.216
glass

00:01:18.216 --> 00:01:21.196
that's not a die off to her meaning you
can adjust

00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:23.926
the focus on that it's fixed focus

00:01:23.926 --> 00:01:26.856
a little worried at first because if you
were classes i thought i might need a

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:28.876
doctor but i didn't

00:01:28.876 --> 00:01:32.256
nearsightedness hopefully uh...

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:34.026
uh... in my favor

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:37.916
so i went ahead and bought this any came
with this attachment

00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:42.826
which is what screws into the tripod
threat on the bottom of your camera

00:01:42.826 --> 00:01:46.096
and their magnetic so you're supposed to
attach

00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:47.866
gency there

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:51.676
viewfinder to but i don't really like
this idea because

00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:55.576
i did not want this to be stuck to the
back of my camera

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:58.226
since they do have an articulating uh...

00:01:58.226 --> 00:02:00.566
l_c_d_ screen here on the back

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:02.346
uh... that i use often

00:02:02.346 --> 00:02:05.226
i really like that feature one reason
about this camera

00:02:05.226 --> 00:02:07.246
uh... if this were attached

00:02:07.246 --> 00:02:11.255
clues triple threat on the bottom into
the back here i would not be a little

00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:13.315
lifts my screen

00:02:13.315 --> 00:02:17.695
which i think is a dumb idea so i went
ahead and just dispose of this idea

00:02:17.695 --> 00:02:19.136
entirely

00:02:19.136 --> 00:02:22.925
and what it went different to attach to
my camera

00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:24.646
my first thing they did was

00:02:24.646 --> 00:02:27.955
there's some ridge's here are some bumps
on the back

00:02:27.955 --> 00:02:31.586
allowed to fit into this frame as you
can see this and i choose their

00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:36.125
uh... you're into need to level those
off because at first i didn't do that

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:40.225
and they ended up uh... creating a mark
on the back we'll see screen

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:42.265
where those little arrays

00:02:42.265 --> 00:02:47.095
bridges were hidden really care for that
for chile came up with a clean it but

00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:48.455
didn't like that idea

00:02:48.455 --> 00:02:51.356
so it secure that is something i had to
do was

00:02:51.356 --> 00:02:54.086
pre some kind of padding on the back
here since this was not going to be

00:02:54.086 --> 00:02:56.405
sticking to this frame anymore

00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:59.855
uh... it was touching well see screen it
wanted to uh...

00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:01.326
abuse it so

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:04.405
i took some causing bill crowe something
that he said backed

00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:09.035
buzy bill crowe like this and i
discovered relief in listen scissors

00:03:09.035 --> 00:03:13.366
and put it on the edge right here so
that i was a soft anglicans put her on

00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:14.935
my camera

00:03:14.935 --> 00:03:19.305
now the next problem was without waiting
attach it to my l_c_d_ screen

00:03:19.305 --> 00:03:23.695
portland it was i took a croat afflicts
idea since he

00:03:23.695 --> 00:03:25.745
uh... pretty allow using

00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:30.225
identical uh... viewfinder believing he
had some uh... person velcro

00:03:30.225 --> 00:03:31.886
actually right in the center here

00:03:31.886 --> 00:03:34.875
on both sides in in another bill crowe
strip around

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:36.285
the screenwriter

00:03:36.285 --> 00:03:39.425
slightly different uh... scenario
because

00:03:39.425 --> 00:03:42.115
i can see on my book restraint here

00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:45.845
there isn't uh... single passage through
the middle east and the velcro so to

00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:47.015
slots

00:03:47.015 --> 00:03:50.745
so i had to do basically the same thing
crow foot they did

00:03:50.745 --> 00:03:51.705
only

00:03:51.705 --> 00:03:55.125
just with two pieces uh... instead of
one

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:59.425
institute pieces of the has this wiki
side of the local right here

00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:02.725
and then now you just take uh...

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:05.725
too soft pieces

00:04:05.725 --> 00:04:08.915
petition give easel packs a bill crowe
for a look at uh... book fifty or

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.655
something and we forget my a dollar
general

00:04:11.655 --> 00:04:13.205
and its attachment and

00:04:13.205 --> 00:04:16.015
reminds us vance's croak which he
actually put

00:04:16.015 --> 00:04:17.205
like some fabric

00:04:17.205 --> 00:04:20.485
it's a good adhesive backing off but
that's a pervert here you got the

00:04:20.485 --> 00:04:21.515
t-shirt

00:04:21.515 --> 00:04:23.025
soviet might do

00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:26.695
in the future but uh... right now

00:04:26.695 --> 00:04:30.106
can do this in a row in the local pieces
through

00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:31.915
slots there

00:04:31.915 --> 00:04:34.195
hold it in place

00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:37.966
slogan a purple at tight

00:04:37.966 --> 00:04:44.826
bombed to attach is

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.246
you know that's attached

00:04:47.246 --> 00:04:49.505
so now

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:53.975
eyecare and use this as a as viewfinder
in bright sunlight

00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:56.206
i can actually see my screen

00:04:56.206 --> 00:04:57.826
in bright sunlight

00:04:57.826 --> 00:05:01.785
you can see it in the uh... sort of see
it's a actually looks pretty good

00:05:01.785 --> 00:05:03.305
uh... so crime

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:05.445
and uh... something

00:05:05.445 --> 00:05:08.686
area where i can see the screen your
weapon in my hand or something or

00:05:08.686 --> 00:05:11.896
completely shade screen has magnified
when i look through it

00:05:11.896 --> 00:05:13.635
has a nice uh... i cupped

00:05:13.635 --> 00:05:14.605
right here

00:05:14.605 --> 00:05:16.755
anthony de tocqueville i can't

00:05:16.755 --> 00:05:20.005
which is something i couldn't do it was
going to use this uh...

00:05:20.005 --> 00:05:22.485
worthless frame rates

00:05:22.485 --> 00:05:26.735
so i'll know i'm a a pretty happy with
this that system it just made out of

00:05:26.735 --> 00:05:29.895
plastic palaces classic the snyders
intern

00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:31.456
this is actually rover

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:34.805
there's like a two within a two point
magnification right here

00:05:34.805 --> 00:05:37.665
uh... and uh... works are pretty good

00:05:37.665 --> 00:05:39.255
so thanks to

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.915
group which they did hear it sticks on
the back

00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:45.745
and now i have a pretty nice of you find
there's no use them shooting

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:47.695
out in the daytime so again

00:05:47.695 --> 00:05:50.935
this is just kind of a universal
viewfinder here

00:05:50.935 --> 00:05:52.306
gotta go anyway

00:05:52.306 --> 00:05:55.225
for thirteen dollars only the link below

00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:56.485
and uh... i think i would keep this
