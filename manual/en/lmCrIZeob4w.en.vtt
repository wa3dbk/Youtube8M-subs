00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.349
It's christmas in Japan everybody!

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:11.390
Japan is the country with the best people in the world

00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:13.930
Because they don't only celebrate THEIR holidays

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:15.406
They celebrate OUR holidays

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:17.205
We love Japanese festivals

00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:18.872
And festivals from other countries

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:20.914
How can we get the best of both worlds

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.612
Double presents!

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.830
No Christmas cheer like we've got here

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:26.321
In any other land

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:28.411
It's Santa AND it's samurai

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:30.134
Christmas in Japan

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:32.252
Turkey tastes great with Christmas cake

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.873
As we all understand

00:00:33.887 --> 00:00:35.962
And we're not going home this year for

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.543
Christmas in Japan

00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:39.677
The Japanese know like they do back home

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:41.327
Of the profits to be had

00:00:41.383 --> 00:00:43.505
Christmas trees are seen well before Halloween at

00:00:43.548 --> 00:00:45.057
Christmas in Japan

00:00:45.126 --> 00:00:47.175
The 24th is the day for fun and play

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.841
For those who book their plans

00:00:48.884 --> 00:00:50.976
And you know by the yells from the Love Hotels

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:52.657
That it's Christmas in Japan

00:00:52.684 --> 00:00:54.791
No Christmas cheer like we've got here

00:00:54.832 --> 00:00:56.400
In any other land

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.387
That snowman's made of mochi rice

00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:00.156
Christmas in Japan

00:01:00.212 --> 00:01:02.305
Turkey tastes great with Christmas cake

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.854
As we all understand

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.091
And Emily's in a Santa hat

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:07.582
Christmas in Japan

00:01:07.623 --> 00:01:09.351
He won't be home for Christmas

00:01:09.392 --> 00:01:11.340
He lost his job and the money to fly

00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:13.517
It was considered rude when I spewed my food

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:15.065
On the boss at the bonenkai

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:17.084
The Christmas number 1 this year

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:18.867
Is the same as the last ten

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:20.621
I will kill myself if I hear

00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:24.610
George Micheal sing that song again....

00:01:24.652 --> 00:01:26.731
No Christmas cheer like we've got here

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:28.235
In any other land

00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:30.516
That Christmas tree's made of sushi

00:01:30.585 --> 00:01:31.992
Christmas in Japan

00:01:32.047 --> 00:01:34.141
Turkey tastes great with Christmas cake

00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:35.705
As we all understand

00:01:35.747 --> 00:01:37.957
They're called Christmas lights, not illumination

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.505
Christmas in Japan

00:01:39.547 --> 00:01:41.596
It ain't right that the stereotype

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.220
Always gets laid on me man

00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:45.280
Cause they would die with no Kentucky Fried

00:01:45.363 --> 00:01:46.946
at Christmas in Japan

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:49.213
Christmas day is a busy day

00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:50.675
for that day we should work

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:52.999
but the real party is the Emperor's birthday

00:01:53.038 --> 00:01:58.565
on the 23rd

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.466
No Christmas cheer like we've got here

00:02:00.493 --> 00:02:01.942
In any other land

00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:04.208
I hear Rudolph summers at a temple near Nara

00:02:04.264 --> 00:02:06.123
Christmas in Japan

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:07.935
Turkey tastes great with Christmas cake

00:02:07.963 --> 00:02:09.602
As we all understand

00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:11.546
And no one even notices

00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:15.420
Christmas in Pakistan...

00:02:15.474 --> 00:02:17.306
No Christmas cheer like we've got here

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.957
In any other land

00:02:18.997 --> 00:02:21.032
Who needs egg nog, I got hot sake

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:22.596
Christmas in Japan

00:02:22.637 --> 00:02:24.673
Turkey tastes great with Christmas cake

00:02:24.713 --> 00:02:26.353
As we all understand

00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:28.531
And we're not going home this year for

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:30.125
Christmas in Japan
