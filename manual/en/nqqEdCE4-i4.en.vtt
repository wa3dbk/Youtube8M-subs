00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:05.560
See you should be using something like this
on your hair. Hi my name is Sylvia Russell

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.780
and I'm going to show you how to choose the
right shampoo and conditioner for African-American

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.610
hair, extremely curly or ethnic hair. Now
this might be a difficult task because there

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.130
aren't many products on the market that can
give you exactly what you need. Sometimes

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.340
you have to consult your professional because
professional products are made for professionals

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.800
and they can help diagnose your problem and
if you have dry, brittle hair, you want to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.040
make sure you get the right product. Now you
want to make sure that if your hair is dry

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.170
and brittle that you are using products with
a low ph. What is ph? That is something that

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.030
you as an individual should go into the salon
and talk to your professional about. She can

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.920
explain everything that has to do with anything
with porosity of the hair, and your ph level.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.129
One thing I will say though, is that seven
is the best you want. Anything below seven

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.560
is good. Seven and below are the types of
ph products that you want. They will help

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.310
to moisturize the hair, they will help cleanse
the hair very mildly and they won't strip

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:21.060
the hair of all the oils. Let's remember not
to over shampoo. If we shampoo every single

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.670
day, we lose moisture. So you want to make
sure that if you have to shampoo every day,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.530
that you are using a low ph shampoo and that
you are giving the hair the moisture that

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.900
it needs. So lets recap, if you have dry and
brittle hair you want moisturizing shampoos.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.320
If you can't find it in your local grocery
store, you want to check in with your local

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:50.100
professional. So remember to get beautiful
healthy hair, you need moisture. My name is

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.040
Sylvia Russell and this is how you find a
shampoo for dry, brittle hair for African-American

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.400
ethnic or curly hair.
