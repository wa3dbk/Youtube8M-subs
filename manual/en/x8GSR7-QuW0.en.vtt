00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:10.700
This video shows how to floss the PS102 and PS103 sensors on M600 series LaserJet printers.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.960
Flossing removes small pieces of paper or debris blocking the paper path and causing jams.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.360
Before you begin, you will need,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.440
index cards or heavy card stock paper,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.640
and a blunt, non-metallic tool, if available.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.700
This procedure is best performed using a heavier stock paper to insert into the portion of the paper path

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.700
to push out debris blocking the paper path.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.760
This graphic shows the locations of the paper path sensors from a side view of the printer.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.040
When troubleshooting 13.A2 , 13.B2 and 13.FF error paper jams,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.880
floss the paper paths leading to and around the PS102 and PS103 sensors.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Open the top cover of the printer.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.760
Open the Paper Tray 1 door on the front of the printer.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.040
Remove the toner cartridge.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.180
Remove the envelope accessory cover.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.700
Grasp the green handle on the paper access plate and lift it up.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.560
Slowly pull the jammed paper straight out of the paper path to avoid tearing the paper.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.460
Locate the PS103 sensor near the white paper path rollers.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.580
The Sensor should be positioned against the white paper feed roller.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.820
Do not use sharp metallic tools to dislodge or remove debris from the paper path guide plates.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.040
These can scratch or damage the paper path guides and  increase paper jams.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.360
Insert the flossing paper as shown.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.060
Remove any paper or debris that the flossing paper has pushed out.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.740
Small pieces of paper might be found anywhere in the paper path,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.740
most often against the sides.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.540
Paper might be lodged tightly in place and require additional effort to remove.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.460
Floss the entire width of the paper path guides.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.100
To floss around the PS102 sensor, follow these steps.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.520
The PS102 sensor is difficult to see, lower the cover to access the sensor.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.520
Remove Paper Tray 2 from the printer.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.760
Slide an index card behind the guide plate.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.140
Press lightly against the guide plate while pushing the paper upward.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.040
Grasp the green tab on the cover and lift it.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.180
Pull the card straight out of the opening,

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.540
Then lower the cover.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.000
Floss the entire width of the paper path, including the left and right side areas.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.200
There are two different paper paths for each of the paper trays 2 through 6.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.460
One path is located behind the white plate as previously shown, and the other is in front.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.840
Slide the flossing paper into the paper path in front of the guide plate

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.220
and repeat across the width of the paper path.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.320
Your printer may have additional paper trays installed.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.380
Repeat the steps for tray 2 to floss the paper paths for each of the remaining trays.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.580
Remember to floss both paper paths in each tray area as previously shown.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.520
Reinstall the paper trays you removed.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.180
Reinstall the envelope accessory cover.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.280
Reinstall the toner cartridge.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.820
Close the front cover and lower the top cover.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.860
