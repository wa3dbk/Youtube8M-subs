I'm Bill Elzey with Showplace Lawns. How to
design a new landscape. Well, we go crazy

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:18.730
with that because it's like a blank canvas.
You can do anything and everything. Some key

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:27.070
points to remember as you approach this project;
look at your sunlight conditions. Where is

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:36.030
full sun, where is part sun, part shade, where
is full shade. That's going to determine where

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.500
grass can be and what type of plants you will
use. The other thing that you will want to

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:58.930
notice is where a good place is to plant some
taller things, some medium plants, and some

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:08.310
low plants. Keep that in mind, especially
as you work with a bed. You don't want to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.730
block everything out and had stuff in the
middle that nobody can see. The best thing

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:22.390
to do is as you look at your property, come
up, draw you a plan, look at it, study it

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.310
because you will change it, you're going to
change it again. But draw something out like

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:39.170
this to get an idea of what you've got. Get
a nice long, or several long garden hoses

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:47.100
to outline areas as you see them on your property
so you get a visual as to what it may look

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:58.130
like. The other thing that you would consider
when you're doing a bed or an area, don't

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:07.100
make it it square and ninety degrees, put
some character in to it, corners, bends, and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:16.459
things of that nature. Grass is a good thing
because it turns carbon dioxide in to oxygen

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.819
so we have something to breathe. So you want
some grass, but you don't need to have a lot

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:30.129
of it, and there fore you can fill it in with
some other things, thus taking away the problem

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:37.510
of keeping the grass growing. I know here
in South Central Texas, maintaining lawns

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:47.280
is a real challenge at times. This basic design
here, we've put a walk way in to a patio,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.239
a walk way and a big turn around spot with
a bird feeder in the middle, we put some trees,

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.819
some ground cover, and a bird bath in the
corner over there, some grass, two trees and

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:07.879
a bed, some ground cover across here, grass
again, some more trees. A bed around the corner,

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:16.379
a tree, another tree, another bird feeder,
and some grass. What I like to use for walkways

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:23.840
in a garden situation is decomposed granite
because decomposed granites, granite is pervious,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.749
which means that the water will still go down
through that and disperse to help things around

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:34.400
it. It's not like if this was all concrete
and water never gets there. So that's a good

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:45.010
thing to put in with a border. The border's
can be rock, brick, wood, metal edging, and

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.019
I would prefer those before I would think
of anything made of plastic because plastic

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:59.341
will deteriorate over time and need to be
replaced. It's going to be up to you as to

00:03:59.341 --> 00:04:07.969
what you want, how much of it you want, what
type of plants work in your area to fit the

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:19.200
sunlight requirements. Again, mark off with
a garden hose to get an idea, draw you up

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:28.570
a plan, and work with that before you start.
The other thing I might suggest is to break

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.010
it down in to stages. Do one or two things,
then work on one or two other things, and

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:42.100
so forth, until you get it all filled in.
That also will allow you to see things coming

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.510
together and help you to make a decision because
you will also, again, be changing your mind

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:55.240
as you go. These are some ideas that we use
when we do, design a new landscape.
