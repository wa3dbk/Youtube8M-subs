00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.430
ohohopllil asks

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.400
What is boy culture like in Korea and what's the ideal type?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.110
Are they usually like the guys we see in dramas? We nasties really need to knooow~

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.410
So we asked SooZee about this

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.580
And she found a couple of interesting reading resources

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.910
First one was a survey taken by women about what their ideal type is in men

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.420
And the second one was a satirical blog post about exactly how picky girls can be

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.220
when it comes to meeting their ideal boyfriend.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.060
Now obviously this is not going to be what Every Korean girl wants

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.860
Like SooZee does not agree with these things

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.930
But this is kind of like that overarching theme that girls might talk about with each other

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.230
Things that they are looking for in guys.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.730
And there is also a lot of blind date culture in Korea

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.440
Or as it's called in Korean SoGaeTing

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.770
That's the Jamaican way of saying it...

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.340
It's more like sogaeting

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.670
Blind date. Hookups.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.610
Sounds better than blind-date.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.040
Sogaeting~

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.680
SoGae/SoGhei

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.950
Now there are some obvious characteristics when it comes to the ideal type that can be

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.720
understood pretty much universally.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.300
Such as:

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.290
Having a buff body

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.790
Having great fashion sense

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.490
Have a cheerful and bright personality

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.290
Don't lose your temper and be polite

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.560
Has a charming smile

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.030
Be good at sex

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.060
Listens to what women say

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.300
Now if you ask me, I don't really know who would disagree with these

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.200
Like I'm not looking for a guy who has a buff body

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.240
I would like somebody who is rude and who doesn't listen to me.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.700
I'm looking for someone with a creepy leer.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.840
Like "Boy that was an excellent sex session since I'm so good at it"

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.880
"I'm going to put on my fashion clothing"

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.140
"Time for my charming smile"

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.550
Relationship over.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.420
After that there are some characteristics that seem be specifically embedded in Korean culture

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.120
Not necessarily something that we're familial with ourselves

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.490
One of them, for example is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.860
You having to graduate from one of the specific S.K.Y. Universities

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.330
That's Seoul University, Korea University or Yonsei University

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.700
Are you sure it's not Super Cookie Yummy?

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.030
Cookie starts with a "C"

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.270
Not all cookies [S]Seems like you failed that university

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.410
Now I don't know about you, but I have never really cared about what university somebody graduates from

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.040
and that wouldn't really be a fact that I'm looking for in a relationship

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.240
The thing that people may not realize about Korea is that

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.880
There are Tons of universities you can go to in Korea

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.550
Everywhere

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.580
But there are just the 3 that are most competitive

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.490
So pretty much if you don't go to one of these universities

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.550
You can't get a girlfriend ever

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.790
Well that's not true.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.860
You are generalizing that.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.520
You can't be someone's ideal type.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.530
You want to know what the lowest form of University is in Korea

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.330
between dating culture?

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.730
Art School

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.860
SooZee didn't you go to Art School?

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.330
Yeay...

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.500
We love SooZee

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.900
[S]SooZee's great [M]You've got our love, SooZee

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.310
Another one of the requirements is that you have a job that earns you over 100mln Korean won in a year

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.010
which is roughly 100k dollars

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.180
And you have to be either a public government employee

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.010
Or you have to work for one of the major companies

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.150
Like Samsung or LG, or KIA or what not

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.350
So basically working for a well known brand

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.280
That kind of a company

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.920
The problem is is that these are really stressful to work at

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.360
You might be being paid well

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.790
You work INSANE hours

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.460
When are you going to have time to date somebody

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.030
If you're working up until midnight all of the time?

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.030
These companies require a lot of dedication

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.030
Some people live on campus

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.130
Like, we went to... Where did we go?

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.170
Was it LG that we went to?

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.870
And we saw that they have dorm life for people that work there.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.070
You live at the factory you work in.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.780
Another requirement is: you have to be 180cm or taller

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.450
Which pretty much means, that you will never date a K-pop idol except for maybe like 3 of them

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.280
Oh boy...

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.220
I'm sorry. Look, a lot of their profiles say that they're that tall

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.990
It's more like their ideal height but not their actual height.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.920
Ok, listen. I have to say this.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.290
I know that in North America a lot of girls want to date tall guys

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.430
It's kind of like a thing

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.300
I found that some of my students would rather date

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.830
I did like a survey with them

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.630
Right this was bizarre

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.000
We were talking about describing people's appearances

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.770
and that kind of stuff

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.640
And one of the things they talked about was...

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.170
They would rather date a tall good-looking guy who treats them really poorly

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.510
Than a short good-looking guy that treats them really well.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.250
And I said to them like "NO!"

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.810
Like the self-esteem Martina came out and was like...

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.320
relationship satisfaction should me more important than how tall...

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.620
Another interesting requirement is:

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.190
The ideal guy should have studied for one year in another country.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.290
It's usually an English-speaking country

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.330
To be more worldly, so you could speak other languages

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.730
But I heard, the key of it being 1 year is because you've been studying for a year

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.370
Not that you've been screwing around.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.600
Because if you go... As we know from "Heirs", if you go overseas for more than a year

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.540
You'll start hanging around with crazy party people [S] who do nothing but drugs all of the time

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.480
Exactly. So one year is like that safety bubble of that "I didn't go there and shacked up with somebody

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.810
I went there to study. I came back. And I speak English"

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.480
Speaking of it, you need to have TOEIC score of at least 850

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.290
I don't actually know what 850 means, to be honest

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.890
Because I have never taken TOEIC

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:28.000
What's TOEIC? Teaching... Tomatoes... over... interesting  [S]Total... ovaries... interesting... English... Calculates

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
SooZee [S]SooZee, what does TOEIC mean?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.100
TOEIC is a test... [S&amp;M]No, what does it mean? TOEIC?

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.340
[SZ]Something something English...

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.980
SooZee failed!

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.250
SooZee did you take a TOEIC test?

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.950
I did. [M]What's your TOEIC score? [S]930?

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.260
SooZee is the ideal type. She has lived overseas

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.060
I just want to know how do you flirt with girls?

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.230
Would you be like: "Hey baby, check out my TOIEC. See that? Ooh you like that" [M]Give your charming smile. GO!

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.160
Ok, well now you just lost her.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.270
870, you like that, don't you, girl?

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.070
And what's your height?

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.310
Well I'm 195cm. You like that girl? Oooh you like them numbers.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.710
Question: can you drink 2 bottle of Soju?

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.440
Easily.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.910
Do you enjoy drinking it, though?

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.910
Not at all.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.580
Well then you're my ideal type, because apparently

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.580
If you drink at least 2 bottles of Soju and you're not intoxicated

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.120
eeeentoxicateeeed [Ref to Junsu's "Intoxication"]

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.920
But you don't really enjoy drinking

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.790
Then you're the ideal type.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.460
Now some interesting stuff about Korean family life

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.490
Ideally you should an only child

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.500
Ideally your boyfriend's parents should live Outside the city

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.330
Who visit maybe once a year.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.570
So that they aren't interfering with your life all too much.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.400
I think that's an around the world thing.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.370
I hope my in-laws live up stairs for me so that we can all visit each other and hold hands

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.410
There are a couple of things those we think are a lil bit WTF

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.080
I'm touching your butt right now. You guys can't see this, but...

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.920
Rule #3 you must be able to pat each other's butts

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.120
Speaking of which is actually really funny one

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.850
Which I think is a joke

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.990
Who is kind and bold enough to dance naked if the wife says so.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.520
I don't know.. [S]DANCE MONKEY, DANCE!

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.160
If you're getting a K-pop idol I'm sure you would definitely do that all of the time

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.300
Rain does it anyways.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.170
Give me your charming smile!

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.510
Now one of the negative thing that comes of having all these ideals is that a lot of Korean guys

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.680
Feel a lot of stress

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.310
Because a lot of these ideals are extremely unrealistic

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.810
With the pressure they have in society

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.620
And not only is it stressful for the guy regarding how much money they make

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.890
and the job that they have.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.450
It seems like there wasn't a big emphasis on personality?

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.420
If they get along well.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.020
Like: are they both artistic together?

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.160
Do they have the same interests?

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.700
It's more of a matter of how fundationally solid are you.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.960
You can't really predict love in my opinion.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.900
You might meet somebody who is a dinosaur who likes to dance [S]I'm doing my charming smile

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.070
It's a really charming smile~

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.210
But you know what I'm saying.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.310
you don't know who you're going to meet.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.680
What if you meet an art student that you totally fall in love with

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.350
and he is a sweet, awesome, amazing guy

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.010
Who wants to open up a coffee shop

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.010
and doesn't make that much money.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.780
But you could be really happy for the rest of your lives.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.890
You're going to turn that down just because some guy graduated from a better university?

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.050
I don't know... So what do you guys think about this list of ideal types?

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.060
Is it the same as things that are in your country?

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.360
Or are there ideal things in your country that are not on this list what so ever?

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.300
Let us know in the comment section below.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.460
So that's it for this week's TL;DR

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.530
If you have a question for next TL;DR leave your question in the comment section below.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.570
Or check out the questions already asked and you can thumb them up to bring them to our attention.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.910
And don't forget to subscribe for more TL;DRs where we tell you how to date and fall in love~

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.580
I would not follow this advice to date and fall in love

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.580
This was a bad advice.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.680
It's kind of more of an arranged marriage advice

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.250
It Does seem very arranged
