Hey guys this is Hugo Izzo with Expert Village.
This segment is on what to wear as it pertains

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.090
to quail or dove hunting. Now you won't want
to wear this with dove hunting because you

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.359
want to be camouflaged and obviously this
is not camo, this is hunter orange. With quail

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.750
hunting you will want to wear some orange.
Again you will need to check the state you

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.670
are hunting in or the general areas to find
out what the rules and regulations are but,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.640
it's just a wise practice. If you are in an
area that you are hunting quail, you are going

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.041
to be flushing quail, you want to make sure
that other hunters know where you are. Hunter

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:39.790
orange is great. It's highly visible as you
can see. It's something that you'll just want

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.090
to know you can catch it out of the periphery
of your eyes and know where the hunters are

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.970
in location to you. Also, some other things
that you may want to wear if you are quail

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.120
hunting is some kind of chaps that protect
your legs from briers and brush; a good pair

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.510
of walking boots; and then some comfortable
shirts. If it's on the warm side you want

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.320
to dress a little more to where you?re not
so hot. A lot of quail hunting is done is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.020
from late November into December, January
and February, so even if parts of the United

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.490
States in the south where it maybe a little
warmer you still want to watch the weather

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.600
and dress accordingly. When dove hunting you
can get up a lot of places that when you?re

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.130
going to hunt dove in the morning it's going
to be awfully cold, again you want to dress

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.150
appropriately. For dove hunting you want to
wear as much camouflage as possible and try

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.289
to match it to the location that you are in.
When we've hunted dove in the past, in the

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.560
early morning, you are going to have to wear
some things that as it warms up for the day

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.670
you may want to take it off. A lot of times
your hunt will be done early, if there are

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.939
a lot of birds in the air and flying around
you might not have to worry about it. Also

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.939
know the gear that you are using, know that
whether it's gloves or hats or whatever it

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.619
is just be familiar with it. You don't want
to start with a new pair of boots on a hunt

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.819
and get blisters. Even gloves, if you don't
know how they operate and they get stuck when

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.340
your loading the gun; those kind of things
also how when you pulling the trigger to the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.819
gun and how it relates to that. What to wear
is important. Again you want to wear some

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.150
hunter orange when quail hunting; dove hunting
wear more camouflage.
