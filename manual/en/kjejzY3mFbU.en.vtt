00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.740
So here we're going to the proper
shooting mechanics for the snapshot

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.080
and the wrist shot. We are just going to talk about it real quickly here,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.190
just a refresher. The main key that we are
going to talk about

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.769
always is your hands, getting your hands
away from your body. The reason for that is

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.400
if your hands enclosed to your
body here you are using just your bottom hand

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.590
to shovel the park or to try to get
momentum of the puck. You are just using your

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.430
bottom hand. If you use your top and get it
away from your body and both your hands work together

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.329
what's going to happen is when this top
and pulls back you can see I'm starting to get that flex on my stick.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.850
My top hand is pulling back and I'm
starting to get that flex on my stick.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.790
Now if I rotate my bottom hand through
as my top hand pulls out

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.239
that's going to create that whipping
motion that's really really gonna give you the power

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.649
they are looking for. And what that does
is that gives you

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.250
the ability to get a quick release.
Because here if my hands are out

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.620
and my hands are working together and I
release that puck,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.350
I am going to be able to get a quick release
compared to having to bring my stick all the way back here

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.020
to generate that power. I just get my
hands out use my top hand snaps back to my hip,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.240
my bottom hand snaps through and that's
how I'm generating

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.509
my quick release. So, here I am going to show you a couple time just in full speed.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.060
My hand are out away from my body, my top hand is going to snap back to my hip, my bottom hand is going to snap through.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.590
My hands are away from my body, top hand snaps back,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.680
bottom hand snaps too and that's really
going to create that flex on your stick.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.400
Compared to just using that bottom hand if
my top hand is in here

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.640
and I am just using that bottom hand, then I'm not getting much power. This is where you are generating

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.579
your power from. That's how you generate
that quick release

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.170
that NHL shot. The next thing that I want
you to focus on

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.570
is where that puck is on your stick, so
ideally

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.060
you want to have that puck in the top 30
of your stick here.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.610
You don't want to have the puck back here you want to have that puck on the top 30 of your stick.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.490
What that is going to allow you to do. Again talking about putting leverage
inflex in your step.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.500
If the puck is on that top 3rd, its going to allow you to get

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.800
a little leverage in low pressure on your
stick verses a bit on the heel

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.810
you're not going to get much pressure. So,
here if its on the toe,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.750
I'm going to allow myself to lean in a little bit get my hand out and generate that quick release

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.270
So, here on the toe, hands out, lean and then generate that quick release.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.660
So getting that puck on the toe of your stick is really going to allow you to get your hands through

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.330
your wrist through and generate that
quick release. The last thing that we are going to talk about here

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.489
is just bringing that puck and where
it is

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.590
setup in coordination to your body. So
when you are taking a snapshot or

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.000
you are taking a risk shot you don't want to have to bring the puck all the way back here like that.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.069
You should be able to really set puck from right in here,

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.420
focusing on getting your hands out away
from your body,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.300
getting that puck on the toe of your stick and then

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.129
giving a good quick release. Here puck is

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.550
right in the middle of my stance, my
hands are out

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.409
puck is on the top and I'm getting that good
quick release.

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.769
Those are the techniques that you need to focus on to get a good quick release

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.830
to use the flex of your stick, get
leverage

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.209
and generate a hard shot with power
accuracy and a quick release and those are the three keys at taking a good snapshot.
