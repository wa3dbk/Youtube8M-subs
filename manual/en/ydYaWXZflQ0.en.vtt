Hi! I am Drew Fenn professional home inspector.
I am here for Expertvillage.com. Today, we

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.790
are going to install a shower head and I will
show you how and the video is produced by

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.980
Black Dog Video. You can blackdogvideo.biz
on the internet. Now you have new shower head

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.930
we are going to install on the boom that we
put up here the extension and it has the other

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:45.160
installations we have to Teflon tape this.
So the end of the boom we are going to Teflon

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:56.090
tape, three revolutions, to be carefully,
you don’t want Teflon tape hanging out into

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.280
the water flow stream and make sure it is
a above that. This is a very small threaded

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.310
area, so it is a little more difficult to
get on in it was on the other ones. Then three

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:19.220
revolutions, we break the tape, remember to
do counter clockwise. I will thread this on

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:27.250
and we have got to be very careful, we don’t
cross thread. So we… now see it was little

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:38.190
cross threaded so back it off and start again.
It has gone on nice and smoothly so we don’t

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.840
have a cross thread. Now you might notice
something edge here there is two little machine

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.049
divots on here, that is where we can put a
wrench on it and give it a final tightening.

00:01:47.049 --> 00:02:01.030
Got a wrench, adjust it and we will snug this
down. Okay! There we are. We are all set and

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.220
ready to go with the main shower head.
