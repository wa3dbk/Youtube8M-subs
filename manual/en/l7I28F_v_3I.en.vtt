00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.550
I think definitely seeing a bit of personality.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.900
If we get a true sense of the person, and
what's really driving their motivation for

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.900
study.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.810
We can really feel when a student's got a
genuine interest in the degree.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.190
Somebody who is being honest about not only
their achievements but their interests, and

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.230
not trying to oversell what they've done.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.510
And it really does make them stand out if
they can show that genuine enthusiasm and

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.510
passion.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:41.870
The first thing that I look for is a student's
academic ability.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.210
We do want to make sure that people are applying
to study on the right course, they've got

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.300
the right background so that they can succeed
on the course, and cope with the workload

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.100
that will come during that course.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.260
We also look at the subjects the student's
taking at A-level.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.550
So for some degree programmes such as law
there aren't any A-levels that we specifically

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.860
that we look for as such, we might just look
for ones which involve a heavy level of essay

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.860
writing.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.110
Whereas if you are applying to us for French,
and Spanish, realistically, you are going

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.670
to need to have French at a particular grade,
and Spanish at a particular grade.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.800
The second thing, and one of the most important
things, is the personal statement.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.619
What provides the motivation which is going
to help them keep their interest and motivation

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.590
up for three or four or five years of study.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.869
And we'll also make sure that the reference
backs up what we've seen in the personal statement

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:30.869
as well.

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.440
We are looking for well-rounded individuals
that are going to add to our university community.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.510
The biggest piece of advice I'd give to a
young person - or an older person if they

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.399
choose to go to a university because it's
open to all - is to do their research.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.679
Picking the right subject at the right university
is most important stage of application process.

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.310
The one bit of advice that I would give any
student before they make a university application

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.869
would be to go and visit the universities
that you're thinking of applying to.

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.250
I think the important thing is not just to
look at the degree title but to be thinking

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.600
about what am I actually going to be doing
on a day to day basis.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.220
And looking in particular at why they want
to go to a university, what it is that appeals

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.900
to them about it, it's not just something
to do to fill the time.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.500
I think the critical thing is that the student
has evidenced any skills that they claim to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.500
have well.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.269
Everything needs to be relevant to their application
to university.

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.930
This is a tricky one sometimes because obviously
your application form is covering several

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.990
universities, but you have got to show in
some way that you have understood what each

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.990
course entails.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.810
If you start nice and early, start planning,
focus on what you want from your course, you

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.030
will be in a very good position to move on
to university and do very well.
