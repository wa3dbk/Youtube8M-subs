00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.160
Hi.  In this section of Simplifying And Demystifying Immigration Law,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.360
I would like to discuss

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.800
the question of how to immigrate your family members.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.800
The first thing you have to realize is that there is a difference

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.440
depending on whether the person sponsoring is a US citizen

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.740
or whether they are a lawful permanent resident.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.040
The difference is this: if you are a U.S. citizen,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.560
in some situations

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.200
you can do everything pretty rapidly.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.700
In most situations, if you are a lawful permanent resident, it is going to take a longer period of time.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.020
By that, I mean this: there are basically two steps to immigrating a family member.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.460
The first is what I call a small step, but a very important step

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.480
and a less expensive step.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.420
The second one is where you are going to end up going to a green card interview.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.780
You are going to have to share and disclose financial information

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.820
your income taxes and a whole bunch of other information.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.940
You are going to take fingerprints, to take photographs.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.820
But it is the real deal because at the end of that process

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.980
is when you would receive your green card.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.640
The immigration system here in this country

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.540
is broken down into generally four categories.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.540
Are you trying to immigrate your spouse?

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.360
Are you trying to immigrate a child?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.800
Are you trying to immigrate your parent?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.160
Or are you trying to immigrate a sister or brother?

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.640
Those four categories then are divided on whether or not

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.720
the sponsor is a citizen or permanent resident.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.400
And there's a certain logic to the system.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.740
If you are immigrating as a citizen

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.660
a spouse, or a child, or a parent

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.760
you may qualify for doing both steps at one time.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.740
We call that an immediate relative, an immediate relative process.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.560
That means you can move forward immediately to immigrate your relative.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.620
There are some situations though where you would not want to do that however.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.660
Other classifications would put you in a different category.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.660
There is a first preference.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.520
There is a second preference, 2a and 2b.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.740
There is a third preference and a fourth preference.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.080
The logic behind that means that

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.680
the ones that are higher up

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.400
the first rather than the fourth

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.380
should move quicker through the immigration process.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.280
Let's look at some of the differences.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.840
If you are immigrating the spouse as a United States citizen, they are an immediate relative.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.000
You can move quicker.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.680
If you are a lawful permanent resident,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.980
it is going to take some time.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.540
You are going to have to go through the two-step process.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.520
If you are a citizen and you are immigrating a child,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.500
it depends on your child’s status.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.280
Are they married or not married?

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.780
Are they over 21 or under 21?

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.200
It makes a big difference.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.100
Under 21 has a little bit of preference over those who are 21

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.360
and you can see the logic because if you are a citizen

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.780
and you are immigrating a child under 21,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.980
they are an immediate relative.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.480
If they are over 21, they are in the first preference category.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.720
Now if they are married,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.480
they drop even further down into the third preference.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.520
So you see the logic behind the system.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.000
Under 21 has a preference over 21.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.740
Not married has a preference over being married.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.140
Now, that doesn't necessarily work out a hundred percent

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.620
because another factor - which I am not going to discuss at this time but in a later session

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.200
is what country you are from.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.280
Certain countries have so many applications coming from them

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.420
that the process is actually slower, when technically, under the logical scheme,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.800
it should go faster.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.540
A parent

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.360
Now, this is very interesting here too.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.480
a United States citizen can immigrate more family members than a lawful permanent resident.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.260
Preference is given to the citizen.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.700
For instance, a United States citizen can immigrate their parents.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.160
A lawful permanent resident cannot.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.060
A United States citizen can immigrate a child who is married,

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.260
whether they are over 21 or under,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.580
whereas a lawful permanent resident cannot.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.620
A United States citizen brother or sister can immigrate their brother or sister.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.320
A lawful permanent resident cannot.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.200
So in those situations, do you give up hope?

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.700
No.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.060
Basically, you want to encourage the lawful permanent resident

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.800
to go through the naturalization process

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.820
become a citizen of the United States.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.580
Then they can move into this category and help the other family members.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.340
Another factor here is you have mixed families here.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.280
Is it a straight marriage where husband and wife

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.400
are married and the children are theirs,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.400
biologically and on the birth certificate.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.920
It could be a situation where they are not married

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.860
and the father is removed from the household.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.100
In that case, you are going to need more evidence,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.880
you are going to have to prove a relationship

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.080
between the child and the father.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.280
Generally speaking, people want to know

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.400
“Can I immigrate a certain family member?”

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.660
This chart explains the system and hopefully I have been able to break it down,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.740
simplify it and demystify it for you.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.700
Thank you very much and I will see you next week.
