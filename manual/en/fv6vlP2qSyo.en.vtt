00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.620
Siri, will you be my girlfriend?

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:03.980
No

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.140
SHUT UP!!

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.420
The iPhone 4S was basically the best thing in the history of the world.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.420
People were always saying "This phone is so amazing! There's no way they can make it better!"

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:24.160
So I took that as a personal challenge, and travelled into the afterlife where I could create the best iPhone ever.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.980
Introducing the iPhone 5.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.860
The new iPhone 5 tackles the previous problem of autocorrect typing.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.500
It now asks you if you're sure you meant to type each word.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.820
"Do your homework, Billy"

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.240
Siri: Are you sure you meant to type 'do', or did you mean to type 'so'?

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.740
'Do'

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.740
Siri: Are you sure?

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.800
Yes!

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.320
Siri: Okay, next word, did you mean to type 'your' or did you mean to type 'beaver'?

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:05.220
People complained about how bulky the power cord was. So we engineered the smallest power cord ever.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.400
(Struggled muttering)

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.920
The iPhone 5's vibrate mode has been vastly improved. I used to miss calls all the time when my phone was in my purse.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.420
And it's highest setting, it registers a 1.5 on the riptor scale

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740
Can you call me right back?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.860
Thanks

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.640
Many people have the requesting dual LED flash for brighter photo and video.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.760
Well we took it a step further and we covered the entire back with LEDs allowing you to get brighter photos wherever you are.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.580
Take a picture of me, daddy! It's my birthday!

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.840
AUUGHHAUGH!!

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.760
I personally think dual LEDs would have been plenty, but Steve insisted we put--AUUUAGH!!!!

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.940
Say goodbye to amateur looking iPhone videos. With the old iPhone, you could record vertically which looked wrong.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.240
(Cheerful laughter) It's my birthday!

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.160
I think I just ate a candle, daddy.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.780
Now when you try to record vertically, it's not as pleasant.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.600
(Muffled) This is the best birthday ever daddy!

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.580
(Pained screaming)

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.720
Remembering to do things is even easier with the iPhone 5.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.520
Siri will now overhear your conversation, and will give you important reminders at the appropriate time.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.260
Siri: You have one new reminder, don't forget to...

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:50.080
Message Playback: I really should tell my cheating horrible wife to stop making Mexican food! Gah! My ass burns!

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:00.580
With the  iPhone 5, Siri is even more human-like than ever. She'll even tell you racist jokes just like all your friends.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.580
Hey yo Siri. Tell me a joke.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.480
Siri: What's the difference between a black man and a pizza?

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.480
Hey yo that's f---ed up!

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.860
To really give Siri a soul, we're giving you the option to change her voice to the most soulful voice in the world.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.860
Siri: Hi yall. I'm Morgan Freeman.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.720
Hi, Morgan Freeman!

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.700
So there you have it, the iPhone 5 is here to change the world. Buy it now.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.560
OR I'LL *BEEP* YOUR *BEEP* AND I'LL *BEEP*  YOUR *BEEP*!!

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:39.320
The iPhone 5. Starting at $100 for the 1GB version and 800$ for 8GB with a 10 year contract.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.880
I don't really know why we bother telling you the price, 'cause you idiots are going to pay for it anyway. Hah!

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.860
