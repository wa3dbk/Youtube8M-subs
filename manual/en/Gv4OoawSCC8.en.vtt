00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
In one TV show I saw an unusual recipe shortbread cookies. 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.379
Basler brunsli - a traditional Swiss Christmas treats. 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.159
Chocolate cookies with spices. 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:16.329
Today we will prepare it. 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.900
For this recipe we will need the following products: 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:22.400
150 grams of sugar, sugar from which we make the sugar powder, 100-130 g of flour,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.779
250 g of almonds, cane sugar for dusting, pinch of salt,  

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:34.100
1 tsp of cinnamon, 2 tbsp of cherry brandy, 2 eggs and 150 g of chocolate. 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.400
Grind sugar in powdered sugar. 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.600
If you have a finished powdered sugar, use it.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.290
I empty the sugar into a mill. 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.500
Make the powdered sugar with the blender. 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.710
Powdered sugar is ready. 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.800
Empty it into the pan and will whisk it together with eggs. 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.000
I immediately grind nuts for almond flour. 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.500
I lightly toasted almonds. 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:40.900
When will I grind nuts, they do not stick together. 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.070
Empty the almond flour in a bowl for further cooking. 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.120
We no longer need blender. 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:10.079
Will continue to whisk powdered sugar with eggs whisk. 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:17.100
Add 2 eggs in powdered sugar. 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.400
Take a whisk. 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:35.089
Whisk. 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:48.700
Add melted chocolate to the pot. It has cooled to room temperature. 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:55.829
It is necessary to cool the chocolate, otherwise the eggs cook. 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.800
Add the main ingredient. 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.429
Pour cherry brandy. 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:07.700
It is possible to use any other brandy, for example, plum brandy. 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.789
Stir. 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:16.769
Add a pinch of salt. 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.769
Teaspoon of cinnamon. 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:28.900
Stir again. 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.700
Take almond flour. 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.329
Add. 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.139
Stir. 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:45.000
Add the flour. 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.500
We should have a soft, elastic dough, from which we will make cookies. 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.200
This dough can be rolled out with a rolling pin. 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.589
I will gradually add flour. 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:03.329
We've got such a soft, elastic dough. 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:09.249
Form the dough into a ball, place in a bowl. 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:14.979
Cover top with cling film. 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:23.100
Put in the freezer for 20-30 minutes or just in the fridge for 2-3 hours. 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:33.870
Roll out the cooled dough between two sheets of parchment paper to a thickness of 1 cm.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.800
I knead it up a bit.  

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:53.800
Do this in order not to sprinkle the table with flour and to prevent from sticking the excess flour to the dough. 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.039
Roll out the dough. 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.039
Level the surface a little. 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:13.039
Cut out cookies using molds. 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.909
Sprinkle biscuits with cane sugar. 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:28.800
Spread on a baking sheet, the laid parchment paper. 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.900
Put the cookies to bake in a preheated 200 Â°C oven. 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.129
15 minutes have passed. 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:42.700
Check the cookies with wooden sticks. 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:48.639
It is completely dry. Cookies are ready. 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.100
We get cookies from the oven. Leave it to cool. 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:55.629
Send a second batch in the oven. 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:59.100
Popularity Basler brunsli lies in almond flour. 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.500
Baking turns crumbly and extremely tasty. 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.500
Cook with pleasure and enjoy!

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.000
