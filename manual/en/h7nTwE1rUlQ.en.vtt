00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.500
I know how to deal with cubes.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.870
I’ve played Bombastic, I’ve played Voodoo
Dice, I’ve played Intelligent Qube (and

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.810
really wish I could track down a copy today).

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.940
Cubes work for me.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.400
So I went into Death By Cube, feeling kinda
full of myself.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.250
Oh, how wrong I was.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.240
The cubes... the cubes are coming to get me.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.240
I’m going to fortify the door of the studio
now.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:56.370
So you’re this little cute robot thing.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.920
Kinda like Marvin the Paranoid Android, only
with better weapons systems.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.320
In classic Robotron style, you’ve got one
stick to move and one stick to shoot, as wave

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.080
after wave of boxy foes come after you.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.790
Blast one apart, and... my that’s a lot
of blood.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.381
Just raining down all over the place.

00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:18.710
I mean, these things aren’t even any semblance
of human!

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.140
They look like dolls at best!

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:36.100
I wouldn’t even expect them to contain blood,
let alone hundreds of gallons of it.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.979
I have to wonder if this game was designed
just to be a figurative middle finger to the

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:40.979
censors.

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:41.979
I mean, seriously.

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:42.979
It’s RAINING blood.

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.580
This is supposed to be the future!

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.110
Things are clean!

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.070
The graphics are nice and all, but very red.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.070
Awright.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.670
Let’s look past the blood for a second.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.649
As soon as someone gets a mop.

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:08.390
The goal is to shoot down all the cubes and
cube-like allies while completing a goal,

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.060
ranging from “KILL EVERYTHING” to “DON’T
DIE.”

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.600
Your android, who happens to be suffering
from amnesia (this is a Square Enix game,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.530
after all), is equipped with a basic weapons
system, an invincible dash that disorients

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.280
enemies and causes them to drop their guard,
and a reflector shield which can absorb and

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.850
return volleys of enemy fire.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.221
By spending the chips you earn in each stage,
you can upgrade your android (named Leo, or

00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:40.390
037 if you look at it right-side up) with
homing missiles, spread fire, greater defensive

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.340
potential, or other improvements.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.720
And then you spend chips to unlock the next
world.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.560
And spend chips to unlock each stage.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.860
The whole game runs on money.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.470
Unfortunately, this hypercapitalism creates
some issues, especially if you’re having

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.760
trouble with the tough-as-nails survival stages.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.840
Each mission has three goal scores, each worth
1000 chips apiece... but often, achieving

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.990
these scores isn’t a matter of simply completing
the mission, but a function of HOW you do

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.990
so.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.960
Close-quarters kills yield not only higher
points, but also increase your multiplier,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.794
meaning if you stand back and let your homing
attacks do all the work, you’re going to

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:19.150
succeed in your goal, but it won’t be pretty.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.620
More technically-impressive actions, like
multi-kills, causing mass confusion with your

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.200
dashes, and absorbing high levels of enemy
ordnance will improve your weapons systems,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.840
opening access to reverse fire, homing fire,
and spread fire regardless of your current

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.840
build.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.180
The soundtrack is a comfortable techno backbone,
accented by a friendly voice delivering instructions.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.150
I hope that wherever she is, she’s not getting
blood on her.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.070
All in all, Death By Cube is a strange little
piece of shooter fun, but the whole thing

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.420
seems a little unbalanced.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.670
I don’t know if it’s because the game
starts at such an extreme speed, or if it’s

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.990
a matter of how much flak you have to survive
on-screen, but it’s an experience that takes

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.150
quite a while to get used to.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.740
The learning curve is all kinda of steep,
and unfortunately for your traction, it's

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.370
covered in blood.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.220
Just soaked in it.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.090
All over the place.
