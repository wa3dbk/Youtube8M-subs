00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.670
Our first question is from Andre Daubin of Nashville.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.810
Wow Sentor Obama, you are really tall. What are you like 6"2?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.200
Aww no, just six and a half. My mother always told me

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.450
that good things come in small packages. 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.950
We now have a question on the economy from Stephen Brown.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.350
Senator McCain I recently lost my job and I kind of 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.860
desperately need another one. I, I, I think the answer 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.430
to your problem is lower taxes. Really?

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.430
I don't have a job so, I'm not really paying a lot

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.400
of taxes right now as it is. 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.250
Senator Obama, do you have a rebuttal? Are you any good with

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.880
Excel or Photoshop? Yes sir, I'm actually, yeah...

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.680
Well my campaign has an entry level place for you

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.620
if you are willing to work hard. Now wait a minute my friends,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.390
see this is what I'm saying that while Senator Obama just happily wants

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.320
to pay somebody, to develop his film, instead of taking it

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.320
to the drugstore just like everyone else.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.800
Moving on to our next question. Go ahead please.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.470
Senator Obama: Now the fact Sarah Pailin lady don't got no

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.210
problem with drillin' in Alaska,  Why are you so damn plain

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.310
against it? 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.920
It would take at least 10 years for us to get any of that

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.750
oil from the ground to the gas pump, and if I'm elected President

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.190
I'll make sure that alternative energy sources 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.950
will make oil obsolete. By that time.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.490
By golly, there you go again Senator Obama, waving that

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.630
flag of surrender. You know you're really not

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.300
cute enough or perky enough to pull that one off there Senator,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.370
but we need to get moving on here. Our next question from

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.110
Mr. Michel Party, is from  Memphis Tennessee.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.780
My question is for Senator McCain. Sir, in regards to your imprisonment,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.210
what were the most difficult things about being a P.O.W.?

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.580
Wow, that's a tough question. Lets see, I didn't find out

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.690
about the moon landing  'till I got out.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.290
Oh and the whole mini-skirt thing, that was over too.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.660
But I'd have to say the hardest thing for me was missing the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.170
Elvis Presley 1968 come back special. And let me tell you, my friend,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.810
that it was pure torture. God Bless you sir.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.270
Would you like to comment Senator Obama?

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.310
The change America is waiting for can best be summed up

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.950
in the words of the king. On a golden bright Chicago morning 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.490
A poor little thing ... 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.530
(singing together) 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.300
