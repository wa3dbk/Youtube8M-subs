00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:14.370
Hi, my name is Brad, and today I'm going to tell you about AbleNet's BIGmack and LITTLEmack communication devices.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.109
These are easy to use single message communicators
that are known the world over,

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.039
and programming on them is extremely easy.
You can record very, very quickly and the sound

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.710
quality is outstanding. So let's find out how
to record on one of these right now.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.740
So to record a message on this device,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.000
first make sure it's turned on,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
then enter record mode by pressing holding
the record button until the light turns on.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.080
Next press and hold the message location
while speaking your message and release it

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.070
when you're done.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.070
[Record] "Let's chat." Exit record mode by pressing and releasing the record button and your message is

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.550
ready for play back.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.700
[Playback] "Let's chat." It's that easy. And if you don't remember how to record it,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.000
instructions are written on the back of the
device.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.200
Apart from the obvious differences in size, the BIGmack and LITTLEmack have quite a bit in common.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.220
Both products feature two minutes of high-quality digital recording, as well as external switch

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.910
input jack so if you have a switch that you
you are used to using already, you can plug that into

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.550
device and activate it.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.340
Also on both products is a toy appliance output jack
that allows you to connect

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.200
your LITTLEmack or your BIGmack to any 
switch adapted toy or appliance and allowing you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.200
to provide auditory feedback

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.490
as well as device activation.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.490
The products also both ship with a collection
of colored switch tops, so if I prefer a different color or my vision
needs dictate it,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.550
so if I prefer a different color or my vision
needs dictate it, I can easily unscrew the cap and place a new one on,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.560
and additional colors are available online.
When it comes to mounting options of course

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.790
we can do that.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.510
We have our entire suite of mounting options
available to you, and depending on how you

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.900
combine it, we can put your BIGmack or your LITTLEmack exactly where you need to be and hold

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.029
in that position whenever you need it to.

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:22.669
Lastly I want to talk about durability. AbleNet's products like the BIGmack and the LITTLEmack

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:27.119
are made to be tough and withstand whatever you throw at them,
which for some users actually does mean

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.649
throwing them, but we don't recommend it.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:34.769
The BIGmack and LITTLEmack are two of AbleNet's
best-known easy-tech AAC devices, so to
