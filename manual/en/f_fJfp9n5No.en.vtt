Welcome to fatta fat chutney with your VahChef today I'm going to show you how

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.250
to make a simple radish chutney any chutney is a must when you start a meal

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.359
because that really enhances any meal
here i'm going to take some oil, in this

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.619
we're going to add some cumin seeds when they slightly splutter i'm going to add

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.329
sesame seed and also some tamrind

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.660
okay that should be good in this we're going to add radish you know cut radish into

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.539
small pieces you know a lot of people
they don't like radish much but the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.460
people who love radish they love radish
paratha and many other things but this is

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.590
one chutney anybody would love because this is very easy to make and very

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.489
tasty

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.979
just make sure you cook the radish for
like around 2 minutes add little bit

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.010
of salt while you're cooking this and
also some turmeric when the radish is

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.259
slightly sauted we also can add green
chillies to this, reduce the flame and

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:27.210
just all of them cook for 2 minutes when
the radish is cooked add coriander leaf

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.939
and coconut for this

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.740
just make sure that the coconut is the
same quantity of radish and then it'll

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.140
taste fantastic, dear friends

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.799
you don't even have to cook the coconut just switch off the flame and transfer all

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.180
this into a blender and make this into a nice coarse paste, look at this, this is our

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.340
radish chutney

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.369

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.100

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.769
