00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:20.646
&gt;&gt;Kristin: I can say that the
things I've been doing the last

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:22.326
two years have really
made a difference,

00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:25.586
because my kids have scored
the highest in the State

00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:26.896
on the standardized tests.

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:29.066
So what we're doing
here is working,

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:29.876
and it's helping
them be successful.

00:00:33.436 --> 00:00:36.176
&gt;&gt;Julie: We define Blended
Learning as the combination

00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:38.066
of digital content and activity

00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:40.936
with face-to-face
content and activity.

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:43.876
It sounds easy to
Blend, but it really,

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:46.126
it looks very different
in every classroom.

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:49.396
So if a teacher is using
something that works really well

00:00:49.396 --> 00:00:53.406
in a face-to-face situation,
they should continue to do

00:00:53.406 --> 00:00:54.466
that because it works well.

00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:57.296
If they can find something
else that works better,

00:00:57.296 --> 00:00:59.486
is more efficient or more
effective that's digital,

00:00:59.806 --> 00:01:01.436
then that would be implemented.

00:01:02.216 --> 00:01:04.956
&gt;&gt;Kristin: What I have online
could be completely different

00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:06.876
than what the biology
teacher has online,

00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:09.116
or what the physical
education teacher has online.

00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:12.766
It just depends on what you
need those kids to have in order

00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.976
to understand what
they need to learn.

00:01:16.236 --> 00:01:18.396
&gt;&gt;Mickey: Okay, go
ahead get the laptops.

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:23.706
And actually anybody that's in
a small group come over here,

00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:24.976
I need you to get a iPad.

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:30.486
&gt;&gt;Why I wanted to go to a
more Blended environment was

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:33.736
so that I could figure out a
way to differentiate instruction

00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:38.376
within the biology classroom,
and I wanted a way to be able

00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:41.296
to work with students
in small groups,

00:01:41.456 --> 00:01:43.976
while other students are still
engaged in content learning.

00:01:46.046 --> 00:01:46.796
&gt;&gt;There are three activities.

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:48.676
One's assorted sentence
activity,

00:01:49.136 --> 00:01:51.246
one is an online interactivity

00:01:51.246 --> 00:01:52.976
and one is small group that's
going to be working with me.

00:01:56.146 --> 00:01:59.996
&gt;&gt;Okay, slide to the apps,
and open up Educreations,

00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:02.056
because we're going
to fill in this chart,

00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:04.606
because this is going to get
us practicing base pairing

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:08.956
between DNA and RNA and
reading our photon chart.

00:02:09.356 --> 00:02:11.050
Okay, so what goes G?

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.306
&gt;&gt;Student: C.

00:02:12.696 --> 00:02:13.566
&gt;&gt;Mickey: C. So I'm
going to put G

00:02:13.596 --> 00:02:15.896
and C together like this, right?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.606
&gt;&gt;Shelton: I've like
probably learned more today just

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:22.926
by doing this than I
have the whole week

00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:24.936
that we've been doing this.

00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:27.016
&gt;&gt;Kristin: And we looked at the
research about Blended Learning.

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:29.186
We've defined it, and
then we had to figure

00:02:29.186 --> 00:02:31.416
out what would it
look like in my class.

00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:35.536
And so that's when I went,
"Well, I actually want

00:02:35.536 --> 00:02:37.846
to use it more as
a tool for the kids

00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:39.696
for like supplemental
materials."

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:43.466
There's always practice
problems.

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:46.856
Or you can go listen to
somebody talk about the topic.

00:02:47.126 --> 00:02:50.626
But the kids started to say
that, "We don't want to listen

00:02:50.626 --> 00:02:52.726
to somebody else; we
want to listen to you.

00:02:53.236 --> 00:02:56.366
And we need your help, and
we want to hear your voice."

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:59.076
So I started to go, "Okay,
well, how can I do that?"

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.846
And so our technology
person said,

00:03:01.846 --> 00:03:04.066
"Have you seen this
app on the iPad?"

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:06.466
And me, not knowing anything
about technology, went,

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:07.756
"I have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:08.866
Teach me."

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:11.676
So we went through a
process of me learning how

00:03:11.676 --> 00:03:15.466
to use the ShowMe app, and
then I started making podcasts

00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:18.416
and it gives me a chance
to be in their homes,

00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:20.246
wherever they are 24/7.

00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:21.976
It's Virtual Weller,
is what we call it.

00:03:23.086 --> 00:03:25.426
&gt;&gt;"That will correspond
to six to nine,

00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:26.976
like it has in the
rest of the problems."

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:29.946
&gt;&gt;Luis: The podcast
like helps so much.

00:03:29.946 --> 00:03:32.306
It's like as if she's
actually there, and she just go

00:03:32.306 --> 00:03:34.426
through it again, and you can
like finally understand it.

00:03:34.426 --> 00:03:37.766
&gt;&gt;Kristin: I see them,
they'll plug in, I look over

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:38.836
and they have it
on their phones.

00:03:39.156 --> 00:03:41.366
They have it on their tablets,
they have it on computers.

00:03:45.586 --> 00:03:48.996
They do podcasts for
me during class time.

00:03:49.386 --> 00:03:52.206
I will have specific
problems I want to see,

00:03:52.316 --> 00:03:54.356
just like do they
understand the basics

00:03:54.356 --> 00:03:55.636
of what we talked about today?

00:03:58.036 --> 00:04:00.226
&gt;&gt;Student: Forty, all
right, 60 plus 60.

00:04:01.496 --> 00:04:05.136
Divide 40 to get C by itself.

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:07.996
And C...

00:04:08.576 --> 00:04:10.526
&gt;&gt; ...equals to 45.

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:13.336
&gt;&gt;Class: Yay!

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:13.836
[applause] Oh, yeah!

00:04:14.876 --> 00:04:15.506
&gt;&gt;Kristin: All right.

00:04:17.076 --> 00:04:20.936
&gt;&gt;For me classroom time, direct
instruction, investigations,

00:04:20.936 --> 00:04:23.536
discovery, that's all
still part of teaching.

00:04:23.836 --> 00:04:25.546
It's not all online.

00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:29.016
A lot of the face-to-face stuff
is still the most important

00:04:29.066 --> 00:04:30.486
thing to me.

00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:31.926
The online tools are there

00:04:31.926 --> 00:04:36.556
to help make understanding
even better, even more rich

00:04:36.556 --> 00:04:37.966
of an experienced for the kids.

00:04:38.026 --> 00:04:40.386
&gt;&gt;Julie: We really wanted the
focus to be on the teaching

00:04:40.386 --> 00:04:43.296
and learning part, and
on the digital tool

00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:44.736
as a secondary thing.

00:04:45.386 --> 00:04:46.906
&gt;&gt;Mickey: Kids don't always
get it the first time,

00:04:47.076 --> 00:04:48.936
or the second time,
or the third time.

00:04:48.936 --> 00:04:52.586
And this allows different
ways for those kids to get it.

00:04:53.476 --> 00:04:56.666
The pass rate for my kids the
first year was 75 percent;

00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:58.536
and the second year
was 93 percent.

00:04:58.856 --> 00:05:01.616
The state average is
somewhere around 60 percent.

00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:03.226
So something's working
for these kids.
