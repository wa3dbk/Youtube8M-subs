00:00:00.594 --> 00:00:04.412
(jazzy piano music)

00:00:04.412 --> 00:00:07.737
- Jasmine, cake vodka. Pour.

00:00:07.737 --> 00:00:08.699
- How much?

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:10.813
- I'll tell you when to stop,
man, stop asking questions.

00:00:10.813 --> 00:00:11.974
OK, that's enough.

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:16.974
Meghan, Creme de Cacao, we're
using the dark version, OK?

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:21.543
Now we can hit that with some heavy

00:00:21.543 --> 00:00:23.464
whipping cream, go ahead, pour.

00:00:23.464 --> 00:00:25.473
- The white stuff.

00:00:25.473 --> 00:00:27.436
- Not coke, just heavy whipping cream.

00:00:27.436 --> 00:00:30.697
OK, shake it and keep it sexy!

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:34.101
(girls moaning and laughing)

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:34.910
- Like that?

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.246
- [Skyy] Go ahead, yeah,
do some more of that.

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:39.128
- [Meghan] Go for it.
- [Jasmine] I'm done. (laughs)

00:00:39.128 --> 00:00:40.641
- Go Meghan.

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:43.911
- Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby.

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:46.286
- Happy?

00:00:46.286 --> 00:00:47.355
- [Skyy] All of you is so exciting.

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:48.959
Why you shaking, are you nervous?

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:50.674
- [Meghan] No, is that enough?

00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:53.307
- [Skyy] That's good,
that's good, next one.

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.400
- That smells so good.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.195
- Let me smell it.

00:00:58.195 --> 00:00:59.234
- Drink some, taste it.

00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:00.677
- Oh my god, can we?

00:01:00.677 --> 00:01:01.858
- Yeah, taste it.

00:01:01.858 --> 00:01:03.388
- It smells amazing.

00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:05.952
- I go crazy for, like, anything.

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:08.799
- Mmm.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.006
- [Meghan] That tastes like a marshmallow.

00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:14.378
- Oh, my god.
(Meghan laughs)

00:01:20.487 --> 00:01:21.641
- [Jasmine] You don't need that much!

00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:22.641
- [Skyy] Yeah, we need that much.

00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:23.591
- [Jasmine] No, you don't.

00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:25.982
- [Skyy] We're gonna roast some rum, boy!

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:29.226
- [Jasmine] We're gonna
roast some marshmallows.

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:30.684
- It's just, I'm afraid it'll ruin

00:01:30.684 --> 00:01:33.743
the taste of the drink,
you know what I mean?

00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:34.899
- Its a man's drink, OK?

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:35.895
- Well, whatever.

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.749
- I'll take this one, Meghan,
you can do both of those,

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:40.198
'cause apparently I can't drink.

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:43.979
Yeah, we read your comments. Rude.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.275
- [Skyy] Well, you suck at it, don't you?

00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:47.137
How many drinks have you failed at?

00:01:47.137 --> 00:01:48.785
(girls laughing)

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:51.841
Slide the marshmallows
on there, at least three.

00:01:52.887 --> 00:01:54.941
Use this marshmallow cream.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.504
OK that's enough, homeboy,

00:01:56.504 --> 00:01:58.406
what you trying to do?
- [Jasmine] A little bit more.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.867
- [Meghan] We missed a spot!

00:01:59.867 --> 00:02:02.228
- OK, fine.
- [Jasmine] OK, there you go.

00:02:02.228 --> 00:02:06.116
- [Skyy] Dip it inside
the graham crackers.

00:02:09.606 --> 00:02:12.279
Now sprinkle on some cocoa.

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.375
- [Jasmine] Get me some cocoa too.

00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:17.506
- [Jasmine] This feels like
a kindergarten project.

00:02:17.506 --> 00:02:20.646
- [Skyy] Ugly rabbit drunken smores.

00:02:20.646 --> 00:02:25.044
You need to man up, Meghan, there's yours.

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:27.245
- Oh, that didn't catch.
- [Skyy] No, I think it's good.

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:28.656
- [Meghan] Oh, it is, it is.
- [Man] It's on fire, right?

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:33.656
- Ooh, guys, guys?
- [Meghan] Oh my god, Jasmine.

00:02:35.896 --> 00:02:38.012
- [Jasmine] Oh, that's so burnt.

00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:42.508
- [Jasmine] Don't you like
your marshmallows burnt, Skyy?

00:02:42.508 --> 00:02:45.138
- [Skyy] No, I don't like
anything burnt, what am I?

00:02:45.138 --> 00:02:48.481
- I like it burnt like this
and I like to peel it off.

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:52.449
- It's all just getting soggy.
- [Meghan] Ow!

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:57.227
- [Meghan] I just dipped it in
straight Bacardi 151, oh well.

00:02:58.981 --> 00:03:00.915
- I mean, this is like
two of my favorite things.

00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:04.710
Liquor, and marshmallows, and s'mores.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.305
- Is that hot?

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:09.361
- [Meghan] Mmm. Whoa.

00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:11.323
- [Skyy] What are you thinking?

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:12.844
- Is it good?
- [Meghan] Mm-hmm.

00:03:12.844 --> 00:03:15.311
- [Meghan] I just don't
want the 151 to affect

00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:17.433
the flavor underneath
because it tastes so good.

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:19.552
- 'Cause this is really good,
and this tastes like ass.

00:03:19.567 --> 00:03:21.566
- Oh, so you just want to
suck the 151 off the top

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:23.775
and then do the rest, is
that what you want to do?

00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:25.895
- I just was hoping it
wouldn't affect the flavor.

00:03:25.926 --> 00:03:27.023
- No, I don't think
it'll affect the flavor.

00:03:27.023 --> 00:03:28.823
It'll be perfect, it'll be a smooth blend.

00:03:28.823 --> 00:03:30.287
Probably taste like pineapple juice.

00:03:30.287 --> 00:03:31.592
Go ahead, are you all ready?

00:03:31.592 --> 00:03:32.850
Man up, let's go!

00:03:33.434 --> 00:03:34.354
- - [Meghan] Well, cheers.

00:03:34.354 --> 00:03:35.247
- [Jasmine] I always get nervous.

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:36.833
- Cheers, go ahead.

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:37.978
- Is it hot, can I...

00:03:37.978 --> 00:03:39.936
- No, it's not, put your finger in.

00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:40.928
- [Both girls] It's a little warm.

00:03:40.928 --> 00:03:42.926
- [Skyy] Ok, It's warm!
- [Meghan] Gross, OK, whatever.

00:03:42.926 --> 00:03:45.256
- [Skyy] Ain't frickin' hot!
- [Meghan] Whatever.

00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:46.998
- Action!

00:03:50.093 --> 00:03:51.046
- Well, Jasmine beat you for the

00:03:51.046 --> 00:03:53.808
first time, for the first time ever.

00:03:53.808 --> 00:03:55.411
And you know why?

00:03:56.118 --> 00:03:59.618
That was an easy shot, that wasn't hard.

00:03:59.618 --> 00:04:04.020
- Actually, that Bacardi
ruined the whole flavor.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.822
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:04:05.822 --> 00:04:08.339
- But it was good up until the Bacardi.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.547
No, by itself this was amazing.

00:04:11.547 --> 00:04:15.287
- OK, go ahead and wash down your booze.

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:18.481
- It was nice until...
- [Skyy] Go ahead, on three.

00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:20.587
- [Skyy] One, two, three, down the hatch!

00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:22.796
(Jasmine moaning)

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:25.753
- That's so good, thank you.

00:04:26.645 --> 00:04:28.509
- That's it OK.

00:04:29.694 --> 00:04:31.669
Gentlemen, Meghan and Jasmine

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.430
have a very unique role
to play on this show, ok?

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.101
- Basically, we get to die.

00:04:37.101 --> 00:04:40.075
- Right. They will never, ever, ever have

00:04:40.075 --> 00:04:42.802
anything easy to do on this show.

00:04:42.802 --> 00:04:46.847
Everything they do will be
extremely difficult, ok?

00:04:46.847 --> 00:04:49.797
They will have hair all over their chests!

00:04:49.797 --> 00:04:51.156
So here's what I need you to do.

00:04:51.156 --> 00:04:56.156
If you have really creative
fun shots that are potent

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.250
go to Facebook, post them
on my Facebook page, OK?

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.271
These recipes and pictures
of them, if you have them,

00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:02.876
on the Facebook page, in the feed!

00:05:02.876 --> 00:05:05.649
No messages on the
page, for Christ's sake.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.401
Post it in the feed and I can kind of

00:05:07.401 --> 00:05:10.856
click through and see what they can do.

00:05:10.856 --> 00:05:13.553
Don't give me crazy stuff
- [Jasmine] Don't try to kill me.

00:05:13.553 --> 00:05:15.358
- [Skyy] No, cause some
of them send recipes,

00:05:15.358 --> 00:05:17.867
three ounces of Bacardi 151,
three ounces of everclear,

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:20.816
three ounces of Jagermeister,
and, um, that's it.

00:05:20.816 --> 00:05:21.541
- Oh, you guys.

00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:24.784
- No one's going to do that shot, ok?

00:05:24.784 --> 00:05:27.315
It's gotta be something
that people want to try

00:05:27.315 --> 00:05:30.674
that's potent and has their
name on it, let me know.

00:05:30.674 --> 00:05:33.396
Tipsybartender! I'm out!
- [Meghan] Tipsy bartender!

00:05:33.396 --> 00:05:34.647
- [Meghan] America!

00:05:34.647 --> 00:05:36.260
- Follow all of us on Instagram, ok?

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.093
- TipsyBartender, Jazminc7, @pwnytail.

00:05:40.093 --> 00:05:42.851
- It's actually like
a snowcone flavor, ok?

00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:45.907
- [Jasmine] It's like Hawaii! Mmm.

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.173
- Brain freeze, teeth are
falling out, but it's yum.

00:05:54.173 --> 00:05:55.246
- Like it?

00:05:55.246 --> 00:05:55.776
- Mmm.
