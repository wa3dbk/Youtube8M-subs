00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.160
Replica is about a girl who wakes up
with all her memories

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.750
erased, trapped in the basement of someone who looks exactly like her.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.900
It comes out in August. It's my first global
release, and it's already getting really

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.870
good reviews so I'm very very excited
about it.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.450
I wrote the book because I believe that
not every

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.910
action or sci fi story has to have a
straight, white,

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.390
male main character. I think that's starting to get old. I also believe that teenagers

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.680
don't need to be talked down to. They can
handle the more sophisticated concepts

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.370
available in adult science fiction,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.540
and I also think that a book has the
potential to be more exciting than a

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.950
movie or a video game

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.670
because the screen can only show you how something looks and how it sounds, what it

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.280
leaves out is how it feels, how it smells,
how it tastes,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.290
and you also don't have budgetary constraints when you're writing a book,

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.229
so you can afford to make it a little
bit more daring. If you know someone who

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.759
likes YA, I promise you they will love Replica.

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.270
If you know someone who likes SF, they
will love Replica. If you know someone who

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.119
likes LGBT inclusive fiction,

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.170
they will love Replica. And if you happen
to know someone who likes LGBTYASF,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.679
they will go nuts for it.

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.850
So I guess that's my little spiel done, but
before I go I want to thank the

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.390
people who made Replica possible.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.240
Firstly, my agent, Clare Forster, who
believed in project from the very

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.729
beginning,

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.590
the team at Curtis Brown London, who liked the book enough to take it on board,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.759
the team at Oxford University Press who
liked it so much they bought the global

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.610
publishing rights to it, the

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.840
team at artsACT, who liked
it enough that they

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.970
actually gave me a grant to fund the
editing of the book which I really

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.100
really appreciated,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.560
and my family, Venetia, Tom, my mum and
dad,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.590
and lastly the tens of thousands of readers all around the world who contacted me to

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.590
offer their support.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.750
I really, really appreciate it, guys - I
hope you enjoy the book.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.330
This one's for you.
