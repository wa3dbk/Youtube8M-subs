Ok folks, in this clip we're going to talk
about how to shoot music videos. Music videos

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.980
are essentially suppose to be the visual interpretation
of a song, so make sure early on that everything

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.520
is, everyone is on the same page when it comes
to the visual direction of the video itself.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.220
As you're shooting, first of all you're going
to want to get a lot of coverage of the performance

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.480
aspect of it; meaning the band or the artist
that's performing the song itself. Take as

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.460
much time as you're permitted to to get as
much coverage of this as you possibly can

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.789
cause this will be your safety net in the
editing room. You're going to be going back

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.989
to this performance again, and again, and
again. Assuming that the video itself has

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.229
a story line to it that's separate from the
performance, this will be your, the shots

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:50.289
that you cut to whenever you need to move
the scene's along and you don't want to make

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.829
straight transitions from one bit to the next.
The performance is essentially the glue that

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.379
holds the video together, so get a lot of
coverage of this. Second of all, when it comes

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.820
to shooting any additional aspects of the
video; like if there's some sort of a creative

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.640
narrative story that's attached to the performance
of the group or the band or if they're involved

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.850
in you know a story line that's connected
to the plot of the video. Shoot this segment

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.190
separately from the actual shots of the performance
so that you don't really confuse the two,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.410
cause you're going to be shooting these in
an entirely different way. Shooting coverage

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.410
of the performance is basically covering the
band in a lot of creative ways shooting them

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.460
from different angles using different you
know lighting schemes and locations and camera

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.570
moves to capture the performance. When you're
shooting the story portion you're going to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.430
want to have a little bit more of a clear
time line and almost a script of the events

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.180
that are set to unfold in the story already
planned out and shoot it like you would a

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.170
short film. Obviously there's going to be
a beginning, a middle, and an end and an arch

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.970
between the two. So make sure that you cover
this well, make sure that you really get a

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.310
lot of interesting visual shots and that they
really match the energy of the music itself.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.140
When you get into the editing room you're
going to want the energy of the visuals to

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.700
match the energy of the song. If it doesn't
the video will fall flat on its face and really

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.450
won't make sense. So that is how you shoot
a music video.
