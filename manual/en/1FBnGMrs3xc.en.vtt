00:00:29.152 --> 00:00:31.858
For the last few months, I was training really hard

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.409
but yesterday my condition was very bad.

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:40.078
I think that maybe next time I can run a bit faster.

00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:43.433
Yesterday was the second ..... second time I have run here

00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:47.694
Last year I was 2nd.....yesterday I was the winner.......

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:53.963
but the first place, I was really happy with because I made a good name here in London

00:00:54.152 --> 00:00:57.152
and I got my best time.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.740
So I think that maybe next year, if I can get another chance,

00:01:02.973 --> 00:01:06.363
maybe I can try to run quicker than yesterday.

00:01:25.728 --> 00:01:31.301
You know that the London course is not easy like the other courses.

00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:36.680
So I think that I am No.1 in Kenya, because on this course the last 5km is very hard.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.781
All the people in Kenya, my group, who were training together

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:12.029
because you know when I won yesterday

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:16.162
I won because I have a group for training

00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:18.670
you know sometimes they help me

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.571
so when I get a win then I must repay them.

00:02:23.128 --> 00:02:26.843
Now tomorrow, no not tomorrow, around Saturday

00:02:27.493 --> 00:02:31.069
I will celebrate together with my friends and family in Kenya.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.803
We will have a party in my home

00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:42.958
You know in Kenya, when we win something, you must kill a goat.

00:02:43.143 --> 00:02:46.116
Our religion says you must kill a goat.

00:03:01.162 --> 00:03:04.280
About the World Championships ... I won't make it to run.

00:03:04.831 --> 00:03:08.480
but I think that if I can make it

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.075
I can run the Berlin Marathon or another place.

00:03:12.308 --> 00:03:22.199
But I must talk with my manager, Fredrick Rosa, and we will see and decide later in June.
