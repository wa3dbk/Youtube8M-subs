Hi I'm Grady Johnson and I'm the producer
of the theater company Strange Company and

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.849
today I'm representing expertvillage.com.
Okay now we got our frame completely build

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.990
and you see that I laid them side by side
and then simply place the tops on them. Now

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.710
you want to take a hammer and sort of even
up these sides a little bit. Once you got

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.060
that all chewed out then go ahead and put
in your screws and I recommend that you use

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.119
a little bit of this liquid soap and then
we are going to go ahead and put in first

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.831
that first corner screw. Now be sure that,
that one is square if you get that first one

00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:39.370
squared the rest should fall into place. The
first one is most important one because that

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.470
is going to center the whole work. Go ahead
and pop that in right in your corner. Now

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.100
remember that you got about a inch half that
you are working with here so just kind of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.390
size it up and make sure that you are getting
it in there and that you are going to bit

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.969
into the 2x4. Now that we got that one done
go ahead and go to the other corner. So you

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.150
are going to go ahead put on a little bit
of that soap and here on the other side. That

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:18.320
would get it started. Okay now that it started
go ahead and run it on down. Okay now our

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.400
first two corners are in placed so the thing
to do now is to go ahead and set the other

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.670
end all the way to the other end and then
we fill it in from there. We got that one

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.750
in now lets go ahead and do the same thing
on the front corner until all four corners

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.350
are done.
Now it is just a matter of filling in all

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.860
the rest of the spots on the board. I recommend
that you put them up every foot or so all

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.960
the way down the sides and don't forget that
middle spot. Just start bringing them the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.020
side and space them out about a foot apart.
They would all go together and usually if

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.910
you get to frustrated or try to work something
to hard. Okay I went ahead and found the center

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.690
piece here so I'm going to go ahead and pop
this in to the center piece. If I nailed it

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:24.710
and I could see that I did bit in

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.420
and I got lucky on that. That is the last
one so now we have completed the entire deck

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.700
our complete platform is made for the first
one. When you have a 8x8 stage you got enough

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.841
room to do just about anything and we have
already learn the basic unit to do that is

00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:42.280
which is a 4x8 platform that is already build
now we are going to go ahead and put the other

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.600
one together. In a minute you are going to
have everything that you need to lag these

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.310
together and make your great stage.
