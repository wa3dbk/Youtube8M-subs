00:00:00.178 --> 00:00:03.320
- Tucked away deep in
the Norwegian Fjord land

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.960
is the small town of Aurland.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.790
It's home to something you
wouldn't expect, a shoe factory.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.990
It was the vision of a
young Nils Tveranger.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.190
He launched his shoe in 1908, when it soon

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.523
won the first prize at the national fair.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.180
Aurland shoe industry
boomed, once supporting

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.520
19 companies, now there's just one,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.883
built on an iconic Tveranger design.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.600
Most people in the world know what the

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.930
penny loafer is but most of us don't know

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.740
that they actually come from Norway.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.980
And this is the original penny loafer.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.454
- This is the original penny loafer

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:44.180
it was designed by my
great, great grandfather

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.860
back in the late 1920s.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.080
- And how did it become a
penny loafer or a weejun

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.850
as some people refer to it as?

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.433
- Back in 1934 there was
two American journalists

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:58.620
researching this area and
they write about everything,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.480
the nature, the sea, the
Fjords, but also the shoemaking.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.830
And they go back to USA
and printed the article.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.500
The Bass company, George Henry Bass

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.190
liked what he saw and
copied it back in 1936

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.840
and called it weejuns after Norwegians.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.981
- So the word weejuns
comes from Norwegians.

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:21.814
- Yeah.

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:23.870
- So he's sort of crediting
Norway for his inventions.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.703
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:26.182
- For his inspired inventions.

00:01:26.182 --> 00:01:27.140
- Inspired.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.220
(both laugh together)

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.640
- [Karine Hagen] Weejuns
built a loyal following

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.080
in America and eventually became a huge

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.100
hit on college campuses.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.843
Especially with women who
preferred weejuns to high heels.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.180
While the shoe has become
a long standing favorite,

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.680
most people aren't aware that the unique

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.160
front design actually
played an important role

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.623
in Norway's World War II history.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.270
- [Geirfinn Lysne] Back
between 1940 - 1945,

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.260
the second World War,
the Norwegian painter

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.310
they used a paper clip in the collar.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.240
- [Karine Hagen] To recognize each other.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.560
- [Geirfinn Lysne] Yeah, yes,
and as a symbol of resistance.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.150
But they also used a Norwegian T-aura,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.610
one-tenth of a krone.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.220
- So they put the one-tenth of the kroner

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.062
into the little pocket here?

00:02:15.062 --> 00:02:15.920
- Mm-hm.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.060
- [Karine Hagen] It's
been said some Americans

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.670
inspired by the story, placed pennies

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.810
in their weejuns and the
penny loafer was born.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.310
While the tools may have changed

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.213
the focus on artistry and
craftsmanship, remains strong.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.930
Today, 5 people sit, and hand-produce

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.280
every one of these shoes.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.083
- Yeah, so everything we do
is kind of limited edition.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.010
- [Karine Hagen]
Aurlandskoen has successfully

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.490
fought back mass production

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.640
by returning to its roots.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.200
Re-imagining Tveranger's legendary design,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.173
in smart and often whimsical ways.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.386
They're actually properly paired.

00:02:56.386 --> 00:02:58.770
- Yeah, that's port and starboard.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.250
- So this is a cheat
sheet for those who are

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.530
trying to take their boat license.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.480
- Yes (he laughs)

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.860
- [Karine Hagen] Aurland Shoe
Factory is like no other,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.403
right down to its one of a kind view.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.220
Norway is a wonderfully diverse country,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.860
with much to discover.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.650
We look forward to sharing with you

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.132
more of our homeland.

00:03:17.132 --> 00:03:20.284
(piano music concludes)
