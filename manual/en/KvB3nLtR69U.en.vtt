00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:10.959
The first thing you're gonna teach your puppy
when it comes into your home is how to toilet

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:11.959
appropriately.

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:25.590
And I'm going to take you step-by-step through
the house training process.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.390
The best way to start house training your
puppy is to create, in your home, a safe zone,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.710
where your puppy can be left when it's unsupervised.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.180
Do not allow your puppy to have free roam
around your house.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.840
Otherwise, that will encourage your puppy
to toilet anywhere in your home.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.490
You can create a safe zone either by using
a small room in your home, preferably with

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.000
a tiled floor.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.880
Or if you don't have a small room, use a pen
where your puppy can be contained.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.110
It's really important that you puppy-proof
any safe zone where your puppy is going to

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.930
be unsupervised, so it can't chew on anything
that's gonna harm it or be inappropriate.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.060
You can do that by getting down on your puppy's
level and looking around the area, just to

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.020
make sure that your puppy's gonna be completely
safe when it's left in this place unsupervised.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.150
If you're gonna choose to paper train your
puppy, which a lot of people do because they

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.560
don't want their puppies to go outside without
being fully vaccinated, you can start off

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.350
the process by lining the entire safe zone
with pads.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:41.729
After a couple days, take away a few of the
pads, so that your puppy gets used to going

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.450
to one area to toilet.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.540
As your puppy gets used to going to one particular
area, you can take away more pads until there's

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.270
maybe one or two pads left, on which your
puppy can toilet.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.220
When your puppy has been really good at toileting
on the pads, you can then begin to take your

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.990
puppy outside.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.979
If you have a backyard that's a safe area
to take your puppy, you can use paper training

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.150
and taking your puppy outside at the same
time.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.840
If you live in an urban environment, and you
want to wait to take your puppy outside until

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.560
its had all its vaccinations, then you can
make that transition by taking a piece of

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.560
soiled pad and taking it out onto the street,
putting it down in a safe area for your dog

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.230
to toilet, so that your dog then begins to
make the association: Okay, the pad is out

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.739
here on the street, I can still toilet out
here, and I'm going to be safe while doing

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:39.739
so.

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.760
When your dog has made that transition by
toileting on the pad outside in the street,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.690
then you can remove the pad.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.480
But it's also okay if you don't want to paper
train at all and you just want to concentrate

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.780
on teaching your puppy to go outside.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.750
Either way, you're going to be teaching your
puppy where to toilet appropriately.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.209
It's always really good to have a word that
you can use that encourages your puppy to

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.209
toilet.

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.850
I use that word to begin with as the puppy
is in the act of toileting, so the puppy then

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.209
begins to make the association between the
word --such as, 'go potty'-- and the action

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.650
of toileting.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.090
Then, you can begin to use it at other times
when you want to encourage your puppy to toilet.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.790
You say the words, 'go toilet', 'go potty',
whatever you want.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.470
Once you've built up that actual word, so
that your puppy associates the word with the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.920
act of toileting, you can use it before the
dog toilets to encourage the dog to toilet.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.970
House training can be a frustrating process,
because it does require a lot of your patience

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.770
and a lot of your time.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.810
But if you're diligent, you can really house
train a puppy very, very quickly.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:04:15.080
