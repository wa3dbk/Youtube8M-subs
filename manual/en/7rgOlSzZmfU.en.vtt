Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.060
I have to install this adjuster on my dishwasher
rack.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:16.059
I think all I’m going to need is a number
15 torx bit screwdriver and that should be

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.059
it.

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:19.100
We’re gonna give it a try.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.390
First we need to get the dishwasher rack out
where we can work on it.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.930
There’s two clips on the end of the rails.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.050
Push them towards the center and they’ll
slide right off.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.410
Pull this little tab towards the center of
the dishwasher and slide that end stop right

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.410
out.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.410
Now we can work at it.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.410
Ok, to disassemble this rack adjuster we need
to remove the 5 number 15 torx screws.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:46.149
Once we remove those screws the back side
of the rack adjuster will lift off and the

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.050
whole assembly will come off of the rack.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.339
All right, let’s get these screws out of
the way.

00:00:53.339 --> 00:01:15.740
Now that we’ve removed these five screws
we’re gong to pop this cover off, put it

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.330
out of the way.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:26.660
Take the lever, slide it off of the shaft
and put it out of the way.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:38.210
We’ll lower the rack fully down, tilt it
out and it lifts off.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:47.060
To reassemble our rack adjuster we need to
locate this indentation around this portion

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.060
of the rack.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.030
Take it from the outside and there, it fits
in very snugly.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.700
All we need to do is put the cover back on
and we’re ready to reassemble it into the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.700
dishwasher.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:09.759
When reinstalling the lever make sure that
the elongated portion sits in behind or it

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.609
will not operate.

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:15.489
Make sure it’s tucked in behind here.

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.390
Now that we have the lever in place we’re
ready to put the cover back on.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:30.470
You have to depress the little leaf spring.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.459
Seems to fit tight, now we’re ready to put
the screws on the back side.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.519
We just need to put our 5 screws back in the
assembly.

00:02:39.519 --> 00:03:11.290
Tighten them all firmly.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.819
Check the operation.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.689
Perfect!

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.810
It’s ready to put back in the dishwasher.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.150
All right, looks as good as new.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.120
Let’s reinstall the dishwasher rack.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:50.769
Guide one wheel into the rail, then the second
one.

00:03:50.769 --> 00:04:09.180
Line them all up, replace our clips on the
ends of the rails.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.449
Just like new.
