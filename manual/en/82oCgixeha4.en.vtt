00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:07.680
Now I'm going to talk about potting larger
plants. Now a larger plant is going to be

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.040
heavier to lift, it's going to be more difficult
to maneuver, but, there also are some great

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.880
benefits to dealing with larger plants. Larger
plants are more valuable, and they're more

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.899
dramatic focal points. When I put this 5 gallon
golden bamboo into this larger pot, I'm going

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:36.780
to create a much nicer, more beautiful, and
more valuable plant. Now my main advice I

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.380
have about these larger plants is, if at all
possible don't work by yourself. Get somebody

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.910
to help you. Maybe even two or three people
depending on the size of the plant and the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:57.440
size of the container. Now, when you're dealing
with a larger plant, also it may be a lot

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.460
more difficult to get out of the pot. So,
with a plastic pot like this, you can take

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:11.200
some pruners and just cut the pot open, and
break the pot open. Or if it's terracotta

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.329
or ceramic, use a hammer and smash the pot
open. Then you can just take the plant and

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:24.939
place it into it's new container. Add more
soil, and then, then technique is pretty much

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:37.079
the same for finishing up. So, just as a little
demonstration here. Look how, when I add this

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.530
bamboo plant into this pot, look how nice
it looks. And you're going to have a more

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.619
valuable plant. And also a great benefit is
that this nice big plant is going to grow

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.560
even bigger and even healthier. And then,
you're going to end up with a more valuable

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.490
plant. So, don't be afraid to pot a larger
plant. It is way more rewarding, and then

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.340
you'll have a beautiful, dramatic focal point
for everyone to enjoy.
