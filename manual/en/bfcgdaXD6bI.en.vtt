plans that would normally happens if you strike
it rich if you have an extremely successful

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.099

take care of their family a lot of people
you know

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.460
are feared the first and they do when they
signed a contract is that by a house for their

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.520
mother their bodies and they're going to buy
a house for them other than that long

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.770
that i had another house and i think me like
you know how you take care of your the people

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.830
but then there's also the stereotype of people
crawling out of the woodwork relatives coming

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.890
out uh...

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.310
canopy for the action

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.610

raised you know

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.649
yelsin spends a thousand dollars a month on
cable and satellite television that's understandable

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.070

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.340
service

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.979
and are any of those and we think that he's
for

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:16.419
he also loses two hundred seven thousand dollars
a month because they garnish his wages but

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:20.969
you won't elaborate on why his wages are correct

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.099
and that some sort of tax issue you might
guess

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.049

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.279
three hundred fifty thousand dollars a year
