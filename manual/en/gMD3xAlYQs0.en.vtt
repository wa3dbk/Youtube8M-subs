JSmooth: My name is JSmooth.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.580
Mayuko: And my name is Mayuko Kitayama

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.140
My mom told me that I used to dance when
I was little but I don't remember. When I

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.429
was in high school I started dancing.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.970
JSmooth: I was always dancing, but after high
school I started taking it more seriously.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.280
I mean I practiced every single day of my
life. Like non stop. I locked myself in the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.980
garage and like kept going, kept going, and kept
going. Cause I wanted to be like my inspirations.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.890
Luckily as soon as I moved out here, I had
an audition for Gwen Stefani and I started

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.960
working right away.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.780
Jon Chu found me from the internet actually,
and he contacted my directly. And you know

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.610
being able to do the Step Up 3 was amazing.
Like, that was really my first really huge

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.590
big thing and it was just really a blessing.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.140
Cause I saw the Step Up 3 after we got together
and I was like "THAT WAS YOU!" We've been

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.310
friends for seven, eight years?

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.170
JSmooth: Ya

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.170
The whole time and we never really talked
that much at all until last year.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.549
JSmooth: Not only are we dancing together
today, doing this duet, but we are actually

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.549
a real couple. Engaged.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.950
Mayuko: Engaged.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.929
JSmooth: When we're dancing together, if she's
not feeling good I'll be like, "Come on lets

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.079
go. Like, keep going. Come on, push it out."

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.880
Every time we try to like use part of each 
other and push up, like each otherup and-

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.159
JSmooth: Give each other good energy.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.310
Mayuko: We always practice together so we
wanted to like do something like this one

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.209
day. And finally its happening. We were so
excited.

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:01.419
JSmooth: We always wanna work together so
we were really happy about this opportunity.
