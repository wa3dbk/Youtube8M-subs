00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.290
How to Host a Proper High Tea.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.380
Technically, high tea in the U.K. includes
cooked meats and salad.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.920
But in the U.S., it has become synonymous
with an afternoon of sweet treats and delicate

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.920
sandwiches.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.300
You will need A cloth tablecloth Cloth napkins
Silverware Teacups, saucers, and small plates

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.750
A selection of loose-leaf tea Teapots Tea
infusers Scones and pastries Finger sandwiches

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.460
Platters or tiered serving trays Tongs Jam
and clotted cream A tea kettle A tea strainer

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.150
Milk, lemon, and sugar and creme fraiche.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.190
Step 1.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.580
Invite guests to come by between 3 and 5 p.m.
Afternoon tea is meant to tide people over

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.950
from lunch to dinner.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.950
Step 2.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.890
Put out a cloth tablecloth, cloth napkins,
and your best utensils.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.739
Provide each guest with a teacup and saucer,
and a small plate.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.739
Give each guest two spoons: one for their
tea and one for their clotted cream and jam.

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:04.739
Step 3.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.550
Offer a variety of loose-leaf teas; tea bags
are a no-no.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.850
Either limit your selection to the number
of teapots you have, or provide each guest

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.090
with a tea infuser that allows them to steep
tea in their own cups.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.090
Step 4.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.350
Prepare a menu that includes small scones,
miniature pastries, like petits fours, and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.670
finger sandwiches – egg or chicken salad,
cucumber, watercress, and smoked salmon with

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.070
cream cheese are all traditional fillings.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.620
Cut them into quarters, and remove the crusts.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.620
Step 5.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.810
Place the sweets and sandwiches on separate
platters or tiered serving trays and allow

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.240
guests to serve themselves with tongs.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.370
Place pots of jam and clotted cream on the
table for the scones.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.010
If you can't find clotted cream in your market,
substitute creme fraiche.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.010
Step 6.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.140
Put the loose tea into the empty teapots.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.210
A good general rule is one teaspoon for every
cup of water.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.210
Step 7.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.370
Just before the water boils, add it to the
teapots.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.689
Cover and let steep for two to four minutes.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.100
Stir the leaves lightly a couple of times
while they're brewing.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.560
The tea will brew more evenly this way.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560
Step 8.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.950
Place a tea strainer across each teacup before
pouring to catch the tea leaves.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.480
Offer guests sugar, lemon, or milk – but
not cream.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.499
Step 9.

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:21.189
Sit back, relax, and linger over good conversation.

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.219
High tea is meant to be savored.

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:28.799
Did you know The tradition of afternoon tea
was conceived in the 1800s by Anna Maria,

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.249
the duchess of Bedford, who complained she
got hungry between lunch and dinner.
