00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.600
-Hey, everyone.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.790
I'm Mindy from "Cute
Girls Hairstyles."

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.955
And today, we are going to
film a "Hunger Games"-inspired

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:12.455
tutorial.

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:15.840
And we're going to call it
the Primrose Everdeen braids.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.576
So in District 12, they
wear a lot of brains

00:00:18.576 --> 00:00:19.700
and a lot of French braids.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.080
And if you've seen the
trailers like I have,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.080
Prim has some really cute,
basic French braids in.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.950
So we're going to show
you how to do those today.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.870
OK, I'm just going
to take-- well,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.636
I've divided her
hair in half-- just

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:34.110
so you know-- to begin with.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.620
And I'm just going to start
by taking a little piece right

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.830
here.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.560
And I'm going to just start a
regular any French braid, just

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.951
your basic French braid.

00:00:47.951 --> 00:00:49.950
And then you're going to
pick up hair and add it

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.230
in to that top piece.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.140
And you're going to braid it in.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.820
Now I have a basic hair
braiding tutorial for this braid

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.900
if you don't already
know how to French braid.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.400
The difference that I can
see between the French braids

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.560
that I've done before and the
Prim one is that they keep

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.240
it super close to her hairline
and as tight to her ear

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.760
is they can so that
the braids show really

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.980
well from the front shot of her
face, which makes them really

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.830
cute because they pop out a
little more than a French braid

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.810
that might go like
this down her head.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.680
So as you can see, when I'm
doing the stranding of the hair

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.160
you can see there's quite
a drop into the braid

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.980
and very little on
this bottom side.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.900
And I'm just going to continue
add in hair and braid.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.450
And continue just remembering
to stay as close to the hairline

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.120
as you can.

00:01:55.424 --> 00:01:57.090
I"m going to turn you
just a little bit.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.130
I loved all the braids
and stuff for District 12.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.400
They were very fun.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.740
OK.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.184
So when you get to the end,
now her braids hung in front.

00:02:18.184 --> 00:02:20.100
So I'm going to shift
her just a little bit so

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.433
that the braids will drop
towards the front of her face.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.140
And on Prim, because
they live in District 12

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.330
where they work outside
a lot and stuff,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.220
her hair was a little looser and
had little wispies coming out.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.390
So I've done her hair
completely dry today.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.016
And it will look very
similar after a day

00:02:45.016 --> 00:02:48.540
of running around at school.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.070
I'm just going to secure
the end with an elastic

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.640
and let it fall to the front.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.280
And there you can see-- one
hair I left out of there.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.470
You can see that
from the front shot,

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.600
it shows very cute right
here and right here

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.770
because they're so
close to the ears.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.810
And from the back, you
can see that there's

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.110
quite a bit of a
drop into the braids

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.365
where normally if I were
just going to French braid

00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:20.970
down the head, I would literally
go straight down like this.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.180
And the braids would
be falling back behind,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.340
not over the shoulder.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.750
So there you go.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.280
Primrose Everdeen braids.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.250
Hope you enjoy and
we'll see you later.
