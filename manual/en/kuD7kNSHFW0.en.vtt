00:00:00.403 --> 00:00:02.592
(playful music)

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:07.820
- Hi everyone. Thank you
so much for tuning into

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.178
Cook with April.

00:00:09.178 --> 00:00:11.081
Today, we're gonna make rosemary bread.

00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:13.682
I make it with a bread
maker, stay tuned and you can

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:16.092
learn how to make your
very own rosemary bread.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.851
First, start off by adding
one and a half cups of water.

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:28.083
Then, add four tablespoons of olive oil.

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.173
Next, add one and a
half teaspoons of salt.

00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:41.695
Add four cups of white bread flour,

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:44.713
then add two table
spoons of dried rosemary

00:00:44.713 --> 00:00:47.171
or even more if you like rosemary.

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:53.763
Then, add two and a
half teaspoons of yeast.

00:00:58.795 --> 00:01:01.204
Place everything in the bread maker,

00:01:01.697 --> 00:01:02.725
close it,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.136
and put it to the two pound setting,

00:01:05.136 --> 00:01:09.094
then the white bread
setting, and depending on how

00:01:09.094 --> 00:01:10.659
you like your bread,
you can either have it

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.854
light, medium, or dark crust.

00:01:12.854 --> 00:01:14.852
I like mine light so I have it on light,

00:01:14.852 --> 00:01:16.182
and then I press start.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.657
Your bread will bake for three hours

00:01:18.657 --> 00:01:20.057
and twenty five minutes.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:29.976
Okay, friends, so the bread is ready

00:01:29.976 --> 00:01:33.117
and my hubby Dustin's
here to try it as always.

00:01:33.436 --> 00:01:34.632
- Mm-mm. Alright, man.

00:01:34.632 --> 00:01:35.352
- It might be hot.

00:01:35.352 --> 00:01:36.594
- A little bit.

00:01:43.224 --> 00:01:44.855
- Oh, that is so great, honey.

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.014
- Got crumbs.

00:01:48.586 --> 00:01:50.327
- When you first started
making this rosemary bread,

00:01:50.327 --> 00:01:52.626
I didn't know what to think of it but...

00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:53.149
- Yea?

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.168
- ...ever since you've
started making this bread,

00:01:55.168 --> 00:01:57.386
it's the only bread I ask her to make.

00:01:57.386 --> 00:01:58.755
I mean, it's the only bread I wanna eat.

00:01:58.755 --> 00:02:01.886
It's so good, it's so flavorful.

00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:02.923
Thank you, honey.

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:03.564
- You're welcome!

00:02:03.854 --> 00:02:05.688
So thank you, friends,
so much for watching,

00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:07.474
and I hope you enjoyed.

00:02:07.474 --> 00:02:10.666
Please tune in next Tuesday
for another episode of

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:14.265
Tasty Tuesday, and I've got a
special bonus video this week.

00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:15.611
Stay tuned for that.

00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:17.365
Have a wonderful day. Bye.

00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:18.558
- [Dustin] Bye.
