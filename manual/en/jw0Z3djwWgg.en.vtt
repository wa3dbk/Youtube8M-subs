00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.460
one, two, three, four!

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.780
Rev up your engines!

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.340
ok, it's happened to all of us, you're

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.610
driving on the road, and all of a sudden
you smell a burning smoldering smell

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.810
coming from under the hood, now of course
there could be lots of things, but most

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.609
of the time it's oil leaking, and then
getting on the exhaust, and then make it

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.470
a little burning smell, now in this case
we'll take off the stupid beauty cover, and

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.949
we'll look at the valve cover gasket,
we'll see there's oil leaking all the

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:46.210
way under it, and when we go under the
car, we can see oils dripped the whole way

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.320
down, starting at the top dripped all the
way down, so it's time for new valve

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.670
cover gaskets, and as you can see here,
the oils got on the exhaust pipe and

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.370
of course this gets really hot when the
cars run, and then that's where most of

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.500
the smell will be coming from, now in the
case of this v6 Lexus the front valve

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.200
cover is pretty easy to get to, but,
behind the front cover gasket is the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.369
back cover gasket, inside here we got to
take the hole intake of the car off, in

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.320
order to get to it, and change that back
gasket, now the gasket kit doesn't cost

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.730
that much, but there's a lot of Labor
involved, so let's get going, first you stick a

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.470
drain pan under it, to catch anything that drips,
then we'll grab this radiator clamp and

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.450
take the hose out of the way, then we'll get
this old dish pan and stick it here, so you

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.500
can put all the nuts and bolts in and it
won't get lost, then we'll take out the

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.390
ignition coils, it just pop right off, you
got wiggle them a little, and then remove

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.420
all the bolts, that hold the valve cover in
place, now here's a trick I learned years

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.730
ago, get a pry bar, put it on the metal on
the head, and then under the valve cover

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.300
here and pry it a little, you can see the
whole thing starts coming up, they stick

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.740
on pretty stuck, and here it is,
too bad the backsides going to be a lot

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.270
harder than this easily front side, now
this Lexus gasket is great, it's got

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.680
little ribs in it, so when you put it in
place, it actually snaps and holds itself

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.299
in, so when you put it back together, you
don't need to put any glue on it, because

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.680
it'll stay on, since the ridges hold it
in the little groove, then the cover just

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.400
goes back on, give it a little push, and then
tighten the valve cover

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.349
gasket bolts, make them snug from the
middle and work your way out till you

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.700
got the outside ones tightened, and then
once you made them all snug, go back and

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.030
make sure they're good and tight, now
these valve cover bolts pretty much up

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.500
stops on them, so once they hit the metal, you
can't turn them any more, you just give them a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.829
little bit of a pull, just to make sure
it's as tight as they go, and leave it at

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.829
that, then we put all the coils back on,
and now comes the hard part, we can't

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.819
check the intake manifold and all that
crap off, to get to the back valve cover

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.310
gasket, first we'll take the airbox off,
unbolt all this and pull it out of the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.010
way,
it will come apart in pieces, and take

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.370
this off, then we'll get the airbox out of the
way, then we'll take the throttle off, you

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.659
just remove the four bolts and take that
out of the way, and on the backside

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.349
here, you'll see this little bolt, that
holds it to the engine, got take that

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.010
little block off too, or you'll never get the
top off, there's another one on the other

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.430
side we got to get off, now as long as
we're dealing with hard-to-get-to bolts,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.239
the one on the backside here is a 14
millimeter, that's almost impossible to

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.459
get to, so I've got one of these swivel
head sockets that'll help take it off,

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.510
it's invisible to see inside here, so
basically, you feeling with your fingers

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.419
get the wrench on and start
pulling, and with enough yelling and swearing and

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:53.269
cutting your hands, out it comes, the
first time I ever did one of these, I had

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.510
one hell of a time trying to figure out
where that stuff was, but with that

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.229
special wrench, I got it off and it's not
that bad, you really need to get a wrench

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:04.310
like that though, then while your in there,
you'll see there's a PCV hose, we have to

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.720
pull that out of the way, because that's
connected to the intake tube, then we

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.430
take off the wiring assembly that's in
the way the bolts, then take the bolts that hold

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.810
the intake manifold on, then we pull
the intake manifold out of the way, and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.490
we can finally access the bolts to take
the cover off, just like the front, you pry

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.260
it off, just like the other one, then we
got that off, we put the new gasket on

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.909
the other side, and if you notice, this
one is blue, because it's a special

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:38.930
silicone gasket, since that one's so hard
to get to, the replacement one is

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.330
our quality, so it won't leak is fast, then
of course, we bolt it all back on like

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.630
the other side, but I'm not going film
all that, because I already showed the front

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.919
one it, would be too boring, and it's
getting ready for a spring storm here, so

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.650
I gotta get this done before I get
rained on, and filming slows me down, so

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.430
the next time your valve covers start
leaking and you get a smoldering smell

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:08.030
inside your car, now you know how to fix
it, and remember if you've got any car

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.500
questions just visit the Scotty Kilmer
channel and I'll answer them as soon as

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.419
this Kookaburra is done laughing.
