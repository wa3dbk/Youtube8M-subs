00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.570
 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.460
 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.330
 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.570
Hi everyone. So here we are with Ryse Son of Rome, a phenomenal game

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.619
on the Xbox One. Not only does it have
some of the most amazing graphics I think I've

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.880
ever seen on a console game let alone a PC
game for that matter

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.660
but it works incredibly well. The basic
story is this.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.390
You're a Roman centurion in the Roman
legions and you've kind of risen through

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.949
the ranks

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.349
and you've been tasked to travel to
Britain to put down an uprising.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.550
But things go a little bit wrong. Now
everything is kind of done

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.430
using really a button combo mechanic, as it were. You have

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.740
X&amp;Y which are your primary attacks. You
also have A which is deflection

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.850
and you'll have to watch and time what's
going on on the screen because

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.110
you get surrounded and you'll have to deflect those blows.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.390
Now they have these incredible kill
moments

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.780
where you have to execute a series of moves
effectively

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.860
to get yourself a bonus. Now these
bonuses are

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.210
things like more health, more attack
damage and

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.950
a focus meter. Now your focus meter allows you to kind of go into a

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.359
almost bullet time mode where you move
faster than the people attacking you

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:14.920
allowing you to put down a flurry of blows
on to your enemy and then execute

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.340
a series of execution moves as it were

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.640
all at once and it works incredibly well. There's these great cinematic moments

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.670
throughout the game

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.819
where you just kind of feel you're right  there in

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:30.939
this Roman legion especially when you're
having to shout to your Kinnect to you know launch

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:31.850
catapults or

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.799
launch arrows etcetera. It becomes a
really immersive experience. This is one of those

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.149
games that really kind of shows off what a
Kinnect integration

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.630
could be like if more developers really
put the time into thinking about

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.210
what Kinnect means to a game. And,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.959
like I say, it is one of the most beautiful
looking games I think I've ever played.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:56.030
Using the CryEngine 3 and I must say
it's going to give

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.450
Unreal engine a run for its money this
year I think

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.450
or certainly over this generation.
Everything about this game

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.959
screams quality and while some reviewers
have said it's a bit of a button basher

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.030
I don't really see that. I found it to be an
incredibly engaging and fun experience

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.010
throughout

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.209
and at no point did I kind of feel bored by it.
It's just too well done to get bored of.

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.379
It really is great. So this Christmas
check out Ryse Son of Rome would be my

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.530
personal opinion.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.950
 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.080
