00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:13.514
I've always had a problem with my heart.
It didn't stop me doing anything but in

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:16.808
unusual rhythm.
That was something I've had all my life.

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.985
I was asymptomatic.
I had no problems whatsoever.

00:00:20.147 --> 00:00:22.940
I felt fine.
I managed to give myself of hernia in

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:27.489
December of 2011.
My primary care physician said, well,

00:00:27.613 --> 00:00:32.160
you have a mitral valve prolapsed, so I'd like
you to have an echocardiogram done before

00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:38.040
you have the operation.
And I was thinking, no, I'm not gonna

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:40.669
have one done, it's not necessary,
it's a benign condition.

00:00:40.828 --> 00:00:46.299
But afterwards I went to the lab, I had
the echocardiogram done and two days later

00:00:46.424 --> 00:00:50.306
they called me up and told me I need
to see a cardiologist urgently.

00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:55.685
The mitral valve has two flaps, which [inaudible].
One of them just simply wasn't working.

00:00:55.892 --> 00:00:59.188
It was just flapping around.
My heart had enlarged.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.244
The ventricle to pump more blood through
the atrium because there was more blood in

00:01:04.358 --> 00:01:07.108
it, was enlarged and it wasn't
working properly at all.

00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:11.194
My heart was failing.
The function of mitral valve is to prevent

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.410
the blood leaking back when the left ventricle
is trying to pump it towards the body.

00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:21.340
You don't want it going back
into the left upper chamber.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.544
That's what the mitral valve
is designed to do.

00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:28.797
In Mr. Leitner-Wise's case his regurgitation
or the leakiness in the

00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:34.345
mitral valve had progressed over the course
of last two or three decades from

00:01:34.446 --> 00:01:40.183
trace of mild, which is negligible, most
of us have that, lived it, that's of no

00:01:40.314 --> 00:01:42.895
consequences, to moderate.

00:01:43.377 --> 00:01:48.549
And by the time he was coming in for
a surgical consultation it was severe.

00:01:48.923 --> 00:01:53.346
I have friends who are surgeons, so the
first thing I did was contact them and say

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:58.492
do you know surgeons who specialize in this.
And it so happened that one of the

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.081
surgeons was located in the hospital behind
her house which, really, we can

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:06.459
walk across the yard and get to it, so it
would be a logical place to have surgery.

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:13.050
The surgeon was adamant that he wanted to
do the traditional going through the front.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:16.929
I didn't like the idea of having my chest

00:02:17.248 --> 00:02:21.351
cracked, so I wanted to look for
some sort of alternative.

00:02:21.722 --> 00:02:26.644
Whenever a patient comes to a surgeon they
come with lot of anxiety, so minimally

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:31.901
abrasive approach that I currently adapt
is a small cut on the right side of the

00:02:32.043 --> 00:02:38.319
chest which measures about anywhere
between three to five centimeters.

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:42.245
There is no bone cutting as compared
to the conventional approach.

00:02:42.415 --> 00:02:45.625
The pain is much that less.
The recovery is that much quicker.

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.128
So when they hear all these, a lot of
that anxiety starts coming down.

00:02:53.617 --> 00:02:58.542
The studio we're in is actually my wife's
Yoga studio and she found this wonderful

00:02:58.724 --> 00:03:02.431
location on April of this year, coincidently,
the same month I have heart surgery.

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:09.313
I've had echocardiogram carried out since
surgery which has confirmed the repair is perfect.

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:13.274
There's no mitral valve leakage at all.
There's no regurgitation.

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:17.495
These are all the good things you want to hear.
Long term I just have to have an

00:03:17.573 --> 00:03:19.489
echocardiogram done once a year.

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.587
The key is to get to is to a team that
can promise a very high chance, preferably

00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:31.792
a 99 plus percent chance of a successful
repair because that is what makes impact

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.089
on the durability and the quality of
your life that you're asking for.

00:03:37.534 --> 00:03:44.350
At every stage I had the backup of Johns
Hopkins behind me, so I kind of wasn't on

00:03:44.473 --> 00:03:48.149
my own, so to speak.
My family, we weren't on our own.

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:51.605
I'm very pleased to be in the
position I'm in today.

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:54.190
I'm kind of lucky in that respect.
