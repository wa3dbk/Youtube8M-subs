00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.365
It makes a difference. It really makes a difference. People's lives are changing.

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:09.073
He really inspired me to just really say 'yo, I can actually do this.'

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.044
Wow, there's all these people in my community 
 trying to build it up, you know.

00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:25.883
I really love the sense of community that has, that is, 
 I really think unique to a program like this.

00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:32.155
You know, the fact we're all single mothers with our children, 
 and we're all in some phase of the program.

00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:36.097
The ability to go to school, for me, is 
 one of the largest pieces of this program.

00:00:36.097 --> 00:00:40.364
And the financial assistance that comes with that, and the freedom 
 that comes with being able to be a student

00:00:40.364 --> 00:00:42.924
that otherwise I don't know would be at my disposal.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.007
Because we offer affordable housing, we offer daycare very close by,

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:55.718
we pay for tuition for college, as well as books, 
 provide them with all kinds of counseling support.

00:00:55.718 --> 00:01:00.060
The women are really given an opportunity to change the direction of their life.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.771
And what Homeward Bound accomplishes through all the supports that 
 it provides is the opportunity for the women

00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:14.340
to really move from poverty to sustainable, independent, economic autonomy.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.737
It's the bouncing ideas off of the other women, it's the 'hey, can 
 you get my, can I leave Rose with you in the morning?'

00:01:20.737 --> 00:01:22.806
You know, I have to have a 7 a.m. class and vice versa.

00:01:22.806 --> 00:01:27.778
It's the helping of one another that, I think you 
 could create that network for yourself,  but, but

00:01:27.778 --> 00:01:32.382
that it's already here and it's so implemented for 
 you, it's so easy to utilize it.

00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:35.029
Donors are essential for the success of Homeward Bound.

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:40.620
The women who complete and are successful, the 
 vast majority of them gain sustainable employment.

00:01:40.624 --> 00:01:48.520
They are able to convey to their children 
 the importance of sustaining education, sustaining direction,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.000
sustaining commitment in a way that they would have otherwise not been 
 able to do had they not participated in the program.

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:58.040
Like you educate a woman and then she educates her children, ideally right?

00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:01.080
And the idea that's happened, that's really happening here, and I see it.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.550
It just couldn't be done without the financial support and it makes a difference.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.790
It really makes a difference. People's lives are changing.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.890
I didn't believe that school could help me in 
 any sort of way, cus I thought,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.470
I just gonna be broke and in debt for the rest of my life.

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:28.740
And I saw Arnold, you know, and that's when I was 
 like, he really inspired me to just really say,

00:02:28.737 --> 00:02:29.970
'yo, I can actually do this.'

00:02:29.973 --> 00:02:36.950
The JVS YouthReach program, we deliver services for youth ages 15 
 to 30 who have had conflict with the law.

00:02:36.947 --> 00:02:41.020
The major barrier for them is their confidence levels might not be that high.

00:02:41.018 --> 00:02:46.870
So really what we have to do is build their confidence from 
 scratch and help them so that they feel like they're equal,

00:02:46.872 --> 00:02:49.690
and that they're equal in society, and that they have a place.

00:02:49.693 --> 00:02:54.840
When Arnold like helped me on my resume, it really 
 looked professional when I gave it to the people,

00:02:54.836 --> 00:02:57.770
and I presented myself professional as well.

00:02:57.768 --> 00:03:01.040
And I think that those two in two helped me get the job.

00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:05.610
When you find one youth work, they tell their 
 friends, and then their friends tell their friends.

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.120
They always have a connection with us and they always have our contact,

00:03:08.118 --> 00:03:12.270
and we always do follow-up calls, so we make 
 sure that they know that we're still there.

00:03:12.274 --> 00:03:14.460
It doesn't just end at their getting work.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.020
Now that I'm at Centennial College, and I'm taking business entrepreneurship,

00:03:19.022 --> 00:03:22.530
generally what I'm learning right now is you need to prioritize.

00:03:22.526 --> 00:03:26.430
And if you can prioritize, and you can be 
 organized and you can manage your time,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.370
you can get to anywhere you want to go.

00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:31.740
Well, long term, it definitely influences other youth coming up.

00:03:31.735 --> 00:03:34.870
So now when you have a 19- or 20-year-old youth, he becomes a mentor.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.410
A lot of these youth, they don't have mentors, 
 they don't have people to look up to.

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.030
They don't even know what the positive side looks like.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.310
YouthReach delivers a service to let them know that these barriers can be overcome.

00:03:47.306 --> 00:03:54.610
So without programs like this, without donors, I don't know where 
 people would be, and people like myself would be.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.390
When I was here as a participant, it meant a lot 
 that it was getting the support from the staff,

00:04:05.391 --> 00:04:07.860
from the community members, from the volunteers and everyone,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.730
because  it feels like, you know, somebody cares, 
 someone hears your voice, someone values your opinion.

00:04:13.733 --> 00:04:18.650
I think supporting each individual in the community is 
 a huge thing that the Hub is doing.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:21.970
We made the residents take the leadership and doing the programs.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.860
When they want to refer or connect with the officials, 
 or the government, or to apply for funding,

00:04:28.862 --> 00:04:31.040
that's where we give them the support.

00:04:31.035 --> 00:04:37.280
What I enjoyed about being a volunteer placement at the Hub was that 
 I really got to connect with the people in my community

00:04:37.275 --> 00:04:38.710
because I am a local resident.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.880
So, when I came here, one of the things that I started 
 instantly was a computer program that I developed, an eight-week program.

00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:50.710
Initially it started with maybe five people, and at 
 the end there was a waiting list.

00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:56.260
The volunteers are able to come and run the program 
 and support us in reaching our goal here.

00:04:56.261 --> 00:05:00.280
They have great skills, they have great knowledge, but to put it into practice?

00:05:00.278 --> 00:05:02.620
This is a great place for them to do that.

00:05:02.624 --> 00:05:08.110
I've seen people that I didn't initially meet, who were 
 very shy and reserved, but I see the confidence,

00:05:08.106 --> 00:05:12.310
you know, growing and building, and it's because 
 they are coming here for these services.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.110
It really strikes you, you know, you're like 'wow, there are all these 
 people in my community trying to build it up,' you know.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.360
I would say this wouldn't have been possible without 
 the support we got from the donors.

00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:29.190
There would be no connection. There would be no like, friends meeting each other,

00:05:29.194 --> 00:05:31.830
neighbours meeting each other, getting to know your community.

00:05:31.834 --> 00:05:34.030
That wouldn't have been possible.

00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:36.500
Thank you for your support.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:37.710
Thank you.

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:39.060
Thank you.
