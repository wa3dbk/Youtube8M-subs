00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Goodmorning by Italiancakes

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.000
Today we make

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.000
 a royal icing roses

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We use flower nail tool

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Fix a baking paper over flower nail

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
With tip n.12 we realize a little mushroom

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
on which we will achieve our petals

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
With tip n.124 we realize a bud

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.000
and a first ring of petals 3-4

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
followed by a second ring of 5 petals

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
In this way we are going to realize our rose

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Let dry on baking paper 24/48 hours

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We can complete the rose add leaves

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
From any royal icing recipe

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.000
we have to find the right consistency

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
depending on the type of decoration to be realized

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
In this case we have added a few drops of water

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.000
to have a more fluid royal icing (for leaves)

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Drying time always 24/48 hours

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We can make other stylized roses

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that we can apply to the edges of our cakes

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So a first, a second and a third rose

00:02:43.000 --> 00:03:02.000
With the nozzle n.2 we finish the roses with green icing

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Let dry 24/48 hours after which

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.500
we can remove the roses from the baking paper

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.500
and apply directly on our cake

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.000
