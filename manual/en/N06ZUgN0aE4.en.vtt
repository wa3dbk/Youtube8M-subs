Hey, it's Mike from SWISCO.com

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.453
And today, I'm going to show you how to install a surface mounted tilt latch

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.080
in place of an internal tilt latch.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.460
In this exercise, I'll be working with the SWISCO 26-228 and 26-229 Surface Mounted Tilt Latches.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.240
The tools I'll be using are a hacksaw, power drill, and Philips-head screwdriver.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.040
The reason we're using a surface mounted tilt latch in place of an internal tilt latch

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.520
is because the old latches are damaged, and replacements are no longer available.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.300
Instead of searching around for replacements, which can be difficult, it's much easier to find a pair of surface mounted latches.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:50.700
So, what we recommend in this case, is to leave the broken latch (or latches) as is, and use a hacksaw to remove any remaining "teeth"

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.280
Leaving the internal latches in the sash will not affect the operation of the window.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.860
Once you've done that, find a pair of surface mounted tilt latches that have an equal or less width measurement as your sash.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.240
Place your new surface mounted tilt latch on the sash, mark your screw holes, and then drill your new screw holes.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.120
It is important to drill only through the first layer of vinyl, and be careful not to hit the glass.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.640
