00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.549
So you've book your holiday

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.420
You know you're gonna go,

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.600
you're dreading there isn't horrible building work going on next door

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.070
a bit like where were filming right now

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:19.950
but the key question everyone asks me
what is the cheapest way to spend when I go?

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.570
my first option

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.890
And the best option of the lot is to get yourself a specialist overseas credit card

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.380
Let me explain first of all how all plastic works when you're overseas, whether its debit or credit.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.269
you spend on it and and they add a hidden load

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.869
usually at 3%, the exchange rate they get.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.500
So that means if you spend 100 Pounds worth of Euros

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.580
you'll be charged 103 Pounds

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.120
And it gets worse to in some cases

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.120
You'll be charged for withdrawing cash,

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.899
on credit cards you'll pay interest even if you clear the card in full on those cash withdraws.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.020
And on some, what I call the "Debit Cards From Hell"

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.180
Lloyds, Natwest, Santander, RBS, Halifax, 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.619
they charge you an additional fee every
time you spend.

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.099
Up to one pound fifty.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.780
But the Savior here is the specialist credit cards,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.740
because they on load free worldwide

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.280
and there's a range of them,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.700
So that means you spend 100 Pounds worth of Euros and it costs you 100 Pounds

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.560
Now they will still have ATM charges of various amounts

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.040
although they tend to be lower

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.880
which means you're better to spend on
the card than to withdraw cash and to spend that 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.980
but overall this is the cheapest way to spend.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.340
it works in every country, your getting
perfect rates everywhere.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.160
Of course you need to set up a direct
debit to repay the card

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.460
IN FULL!

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.520
every month or you're going to be charged interest which makes it not worth it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.260
But in general that's the cheapest way
to go. I know some of you out there will be going 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.339
"Aren't there any debit cards that do this?"

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.120
Well the only one remaining as I film is the Norwich and Peterborough current account.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.800
But do you really want to switch your current account just to get cheap spending abroad?

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.020
There are many better perks on current accounts 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.829
and you can just apply for a credit
card anytime willy nilly

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.200
and do what I do. I have an overseas wallet, it sits in there

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.950
I never spend on it in the UK because it
doesn't give me any advantage here

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.700
but when I go away, Wey Hey HEY!!!! 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.970
Tip two, if you actually want a bit of cash
in your pocket how do you get it?

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.850
The worst thing to do, the great sin when it comes to money overseas

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.620
is to get your money at the airport.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.660
they know you're captive customer they give you worse rates

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.440
if you've left it that late and you do need to get your foreign exchange from the airport

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.710
at the very least pre order it for airport pick up and you get a better rate.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.150
But the best thing to do is compare!

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.190
Ignore spiel like commission-free because often commission-free yes, but worst exchange rates.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.000
You just simply want to know, I want to change 500 Pounds to Euros

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.080
how many Euros will you give me after all charges, and compare like that.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.810
You can do this online in seconds, comparing online bureau at 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.640
TravelMoneyMax.com

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.100
when you go abroad you use your card in a bank or in a shop and it offers to let you pay in pounds 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.020
rather than in Euros or Dollars

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.790
the simple rule of thumb is always pay in the local currency

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.690
that way your card is doing the
conversion rather than the shop or the bank

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.360
because generally when you allow
the shop or the bank's convert

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.790
you get a very very poor rate.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.080
This is especially true if you've got one of those specialist credit cards I mentioned earlier.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.900
The're giving you perfect rates,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.120
guaranteed the Overseas Bank or shop is not giving you a perfect rate

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.739
So if you choose to Press pay in pounds

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.579
it's doing the conversion for you, you're losing out.
