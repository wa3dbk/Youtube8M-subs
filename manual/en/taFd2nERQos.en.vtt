TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN THE

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
CORNERSTONE OF ADVANCEMENTS IN

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.733
EDUCATION. NOW, A ROBOT IS

((I STARTED DIGGING AROUND AND

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
SEARCHED THE INTERNET FOR

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.866
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE COULD

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
ACCOMMODATE DEVIN'S NEEDS IN

BE PART OF THE WEST SENECA

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.466
COMMUNITY AND HAVE THE

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
EXPERIENCE OF GOING TO SCHOOL.))

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
UP UNTIL NOW, THE VGO MAINLY

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.133
USED IN THE BUSINESS SECTOR, HAS

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
FOUND A

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
HOME AT WINCHESTER ELEMENTARY.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.133
((THE VGO DEVICE ITSELF CONNECTS

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
TO OUR NETWORK LIKE I MENTIONED.

DEVIN'S MOM ADVOCATED FOR HIM,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000

((HE HAS TO DO EVERY SINGLE

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
THING THAT EVERY CHILD DOES IN

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
THAT CLASSROOM. HE HAS TO

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
PARTICIPATE, HE HAS TO TAKE

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
TESTS, HE HAS TO DO THEIR

HOMEWORK.)) NOT ONLY IS THE VGO

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.600
MAKING DEVIN'S EDUCATION

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
POSSIBLE. MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.333
PROVIDING FOR SOCIAL

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
INTERACTION.

((THEY TREAT HIM JUST LIKE

ANYONE ELSE, THEY HAVE

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM DURING

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
RECESS. THEY TALK ABOUT JOKES,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
THEY TALK

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.133
ABOUT SNACKS AND FOOD.)) IN SOME

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
RESPECTS, IT HAS EVEN INFLUENCED

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.666
HIS CLASSMATES AT SCHOOL.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
((IT MAKES THEM MORE AWARE OF

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
THE DIFFERENCES IN THE WORLD AND

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
THAT PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT, BUT

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS WHAT'S ON

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
THE INSIDE.)) THE VGO MAY BE

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
GREAT, BUT THERE'S

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
ONE LAST PART OF THE PUZZLE THAT

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
MAKES THIS ALL POSSIBLE FOR

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.533
DEVIN, HIS BIG BROTHER.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
((IN THE MORNING, WHEN I'M DONE

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
PACKING MY STUFF, I TAKE HIS

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.400
STUFF AND I GO TO HIS
