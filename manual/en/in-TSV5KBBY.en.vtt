00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Norvig] I think it's a good time to return to hand&lt;u&gt;rank,&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the most complicated function we'll have to deal with.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We know hand&lt;u&gt;rank takes a hand as input, but what does it return?&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We want it to return a value indicating the ranking of a hand,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but we're not quite sure what that value should be.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It has to be something that's comparable by max,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so, well, why not a number?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There are 9 different types of hands that we know about,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
from straight flush at the top to high card at the bottom,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and we can number them from, say, 0 to 8,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
with 8 being the highest for the straight flush.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So here's a sketch of a solution.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We know it's going to be important to look at ranks, so let's get them first.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We can extract the ranks with our card&lt;u&gt;ranks function,&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and then we can say first we want to check and see if we have a straight flush.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So if the ranks form a straight and the cards form a flush,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
then we can return 8, the highest value.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Otherwise what's next?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Four of a kind.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And the only thing we need in kind is the rank, so I'm going to just pass that in.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
If the ranks form 4 of a kind, then return 7.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And we could go on from there.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I go through the cases 1 by 1.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We have straight flush, we have 4 of a kind,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
we would next go to full house and then flush and so on.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The question is, would this work?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
If we continued to flesh this out and we defined the 9 different cases

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to return the numbers from 0 to 8, would that give us a definition of hand&lt;u&gt;rank&lt;/u&gt;

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that's a working program?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And I want you to tell me yes, it would work fine in all cases;

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
no, it would signal an error condition and crash the program;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
no, it would get some inputs wrong and some of them right;

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
or no, it would get all the inputs wrong.

00:02:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Which do you think is correct?
