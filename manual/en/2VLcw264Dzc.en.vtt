00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:18.000
Lord Hedgehog

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:27.625
Silent Night

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.790
Drinking in public?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.540
We'll have to give you a ticket!

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.120
But we have permission!

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.708
As most humble servants, Pilate gave
permission to her and to her.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.790
Oh, you have permission
from Pontius Pilate.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.040
I see, in that case...carry on!

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:15.710
Who is it?!?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.420
Open the door!!!

00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:20.120
We're looking for Hedgehog Nazarenian!!!

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:23.420
There was no permission!

00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:25.875
Liar liar pants on fire!

00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:29.420
Even though he doesn't wear any pants,
we still have a warrant for his arrest!!

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.120
Holy shit!

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.420
There's no one here by that name!

00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:36.500
In the name of Caesar open this door!!

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.460
Or else, I'll let Ave kick out the door
and talk to you in his own way!!!

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.380
We'll figure something out...

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.666
He's not here.

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:27.380
Boys! We're moving out!

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.080
Well, that was close. I'm sure they're
gonna come back when the spring comes.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.580
Yes, random sobriety checkpoints...

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.080
Oh shit! They're back!

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.460
Oh please, not these guys again!

00:03:08.461 --> 00:03:12.160
...and I was hoping for a nice silent night...

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:33.833
AMEN
