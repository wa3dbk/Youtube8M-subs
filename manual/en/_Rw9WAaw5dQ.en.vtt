00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.600
Microsoft's Windows 7, is finally upon us. And here's the big question we are faced with.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.600
Will it fare better than Vista, will it be even better than the popular Windows XP.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.500
We take a look at Windows' lucky number 7, and its rival, the Mac's Snow Leopard.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.200
To see if the new Windows Operating System has what it takes to make you go weak...

00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:35.450
in your knees, and whether the Snow Leopard, will be growling in jealousy.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.600
With its very own set of features.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.200
Right, so today in ViewPoint, we're going to be talking to two executives associated...

00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:46.300
with Windows 7 and Snow Leopard, to find out more about their respective Operating Systems.

00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:50.250
We've got the questions, and we're going to get the answers starting right now.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.200
So welcome Matt, to ViewPoint.

00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:03.100
Thank you.

00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:05.600
So why don't you tell the viewers, what you do here at Microsoft?

00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:10.200
Okay, my job at Microsoft is essentially the Windows Client Business Group lead,

00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:14.100
so that means I look after product marketing and the revenue sales of Windows.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.200
Hi Darren, welcome to ViewPoint.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.200
Thank you for having me, and welcome to Apple.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.001
Thank you, it's very nice.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.200
Tell the viewers out there, what you do here at Apple?

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.250
Well, my name is Darren, and I am a senior manager with Apple in Asia.

00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:44.500
I help manage products, like for example Mac OS 10, and other software products within Apple.

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:47.200
So we are going to kick it off.

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:53.300
In your opinion, why wasn't Vista well received by consumers and critics alike?

00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:58.200
I think Vista was a situation where we had a product that...

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:01.150
we really wanted to go out there into the public's and

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.600
unfortunately, a lot of the situation were where software vendors weren't ready,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.200
our hardware partners weren't ready, and I think partially that's our own fault.

00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:11.100
We probably did not educate them enough.

00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:13.200
I think with Windows 7, you will see us turning that around.

00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:16.200
From the product inception and planning phase

00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:18.100
we've actually had the hardware partners with us.

00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:20.500
We actually had the software developers with us all the way through.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.200
So as the product itself has evolved, they've been able to take those innovations

00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:28.300
and put them into their own products, so they can benefit from the overall OS.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.500
So it's been good with Windows 7, so far?

00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:33.300
It's been extremely positive, people are very excited about it

00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:36.001
the hardware partners are excited, the software partners are very excited.

00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:37.002
All right, great.

00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:42.300
Okay, so Darren, a recent study showed that 18 percent of users upgraded to Snow Leopard.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.200
Do you think this is because it's a minor upgrade? Why do you think users are not biting?

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:56.000
Well we don't have any specific numbers to share, but Snow Leopard is a major upgrade to Mac OS 10.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.200
We have re-written 90% of the previous version, and what users can expect is a much

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:06.300
faster, more secure, and more intuitive Mac.

00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:11.201
So Matt,  what are the new features in Windows 7 that are going to make consumers go WOW!

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.002
I think there is a number of different things that we have done to make the consumer excited.

00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:21.200
We sort of look at making everyday tasks easier, making it less interuptive

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.300
and also making new things possible.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.300
I think users will be uniquely excited about the things we do with the windows itself

00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:30.300
being able to go ahead and dock windows into the sides of the screen.

00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:34.200
To integrate in human gestures support.

00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:38.100
Things like shaking the actual applications, and seeing how it manages.

00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:42.200
And then we move into some of the more advanced features, such as "Play To" for example.

00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:47.400
Connecting your digital home environment, remote streaming of digital media, from one PC to the other.

00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:51.401
And also things like "Windows Touch" for example, really lets you interact with your PC

00:03:51.402 --> 00:03:55.200
through actual, physical contact with the screen.

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:57.200
That's really inspiring for the users.

00:03:57.201 --> 00:04:01.300
Some of our viewers have commented that the Windows Taskbar looks like the Dock

00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:05.400
and Expose looks like Aero Peek, what are your comments on that?

00:04:05.401 --> 00:04:09.200
I think when we focus on the Taskbar itself, this isn't something that we've looked

00:04:09.201 --> 00:04:11.500
at and say, "What are other people doing?"

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:15.400
A lot of the focus on product development have been to go ahead and understand

00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:18.000
how consumers actually use a product.

00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:22.250
To work out where they spend their time, and try to identify areas of optimization

00:04:22.251 --> 00:04:23.500
that they can gain access to.

00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:28.100
And so things like the Taskbar, being able to go ahead and write that kind of application

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:32.450
to instantly see the relevant documents that interact with an application through one click.

00:04:32.451 --> 00:04:37.400
So what you see there through the Taskbar itself, is not just a visual element style.

00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:45.100
It's about I want to get access to my data faster. I right-click on it, I see the list, I engage.

00:04:54.101 --> 00:05:02.300
So Darren, Windows 7 is coming up, we've looked at the features that are similar to the Snow Leopard,

00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:05.500
such as the Expose with Aero Peek, and Dock for the Taskbar.

00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:09.300
How do your features differentiate, or compare to them?

00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:15.001
The Mac has always been different, has always been better than the Windows platform.

00:05:16.002 --> 00:05:19.400
Essentially it isn't just about the UI (user interface), you have to look at the core itself

00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:26.200
and that's where Mac OS 10 really stands out -- it's more stable and more usable as well.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.400
In fact, when our users buy a Mac, they love that experience

00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:36.200
because the hardware is very tightly intergrated with the software.

00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:40.400
And so we can really produce a much better system than anybody else can.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.500
Right, so there's a rumour going on that Windows 7 actually improves battery life on

00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:47.100
notebooks and netbooks. Have you heard anything about this?

00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:51.500
Yeah, we are actually seeing a lot of users actually experiencing, what tends to happen is because

00:05:51.501 --> 00:05:57.000
of the processing, there's actually been reduced in the optimization of the actual operating system.

00:05:57.001 --> 00:06:00.400
We are seeing it now that it's more intelligent in the way it uses the battery life.

00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:04.200
So non-essential services can be shut down, after a period of inactivity.

00:06:04.201 --> 00:06:07.001
That actually increases the battery life.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.002
Can you care to share with us more about the energy usage on Windows 7?

00:06:12.003 --> 00:06:18.003
Yeah, so what's interesting with Windows 7, after a period of inactivity, like I've said it shuts down.

00:06:18.004 --> 00:06:22.300
We've actually seen these in studies, that after 15 minutes, by default, it will actually go ahead

00:06:22.301 --> 00:06:27.400
and shut down non-essential services, like the monitor for example, and from that actual shut down

00:06:27.401 --> 00:06:33.001
we've experienced up to 40% of electricity savings on the actual machines.

00:06:33.002 --> 00:06:35.500
So it's really efficient in the way it actually handles electricity.

00:06:39.001 --> 00:06:41.300
Let's talk about power savings option and energy and all that.

00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:47.001
With Snow Leopard, do you think it plays a part in minimizing energy usage and all?

00:06:47.002 --> 00:06:56.300
Yeah, Apple has a comprehensive approach to the way we account for all the power consumption and emissions.

00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:00.001
And the majority of them come from the use of our products.

00:07:00.002 --> 00:07:08.100
So what we have done, like no other manufacturer can do is tightly integrate all the software and the hardware

00:07:08.101 --> 00:07:13.500
to really save on energy use. And there's really three ways that we can save on energy use.

00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:21.501
One, which is to really use efficient power. Use low-energy consumption components.

00:07:21.502 --> 00:07:25.500
And really, the power management features in the software.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.300
And we tightly intergrate all of those, for example your Mac OS 10, will spin down whenever possible.

00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:39.400
It will dim down the power-saving LED displays, as I've mentioned even between keystrokes

00:07:39.401 --> 00:07:46.001
we monitor all the processor usage. In fact if you look at the Mac Mini for example

00:07:46.002 --> 00:07:50.400
that consumes about 25% of a typical lightbulb.

00:07:50.401 --> 00:07:55.001
Which is fantastic, it's the most efficient desktop you have in the market today.

00:07:55.002 --> 00:07:59.002
So it saves on your electricity bills and all that. Yeah.

00:07:59.003 --> 00:08:03.100
So Matt, give me one word to describe your operating system. Go!

00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:05.101
Simplified!

00:08:05.102 --> 00:08:09.002
So Darren, give me one word to describe your operating system. Go!

00:08:09.003 --> 00:08:10.000
Awesome!
