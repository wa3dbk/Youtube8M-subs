00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.832
- So check this out, it's Trevor James

00:00:01.832 --> 00:00:04.414
and today I'm with a local
friend here in Chongqing.

00:00:04.414 --> 00:00:05.890
Two hours south of Chengdu.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.867
We're gonna have some sweet
potato starch noodles.

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:11.784
(speaking Chinese)

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:17.820
- Yeah, let's go check it out!

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.653
- Okay.

00:00:19.705 --> 00:00:22.288
(upbeat music)

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:26.796
(banging and singing)

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.784
- There's nothing like a bowl
of hot, slurping goodness.

00:00:42.784 --> 00:00:44.383
These sweet potato noodles are soaked

00:00:44.383 --> 00:00:46.183
and then poured into a chicken broth

00:00:46.183 --> 00:00:48.546
with 21 secret ingredients.

00:00:48.546 --> 00:00:50.756
Some pickled vegetables and soy beans,

00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:52.588
chili oil and vinegar.

00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:55.459
And then this thick sauce
with stewed beef chunks,

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:58.403
chicken stomach and ground
pork are added on top.

00:00:58.403 --> 00:00:59.486
So delicious.

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:03.235
Okay, so we have two bowls of Suan La Fen,

00:01:03.235 --> 00:01:05.955
which is like sweet potato noodles.

00:01:05.955 --> 00:01:07.501
Sweet potato starch noodles.

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.279
(mumbles)

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:11.115
So we've got the beef,
and there's actually

00:01:11.115 --> 00:01:13.171
chicken stomach in here as well.

00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:15.755
There's these soybeans.

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:17.003
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:19.188
And then there's also pickled vegetables

00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:21.771
and it's in a ton of spicy oil.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.998
It's just, the smell is just invading

00:01:24.998 --> 00:01:26.037
the nostrils here, so.

00:01:26.037 --> 00:01:29.704
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.763
It's sour and spicy.

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:44.277
And the hot chili oil
just coats your tongue

00:01:44.277 --> 00:01:45.110
and coats your mouth.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.871
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:51.494
It's sour because there's this
pickled vegetable in here.

00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:55.161
(speaking foreign language)

00:02:11.472 --> 00:02:13.315
I love this, I love this food.

00:02:13.315 --> 00:02:16.940
I love the food in China,
it just brings me joy

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.773
every day.

00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:22.926
They just, they're
really gooey and squishy

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:25.124
and your teeth just sink right into them.

00:02:25.124 --> 00:02:28.827
I can see how you could
eat this every single day.

00:02:28.827 --> 00:02:29.660
Mmm!

00:02:33.204 --> 00:02:36.353
You've really got to bite into them.

00:02:36.353 --> 00:02:40.020
(speaking foreign language)

00:02:43.287 --> 00:02:45.393
Oh, that was beautiful.

00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:46.226
Beautiful.

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.820
(speaking foreign language)

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.765
The big chunks of beef.

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:56.092
(speaking foreign language)

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:57.755
Just beautiful, just so tender.

00:02:57.755 --> 00:03:00.737
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:00.737 --> 00:03:01.823
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:01.823 --> 00:03:03.102
I've just got to say thanks so much

00:03:03.102 --> 00:03:04.439
for watching my travel videos.

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:05.272
It means a lot to me.

00:03:05.272 --> 00:03:06.829
Check back all the time,
because I've got new videos

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.218
coming up all the time.

00:03:08.218 --> 00:03:10.665
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:11.498
Let's go.

00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:16.701
(singing and banging)
