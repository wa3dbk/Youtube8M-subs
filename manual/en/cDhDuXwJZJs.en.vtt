no larae in the house as she always is

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.740
because I can't do anything without her
that's right bugs and it's Sunday you

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.700
know what that means it's species Sunday
that's right so today we're going to

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.750
take it to the next level with the
species we're going to talk about the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:27.359
Madagascar lace plant kick-ass plant um
let's see here Madagascar lace well it's

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.710
from Madagascar which if you guys know
anything about your geography is a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.180
secluded island off of the east coast of
Africa which has a bunch of weird

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.600
species of not only plants but animals
and everything of the like this plant

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.289
punjah geese in Madagascar incest as
Klaus from the aga would say this is a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.449
great plant this plant requires high
light good substrate and is not a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.090
beginner plant I'll just say that it's
not a beginner plant but really cool it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.250
does really well in this size substrate
if you can get small substrate obviously

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.280
I've never even I've never even
attempted to keep it without dirt nor

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.470
what I recommend that you do because it
needs good nutrients comes from

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.200
nutrient-rich waters and it's actually
from fast-moving streams it comes in

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.520
really fast moving streams and the
reason for that is this if it blows in

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.430
the wind or whatever
like the fast-moving stream will hold it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.610
because the fast-moving stream can go
through the holes and the plant won't

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.329
get like beat up so if you can see I'm
like messing with it but it's it doesn't

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.310
really respond to that because it's got
holes in it great plant um got another

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.079
one over here good for ain't good for
like a tank that's gonna have a little

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.899
bit of flow in it this tank actually
doesn't have that much flow but I

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.619
probably should because the babies are
getting bigger but some good plant you

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.860
can break it off at the bottom that's
how I've taken this plant into another

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.740
one solid plant gets really really big
kind of weird to aquascape whit though

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.219
because it gets so big but um you know I
really like it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.250
panja gate in madagascar iNSYS as it's a
scientifically called I believe so let

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.349
me know if anyone has any knowledge on
Madagascar lace plants and we'll do it

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.140
