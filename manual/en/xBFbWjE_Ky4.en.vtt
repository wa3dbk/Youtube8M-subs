reviewing the slotdog giving a gator-looking
hot dog like this I'll show you how.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.080
barbecuetricks.com i thought i'd do another
little product demo... i thought it was cool

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.230
i did the smoking gun about a week ago and
I got sent one of these a while back on GrateTV

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.370
we did a spiral cut hot dog and low and behold
these guys at slot dog...

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:36.430
Daniel Chrichton sent me - i guess it's his
invention - Join the hot dog revolution from

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.480
Muscoga Canada.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.480
Here's how it works.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:50.780
It's kinda like the spiral cut hot dog but
it will do it with this grid like patter which

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.190
looks like it gives it a crocodile type cut
so lets give it a go... the slot dog.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.969
I think they are twenty some bucks online.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.569
By the way a hot dog is one of my favorite
things... they're already cooked.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:16.220
They're just the best BBQ thing out there.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.630
I think next week I'll give you my top tricks
for hot dogs this may be on that list we will

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.630
see.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.130
OK so...we hit it like that and then I think
he says rock it back and forth.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.389
So it's flat on this board.

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:37.999
That's what we got.

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:41.259
lets do both sides to avoid curling.

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.909
There we go.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.459
Slot dog! it's not going anywhere.

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:52.459
It's all in one piece.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:57.200
It's probably an eighth of an inch slots in
there.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.729
So we'll throw it on the grill and char it
up a bit and see how it ends up looking.

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:13.840
Here's what you get the guys say it will hold
on to some of the condiments and toppings

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.710
- looks pretty cool - looks fun.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.290
Party conversation for sure.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.489
Thanks to the guys from Slotdog for sending
it over.

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.959
