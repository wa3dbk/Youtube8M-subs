00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.590
In this first section you'll see the camera
hard mounted to a grip.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.130
I'm actually using GoPole's "The Bobber" floating
grip.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.289
It's mounted directly to GoPro's "The Frame".

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:33.890
I'm using two hands on the grip and I'm trying
to be as smooth as possible.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.250
This section shows me using version 2 of my
DIY steadicam.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:01:00.710
I'm using two hands on it and I'm trying to
be as smooth as possible, again.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.080
Here we're back to the hard mounted grip.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.670
"The Bobber" is an excellent product, it's
just not the best product for steady shots.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.050
It's really meant for water sports.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:25.390
I'm using it here just to show you what a
hard mounted shot is without any motion dampening.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.690
Here we're back to the steadicam.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.870
It's got a much smoother and fluid, floating
feeling.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:45.070
A lot less jittery than the hard mounted grip.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:59.850
I think it's important to remember that a
steadicam is not a magic solution for smooth

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.740
shots.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.280
You still need to hold it as steady as possible
and walk smoothly.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.840
You should practice a little bit with it so
yo uknow how to use it well.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.840
And that's about it!

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.840
Thanks for watching!

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.120
