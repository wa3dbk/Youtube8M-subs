Hi everyone and thank you very much for all
your comments and questions on our Transformer

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.460
Prime video that we did yesterday for you.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.919
So we’ve got back together we’ve got your
comments here on our computer and we’ve

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.130
got the Transformer Prime for a few more hours
and what we’ve tried to do is answer some

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.590
questions for you based on things that you’ve
asked for.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.890
So the first one is the hardest one, is RcAeTnEaD
I’m going to maybe put that on screen here

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.700
you’ve asked about flash player.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.870
Now you’re right in your question here Android
as a platform does use Flash we’ve updated

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.210
Flash on this machine to Flash player 11 and
we can actually show you 720p running on that

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.370
directly from a browser so we’ll show you
that here.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.409
It looks very good very smooth as it should
be using the Tegra 3 chip.

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:06.890
Okay so the next question we’ve got is from
Markus40755 and his question was about the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.729
pinch and zoom capability and it is a good
question because the pinch and zoom and other

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.800
functions like that to do with tablets is
a combination of the software in this case

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.840
Honeycomb and the ability for the hardware
to keep up with it.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.120
I can say that on the Transformer Prime the
pinch and zoom capability is very very strong

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.340
there’s no lag very smooth it’s a good
screen anyway with the gorilla glass.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.970
I don’t have any issues being able to control
it.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.740
Now I’ve got a browser here and I’m opening
and closing my fingers and I’m getting good

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.190
quality response from an enlargement point
of view not forgetting of course when you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.540
are in things like a browser you can double
click to be able to expand a word and then

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.450
double click to bring that back down again
to see the full browser.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.600
So thanks for the question.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.660
Okay the next question we’ve got is from
527Andreas and his question was about browser

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.630
capability so right now we’re using the
built-in browser obviously there are other

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.470
browsers available like Opera that is available
through the Android market but specifically

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.010
just using the one that’s preloaded it’s
very quick to use again it’s going to be

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.940
a little bit dependent on your network to
be able to get the best performance but if

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.480
the network is optimum performance then you
will have a very good experience browsing

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.489
and again because Flash is enabled you’re
going to get all of the different websites

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.370
in their full rich content that you can get.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.499
Okay the next question we’ve got is from
MonoBawuino apologies if I got that wrong

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:39.450
your question was about your finger input
and being able to write things with your finger

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.950
and scribbling and those kinds of things.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.500
So built into the Transformer Prime there
is an app called Supernote so we just go into

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.650
that here and it’s actually a good little
piece of software because it enables you to

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.209
either scribble with your finger freehand
or you can use a keyboard to enter text.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:01.620
It does have a few different specific thicknesses
of strokes you can use that immediately show

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.659
up on the line if you want it to you can also
have baseline to help you put the strokes

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.139
where you want them to so that it looks like
it’s actually handwriting but the response

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:15.700
is again very very fast very good there’s
no lag as soon as I enter my finger and do

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.409
a letter up it comes it’s all very freehand
very very good.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.040
The next set of questions we have come from
a gentlemen called Jeremy Vidal hopefully

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.969
I’ve pronounced the surname correctly.

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:33.379
The first one is to show connection of the
actual tab itself.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.080
Does it scratch well let’s have a look.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.659
Take it off here as you can see it’s actually
quite a tight fit and it does have some rubberised

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.469
internals to make sure that it doesn’t scrape
against it because the last thing you want

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.650
is to harm some of the surfaces here.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.950
So when we put it in because we’ve got these
two slots here which allow you to show some

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.920
direction there’s no real chance of it not
getting into place right away.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.239
We’ve done that 20 times 30 times since
we got it and not once have we scratched the

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.519
machine itself.

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.080
The second question was about the charging
cable what length was it and was it of sufficient

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.389
length to be able to connect up to a powerpoint
all day every day.

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:17.980
So it’s actually just a simple USB cable
fairly long about one metre now not the length

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.000
you probably want to have it as a permanent
or replacement desktop machine but to be honest

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.190
being a tablet it’s going to be out and
about it’s going to be portable.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.310
It comes with this adapter here so the USB
goes in here and the proprietary connection

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.880
goes into the tablet.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.270
The next question is is it solid does it squeak
at all?

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.030
Well again we’ve been playing with it for
the last 24 hours almost all of the 24 hours

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.520
and you can see here that there’s no squeaking
it’s a very very solid machine because it

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:54.630
uses this metallised casing it makes it very
sturdy doesn’t creak, doesn’t squeak it’s

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.580
just a very solid, non-squeaking machine.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.280
The next question was fingerprint resistance
yeah look it’s actually very good as far

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.139
as fingerprints go I’ve got a bit of a sweaty
palm because I’m so excited about this product

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.730
but it still doesn’t leave any marks on
the surface here as you can see.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.479
It’s actually quite good at not putting
marks on the machine.

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.310
Tell us what you think we’d love to see
your comments below and we’ll answer any

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.459
questions so feel free to ask away.
