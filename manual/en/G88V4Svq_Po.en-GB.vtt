00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.180
Hello!

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.180
In this update, I would like to begin by offering thanks

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.220
for the huge amount of support
the channel has received in recent months.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.740
Every like, comment, and subscription
really does help motivate me to do more.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.740
I would also like to offer special thanks
to all of my Patreon supporters

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.660
and share with you how the money
pledged through Patreon

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.080
is directly helping to improve the channel content.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.000
As some of you may know, we smashed
the first two Patreon milestones pretty quickly,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.580
which means, I'm now committed to
producing at least one video per month.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.160
And, I've now purchased some
additional camera equipment

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.460
to improve both the quality of the videos

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.720
as well as speeding up workflow.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.300
All of the videos so far have
been shot on the Nikon D7100

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.700
with a 35mm prime lens.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.540
The new camera I'm going
to be using is the Nikon D750,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.080
and I'll mostly be shooting
with a 90mm Tamron macro lens.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.600
This means we'll be able to get a much
closer view of the miniatures being painted,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.200
and you can see one or two shots in
episode 11 that were filmed with this lens.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.220
Here, you can see the closest shots I could
achieve with my previous camera on the left,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.100
compared with kind of shots I can comfortably
get with the new camera on the right.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.620
And we can get even closer still should we need to.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.160
Having a second camera also means
that I can leave the D7100

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.680
in a fixed position in my figure cabinet,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.740
to be used for the sole purpose
of taking still images of the figures

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.320
in between the main stages of painting.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.940
These are the shots that are needed
to produce the transitional sequences

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.940
that I always like to include
at the beginning of each tutorial

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.360
and would usually necessitate a time-consuming
rearrangement of the camera and tripod.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.540
This process will now be
far quicker for me whilst filming

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.700
and should produce smoother
sequences for you to enjoy

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.820
as the camera never has to leave its position.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.120
One other piece of equipment I've purchased,
is this camera slider by Varavon.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.280
This will serve two main purposes:

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.680
Firstly, it will allow me to produce
a wider range of creative establishing shots,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.320
such as you can see here,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.180
aided by the D750's ability to
shoot at 60 frames per second.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.660
And secondly, it will speed up my workflow

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.960
as I will now be able to more
quickly reposition the camera

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.120
when switching between shots
of the miniature being painted

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.220
and shots of the mixing palette.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.060
All of these improvements are 
being paid for – as far as possible –

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.220
through your generosity as patrons

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.560
and will mean that I can realistically aim
to increase both the quality of the videos

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.580
and the pace of my output.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.800
Finally, please feel free to let me know which miniature
ranges you would like to see covered in the channel

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.620
by filling in the Google questionnaire which
you can find in the channel description below.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.020
Thank you for watching, and as always, happy painting!
