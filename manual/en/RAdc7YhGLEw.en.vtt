After the pages have been colored and the
dialog written Dex will then go in and letter

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.860
the pages based off my script. There are plenty
of comic font programs available with Comic

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.259
Craft being the most popular. This is what
we use now for Cony Wave. Dex will now give

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.530
a brief demonstration on how to letter a page.
Dex will now give a brief demonstration on

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.800
how to letter a page. By using Illustrator
I import the colored image into Illustrator

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.220
and then I start using prefabricated word
balloons that I use to help use for the dialog

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.740
for this particular page so basically you
just can click on any word balloon that you

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:41.039
think works best for each character to speak,
basically click and drag into each frame in

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:47.129
there as you can see and move it into position.
You can resize it to help fit in the panel

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.269
itself and then obviously you would type in
the text from the script that you use here

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.050
which is already prewritten out for me. So
I just go through each page and figure out

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.780
what the script is and then figure out what
the best place is for the word balloons that

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.400
would work. As you can see each individual
one will pop up through each layer, obviously

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.930
each individual word balloon is going to be
its own separate layer so that way when you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.710
type in your text you can manipulate it any
way you want in terms of size of the text,

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.890
size of the word balloons and where exactly
you would want to put them. If you look here

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.530
obviously this is already prewritten out and
I will show you a quick thing here of how

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.130
you can move them around for instance. If
you click on both of them you want the word

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.820
balloon as a separate layer as well as the
text layer. Now you see here I can click and

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.090
drag this anywhere all over the page that
you want. Obviously our character here is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.660
speaking so we want to put it around there
as close as possible. You can also control

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.000
the stem of each individual balloon by this
tool here by this arrow key as you can see

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.060
here I can make this stem anywhere on the
page. Obviously for this reason we want her

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:12.230
to speak. This is a typical dialog page so
it is kind of easy. There are really no action

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.340
words or anything on there or any kind of
special effects, just plain old chit chat

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.650
so one thing I want to mention also particularly
in the script in this particular word balloon

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.330
this character was speaking off the panel
so what I do is I just pick a nice spot for

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.970
the text and the balloon to go and I just
make the stem kind of go off the panel to

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.120
make it look like she is speaking.
