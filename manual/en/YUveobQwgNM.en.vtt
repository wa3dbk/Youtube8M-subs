00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.190
As Arcade games go, Zaxxon by SEGA remains
milestone in gaming history thanks to its

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.310
many firsts - not the least of which was the
introduction of 'axonometric projections'

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.529
to create a sort-of holographic 3D effect.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.450
Thankfully it's 2012 now and 3D effects are
the least of our worries, so SEGA have dug

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.180
up their classic title to give it Temple Run-like
shake-up.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.640
It's here that things start to feel a bit
worrying - avoiding hazards has always been

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.940
a staple in the original isometric shoot'em-up,
forcing players to balance their efforts between

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.750
evasion and offense.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.940
Zaxxon Escape pulls the plug on the second
half, reducing combat to the occasional tap

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.500
to blow up barriers, an enemy or two, and
power-ups.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.720
As for the rest of the controls?

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.460
I hope you like flipping your iDevice.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.260
Tilting can be a wonderful way of giving the
player a visceral way to engage with the game

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.890
in front of them - at first this is also true
of Zaxxon as you twist your iDevice to rotate

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.230
the ship you're flying.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.640
However, obstacles regularly force (or at
least strongly nudge) you towards rotating

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.610
your device completely, forcing you to juggle
it between your hands - one fumble and you

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.790
might be explaining why your screen is cracked
to someone at an Apple store.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.530
One thing Zaxxon Escape doesn't fumble is
the presentation - story-wise you've just

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.549
blown up a massive space station and now you're
making your exit before being engulfed in

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.549
flames.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.280
The sprawling and varied designs of the station
make for great eye-candy, especially when

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.020
ducking and weaving through obstacles - in
this regard its design feels flawless.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.939
However, ultimately the game is just another
Temple Run title, complete with swipe-based

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.310
path selection.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.229
Upgrades cover the same basics as well, though
the amount of coins you can earn in a single

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.090
run is limited, making the initial purchase
feel altogether too harsh as you grind to

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.159
make any serious progress.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.020
In the end it comes down to whether you don't
mind flipping your iDevice to play a spaceship-themed

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:02.479
version of a game you probably already own.
