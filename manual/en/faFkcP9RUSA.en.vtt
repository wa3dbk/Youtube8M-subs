Hey what's up guys, Sean Nalewanyj here with
a Muscle In Minutes Q&amp;A where I give quick,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.009
to the point answers to your fitness questions.
Today’s question is, “are seated calf

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:22.170
raises necessary in order to build your calves
effectively, or are standing calf raises enough

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.840
on their own”. So basically, your calves
are made up of two main portions, the first

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.140
is the gastrocnemius which is the much larger
visible portion of the calf that sits on the

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.620
outside of your lower leg, and the second
is the soleus which is a much smaller basically

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.170
strip of muscle that sits underneath the gastrocnemius,
and when you perform a calf raise with your

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.809
knees bent like in a seated calf raise, it
basically de-activates the gastrocnemius and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.809
isolates that small soleus muscle. Now, if
your goal is to fully maximize the development

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.509
of your calves then obviously building up
the soleus muscle will help a bit since it

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.630
basically pushes the gastrocnemius muscle
further out, however, it’s important to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.069
keep in mind that when you perform any basic
calf raise even with your knees straight like

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:24.490
in a standing calf raise or a leg press calf
raise or a machine calf raise, you’re actually

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.420
hitting both the gastrocnemius and the soleus
at the same time. So even if you never performed

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.390
any seated calf raise work at all your soleus
would still end up getting plenty of stimulation

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.110
regardless, and that, combined with the fact
that it’s already a very small muscle to

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.670
begin with, overall I’d say that in most
cases seated calf raises probably aren't going

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.860
to make much if any real noticeable difference
to your bottom line calf gains assuming that

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.420
you’re doing a sufficient amount of regular
straight legged calf raise work. Now if calves

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.989
are a particular weak point for you, and you
want to squeeze out every possible ounce of

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:10.060
growth and you have the extra time and energy
to throw in a few sets of seated calf raises

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.000
here and there then that’s totally fine,
it’s not going to hurt you, but the main

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.560
take away point here is that whether you do
seated calf raises or not, number 1 the difference

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.610
in your overall calf growth will likely be
minor if anything, and number 2, standard

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.070
straight legged calf work is far more important
for building up your calf size and it should

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.360
always be given full priority in your calf
training. So thanks for watching, make sure
