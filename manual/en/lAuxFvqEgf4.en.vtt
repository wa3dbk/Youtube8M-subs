00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
Since I was a kid - I left school and I
wanted to

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.410
study at university but I didn't really
get the opportunity to do that.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.320
So all through my life, it's something
that I've wanted to do but always put off.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.200
I just kinda felt "maybe I wasn't quite
good enough to do it" after the time had gone when I'd left school.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.880
But then someone prompted me to tell me that actually, in the business that I'm in -

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.390
which is the optometry business -

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.300
the way I could get ahead and earn more money was actually to go and study optometry as a degree.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.550
So after thinking about it for a long,
long time,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.439
I suddenly decided "yes, I was gonna do it".
And - of course -

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.760
Aston's one of the major places where
you can study optometry.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.210
What actually happened was, I just
talked to my wife about it and she said

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.460
"you know what? You should do it."

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.579
The income-thing was a challenge for us,
we had to work out how to do that but

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.170
in the end we did and with Student Finance
and all those things available to us today,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.280
we found we were able to actually do that.
I felt good when I applied

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.100
to university and I felt positive about
myself and thinking "yeah, I can do this".

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.600
And then I started to talk to some
friends and they started to sow some seeds of doubt into my mind

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.900
"Oh, you'll be the oldest swinger in town" were the kind of comments that I heard from people!

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.689
And while I thought... it didn't really
affect me in the beginning, but it

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.950
did kind of start to get to me, before I
started. So in the build-up to uni which

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.830
was probably a year before I started,

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.060
I did get a little bit worried about
being in the company of all these young "kids".

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.500
So the first day I turned up, there were a load of young kids in the group

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.700
and of course there were some mature
students but I really didn't get to know them until later.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.600
So in the first few weeks, to say that
I felt a little bit out of it would be fair,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.759
but it really didn't take very long
before people started to know who I was,

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.040
i started to make friends,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.619
even some of the youngsters became
friendly, which was great.

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.759
So in the first few weeks, I'd say "a bit of trepidation but

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.759
overall... a positive experience that was great".

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.800
So I've been here now for a couple of years, this is the end of the second year that I'm studying...

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.229
and it's an absolute world of difference,
compared to when I started.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.300
I know loads of people at uni, there's tonnes of support, everyone's friendly, and that overall initial trepidation

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.700
was probably something I didn't need to 
worry about it, but at the time it was a little bit of a worry.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.420
Clearly now, I know a lot of people, I've
done well in the course,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.500
I'm really enjoying it, it's fantastic.
Absolutely - just what I wanted...and I'm learning tonnes of things.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.200
There are really two or three things that have helped me

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.110
while I've been at uni. One of the first things was you get an assignment to do,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.520
quite early on in the course.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.000
Of course I hadn't studied for twenty years so you always get a bit worried about

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
"oooh, how's that assignment going to go?" but in fact, I went to the Learning Development Centre

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.269
and they were just brilliant. I mean, people
that have been studying for a

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.050
long time were able to give input to
the kind of assignment that I did

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.220
and particularly one of the things that
worried me was referencing.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.200
Because it's a big deal these days. You can't
just write things of your own accord.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.269
You have to...if you use other people's work, you do have to reference it.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.220
Well I'd never experienced that all, so when
I went to the Learning Development Centre

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.000
they were really helpful and gave me a whole load of information about how to do that, so that - kind of -

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.700
took away a little bit of the fear.
The other thing that's been really helpful is the Mature Students Association.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.000
Really a whole group of people - probably 100 people on campus - that are all in the same group.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.760
You know, we're all mature students, ageing from probably 25 up to maybe 55

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.209
and really everyone feels in the same way at the beginning.

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.840
A little bit out of it, looking for
someone that's in the same camp as them.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.709
So in fact, the Mature Students Association is ideal. We do socials,

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.310
we do lots of learning and
development stuff together, so the

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.950
seminars and that kind of thing

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.230
and really it's just great to get into a room
where the mature students are together and

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.980
we can just chat about our own experiences. It's brilliant.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.580
"Get to know other mature students on campus" because

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.819
you'd be surprised that everyone's experience
is very similar

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.959
and sometimes - by sharing challenges and
issues and problems -

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.560
you can kind of feel positive about it.
And the other thing is "get organized".

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.689
Absolutely important. Well, I've got two young
kids so I what need to do is just make sure

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.540
that everything runs like clockwork,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.319
so I think juggling everything together, just
make sure you've got a good plan to do

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.500
that and you'll be successful, without a shadow of a doubt.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.900
One of the things that I was really delighted to achieve actually - in the first year

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.000
I was top student for that year, which
was just something I never expected at all.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.600
I did have to put a lot of work in - like
all students do - to achieve that

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.780
and actually it made me feel like
"you know? I'm just as good as the other students."

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.000
Over the time that I've been studying, it's
nice to see that my friends reaction to being a student is

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.160
is quite different now. In the
beginning they were kinda thinking

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.000
"oh, it's an easy life and I just didn't want
to go to work anymore and it was going to be just you know a bit of a doss"

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.020
but actually these days, they are quite

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.810
supportive and positive about it. I think they
realize just what it takes

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.300
to give up work, go to university, put the
effort in,

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.500
and to be successful, so I'm actually
encouraged by their positive mindset now.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.740
Definitely I would say, it takes commitment,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.160
it's definitely hard work, you need to
get organized but it is the most fantastic experience

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.080
I think that anybody could go through

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.050
and if you're thinking about doing it, I'd say
"you know what? Just do it!"
