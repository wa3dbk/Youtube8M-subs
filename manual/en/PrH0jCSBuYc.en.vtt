00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:16.260
(Italian music)

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.980
You want to go first?

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.800
I've been to the Frist quite a few times

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.430
I think this one

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.090
just absolutely blew my mind.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.840
It's one of the best I've seen.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.700
In January,  I went to Kandinsky and it was about his life and all the art,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.220
so, it's kind of similar cause it's going in time.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.100
That's what I like about art, you can see what was going on during that time frame.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.840
For me, this is the first time I've seen a fashion exhibit here but

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.030
I've been to an Art Deco show were a
bunch of cars were here

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.739
and that was stunning but this is too
this is stimulating in a different way

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.360
I love art in all kinds of different forms
and this in particular was very

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.150
inspiring

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.590
fashion really is an expression of
the human ability to

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.930
express oneself artistically and so it's
very inspiring to see the works here.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.380
This exhibition, I guess it's more
relatable cause

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.039
fashion's everywhere and it's a huge part
of everyone's lives and

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.160
is just cool to see fashion through the years.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.300
And I think it was a very helpful because

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.260
now  I'm going to, I'm going to venture out
a little bit I think

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.440
when I dress next time I might do
something a little different.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.780
You should really come and see this show

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.360
it's got a lot of things that you're probably into

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.560
and a lot of people would love.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.580
If I could describe the fashion exhibition in one word...AMAZING!

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.380
Wow!

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.880

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.920

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.900
Is there anything else you want to add?

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.980
I don't know...

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.300
