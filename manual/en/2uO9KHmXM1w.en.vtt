00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.360
How would you like to transform your PC into
a supercomputer making graphics intensive

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.270
applications like film editing, animation,
3D rendering and color correction operate

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.160
at lightning speeds? You can easily do this
by adding an adapter card to your PC. The

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.480
CUBE is the easiest way to add high performance
cards to your PC. Add-in cards like GPUs and

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.220
Flash drive boards can easily increase the
performance of your computer. How many times

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.350
have you needed a high-end, power-hungry GPU
in your system that required more power and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.530
cooling than your system was equipped for?
Since PCI Express is the bus structure of

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.400
all PCs today, it's relatively easy to extend
that native bus on your PC to an external

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.190
enclosure that provides any number of high
speed slots. Also, supporting a number of

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.799
GPUs operating at about 300 watts each requires
a lot of power and cooling that is not typically

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.799
accommodated by a usual PC. The CUBE can
support both double wide and single wide PCIe

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.920
cards. You can easily install any PCI Express
board into the CUBE by loosening the thumb

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:33.399
screw, removing the metal tray, and installing
your board as you would in any other situation.

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:40.399
Once you've done that, simply replace the
tray. Replace the single thumb screw. and

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.719
cable it to your computer. Then you're ready
to go. In addition, some applications require

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.889
fast storage that can download a lot of data
speed at hundreds of times faster than disk

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:06.729
drives can support. Today's NAND Flash drives
can support terabytes of data at write speeds

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.100
of greater than 1500 writes per second. These
boards require a lot less bandwidth than GPUs

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:20.460
and usually only occupy one slot. Therefore,
a CUBE2, which provides up to 5 slots, or

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.640
Or a CUBE3, providing up to eight slots, can
support a combination of both Flash drives and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.640
GPUs in a single enclosure. One Stop Systems
designs and manufactures these high performance

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.560
desktop, as well as rackmount expansion enclosures
with a variety of options that can shorten

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.960
your production time. If you would like more
