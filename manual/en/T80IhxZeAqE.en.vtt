00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.880
Walk the streets of chance

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.300
Where purpose gives way to,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.060
desperate circumstance.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.360
Follow blue gray skies,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.500
To find there, is no

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.060
perfect design.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.820
When the night awakes the mind,

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.740
When the darkness calls your name,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.000
When the soul evokes desire,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.980
When desire gives birth to,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.760
Purpose, purpose.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.020
Morning comes,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.020
Walk the earth like,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.600
You've never seen the sun.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.120
Find the line of time,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.340
Finally embrace,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.220
perfect design.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.840
When the night awakes the mind,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.720
When the darkness calls your name,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.800
When the soul evokes desire,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.940
When desire gives birth to,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.920
Purpose, purpose.
