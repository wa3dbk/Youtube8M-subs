00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.145
The collection of the Museo del Prado is truly exceptional but it is one that also has its gaps, 

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:23.315
of which the most regrettable is probably the lack of an original painting by Leonardo da Vinci, 

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:29.000
although this is to some extent to be expected given the very small number of known works 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.983
by that Florentine artist. The lack of any work by the artist in the Prado’s collection is partly offset 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.899
by a fine group of works by his pupils and followers, both Italians such as Bernardino Luini, and Spaniards 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.351
such as Fernando Yañez from La Mancha. In addition, the museum possesses a number of copies of original 

00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:56.486
works by Leonardo including one of the Mona Lisa, which must have arrived in Spain in the first third of the 17th century 

00:00:56.688 --> 00:01:04.941
and which we believe is the work referred to in an inventory of 1666 of the Alcázar in Madrid
 

00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:10.209
in which there is a reference to a smiling woman attributed to Leonardo da Vinci. 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.084
When the Prado first opened in 1819 the painting entered its collection along

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:21.090
with the other works from the Royal Collection. This painting has always been known

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.527
to the Museum and has always been on display. What we can now offer, however, is more information on

00:01:27.727 --> 00:01:32.342
 it and on the nature of its relationship with Leonardo’s original.

00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:36.133
For many years the Prado’s version was thought to have been painted on an oak panel, 

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:41.900
suggesting that it was by a Flemish artist, but we now know that it was painted on walnut, 

00:01:43.597 --> 00:01:50.221
which is a support that was commonly used in Leonardo’s studio. 

00:01:50.963 --> 00:01:56.309
This information and further details of a technical nature have now led us 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:03.347
to the conclusion that this is a copy executed in Leonardo’s studio 

00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:08.306
studio at the time that the original was being painted. 

00:02:08.506 --> 00:02:16.698
From contemporary accounts we know that Leonardo painted works in his studio

00:02:16.898 --> 00:02:23.752
that were copied by his assistants. In this case we can add technical information to these documentary sources.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:35.096
Among Leonardo’s assistants the style and technique of the present work, both with regard to

00:02:35.296 --> 00:02:39.479
the surface layers and the interior, is close to that of Francesco Melzi, who was 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:45.967
one of his best known collaborators. As I mentioned earlier, this copy has always been 

00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:50.000
known to the Museum but to anyone who looked at it there were 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.601
three elements that clearly distinguished it from the original in the Louvre. 

00:02:56.801 --> 00:03:02.415
The first is stylistic in nature: the artist who painted this copy had a much more linear style,

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:09.933
using a more precise brushstroke but making little use of the famous sfumato characteristic 

00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:15.627
of Leonardo’s mature work. The second difference, which is almost anecdotal in nature, 

00:03:15.827 --> 00:03:20.955
is the fact that the Prado’s Mona Lisa has eyebrows, which are not to be seen in the Louvre original.

00:03:21.155 --> 00:03:28.430
The third and undoubtedly the most striking point is the fact that until the recent restoration of the Prado

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.633
version no landscape background was visible. It has now been fully recovered through the splendid restoration

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:41.955
carried out by Almudena Sánchez. The Prado version has recently been the subject of study at the suggestion 

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:46.898
of the Louvre, which has requested it for inclusion in their exhibition on The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne. 

00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:51.892
As a result of the X-rays and infra-red reflectographs made during this process the landscape reappeared. 

00:03:52.092 --> 00:04:00.660
In addition, pigment analysis proved that the dark layer that had obscured it had been added

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:08.452
 at least 250 years after the work was painted, in other words not prior to 1750. 

00:04:08.652 --> 00:04:14.996
Furthermore, there was an intermediary layer that allowed us to undertake the restoration far more safely.

00:04:15.096 --> 00:04:22.567
The result of the recent restoration is quite clear. The painting has undoubtedly become more appealing to look 

00:04:22.767 --> 00:04:27.140
at and we can also say that the figure has more space than before, 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:34.279
while the newly discovered landscape is remarkably close to the one in Leonardo’s original painting.

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.990
What is the importance of this copy? Well, it is clearly not a masterpiece 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.488
and it certainly does not contain a single brushstroke by Leonardo da Vinci. 

00:04:44.688 --> 00:04:54.574
It does, however, have the merit of encouraging us to look at the original with fresh eyes. 

00:04:54.774 --> 00:05:00.631
Above all, it offers more information on the working and pictorial practices characteristic of Leonardo’s studio.
