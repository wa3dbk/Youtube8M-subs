DIY Custom Apple Watch Wars!

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.410
Hey what's up guys Keaton here so I'm with
Katharine and we did a video on her channel

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.019
in the pool where we did a Q and A so some
of the questions on there were pretty interesting.

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.480
I'll leave a link in the description below
for you to check out.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.740
But in today's video we're going to be customizing
our own Apple Watch bands.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.429
So I went the Apple Store and picked these
up.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.600
These are low key very expensive so Katharine
take your Apple Watch band.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.760
And how this is going to go is we're going
to get 20 minutes to shop with only 20 dollars.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.550
Nice, legit currency there.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.180
Then we're gonna get 30 minutes to design
and then at the end we're gonna find out who

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.830
has the cooler Apple Watch band.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.839
So lets get started!

00:00:37.839 --> 00:01:35.850
Ok guys so we are on our way to Michael's,
we're driving right behind Keaton and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.580
some ideas I have...I'm thinking maybe putting
washy tape on it.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:04:54.930
Maybe some studs, I know you guys like those
but 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:06.280
I 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.300
don't really know.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:45.680
