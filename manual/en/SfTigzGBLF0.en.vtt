Barbie - Easter Egg Hunt

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.660
Come on Tamika!

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.640
Lets grab our baskets and get in the car

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.080
You know Barbie likes to stick to a schedule!

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.340
Ok, ok!

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.360
Got it!

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.120
Really?

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.160
Tam, you think you'll really need four baskets

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.880
for an Easter Egg hunt?

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.060
Aren't you being just a little bit greedy?

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.000
I don't know what you're talking about?

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.820
You know we almost got banned last year after

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.720
you kept tripping all the little kids over

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.480
and taking their eggs

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.700
Da, di, da di dahh...

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.200
Oh, you fell over did you?

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.060
Well you won't be needing these then!

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.740
Not my fault!

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.880
They fell

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.940
Can I help it if I happened to be there at the same time?

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.680
The Easter bunny would have been upset

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.780
if his eggs went to waste?

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.340
I sure hope that greedy kid from last year

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.040
is not coming to the egg hunt this year

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.660
I've had to double my chocolate making

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.940
this year just so others can get some!

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.360
Ok girls, strap yourselves in!

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.780
We're off on our Easter egg hunt!

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.880
Should be lots of fun and if we get there quick enough,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.520
we might spot that fluffy bunny on his way out

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.880
I wonder what he looks like?

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.640
Do you think he's as cute as me?

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.520
Probably cuter but definitely not as cute as me

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.520
Oh girls!

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.940
I'm pretty sure he's the cutest bunny on the planet

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.740
Did anyone bring any carrots for him

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.080
or does he only eat chocolate?

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.400
Ha ha, Barbie

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.960
You're so funny!

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.400
Ok girls, it's about to start

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.040
You know the rules

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.160
The younger children get first pick of the eggs,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.540
so no pushing or shoving

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.200
Tamika!

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.580
I'm serious young lady!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.940
Don't make me take you home!

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.800
This is so much fun!

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.940
It's so cute seeing the young children's

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.380
faces when they find an egg

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.820
Really?

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.660
Don't think so...

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.320
That's one less for us!

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.500
Chelsea look at that?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.660
I can see a fluffy tail

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.400
You don't think it could be the Easter Bunny do you?

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.780
Ahhhh...

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.480
I don't think so

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.960
He'd be long gone by now

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.520
I bet he's at home eating his carrots

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.860
Shhhhh!

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.820
Let's get closer...

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.760
Oh, he's gone!

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.880
See!

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.360
I told you

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.140
Hey look!

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.080
I do see something!

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.180
And he's gone again...

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.380
Ok, one more time little bunny!

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.440
There he is!

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.260
Quick!

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.860
We lost him!

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.260
Geez, he's quick!

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.540
Barbie!

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.040
Barbie!

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.720
You'll never believe it!

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.140
We just saw the Easter Bunny

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.700
I don't think so girls

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.920
I was only kidding when I said you might see him

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.040
He's way to fast!

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.740
Probably already back home making

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.440
next years batch of eggs

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.300
(Laughing)

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.960
We'll never forget this day Barbie

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.080
Thanks for taking us
Yeah!

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.820
We got you something really special to say thanks

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.600
We hope you have a wonderful Easter Barbie!

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.700
Ha, ha, girls.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.220
You shouldn't have!

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.480
Actually we didn't

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.840
I just took it out of somebody else's basket

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.340
Tamika!
