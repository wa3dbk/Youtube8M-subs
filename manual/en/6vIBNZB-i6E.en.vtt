00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.709
The backhand topspin against backspin is an
attacking shot used when your opponent pushes

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:10.889
or chops the ball at you with backspin.

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.520
Forehand and backhand topspins in off backspin
are very common in table tennis and are generally

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.940
how rallies are started.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.320
If you can play this shot strongly, it means
that you'll enter the open rally play in a

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.390
better position to win the point.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.320
This shot is very similar to the backhand
topspin against block.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:43.820
So, head still, body arm and wrist relaxed,
wrist rotating through the shot.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:54.860
You'll also notice that there is more upwards
movement in the swing.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.550
The major difference is that you'll need to
drop your wrist at the start of the shot,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.799
especially when the backspin is heavy and
low.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.939
Backspin can have different effects on the
ball depending on the height and speed of

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.610
the chop or push.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:21.039
The ball can either skid through at a low
angle or hold up and bounce higher, depending

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:27.229
on the angle and speed of the ball.

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.369
You'll need to adjust the height of your body,
depending on how high the bounce is.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.280
If the ball is low, bend your knees and get
down low.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:48.939
If the ball is higher you can have straighter
legs.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:57.369
If the ball is pushed high, then your whole
body will need to lift and adjust.

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.579
The angle of your racket need adjusting.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.119
Having your racket face too closed will send
the ball into the net, so you'll generally

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.900
have to open the face of your racket to counter
the effect of the backspin.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.820
Opening your racket face will usually mean
the ball travels in a higher arc over the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:28.840
net and you'll need this against low heavy
backspins.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:37.420
It is possible to use a closed racket face
against low heavy backspin, but this will

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.510
require very precise timing.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.760
Topspinning with a close racket face is one
of the secrets of behind keeping the ball

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.650
low over the net and it's well worth practicing.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.780
Even though there is upwards movement, be
careful not to lose your body position.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.049
The last thing you want is to end up with
straight legs and not to be able to move quickly

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.049
or play a strong shot afterwards.

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:13.959
Use timing and correct mechanics to avoid
having to move your body too much vertically.

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.390
Start the shot from in front of your stomach
to begin with.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.069
From here, you'll be able to topspin the ball
across court or down the line from same starting

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:33.560
point.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.989
If you want to generate maximum power then
start the shot from your left hip, however

00:03:38.989 --> 00:04:19.000
keep in mind it will be more difficult to
play the ball down 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.040
the line.
