00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.800
LG Optimus Black Preview.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.580
Expected H1 2011.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.530
At first glance, the LG Optimus Black looks
almost exactly like dozens of other black

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.949
slabby Android phones, and to a very large
extent.. that it all it is. But LG have packed

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.949
something a bit different into the Optimus
Black, and it is something that might just

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.410
give forthcoming LG smartphones the edge over
the competition.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.449
The main selling point with the Optimus Black
is its screen. It uses LG's "NOVA" technology

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.729
to give a clear, bright display.. and crucially
it uses significantly less power in everyday

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:46.880
use to rival OLED panels.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:55.070
LG say that the NOVA display is designed to
be the brightest and most readable panel on

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.980
the market, with higher levels of brightness,
high contrast and pure whites that can be

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.549
used indoors or in direct sunlight. Critically,
LG claim that the NOVA display reduces power

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.460
consumption by 50% during indoor use, and
uses much less energy than an AMOLED screen

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.690
when displaying a full white background..
and this translates to longer battery life,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.830
which most Android users would agree can be
a real issue.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.811
The display is a 4" unit, and although LG
haven't confirmed it we suspect that it is

00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:37.590
a standard 800 x 480 pixel resolution. Inside
is a large 1500 mAh battery, and the LG Optimus

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.620
Black is just 9.2mm thick and weighs only
109 grams, which is impressive for a device

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.979
with such a large screen. One other novel
feature is "WiFi direct", which allows WiFi

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.390
enabled devices to communicate with each other
directly, which will make things like file

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.630
transfers and printing much easier to do.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.480
We don't know what camera it has on the back,
but the Optimus Black does come with a 2 megapixel

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.530
front-facing camera for video calls. Earlier
Android phones lack video calling, but it

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:19.390
still hasn't really taken off in a big way.
Perhaps things will change in 2011, who knows?

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.840
The LG Optimus Black will ship with Android
2.2 ("Froyo") out of the box, with an early

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.110
upgrade to Android 2.3 ("Gingerbread") promised.
There's no word on pricing, but LG do say

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.910
that the Optimus Black will be rolled out
worldwide during the first half of 2011.
