Hi, I’m Lorie Marrero and I’m coming to
you today from the floor at The Container

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.250
Store. I’m in the kitchen department to
show you today’s [POP] Clutter Video Tip,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.800
which is my favorite kitchen products that
you can’t find really anywhere else. I have

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.710
the first one to show you – this looks like
a normal double-decker turntable, but what’s

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.380
unusual about it is that the top level actually
splits and you can have [POP] tall things

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.570
here, shorter things here, and really maximize
that vertical space in your cabinet. So love

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.600
turntables. And you can get here one of the
largest turntables I have ever seen [POP],

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.640
and it’s fantastic for those deep, dark
corner cabinets where you can’t reach things

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.850
in the back very easily and you don’t have
already a built-in lazy susan, you just plop

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.810
this right in, you can put this under your
sink as well, any other deep dark cabinet

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.000
area, and you can even use this for indoor
plants or something like that too; so, very

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.070
useful and unusual. [POP]These are vertical
sorters. Now, these come in all different

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.819
shapes and sizes. I have a wood one and a
metal one here to show you, but they are taller,

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:19.359
shorter, wider, all kinds of variations. And
they’re great for anything you need to store

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:24.659
vertically like cookie sheets or trays or
even in an office environment, maybe you have

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.729
envelopes that you want to separate out. So,
these are a great solution, too. Next we have

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.759
the Magnetic Knife Holder. Now, it says “knife
holder,” but you actually can use this in

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.380
a lot of different places. So you mount it
on the wall and then you can use it in the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.640
[POP] workbench area in the garage for tools.
You can also use it in a craft room for craft

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.039
supplies, metal cutting tools, and scissors
and things like that. But it’s a very utilitarian

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.749
thing. You just put it up there and slap whatever
metal thing you want onto it and it will hold

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:06.799
it very tight. [POP]And lastly we have the
Lid Maid. Now, I’ve never seen this anywhere

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.110
else. I love putting these into kitchen cabinets
to hold the lids to pots and pans. And you

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.540
may have seen this in my other Clutter Video
Tip about organizing pots and pans. [POP]

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.730
It slides in and out of your cabinet and holds
all the pot lids up vertically, just like

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.270
we were talking about, and, you know, it’s
really great because of the sliding in and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.470
out feature, you can reach things easily and
installs very quickly as well. So, I hope

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.390
you like these product selections today. And
