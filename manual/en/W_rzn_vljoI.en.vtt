00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.237
Remember when I lost the top to one of these boxes?

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:06.807
Well I have new tops, and they're better.

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:09.610
I got these in Idaho when I was at Happy Trails

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.713
Look how nice and shiny they are,

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:17.385
They have a hinge on them so they bolt to the box

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:20.654
and I wont lose them again.

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:24.091
Another thing that I really like about these is,

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:29.630
that there's this lock right here so you can lock the box with this.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.269
right here. Right now I have these padlocks on the sides.

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.738
Makes me sound like a marching band when I'm driving down the road.

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:40.240
So it'll be nice to not use those anymore.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.041
and have something that is built in and I don't 
 have to worry about making all that racket.

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:50.551
So I'm gonna try to install these without screwing anything up.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:58.092
I'm not a professional installer but if watching this helps 
 you learn how to put these on fine.

00:00:58.092 --> 00:01:01.328
If you wanna laugh at me making mistakes, that's fine too.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.867
What you wanna do is latch these tighten these latches down

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:12.940
and then make yourself a mark from the top 
 of the lid at 1 3/8" down.

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:14.675
and that's where you drill the hole.

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:17.044
1, 2, 3, 8ths

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:22.383
Now you've got some marks you can pop this off

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:25.553
drill some holes.

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:32.993
and always remember when you use power tools

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:37.831
to a get your face really close to what you're doing,

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.430
and squint your eyes really tight like this.

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:47.710
That's called the safety squint. 

00:01:48.876 --> 00:01:50.780
I just realized that these little plastic bushings need to go in the hole

00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:57.650
not just the bolt so looks like you 
 need to use a 1/4" drill bit

00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:01.590
for these to go in there and then it 
 kind of helps it be a smooth

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:03.820
hinge when it opens

00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:08.360
so just let me reem these babies out

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:09.160
boy that's scaring me.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.900
it's okay to be scared.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.900
Oh! Dang that's hot.

00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:23.940
Everything's okay. Everybody calm down.

00:02:25.813 --> 00:02:28.550
I've got it figured out

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.350
that goes in there

00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:35.060
that bolt goes on there.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:39.860
it's gonna work

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.460
so put that nut on there you tighten them up

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:50.770
and you have a fancy new lid that opens up and doesn't fall off

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:53.670
if you forget to lock it. It just stays there.

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:57.310
It's also handy because you can flip that open 
 and you know how whatever you need

00:02:57.311 --> 00:03:00.010
is always at the very freaking bottom of this

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:06.750
when I take off the other lid you gotta set it 
 in the dirt or what do you do with it

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:10.390
so I kinda like that it stays there for more reasons than

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.290
you're a dummy and forget to lock it and it falls off

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.290
you're a dummy and forget to lock it and it falls off

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.560
and hits somebody in the head. That probably didn't happen.

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:22.270
But a, that's what you do if you've got some old busted up boxes

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.070
and there's that nice little lock right there

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:27.410
If you've got some busted up old boxes and you don't feel like spending

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:35.180
money to buy a whole new set this kind 
 of a good way bring new life

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:36.080
to your old set of boxes.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.190
the guys at happy trails hooked me up with these

00:03:40.187 --> 00:03:42.990
