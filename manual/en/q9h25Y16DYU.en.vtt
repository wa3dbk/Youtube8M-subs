00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:06.879
hello and welcome

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.380
this is the thule round trip elite bike box

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.219
just to arrived this morning so thought I would share it with you

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.910
Im going on trip in a couple of weeks I really like the look and design of the thule cycle box it works a bit like a shell

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.869
and there is also a integrated bike
stand in the box as well so lets

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:30.869
crack it open and see exactly what's in
the box

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.629
so my first impressions so far

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.210
really good solid box it feels
really nice

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.920
really well made yes the wheels down here really well wrapped up

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.390
really do not know haw to get into it yet

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.390
its got some velcro around here

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.610
ok its got two catches on the side here

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.110
they are a little bit like a cycle shoes have buckles

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.659
to press it. its like a spring-loaded thing so you can clamp it down tighter if you have to

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.210
ok

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.789
and that just lifts off

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.640
so basically what it has got

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.990
it has two studs here

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.789
they just place on that side

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.959
and that just goes into a catch

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.899
as I say a bit like your cycle shoe buckle just tighten just clamps down onto it

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.299
so really good, good simple design nice and solid billy goat set aside nice and solid

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.190
ok so there is the top

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.240
ok so what have we got inside

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.640
so these are I am presuming

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.250
these are your wheel bags

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.799
so two actual padded wheel bags there

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:16.799
one

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.970
ok two

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.330
ok got the stand its self

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.140
whats really good about this, this actual bike stand

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.450
makes up the protection and everything else it clamps into the bottom

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.850
of the case itself and keeps the bike nice and secure

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.850
and stops it rattling around

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.040
arrr right ok

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.069
really simple just a little tag

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.439
that you actual pull that just pulls a lever to get it out

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.769
then that just pulls out itself

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.299
so basically this is the

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.450
stand itself

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.890
ok

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.420
just slots in there

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.420
the other way around

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.040
ok

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.150
and that sits on there

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.460
and the bike will just sit in there all nice and secure

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.480
first impressions really well made

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.740
just like everything else that thule do

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.270
and yes I'm really happy with it really well made

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.670
really solid all i have to do now is get on a plane
