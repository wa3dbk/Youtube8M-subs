00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.780
Hi, Alan Stratton, from As Wood Turns (www.AsWoodTurns.com)
On a video, a while back, Steve Cook saw me

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.590
drilling a hole on the lathe holding a drill
bit in vise grips.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.500
He thought I was not being very safe.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:35.150
So, when I was at the Utah Woodturning Symposium,
he presented me with a Jacobs chuck in a handle.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:42.510
This is Brazilian rosewood that he turned
so that I can be safer when I’m drilling

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.559
on the lathe.

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.820
So, thank you Steve, I’ll use it on this
project.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:56.149
Also, when I was there, Craig Milliron gave
me this pigtail turner and said, “Hey, make

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.180
this for me”.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.149
So, okay Craig, here we go.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.720
And, a while back, another viewer asked to
make a Celtic or Keltic knot.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.780
There seems to be a great dispute on the pronunciation
on that.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:19.740
So, I’ll also make, in this case, a Celtic
or Keltic knot in the handle for the pigtail

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.740
turner.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.060
I have yet to epoxy this into a handle.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.280
But, I will.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.600
So, here we go, pigtail turner, Celtic knot
for a barbecue.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.500
And, thank you Steve and Craig.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.750
Let’s get going.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.500
My process concept for this Celtic or Keltic
knot is to ensure that as I cut the slices,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.420
that the angle remains constant and the distance
from the bottom is also constant.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.479
And, I don’t want to measure and mark each
time as that would introduce a lot of error.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.130
I’m sizing the walnut slice to replace the
wood removed by the saw kerf.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.420
I’m throwing together a sliding jig to handle
both tasks.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.900
Rather than riding the table saw slot, it
rides against the table saw fence.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.290
I’m attaching a board for an angled fence
and another to fix the distance.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.290
Then first cut.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.290
Now for gluing.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.500
I’ve made an angle fence and lined it with
parchment paper.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.190
After spreading glue, I’m clamping the wood
against the back fence.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.420
However, the most important clamp is the one
running from end to end.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.950
With the wood trapped, this is what is providing
the real pressure.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.560
And wait for the glue to dry.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.280
Now for cut number two.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.570
This is at a 180 degree rotation from the
first one.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:50.200
And for gluing again.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.180
Same setup.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.310
Now for cut and glue number three.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.400
This is getting repetitive.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.440
With cut number four, I’m seeing some trouble.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.190
The cut has crept visually higher.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.260
I think my walnut was slightly thinner than
the saw kerf.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.840
Now that I’ve cut four times, the tiny discrepancy
has multiplied.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.970
I’ll go ahead and turn it and see how far
off it is.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.740
I’m letting this glue dry at least overnight.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.070
Now for the actual turning.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.850
I’ve very carefully marked centers on each
end and punched them with a nail to guide

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.950
a steb center and a live center.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.140
So, now the wood is between centers.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.520
I’ll use a gouge to rough turn the handle.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.770
Mostly what I want now is a tenon so I can
mount it in a chuck.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.490
For this I’ll use a bedan and a parting
tool.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.630
Why a chuck?

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.440
It’s because I want to drill the end for
the pig tail turner on the lathe.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.820
Otherwise, I’d have to drill with a drill
press then mount to the lathe.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.220
I think this way is more accurate at least
for me.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.100
Then a little more roughing with the bedan
as long as it’s already in my hands.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:23.100
Before I get too close, I’ll drill the end
with Steve’s drill chuck handle.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.350
Now I can put a cone on the live center for
support and finish shaping the handle with

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.570
a gouge and a skew.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.840
Before sanding, I’m cutting two pairs of
grooves for decoration.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.560
Other than the Celtic knot and these grooves,
I’m keeping the handle fairly simple.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:51.660
The knot is enough decoration!

00:04:51.660 --> 00:05:08.060
With sanding nearly complete, I’ll burn
the grooves with a wire to darken them.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.040
Finally, I’m finishing with a mix of mineral
oil and beeswax while sanding the final grit.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.850
Then part off the handle.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.680
After all that, I’m buffing the handle just
a little bit for a nice shine.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.300
This Celtic or Keltic knot turned out quite
nicely.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.520
If I look very closely, I can see a little
offset where that last cut was off just a

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.520
little.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.320
But you have to study the knot to find it.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.200
I already have a plan to do better next time.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.860
So, I’m happy with my Keltic knot and the
pig-tail barbecue turner.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.010
Thanks again to Steve and Craig.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.130
