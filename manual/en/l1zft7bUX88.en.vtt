Hi, this is Yolanda Vanveen on behalf of Expert
Village. Many of us have tulip bulbs in our

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:12.410
garden but and we want to bring them in the
house. So what's the best way to take care

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.970
of cut tulips before they're blooming and
after blooming, what do I do with them? Here

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.240
are a few quick tips. When your tulips are
coming up in your garden and you want to bring

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.140
some in the house to enjoy, the best time
to cut them is way before they start blooming.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.100
Right when they've got a lot of color, but
they haven't quite opened up yet, cut them

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.820
at that point and bring them in the house.
And when I cut them too, easy way to do is

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.630
just take a pair of scissors and just snap
them right above the ground and I like to

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.170
leave just a little knob on the ground 'cause
that way I know where the tulips were so if

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.190
I want to plant some summer blooming bulbs
in that area, I already know where these tulips

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.219
are planted. They look best in groups of three
or more even ten, a dozen and there's a reason

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.930
that they sell them in groups is because they
look best when they're in groups of twelve

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.220
or more. When you bring them in put fresh
water in a vase, cut rectum the stems and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:21.750
throw them in the vase. I don't add aspirin,
bleach or any other or even alcohol to my

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.479
water although there's all types of wives
tales that have that say it works but for

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.840
me it's like going to a party and drinking
chlorinated water. I want fresh, beautiful

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.729
juicy water. So the best things to do is every
three, four days recut the stems and add fresh

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.200
water to your cut flowers and you'll find
in the end that they'll last for a lot longer

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.310
than other of the other materials that you
can put in with them. So now we know how to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.060
get our cut flowers into the house and what
to do with them so when they're outside do

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.330
we fertilize them or not? We'll talk about
that next.
