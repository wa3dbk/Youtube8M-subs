00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.710
Follow these tips to protect your skin from the 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.420
damaging effects of sun exposure and reduce your risk of skin cancer.  

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.110
Apply sunscreen every day.  

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.910
Skin that will not be covered by clothing needs 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.220
sunscreen when you go outside, even on cloudy days. 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.900
Reapply approximately every two hours, or after swimming or sweating. 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.310
Use a broad spectrum sunscreen which protects the skin 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.500
against both UVA and UVB rays and that has an SPF of at least 30. 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.310
Use one ounce of sunscreen, an amount which is about equal 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.810
to the size of your palm.  

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.700
Thoroughly rub the product into the skin. 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.800
Don’t forget the top of your feet, your neck, ears, and the top of your head.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.910
Seek shade. Remember that the sun’s rays are strongest 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.210
between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.100
If your shadow is shorter than you are, seek shade.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.010
Protect your skin with clothing. 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.420
When going outside wear a long‐sleeved shirt, pants, 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.510
a wide‐brimmed hat and sunglasses. 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.910
Use extra caution near water, sand or snow as they reflect and 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.410
intensify the damaging rays of the sun, which can 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.910
increase your chances of sunburn.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.310
Get vitamin D safely. 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.610
Eat a healthy diet that includes foods naturally rich 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.810
in vitamin D, or take vitamin D supplements. 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.200
Do not seek the sun.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.410
If you want to look tan, consider using a self-tanning product, 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.300
but continue to use sunscreen with it.  

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.610
Don’t use tanning beds. 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.010
Just like the sun, UV light from tanning beds can cause

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.920
wrinkling and age spots and can lead to skin cancer. 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.100
Check your skin for signs of skin cancer.  

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.920
Your birthday is a great time to check your birthday suit. 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.210
Checking your skin and knowing your moles are key 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.220
to detecting skin cancer in its earliest, most treatable stages. 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.910
If you spot anything changing, growing or bleeding, see your dermatologist. 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.376
