THE OIL

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:18.230
The engine will run 24/7 while we’re out in sub-zero 
temperatures of minus 50 degrees – so that’s where 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.020
the oil plays a huge part because if we don’t have good 
oils in the engine, running your engine 24/7 could be a 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.000
huge problem. Oil is like the lifeblood of an engine – 
just imagine the blood in your body; we need it to get 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.160
PAUL MARSH – ADVENTURE MECHANIC

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.160
our muscles to move – well the engine needs it in the 
same way – for the parts to function in the engine, for 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.010
them to go up and down continuously at these 
temperatures – you’ve got to have oil. But you need special 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.080
oil for temperatures like this because minus 50 is a very 
seriously low temperature – and only a really good quality 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.170
oil like the Shell Helix oil we’ve put in will do the job.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.230
This is our safety, this is our lifeline – if this thing packs 
up we’re in the middle of nowhere at extreme temperatures 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.120
and we won’t survive – we’ve got good, warm kit but we 
rely on this engine more than you could believe.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.240
We want to see how the oil has been affected by this 
icy cold temperature. This is a mineral based oil – it’s 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.180
about a 20/20 grade, something we bought locally. I’d 
like to catch it but this is like treacle – you would not want 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:24.140
this oil in your engine. Here’s the next oil – this again is 
a mineral oil – it’s a 20/50, more of a summer oil. You can 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.100
see that this is like treacle as well. This is almost frozen – 
almost like an ice cube. The next oil we’ve got is a fully 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.120
synthetic Shell Helix oil and as you can see – this is running.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.060
The oil has got a detergent in it to clean the engine out – 
so we expect a bit of discoloration in the oil.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.110
Oil does its job over a period of time – if you look at this oil 
now; it’s black. That just shows that the oil has collected the 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.140
impurities that it needs to; the soot that goes around the 
engine – and still I could run this oil for longer – but because 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.090
we’ve run these vehicles 24/7 at temperatures at minus 50, 
we just thought it really good to take a good change of oil.
