00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.690
Why go through the
hassle and expense

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.650
of rebuilding the broken T5 in
your 83 to 93 Mustang 5.0, when

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.770
you can pick up a
heavy duty brand

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.980
new unit for just
a few dollars more.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.480
The Ford racing M 7003z
super duty T5 transmission

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.610
gives you a lot of
bang for your buck.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.730
Starting out at the front, it
has a steel bearing retainer

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.960
already installed.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.220
And it has the 93
cobra style pocket

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.170
bearing on the input shaft.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.610
The double Molly second,
third, and counter shaft gears

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.720
give you increased durability.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.390
The case is the latest
revision offering you

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.840
the highest strength.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.521
It also has installed the
desirable 7 tooth speedometer

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:42.020
gear.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.000
So if you're replacing an
eight tooth drive gear unit,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.840
then you need to replace
your driven gear accordingly.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.930
And you can use our
speedometer gear calculator

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.250
to help you out with that.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.150
Third and fourth have
carbon blocker rings.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.950
And all the synchronizers
and bearings

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.420
are upgraded throughout.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.070
It has a stock style Mustang
shifter installed on it

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.060
already, but you can
pop that off and install

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.160
a short throw shifter,
like our SV Mongoose.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.010
This is quite literally
a bolt in upgrade

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.750
for any 83 to 93
Mustang 5.0 that

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.600
originally came with the T5.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.080
It also features a much more
friendly set of gear ratios.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.290
First gear being 295, second
gear 194, third gear 134,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.735
fourth is a direct one
to one, and fifth gear

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:26.360
is a very highway friendly 0.63.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.890
The input shaft features
a Stockton splines.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.370
And the output shaft
features a stock 28.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.280
It does come dry, so
you'll need to add fluid.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.860
Recommended oils are
Mercon or Textron

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.480
3 automatic transmission
fluid, GM synchro mesh,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.151
or my favorite The Royal
Purple synchro max.

00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:46.150
Don't freak out when you
look in the tail shaft,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.470
there is a rubber plug
there to block off

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.690
any debris from getting
in your new transmission.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.620
Whenever you shove
the drive shaft in,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.900
it'll push it into place.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.940
This heavy duty world
class transmission

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.370
is rated at 300 pound
foot torque capacity.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.160
However, they have
been known to handle

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.330
quite a bit more than that.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.940
Remember the killers
of T5 transmissions

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.720
are aggressive clutches
and sticky tires.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.500
So if you stick to something
in the stage one clutch line

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.160
and don't go over a
drag radial, your T5

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.720
will probably live a
long and happy life.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.410
You can grab yours at
latemodelrestoration.com.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.597
