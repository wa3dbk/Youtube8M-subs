00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.820
I discovered that I could fall in love with a woman.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.640
She said: It's not a big deal, it just means 
you're a lesbian. Then the penny dropped.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.680
I couldn't enjoy being touched. That was tough.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.390
My husband and I went to therapy 
because I couldn't stand any sexual contact with him.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.540
It almost made me sick. 
And then we had to learn how to have sex all over again...

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.150
We got pamphlets and watched films, 
but nothing seemed to help.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.810
The feelings didn't come back.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.400
And then, in my second year of therapy, 
I fell head over heels in love with my therapist.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.250
She was a lesbian too, although I didn't know it at the time. 
But I really fell for her.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.560
My whole body reacted. I felt like a teenager again.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.550
At the time, she was very clear that 
she loved me as much as her girlfriend.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.710
She felt most complete with both of us.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.510
It was really tough, the days that she was gone, 
the dates that she went on with her girlfriend.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.050
But I thought: ok, I'll get used to it. 
We went on vacation with the family...

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.890
... but my wife was so depressed 
and missed her girlfriend so much.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.020
And it was then that I said we should probably split up.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.020
She was so shocked that I would see it that way.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.510
She said: I would rather break up with my girlfriend, 
because I'd rather stay with you.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.100
Once I knew, the problem became: Nhow do I tell my husband and kids?

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.770
It was a long time before I had the courage to tell them, but I finally did. First my husband.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.850
And he said: it's just a phase, it will pass.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.140
My husband wouldn't let me tell anyone, 
not even our own kids.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.870
And then I told him: Jan, I want to stay with you...

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.430
... but as brother and sister - I can't share a bed with you any more. 
And that was really tough for him.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.800
He said: Anne, I can't handle that. 
If that's the case, then you'll have to leave.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.800
There we met other people in the same situation...

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.900
We both got a lot of support there, but especially my husband.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.660
I was really in bad shape. I wasn't sleeping well 
and I couldn't function at work.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.270
I got sick and finally went for help.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.650
Social workers led me to the Orpheus foundation.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.100
I went to an open house 
and that was the first time that I felt understood.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.940
Here were all these people going through the same thing.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.680
That really helped a lot.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.310
Leaving my husband was really tough, but also a relief.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.120
Because I could finally be myself.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.080
That felt so good - to really be able to be myself.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.310
Why do you stay with her?

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.760
Because she's the love of my life. 
It's not like you get used to it and then it gets easier...

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.600
... but now it's a conscious choice.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.250
When she's away it's sometimes tough, but then again...

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.970
... if she feels complete, that benefits our relationship.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.670
We think we've found a good balance 
and we expect to grow old together.
