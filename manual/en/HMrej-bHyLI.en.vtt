00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.150
If you want to achieve a hardcore smoky eye,
there are several steps that I am going to

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.860
instruct you on.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.830
Right now Bobby has tips from our basic smoky
eye, so what we did to achieve this first

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.000
prime.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.460
You always want to prime.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.610
Next, we did a little bit of black liner,
the Urban Decay Perversion liner, and we smudged

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.910
that up with a smudge brush and a little bit
of black shadow and then blended it.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.620
We also took the shadow down underneath with
the smudge brush, and that's basically where

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.750
we are now, but we're going to continue to
build upon this to basically make it a little

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.010
more hardcore.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.450
I'm going to start by using a little bit more
liner.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.090
Starting with the lash line again, I'm actually
going to bring the wing out a little bit more

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.420
here because we're going to make it a little
more intense.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.680
Don't be afraid to just kind of get in there
and fill it in.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.239
I'm going to make it nice and dark.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:08.350
Don't worry if the line is not perfect because
we're just going to be blending and smudging.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.110
So now that we have the intensity starting
at the lash, we're going to blend it up so

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.310
it's fading more.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.900
We don't want it to just look like a chunk.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.390
I'm going to take the smudge brush, a little
bit of black and going right on top of that.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.060
You want to work quickly so that this doesn't
set.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.280
You really want a nice concentration of shadow
and, if you see, I'm kind of bringing the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.009
line this way I'm going to make that a little
bit clean.

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.751
We'll clean this part up afterward so that
it's nice and clean, but I'm going to bring

00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:47.869
the shape of the shadow out this way.

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.579
One cool thing to make an eye to look a little
more hardcore is I'm actually going to incorporate

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.040
a kind of cobalt blue color.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.400
The shadow that I'm using right now are from
the Urban Decay smoke palette which I really

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.400
love.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.520
It's perfect for any type of smoky eye that
you're doing.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.580
You can get a natural smoky eye from this.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.230
You can get any type of color smoky eye or
even a deep smoky eye like this.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.769
Also another tip, tapping on the shadow in
some areas if you're [inaudible 02:20] pigment.

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.209
Also, since this is a dark color, you want
to be careful.

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.739
You don't want too much fallout, but if fallout
does happen, it's fine.

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.099
We can clean it up.

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.920
I'm just going to tape it in, doing tiny little
strokes like this.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.219
Since we're making it hardcore, I almost want
it to look like her eyes are deeper in her

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:44.680
sockets, so I'm going to take the darkness
up this way towards her brow bone.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.829
We're not going to go any higher towards the
brow on this outer edge.

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:55.879
Now I'm about to start adding in the blue
to get the little two-toned effect, and I'm

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.569
going to use a little more of a compact brush.

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.269
It's not quite as compact as the smudge brush,
but this will do just fine in the blue.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:13.450
I'm going to start the blue over in this corner
at the top, and start bringing it over on

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.780
top to the line we had already made on the
outer corner with the black.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.279
If you can see, it's kind of fading from darkest
to lightest since we've got a really intense

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:29.769
black pigment down towards the lash.

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.029
I'm going to go back through with a little
bit of black again at the lash line; I really

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:39.029
want to make sure that the lash line is the
darkest part of the eye.

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:43.389
So when you're doing a smoky eye, you really
want to concentrate on the gradation of color.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.709
You want it to be very smooth and blended.

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.389
So now I'm going to do a little bit of blending.

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.530
I'm actually taking the lightest color in
the palette, which is called [kinky], and

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.480
I'm going to go at the brow bone and just
kind of blend it down.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.959
That's not quite as harsh up here.

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.049
I like to take a little bit of the light color,
too, and do this outer side.

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.579
It kind of cleans up the look and take it
around the side.

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.949
Any type of edge, you kind of want to blend
down so that it's not too harsh.

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.930
Here we go, and now I'm going to do a little
bit of work underneath the eye.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.979
I'm going to bring the blue, since we concentrated
the blue right over here, I'm going to concentrate

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:35.659
a little bit right here on the eye.

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:44.990
I'm going to put a little more black in the
outer corner, and you want to make sure that

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.639
the upper shadow is connected to the bottom
shadow, so I'm doing a little work in this

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.800
corner over here.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:01.060
The last step for this eye is to use the black
liner on the inside, so I'm going to do the

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.470
inner end now.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:09.410
I'm just pulling down on the eyelid a little
bit and going ahead and lining.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.470
You want to make sure that there's no white
space between the lash line and where your

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.990
lining is, so you can take on the outside
when you're done and do a little bit right

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:28.169
here, a little bit over on this corner right
here.

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:36.650
And there you have it, a hardcore smoky eye.
