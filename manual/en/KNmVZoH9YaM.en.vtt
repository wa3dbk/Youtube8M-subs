"Thought"!
Andy, Elidio and José will play!

00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:07.517
In this game, the players
will start a scene,

00:00:07.517 --> 00:00:12.664
whenever I want to hear one
of the characters' thoughts,

00:00:12.664 --> 00:00:14.250
I will ring the bell.

00:00:15.626 --> 00:00:20.603
I'd like to know from you,
what's your profession?

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:24.303
- Analyst.
- Of what? People?

00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:29.793
- IT analyst. - 'IT analyst'.
The "Thought Game" starts now!

00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:36.705
Mr. President.
The analyst is here, and he...

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.977
- Let him in!
- He will get into the espionage case,

00:00:40.977 --> 00:00:44.253
I am certain, he's the
best analyst we have!

00:00:44.535 --> 00:00:46.936
- Hello, Mr. President...
- Don't touch Mr. President!

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:51.164
I want to hear
Mr. President's thoughts.

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:55.087
I never knew what IT means.

00:00:57.168 --> 00:01:01.056
Mr. President, we believe the attacks...
May I use the computer?

00:01:01.056 --> 00:01:03.461
- You do IT, right?
- IT.

00:01:03.461 --> 00:01:04.892
- IT analyst.
- Yes, I am.

00:01:04.892 --> 00:01:08.683
We believe that the attacks
that occurred last tuesday,

00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:13.055
were originated from
Kazakyostan!

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:17.497
I want to know what the
president's assistant is thinking!

00:01:17.718 --> 00:01:20.991
Guard the door, that's what I do,
to guard the door!

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:27.002
I'm the right hand! I guard the door,
that's what I do, to guard the door!

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:31.232
I like to guard doors!
Door! That's what I do!

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:36.469
I like that. I like... Wait! Door?
It's mine! Nobody touches this door!

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.245
- Well...
- You have to be careful!

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:42.523
- Of course.
- This is very important!

00:01:42.743 --> 00:01:48.326
The intel we have is
that at two-forty seven,

00:01:48.326 --> 00:01:52.902
we believe that, by accessing
this website, you actually

00:01:52.902 --> 00:01:56.421
left a breach in the system...

00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:59.405
I want to hear the president's thoughts.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.129
Could IT mean 'intelligent traffic'?

00:02:05.143 --> 00:02:08.487
Could it be 'immortal turtle'?

00:02:08.617 --> 00:02:10.647
What could it be?

00:02:11.247 --> 00:02:14.004
Help me, please...
An entire city is...

00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:17.379
They're invading right now, sir!

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.434
Where?

00:02:20.045 --> 00:02:22.078
In the computer, idiot!

00:02:22.378 --> 00:02:24.473
I'll try to create a diversion!

00:02:24.473 --> 00:02:26.377
I'll find where they are
accessing from!

00:02:26.377 --> 00:02:29.605
- Go!
- I'm tracing, and it comes from...

00:02:29.605 --> 00:02:30.906
The room on our right!

00:02:31.906 --> 00:02:33.586
Yes, the room on our right!

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.704
Room on our right!

00:02:35.704 --> 00:02:37.607
Analyst!

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:41.307
Room on our right. Room on our.
Room on...

00:02:41.307 --> 00:02:43.051
That's weird, it's
cacophonous or something!

00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:46.882
Roomonour. Room on our right.
Roomonouright.

00:02:46.882 --> 00:02:51.711
Room on our right. Room.
Roomonouright.

00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:54.182
Room on our right!

00:02:54.182 --> 00:02:57.886
How does he feel?
He's a little roomonouright!

00:02:58.486 --> 00:03:00.070
Let's go!

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.353
Follow me!

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.664
Freeze, Mr. President!

00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:08.293
You heard that, let's go back!

00:03:08.527 --> 00:03:09.545
Oh, my God!

00:03:09.545 --> 00:03:12.861
He must have turned back, because
he was in the room on our right!

00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:15.677
President's thoughts!

00:03:16.257 --> 00:03:19.822
'Italian tomato'?

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.578
- Hey, boy! Why...
- Get back! Who are you?

00:03:25.578 --> 00:03:29.062
I'm an information
technology analyst!
