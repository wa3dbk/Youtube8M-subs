Hello, my name is Giacomo Redondi.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.500
I am from Costa Volpino, a province of Bergamo.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.500
I'm a cross country rider.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.500
I started at the age of four. I started practicing  motocross from the year 2000 until 2009, where I won four Italian championships.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.500
Next, in 2010, I went on to do enduro. Last year I managed to win the World Championship and the Italian Championship in the 125 class.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:24.500
I started doing enduro because I live in the mecca of enduro, Bergamo. There are mountains and trails, enduro was born behind my house.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.500
Riding enduro is really nice because even around the world you don't get to see these landscape images.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:55.500
You must always improvise on driving, then you have to adapt to all situations because there is water, stones, sand, asphalt... you find everything and I really like it.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.500
The cross country driving style requires a lot of strength.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.500
You must meet any movement that the bike may have facing any obstacle or unexpected moment that you find during the race.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.200
The bike is like a runaway horse in the midst of rocks, river crossings, and sand.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:41.500
This is the second year that I'm with KTM, so I found the bike that I really like. I'm ready to battle and win the World Championships in 2013.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.000
Greetings from Red, follow me in the next stages of the World.
