[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.255 --> 00:00:09.080
Hey, everybody.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.250
Jamin here from "Game/Show."

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.760
I'm here in the amazing
city of Portland, Oregon.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.407
And here's Steve
Gaynor, who is--

00:00:14.407 --> 00:00:15.490
Co-founder of Fullbright.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.510
And we are in his
studio right now.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.030
And I have some questions
for him about life,

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.402
love, and "Gone Home."

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:22.110
Let's get going.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.050
All right.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.950
"Gone Home" is kind of held up
as like a-- it's kind of like

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.920
the example that people use
on the game/not-game kind

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.510
of debate.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.070
I recently did an
episode on this

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.014
about the meaning
of that question.

00:00:36.014 --> 00:00:37.930
I guess, first of all,
was that an expectation

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.722
that you all had before
releasing the game,

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:41.971
that this was going to be
something that people talked

00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:43.350
about when they played it.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.134
And how do you typically
respond to that?

00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:48.300
It's not always a criticism.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.730
But a criticism or observation.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.980
It wasn't something that
I'd pictured in those terms.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.570
I mean, A, because
I thought there

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.900
were a lot of precedents
for it, like "Dear

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.670
Esther" and "Proteus."

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.880
There are games that are
just about being in a place

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.560
and navigating
through and having

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.720
that aesthetic experience.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.160
And even shortly after
"Gone Home" came out,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.285
"Stanley Parable" came out.

00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:14.826
And that's very much just like,
oh, you navigate in the space

00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:15.880
and find what's there.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.504
And it's in a very
different structure.

00:01:17.504 --> 00:01:20.634
But I feel like I
wasn't thinking about it

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:22.800
before the game came out,
because I'm like, oh, it's

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.091
kind of like these other games.

00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:29.180
Part of it is that we
were very fortunate to get

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.295
a lot of critical phrase
from mainstream outlets

00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:40.140
that back to back gave us a 9.5
and GTA 5 a 9.5 or something.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.300
And I think there's sort of
this upsetting of expectations

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.200
of what kind of experience fits
into that "IGN gave it a 9.5"

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.460
space from this
audience that has

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.020
been following this stuff every
day for a really long time.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.320
And I think that's why
it's like, well, you

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.330
gave this a high score.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.788
But it's not even
a game, you know?

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:05.200
It's kind of why that became
part of the narrative.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.000
"Gone Home" is not a
traditional AAA-style game

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.926
in a lot of ways, because
we as the designers

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.550
don't track a lot of
what you're doing.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.260
We're not giving
you feedback on,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.510
here's an achievement for
finding another audio diary.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.167
Or like, here's a puzzle.

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:23.250
Then you have to solve it.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.500
And then once you solve it,
we're like, you solved it,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.740
and now you can go to the
next level or something.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.395
It's much more sort of like,
we let you into the house,

00:02:31.395 --> 00:02:35.220
and then we go hands off,
and we just say, explore.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.059
There's very level
designy gating of,

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:39.100
like, you do have to find
the key to the basement

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.770
before you can go
into the basement.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.000
But it's all based on
those core verbs of just,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.710
like, you explore enough to
find enough information to get

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.489
to the next area to explore
until you've finally exposed

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:53.780
all of the content in the game.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.935
You can think, oh, OK, so
that's what the story was

00:02:55.935 --> 00:02:56.810
about the whole time.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.255
Or you kind of make those
interpretations yourself.

00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:05.970
But I think that a game can be
about using interactive tools

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.940
to become familiar
with the story

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.520
by mining it out
of an environment.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.180
And that's a kind of game.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.640
Do people speed-run
"Gone Home"?

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.450
Yes, definitely.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.470
What's the current--

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.620
48 seconds.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.481
[LAUGHS]

00:03:20.481 --> 00:03:20.980
Gone-- yeah.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.498
Gone, came, and went.

00:03:22.498 --> 00:03:24.590
[LAUGHS]

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.066
The thing is, it was
designed that way.

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:30.014
So I think, on some level,
as you place through a game

00:03:30.014 --> 00:03:31.680
and you get more
familiar with its rules

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.096
on how to interact
with it, you're

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:36.234
gaining facility with
just your ability

00:03:36.234 --> 00:03:37.400
to be effective in the game.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.270
And a big part of the experience
of your first time playing

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.360
the game might be like,
oh, I didn't realize

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.020
there was this passageway here.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.510
I didn't realize this
connected to this.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.660
And so by the end
of the game, you've

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.780
build this whole mental
map of, not just the floor

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.980
plan of the house, but
how it interconnects

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.465
and what the secret ways to get
from point A to point B are.

00:03:58.465 --> 00:04:01.200
And so I thought it was
really valuable to be

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.980
able to say getting
just to the last room,

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.240
like to the end of the
game, from the opening

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.740
credits to the
closing credits isn't

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.982
based on-- you
have to go upstairs

00:04:10.982 --> 00:04:13.315
to get the key to go downstairs
to go into the east wing

00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:14.710
to get the key to go up.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.589
It's like you go through all
that stuff on your first time

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.736
through to gain the
knowledge that the key was

00:04:21.736 --> 00:04:24.360
accessible from the beginning if
you'd just known where it was,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.620
right?

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.703
And so people would start
it over after the point.

00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:29.370
They're like, oh wait, if I
just go here and get the key,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.290
I can go straight to the end.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.520
And that's awesome.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.090
But the more exciting
version of, I think,

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.671
"Gone Home" speed runs is people
that do 100%, speed run, which

00:04:38.671 --> 00:04:41.170
is you have to get every audio
diary before you complete it,

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.820
because people are
really creative with,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.361
like, OK, if I go
upstairs first then

00:04:44.361 --> 00:04:45.884
take the back way
into the basement

00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:47.550
and then back up
through the east wing--

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.841
It's like "Supermarket Sweep."

00:04:48.841 --> 00:04:49.970
It is, yeah.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.680
And they're optimizing
their path by,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.388
like, wait, I know
all these connections,

00:04:53.388 --> 00:04:55.660
and if I go here and here
and here, then they're

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.412
really strategizing and
thinking about the game in a way

00:04:58.412 --> 00:05:00.620
that I didn't think about
it when I was the designer.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.840
That's really cool to see.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.170
What's-- I guess,
what's next for you guys,

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.950
either conceptually or,
you know, as a studio,

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.250
you have one big
game under your belt.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.930
What direction would you like
to see Fullbright take over

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.620
the coming next couple years.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.250
I mean, we were four people
that made "Gone Home."

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.800
And we don't want to get a
whole lot better, you know?

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.850
We've hired a couple
more people since then.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.280
It's like 100 people.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.460
Not more than 100.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.930
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.630
We're working on
our next game now.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.850
And it's taking "Gone
Home"'s core gameplay

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.570
experience of exploration
and finding stuff

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.160
and being in this environment.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.940
But it contains the story
of what happened there.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.020
And we're building
on it, because we

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.890
don't want to repeat
ourselves and just

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.590
say, well, let's do another
house with stuff in it.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.060
But it's a different house.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.880
But I think that we created a
really strong interactive base

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.890
in "Gone Home" of
being in a place

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.800
and being able to draw
meaning out of it.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.960
So taking that and taking the
next step that builds on it

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.940
and makes our next game feel
like it also stands on its own

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.560
is really important
to us, because that's

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.440
what's going to make
us excited about making

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.700
the game as developers.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.390
And hopefully that's
also what makes

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.932
the audience excited to
see what we're doing next.

00:06:15.932 --> 00:06:16.640
Well, that's it.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.840
Thank you so much,
Steve, for your time.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.830
And the laughter and
the joy that we had.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.120
We had wonderful time.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.940
And we'll see you all next week.
