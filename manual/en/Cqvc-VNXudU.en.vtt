00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:10.880
O.k. Main, main thing with any part of setting
up a tank is conservative. I'm not conservative.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.680
But we want to be conservative in how we do
all these things. In transporting the fish

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.600
to your tank, think conservative. You don't
want to just get the fish, obviously, and

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.470
just dump them in there. A couple of reasons.
Main one being that the temperatures have

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.269
to be the same. So what we're going to do,
we're going to take that fish bag, float it

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:44.710
in your tank. And one quality about water
is that it changes temperature very slowly

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:52.190
so that works in our advantage in this hobby.
So we're going to take the fish bag, float

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.069
it, open it up, and do nothing other than
just let that bag, with the fish inside this

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:03.210
bag, float in your tank. The water that they?re
going to go into for about twenty minutes.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.909
Now, obviously, if you have a lot of, if you
have a much larger amount of water, you're

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.450
going to maybe make that forty-five minutes
because that's just more water. But for most

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.340
purposes, fifteen, twenty minutes. You're
going to want to float that bag right there.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.649
What will happen in that fifteen, twenty minutes
is that this temperature inside the bag will

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.729
get the same temperature as the water it's
going into. Now after about fifteen, twenty

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:35.530
minutes it's a good idea to take some of your
water that it's going into and just put it

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.320
in. I might be better to have a cup, but if
you're going to use your hand like I'm doing

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.780
here, just make sure your hands are clean,
obviously. So that allows the fish to get

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.409
used to the water that they're actually going
to be going into. Again, we're just doing

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:55.799
the conservative thing here and kind of breaking
the transition down into little pieces here.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.929
So after this has been floating about a half
hour, very important point, get a little net.

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.820
Don't just dump the water into the tank. This
is especially crucial if your just starting

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.081
out. Because while those fish where in that
bag, ammonia is building up, some of their

00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:18.880
slime was coming off. So that's probably not
a good idea to just dump the water in. So

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.390
what we usually recommend is just getting
your net out and, again, keep conservative.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.830
Just net them in there and as quickly as possible
just right into the water. Just like that.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.000
It's o.k. if you get two or three, two fishes
in. That's fine, of course. And there we got

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.050
some happy fishes in there, and they're going
to quickly acclimate to that environment there

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.470
that you've set up. So, there we go, happy
fishes.
