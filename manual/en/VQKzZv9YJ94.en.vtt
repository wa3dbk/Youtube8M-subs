Adobe Photoshop is a registered trademark
of Adobe Systems Incorporated. I am in no

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.589
way affiliated with Adobe. Hi, I'm Steve Anthony.
I'm a photographer and digital retouching

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:19.830
artist here in New York City. In this clip
we're going to talk about using a digitizing

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.439
tablet for working in Photoshop. Now you can
certainly use your computer and mouse and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.500
millions of people do that everyday. But if
you want to get - have some really, really

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.910
fine level control over your image manipulation
in Photoshop you really need to have some

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.690
sort of a digitizing tablet. In this case
all it is is a - it's a tablet and a pen which

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:52.100
functions as an editing tool. I'll show you
what I mean. Now if I were to take this picture

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:07.550
and I wanted to, I don't know, for example,
draw a mustache on it. Well I could do that

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:16.800
with my mouse, if I really had to, I'd make
a pretty bad mess with it, but if I were using

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:27.700
a digitizing tablet it really is just like
drawing with a pen on a piece of paper. Now

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:36.320
this is perhaps not the best example of what
I'm talking about. So let me show you just

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:45.880
a blank image. And what you can do with a
 - now if I were to write my name with the

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:54.860
mouse,
it can be done, but as you can see it's quite

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.580
tedious and cumbersome. Whoops. And it's very
easy to make a serious mistake like that,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:15.450
whereas again, with a tablet it's just like
I'm drawing on a piece of paper.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.820
And it's also pressure sensitive so as you
increase the pressure it gets to be like - like

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:32.430
you're using any other artist's tool. And
you can - just by using - if you use the right

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:48.380
brush simply the pressure of your pen changes
the thickness and the attributes of the brush.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.880
If I don't use much pressure it's a fairly
thin line, if I press down hard it's a very

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:02.400
thick line.
Now this, you know obviously I'm just doodling,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:11.959
this is not really showing you how to make
best use of a tablet but if you were to be

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:20.170
editing a picture for example, being able
to have a very fine adjustment for doing things

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:32.349
like, for example, dodging. It's good to have
a very, very light touch, now in this case

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:39.180
I'm doing a rather odd effect just so you
can see what I'm doing. Lightening the area

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:47.709
under the glasses, but you can see I can have
a very, very fine control as opposed to the

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:55.060
rather cumbersome control of the mouse. They're
inexpensive, I highly recommend if you're

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.000
going to spend any time at all with Photoshop,
get yourself a digitizing tablet, and I think

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.959
you'll find it'll open up a world of new and
exciting possibilities in Photoshop. I'm Steve

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.209
Anthony and this has been how to use a digitizing
tablet with Photoshop.
