00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.819
\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is a TF Source video review
of the coronation add-on kit for deluxe Starscream

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:15.250
by Megavolt Robot Factory. Starscream seems
to have received a lot of love recently. We've

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.080
all ready reviewed the Gentai Ghost Starscream
exclusive, an even larger and more expensive

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.730
ghost version of the Masterpiece mold has
finally been confirmed via photos in Figure

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.500
King Magazine, and the debatably best leader
class mold from Revenge Of the Fallen will

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.629
be the as of yet unreleased Starscream. The
most iconic image of Starscream after his

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.230
ghostly visage is his brief stint as the newly
appointed Decepticon Leader in the Transformers

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.540
Animated movie. This version has been coined
Coronation Starscream and has only seen a

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:53.250
handful of official figures, all of them non-transformable
busts or figurines. Back in 2008 3rd Party

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.730
Toy maker TFclub released an add-on set for
the Masterpiece Starscream mold, and even

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.680
a Skywarp variant. The set was very popular
amongst Starscream fans and it lead us to

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.959
the upcoming 2010 release of the coronation
add-on kit for deluxe Starscream by Megavolt

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:17.729
Robot Factory. This add-on kit comes in a
simple carded bubble. The back of the package

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.630
labels this product as MRF-00001, signifying
this as Megavolt Robot Factory's first item

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.779
to be made publicly available. Also on the
back is illustration showing an all black

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:34.499
Starscream decked out in the coronation gear
lurched onto a throne holding a robotic head.

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:35.590
Apparently, the original concept for the packaging
bubble was to mimic the shape of this throne

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.609
so that Coronation Starscream would be able
to sit on it. The concept was unfortunately

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.549
abandoned due to production issues. The package
includes 9 pieces total - a pair of shoulder

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.890
pads, replacement null-rays, and wing-joint
assemblies. A single crown, cloth cape, and

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.109
Leader-1 replacement head are also included.
\b

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.659
\b0 This add-on kit is not as removable as
owners of the original Masterpiece coronation

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.319
kit might expect. Kit-bashers and moderate
customizers should have no problem assembling

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.009
the pieces, but I will stress that the final
assembly is somewhat permanent. A phillips

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.639
head screw driver will be required and additional
tools such as a dermal may increase the ease

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:12.200
of assembly. Before we tackle the full assembly,
it should be noted that the kit can be somewhat

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.300
applied to the classics seeker mold without
disassembling any parts, however the cape

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.390
attaches better after replacing the wing hinges.
The shoulder pads, null-rays and crown can

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.411
be easily applied to the figure and effortlessly
removed. However, to really get the most out

00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:33.751
of this add-on kit, you'll have to get your
hands dirty and replace the wing hinges. It

00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:38.550
is the suggestion of this reviewer to use
the add-on kit with the Hasbro 20th anniversary

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.420
Starscream due to the white nature of the
plastic used for the wing hinges and null

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.730
rays. The kit works with any version of the
seeker mold, but the colors seem to look most

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.030
graceful with the 20th version. To complete
the wing hinge transfer, start with the figure

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.860
in Jet mode. Remove the screws that adhere
the wings to the hinge with your phillips

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.770
screwdriver and put them to the side. You
may now want to test the kit hinges by placing

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.850
them on the wings to make sure they fit. If
you have any trouble due to warping, you can

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.930
try using an x-acto blade to shave off some
plastic so that the hinges can fit snugly

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.301
into the wing. Do not screw the new hinges
in yet. Removing the original wing hinges

00:03:18.301 --> 00:03:23.090
proved to be a tricky process for me, but
using the blunt edge of the x-acto blade to

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.330
wedge the hinge bit from the rotating assembly,
provided just enough leverage to force the

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.930
hinge to pop off of the main figure. If you
choose to use an x-acto blade, please be careful

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.879
not to cut yourself while forcing the pieces
apart. The next step proved the most difficult

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.050
 - pegging the new hinges onto the figure's
main body. I found it easier to force the

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.660
hinge on without the wing attached, but either
way will work. Just make sure you don't put

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.310
the wrong hinge on the wrong side of the figure.
The hinges have a enlarged flat top which

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.170
is used to secure the peg within the peg hole,
but be careful not to force the peg in too

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.710
hard. Over-exertion may cause the delicate
peg to snap off or create stress marks. I

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.540
used a dremel tool to create a bevel on the
pegs. This made it a bit easier to ease the

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.390
peg into the peg hole, but do this adjustment
at your own risk. Additional instructions

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.239
from Megavolt Robot Factory will be linked
in the info of this video. When all is said

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.449
and done, you should end up with an incredibly
augmented figure. The wings can now rotate

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.520
on an additional axis and fold backwards,
much like the original G1 seeker toy. This

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.199
is an under-advertised benefit of this add-on
kit. Starscream's wings no longer need to

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.279
lie flat against his back, which now allows
the cape to position correctly behind him.

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:45.669
Once the cape is added, the colors of 20th
Anniversary starscream really sing. The crown,

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.029
cape and red paint on this figure create an
almost neon comic book appearance. As icing

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:55.150
on the cake, the kit includes a head that
can replace the original seeker head by removing

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.790
a pin. Whose head you may ask? None other
than Gobot Leader-1's cartoon face! Those

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.130
that have been fiending for a Leader-1 seeker
redeco can finally rejoice. The one major

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.410
shortcoming of this set is probably the crown,
which seems a little bit over-sized. In fact,

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.349
when placed on the head, it can no longer
rotate. However, the added wing articulation

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:23.509
more than makes up for this slight problem.
If you are a Starscream nut, you have to get

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.300
this add-on kit. The permanentness of this
set is also appealing since it does in fact

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.840
change the figure. Moderate to extreme customizers
will enjoy the process of putting this add-on

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.099
kit together, while it is also a great entry
project into the world of customizing for

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:43.370
beginners. The short-comings are few and Megavolt
has even shown a willingness to listen to

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.889
fans after public outcry coaxed the company
to decrease the size of the crown and null-rays

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.969
to the current proportions. This is a unique
kit that greatly improves the figure it is

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:57.159
meant to augment. If this is the first we've
seen from Megavolt, we can definitely look

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:01.400
forward to what the company has in store for
the future. In closing I would like to recount

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.460
this quote from the company's founder: Transformers
have always been a passion and a hobby of

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.289
mine, and I'm just really excited that something
I created can be enjoyed by other fans. Of

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.409
course, what happens next depends on how well
this coronation kit does, but I am already

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:23.629
busy designing the next project, and crossing
my fingers! Well Megavolt Robot Factory, we

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:34.849
are ready and waiting

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:44.710
for your next project.}
