00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.720
As with every new entry into a range of football
boots, fans of the last model want to know

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.300
- which is the better boot?

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.670
So, with the launch of the evoPOWER 1.2 earlier
this week, we figured we’d take a look at

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.480
how PUMA’s latest stacks up to it’s predecessor.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.660
Starting with the aesthetics, it’s clear
the design team at PUMA are feeling a little

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.410
bit more confident in the identity they want
to give the evoPOWER.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.660
The first evoPOWER 1 was a clean-looking boot,
for sure, but there were some design touches

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.000
we weren’t all that fond of, such as the
holographic finish on the upper.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.960
Here on the 1.2, PUMA have gone for a more
aggressive aesthetic, with the new Accufoam

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.170
layout giving the design team an excuse to
give the shoe a high-tech, futuristic look.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.470
Sticking with that Adap-Lite upper, and PUMA
have definitely made some changes in this

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.470
department.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.611
For starters, the upper on the first evoPOWER
had a very smooth, jelly-life feel both in

00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:17.250
hand and on foot; the frictionless finish
on the upper is compensated for rather nicely

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.400
by how soft and supple the upper is.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.310
Here on the 1.2, the Griptex finish on the
shoe feels like it will give a much tackier,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.110
more traditional feel on the ball from the
off, is still remarkably soft and stretchable

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.860
- but is still marginally less workable and
supple than it’s predecessor.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.380
The Accufoam in the upper is also a lot less
pronounced from the surface in the old model,

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.150
whereas the 1.2 has a thinner layer, but there’s
more of it.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:57.490
Finally, on the top of the boot the heel on
the evoPOWER 1.2 also undergoes a revamp,

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.100
with the achilles’ protector rising a little
higher up the back of the foot, and is also

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.500
a little more rigid, with PUMA apparently
engineering out the need for as soft of a

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:19.870
crumple zone in the heel.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.650
The outsole of both evoPOWERs is more or less
the same, with the Gradual Stability Frame

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.650
and traction plate

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.810
Despite these changes, both boots have the
same level of flex and bend that PUMA say

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.720
boosts shot power.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.610
Putting both boots on makes it really easy
to appreciate the differences between both

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.150
shoes. Whilst both versions of the evoPOWER
have a similar level of flex and bend in the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.430
soleplate, the upper on the first model is
much forgiving, but on the 1.2 it feels vastly

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.400
more supportive.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.440
The distinct impression that we get is that
PUMA have geared the evoPOWER 1.2 to be a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.290
more stable football boot - which is no small
feat considering the whole upper still has

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.290
to stretch downwards.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.159
It’s also obvious that PUMA have worked
to keep the fit the same, as both shoes have

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:22.700
the same shape - meaning they’re still a
great choice for wide footed players.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:30.090
So, bottom line: The fit and comfort of the
shoe remain the same, along with the outsole.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.450
But, the upper trades that smooth, jelly feeling
finish for a grippier, more textured version

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.630
that also brings in much more support and
the feeling of lockdown.
