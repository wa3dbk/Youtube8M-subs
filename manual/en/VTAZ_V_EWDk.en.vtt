00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.558
Today, as you can see behind me, we have a very special video about ultraLUUV.

00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:11.000
Whether you are hearing about ultraLUUV for the first time or not, stay tuned

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.500
as we are going to show you some amazing and exclusive footage!

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.752
Let’s start with the basic model, solidLUUV. 
And if you ask yourself what we are talking about

00:00:31.752 --> 00:00:40.338
solidLUUV is a stabilizer for cameras  that enables you to easily capture really smooth pictures, while in motion.

00:00:40.338 --> 00:00:51.081
You can attach cameras up 500 grams - for example, as you can see here, a 360 degree camera or a smartphone with a suitable adapter.

00:00:51.081 --> 00:01:04.417
It’s all possible, but today, it’s all about ultraLUUV. And the special thing about it is that it features an electronic stabilization module.

00:01:04.417 --> 00:01:12.745
The great thing about this combination is that if you buy a solidLUUV it’s possible to upgrade to ultraLUUV by purchasing the electronic gimbal,

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:18.482
as it is designed in a modular way that they are compatible with each other.

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:22.443
This way you’ll benefit from solidLUUV’s mechanical, full 3-axis stabilization

00:01:22.443 --> 00:01:27.113
and the electronic 3-axis gimbal on top, 
so that it’s actually a 2 x 3 axis stabilization

00:01:27.113 --> 00:01:30.892
that allows you to shoot incredibly smooth and stable footage.

00:01:30.892 --> 00:01:35.203
But now let’s have a look at ultraLUUV in action!

00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:47.443
Here I have ultraLUUV again. So, how do you hold it correctly?

00:01:47.443 --> 00:01:56.468
Just grab the grip with your thumb and index finger, place the other fingers underneath the handle and you can instantly hold it pretty securely.

00:01:56.468 --> 00:02:03.969
After a quick 10 minute crash course to get acquainted with ultraLUUV, it took me a few minutes and I could start filming immediately.

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.621
After that and I have to say that I was amazed by how easy it was, given the fact that I had never operated a steadycam before.

00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:17.649
Those of you who have operated a Glidecam or a Steadicam before know that it can take weeks or even months to get acquainted to the product

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:20.694
and to be able to shoot footage that looks somewhat acceptable.

00:02:20.694 --> 00:02:24.823
With ultraLUUV it’s really that simple: 
Grab it, take a few test shots and start shooting.

00:02:24.823 --> 00:02:29.644
It simply looks amazing as you can see in our splitscreen comparison sequence.

00:02:29.644 --> 00:02:35.006
The learning curve when using ultraLUUV is surprisingly steep in comparison to conventional steadycams.

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:40.621
Also, another advantage – and unfortunately, 
I cannot show you in full detail today -

00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:43.331
is how you can adjust the counterbalance weights.

00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:50.805
It’s all inside ultraLUUV’s drop-shaped base and as soon as the Kickstarter campaign starts, and the patent is finalized,

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:54.255
you’ll certainly get more details on that and probably also a full review on our channel.

00:02:54.255 --> 00:03:04.848
What I can tell you already is that there will be recommended weight setups and you don’t need to spend much time or effort balancing the stabilizer.

00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:12.482
And because the weights are placed inside the shell they are protected and cannot shift while filming.

00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:22.292
If you are interested in LUUV products, 
a Kickstarter campaign will start on September 22

00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:27.470
where you can secure your solidLUUV for only EUR 99 (approx. USD 109).

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:38.532
The price for the electronic version, ultraLUUV, will be announced at the start of the campaign.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.877
That is our review about ultraLUUV. It was a lot of fun, and thanks again to you for performing the stunts today.

00:03:46.877 --> 00:03:53.300
Have a look at his channel! You will find the link 
below and in the description of this video.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:01.823
If you liked it, then like our video and I hope to see you again soon with a full review and more details about how the weight setup works

00:04:01.823 --> 00:04:04.910
that certainly is pretty interesting for the techies here.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.800
Feel free to leave comments on this video and on what you would like to see next time.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.800
See you soon - bye bye!
