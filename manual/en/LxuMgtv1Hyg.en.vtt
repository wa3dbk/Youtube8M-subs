00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.870
Well today we have a gentle roll out
and then before we know it

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.740
the route will take us up hill and down
dale. And I must say it really does look like

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.170
it's a great day for the climbers.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.339
And it looks like this ride is going to
make for an amazing one, too.

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:26.410
Oh, someone's got a problem! You've to hand it
to these mechanics though, they certainly know

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.789
a thing or two about bike riding, I can
tell you.

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.250
They're always on hand to get the riders back on their way.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.739
Wharfedale is a very, very special place
in the world.

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.680
The bunch really does make a wonderful
sight doesn't it as it passes through

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.129
these lovely villages.

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.829
Ah, the director sportif is offering
encouragement from the team car! [dog woofs!]

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.500
And in good time too, we're now approaching
the slopes of Kidstones,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.129
the first climb of the day.

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.140
The canvas of the countryside can really be
appreciated from high vantage points

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.390
such as this.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.910
Now what goes up of course must come
down and it's a beautiful descend from here,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.379
 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.150
as the road bends its way now down into
the valley below.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.409
And even downhill you know it can be
thirsty work.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.600
And what better than a pit stop. And it looks
like the domestiques are on hand

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.009
to bring this leading pelaton

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.590
home much faster towards to refreshments.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.149
Well they're really enjoying these sweeping roads aren't they? And a chance now to speed though

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.740
Wensleydale and pick up the pace once
more.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.710
And those just wanting to enjoy the scenery
well they can always join the autobus.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.400
And from here the road will gradually
wind its way up towards the next mountain climb,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.361
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.869
and it's the iconic Buttertubs Pass. You
know it takes great determination

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.219
but the rewards are well worth it. What
an amazing sight.

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.560
The crowds have really come out in their
droves!

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.189
This beautiful area has to be seen to be
appreciated.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.569
Climbing the Buttertubs Pass is a great
achievement.

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.810
It's worth making the extra effort for a view
like this,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.790
and part of the adventures of riding a
bicycle. There's a real thrill too, when a

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.170
road twists and turns down from a climb,

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.730
and this requires great skill. Well you
know, nobody can argue can they,

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.720
Swaledale really is a beautiful part in the
Yorkshire Dales.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.100
And you know, I can't think of a better
way of bridging the gap.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.620
 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.780
I think the sprint leader's jersey is
in safe hands here.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.000
These roads really do make it a great
place for cyclists,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.159
the riders are working together

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.600
on the home stretch.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.069
And there's a breakaway, looks like he's
dashing for his tea!

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.109
But it looks like someone's had the same
idea,

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.200
and they're really flying.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.900
Now this is what I call a feed station!

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.920
He's enjoying his moment at the front of the pack isn't he?

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.430
Well she really has shown us some
great skills on the descends down from

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.200
the hills here

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.549
and she's now heading into Reeth, and look at this she's got a clear lead.

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.500
And this lead out train is certainly doing
its job.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.430
You know, the Yorkshire Dales have made
for an amazing day of cycling.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.700
This has certainly been a great day out.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.500
 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.629
 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:48.010
