00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.019
It was windy enough to blow the door off the
outhouse when my son-in-law Jason finally

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:13.169
got time for some farm pond bass fishing.
That’s Kansas early spring weather for you.

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:18.470
Normally, he flyfishes, but in today’s wind
and waves, he adapted to a spinning rod and

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.230
the old reliable No. 3 Mepps spinner.
And that turned out just right. The bass were

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.859
hungry after a cold winter, and the spinner
blades flashing in clear water fooled them

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.710
into thinking, “minnow.” Time after time,
fish ranging from one to four pounds smashed

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:43.699
the lure – helping show why bass fishing
is the most popular angling sport in America.

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.220
You can do the same thing wherever you live.
Smaller farm ponds, state fishing lakes and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.829
community lakes warm up earlier than larger
reservoirs. And spring fishing will be good

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:02.280
at these lakes first. Consult the 2010 Kansas
Fishing Atlas for maps of all state- and community-owned

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.610
lakes, as well as private waters leased and
open to fishing through KDWP’s FISH program.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.020
More than 100,000 private farm ponds wait
across the state with outstanding bass fishing.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.200
With a little legwork and personal contact,
you can get permission to fish your own secret

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.829
fishing hole.
In early spring, surprising success can be

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:32.020
had on smaller waters by simply bank fishing
with a modest spinning rig, 8-pound test line,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.180
and an in-line spinner found just about anywhere
fishing tackle is sold. No fancy tricks are

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.040
needed. Largemouth bass are hungry now and
will readily strike an inline spinner that

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.740
is simply retrieved at a steady pace. And
to make things better, other gamefish like

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.899
crappie, walleye, and white bass strike these
lures as well.

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:01.420
Wind often roils clear water in shallow coves,
and bass often feed along the visible line

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.330
where clear and murky water mingle. Wave action
often cuts underwater light levels from bright

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.030
overhead daylight, making gamefish more active
during good fishing hours.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.500
So the same wind that made it hard to stand
up probably helped the fishing. Jason had

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.660
only two hours to fish, and he ended up catching
and releasing more than 30 nice bass. That’s

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.830
enough to get you fired up for Kansas’ great
fishing that always marks April and May.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.870
Buy a Kansas fishing license and enjoy this
thrilling action for yourself. I’m Mike

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.050
