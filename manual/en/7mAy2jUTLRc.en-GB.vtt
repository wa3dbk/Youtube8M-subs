Hey guys! Welcome back to Mimeiku!

00:00:02.864 --> 00:00:09.774
Today I'm going to be using this brand, Star 
 of the Color, for my base makeup!

00:00:09.774 --> 00:00:12.253
Apparently this is used in Hollywood! Oooh-la-la!

00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:20.398
I'll be using the palette with cream foundation, 
 blush and highlight, and the powder. 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.515
And the sponge provided!

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:25.559
Let's do it!

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.282
First up, foundation!

00:00:28.826 --> 00:00:33.308
With this foundation a little bit goes a REALLY 
 long way, so don't use too much!

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:39.407
So I'm going to apply the foundation with the sponge 
 and then blend it out with the sponge too!

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:06.464
Next up we're going to use the highlight colour!

00:01:06.464 --> 00:01:12.471
And this can be use on your undereye circles, any 
 redness, any spots, and also any dark areas. 

00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:16.134
I went with the highlight because of my ghost white complexion, but 

00:01:16.134 --> 00:01:22.663
they can make the palette with a darker contour shade!

00:01:39.857 --> 00:01:42.460
I mostly used the sponge, but you can of course 
 use a brush to blend the highlight out!

00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:58.980
And I'm going to use a concealer brush to hide mah spotty spot!

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:03.870
And now for the blush!

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.580
Using the sponge like this...!

00:02:07.852 --> 00:02:10.050
And tapping off the excess

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:20.730
Then turn it around to blend!

00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:34.040
And of course we need to set it all with powder!

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.570
All finished! 

00:02:52.517 --> 00:02:58.100
What I really love about this brand is how little product 
 you need to use - it's gonna last me forever!

00:02:58.105 --> 00:02:59.980
I also like to carry it in my makeup pouch! 

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:04.017
