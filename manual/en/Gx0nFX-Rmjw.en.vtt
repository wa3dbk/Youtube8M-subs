00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:31.520
Forget the violence.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:45.980
Forget the sex.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.940
Forget everything that makes this game so
shocking.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.370
Theyíre mere footnotes in terms of what itís
truly about.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.859
More than any of its multitude of situations
that would cause parents and activist groups

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.620
to collectively sh*t themselves, this is a
game that simply gets it.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.559
It gets the inherent absurdity.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.930
It gets the tradition.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:17.450
It gets what has always made video games fun.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.460
A sequel to the 2008 original and modern cult
classic, No More Heroes 2 speaks its intentions

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.770
loudly and wears its flaws proudly.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.850
More importantly, itís confident enough to
know itís doing something special.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.280
After all, from organizing petitions to whining
on the Internet, weíve all had our own ways

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.220
of dealing with the Wiiís lack of mature
games.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:51.110
Our own ways of coping.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.280
And so he does.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.640
Over and over again.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.060
An assassin who is yet again out to climb
the ranks and prove heís the best in the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.039
world at what he does, Travis Touchdown has
an electric laser swordódonít call it a

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.760
light saberóas well as an attitude and personality
which effectively parody the very nerds controlling

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.760
him.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.820
Of course, itís also a celebration of that
culture.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.310
As much as its a modern take on the traditional
beat ëem up, No More Heroes 2 is also a video

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.590
game about video games.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:31.200
To earn money, Travis takes odd jobs that
transform him into things like an 8-bit coconut

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200
grabber.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.800
Because who doesnít like to grab a nice,
fuzzy pair of coconuts?

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:54.599
And on a totally unrelated note, uh...this
game is a bit perverse.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.620
Gameplay is very similar to the first.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.050
You move Travis with the analog stick on the
nunchuk, and you swing your sword with the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.050
A button.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.739
But your brutal kills and even a selection
of wrestling maneuvers can be used with situational

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.659
motion, and it works brilliantly.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:16.390
Like its predecessor, this gameís restrained
approach to motion has an incredibly satisfying

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.680
effect on the gameplay.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.210
But what makes No More Heroes 2 a great sequel
is that it addresses many of the original

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.450
gameís problems.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.299
The boring, vacant over world has been scrapped,
which means you just choose a mission, and

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.299
youíre there.

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.060
It streamlines the experience beautifully
and allows what the game does best to keep

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.260
the spotlight.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.040
Now, to be fair, what the game does best...can
get a little repetitive.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.970
After all, the incredible style and humor
aside, No More Heroes 2 is a straightforward

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.760
brawler, a genre notorious for somewhat shallow
gameplay.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.810
And though the game does a lot to hamper that
repetitionóuh, from its side jobs to new

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.120
playable characters and ample options for
character customizationóit can get a bit

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.730
tiring when youíre killing such similar enemies
in such similar ways.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.239
So yeah, the game has flaws, but theyíre
really not important.

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.500
Exemplifying the punk rock ethos of its designer,
No More Heroes 2 is a ruthlessly stylish and

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.970
energetic love confession to its very own
medium.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.061
Itís not a perfect video game, but youíd
be hard-pressed to find one more fun, more

00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:40.300
proud...or more deplorable.
