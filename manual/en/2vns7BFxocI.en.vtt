I’m Lee. I have a degree in architecture
and about ten years experience in the construction

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:12.730
field and we’re laying out a diagonal countertop
today. We have about the same spacing on both

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.600
sides of the sink, and we’re going to start
from here since this is the first point that

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.050
you see when you come around the corner. You
just want to center this tile. And you can

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.699
do it one of two ways. I usually just estimate
the amount and measure to see if I have it

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.960
right. Here’s three and three quarters and
almost three and three quarters so you can

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.570
just scoot it back this way. It does not have
to be exact, and about four…a little more

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.120
than four- just scoot it that way a little
bit. &lt;P&gt; What we’re going to do is we’re

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.930
going to find the center of the countertop.
After we kind of center the tile, find the

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:08.660
center of the countertop. So we just want
to measure the tile and see if we have it

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.470
almost right. Sixteen and a half, so it’d
be eight and a quarter, so that’s just about

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:22.770
right. And it should be sixteen and a half,
so eight and a quarter, so just need to move

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:31.550
it over to about right there. You just take
and split the difference of the two lines,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.130
and that’s your center. So, you want to
make sure that this is all a square and laid

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.561
out or you could get a forty five degree angle,
or you can do it by just size. I like to do

00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:51.080
it by sight just because none of these counters
are square or anything. And you get it to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.110
where it looks just about right. &lt;P&gt; Grab
you some spacers because you’re going to

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.610
have to lay all this out first- which will
take a while- that one in the back took probably

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.330
a full day of just laying out tile- cutting
it, I had to make numerous cuts over and over.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:17.140
Ok. Lay out the spacers. Now you’re going
to use a pre-chosen color. Back here we used

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.920
black. Up here, we’re going to use the same
color that we used at the front door. And

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:33.100
just lay it in to where the spacers are, and
you have to hold it. I’m going to put this

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.520
pattern over it so that you can kind of see
what you’re going for here. You’re going

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:46.490
to have this border around the top. So the
easiest way to do that is just measure if

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:54.060
this is right. Sixteen and a quarter and you
can write on your counter top if you want.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:04.220
And this is a twelve inch tile…it’s eleven
and three-quarters, which is kind of odd.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.580
And then you have two-quarter inch spacers
which you can take a half inch off from it

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:17.980
and that will be the size of your tile. &lt;P&gt;
This entire large piece of plastic is sixteen

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:28.270
and a quarter inches. Your tile is only eleven
and three quarters. Eleven and three quarter

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:35.700
and sixteen and three quarter- and that gives
you a difference of four and a quarter. And

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.580
you can just count the little spaces if you
need to, or however you do it. So that’s

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:48.450
four and a quarter, and you’re going to
take out a half, so that’s three and three

00:03:48.450 --> 00:04:01.170
quarters. So that would get three and three
quarters. And that would be the width of the

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:11.319
tile, or the width of the space that’s not
taken up by the tile and the grout. So you

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.710
take that three and three quarters and you
split it into two and you have a border all

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:24.400
around. And that’s how you would lay out
the center of your diagonal countertop.
