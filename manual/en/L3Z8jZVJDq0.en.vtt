Living Arrangements with Nico de Swert
Pottery Barn

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:10.490
Hi I'm Nico de Swert, I'm a floral designer and interior stylist.

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.349
We're going to make our Holiday dining centerpiece, 
which is going to consist of two separate pieces.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.529
The first one is this beautiful rattan tray that I found.

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.569
and we have three bosphorus bowls

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.409
these beautiful pillar candles from 
pottery barn

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.859
which are four by four and a half inches.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.259
and we fill the tray up

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.330
with christmas ornaments

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.570
and basically

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.130
they're old Christmas ornaments that I had in my attic

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.320
uh some of them I bought it flower market
they're very inexpensive they're glass ornaments like

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.880
that what I do is i just basically take
off where hang it normally in the tree with,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.660
and this is a perfect vessel 
that you're gonna use for your flowers in the tray.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.690
and just with a squeeze bottle like that you just
fill it up with water

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.120
just like that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.300
all the way to the top

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.290
because an orchid has a very short stem so you have to make sure

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.090
that you fill the water all the way to the top,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.910
and just putting that in a tray

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.579
we have these beautiful phalaenopsis orchids
in a beautiful magenta, 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.090
and we have these beautiful green cymbidium orchids

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.350
so we're gonna start with the cymbidium orchids,

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.450
anywhere where I have

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.119
an ornament with water

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.990
then we're putting them into the vessels

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.229
into our little ornament vessels that we have

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.670
all over the tray

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.760
very easy

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.730
easy to do, inexpensive

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.950
and it's going to create such a beautiful statement on your

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.910
dining room table

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.170
these beautiful

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.980
Phalaenopsis orchids

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.240
and just kind of intermingle

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.910
the green ones with

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.299
the pink ones, just like that very simple

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.030
and this is gonna be such a beautiful statement 
on your dining room table

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.610
once we have some candles lit

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.610
this is all gonna

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.920
beautifully glisten up on your table,
really special

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.380
it looks kind of complicated

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.410
it's really simple to do just adding your ornaments,

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.200
the orchids to the ornaments and that's really all there is to it

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.659
it's very very simple

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.720
and that's basically it, voila

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.830
There's your centerpiece for the holidays.
