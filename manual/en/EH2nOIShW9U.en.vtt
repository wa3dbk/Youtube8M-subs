00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.710
If you're not a fan of big bulky cases, but
hate the one-time use that you get out of

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.740
a skin, well let me introduce you to the world's
thinnest iphone case.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.800
This is The Veil from Caudabe.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.420
Hey what's up everyone, this is Dom and if
you haven't caught on by now, The Veil is

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.560
a super thin iPhone case.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.090
In fact, it's only 0.35mm thick.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.200
I've never been a fan of skins as you can
only use them once, and I'm not really fond

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.750
of cases that take away from the beauty and
sleek design of a smartphone.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.039
Well, The Veil seems to offer the best of
both worlds, at least for my use.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.370
Today we're checking out the iPhone 6 and
6 Plus versions, but Cauabe also makes it

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.339
for the iPhone 5, 5s, and 5c.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.559
And I'll be sure to leave all of the links
below in case you'd like to check them out.

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.690
Putting on The Veil is as easy as you'd assume.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.229
Just plop the iPhone inside of it and press
down around the edges.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.120
This case features an open bottom design,
much like Apple's leather case, and has cutouts

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.379
for all of the buttons and the mute switch.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.110
Just in case you were wondering, The Veil
will not solve any protruding camera issues

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.610
you may have with the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus,
but that's because it's thinner that the camera

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.610
protrudes.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.610
So you'll still have a little bump there,
but that's never been an issue for me.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.470
What you're gaining is the experience of having
a naked iPhone, but with added scratch and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.470
bump protection.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.840
Also, the front of The Veil is perfectly formed
to the curved glass edges of the iPhone 6

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.280
and leaves plenty of space for a screen protector.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.360
It's a semi flexible case made from magical
plastics and it has a matte finish that resists

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.950
fingerprints and dust, but in my opinion it
can be a little slippery.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.360
Don't get me wrong, it's no more slippery
than the iPhone itself, but I kind of wish

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.180
it had a rubberized matte finish to it for
added grip because as you can see here, it

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.030
just kind of slides around in your hand.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.130
The Veil is awesome for me, but if you're
looking for drop protection or pretty much

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.450
anything outside of pocket protection, you
may not appreciate this case.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.200
I'm a case-less kind of guy, but prefer to
keep some type of coverage on my smartphones

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.100
to keep away scratches in case I'd like to
sell it at a later date.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.260
This is protection for the minimalist.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.080
If you drop your phone inside of this case,
you might as well have dropped it naked.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.080
The Veil offers everything I need, but what
do you think about it?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.080
Be sure to leave a comment down below.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.530
This case is available for around $15 and
it comes in the Wisp Black color that you

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.490
see here or Frost.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:43.319

Thanks again for watching everyone.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.470
This is Dom and have a great day!
