00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.709
Hello and welcome to Todd's kitchen

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.940
Butter is an ingredient i use in many recipes but most people don't realise you can make it at home

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:13.940
So join me to day as i show you how to make home made butter

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.169
Into a mixing bowl pour in our

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.980
thickened cream

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.889
in America it is also called heavy cream

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:32.650
its basically a very thick milk

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.200
that has about thirty five percent fat. You can use a hand mixer if you choose but im using a 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.430
stand mixer

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.770
So whip the cream on high

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.470
until it comes up extremely thick. 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.470
The other way to do this is put it into a jar and shake it but that can take about twenty minutes and will also hurt your arm

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.260
so it is part way there

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.239
it has started to thicken up

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.050
this is at soft peak stage so keep on mixing

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.060
So at this point im going to change the head

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.530
if your using a normal hand mixer you don't need to 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.240
but if your using a stand mixer you will

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.820
and now I'm adding the paddle attachment 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.370
again if you have a hand mixer keep mixing

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.370
but if you have a stand mixer

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:34.370
switch to a paddle

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.040
So what you will see soon it

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.040
this will start to separate into solids and liquids. The liquid is the butter milk

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.280
and the solids will be the butter

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.430
The solids have started to separate from the butter milk

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.910
turn the speed down to prevent splashing 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.340
it has been mixing

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.870
for about five minutes

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.690
and you can really see how the

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.510
the solid butter and butter milk

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.439
keep mixing on low for another minute

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.909
you can see the butter on the paddle

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.469
so what we will do next

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.199
is pour the butter milk into a container

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:29.759
don't throw away the butter milk as it has lots of uses in cooking

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.269
im putting this is the fridge to use in another recipe

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.699
Now if you want to use the butter straight away

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.329
then you don't have to do anything else and use it as is

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.809
but if you want to store it in the fridge for longer

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:44.189
then you need to remove the excess butter milk from the butter

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.049
So i have some ice water here

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.159
it must be ice water

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.639
pour some in

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.899
and just

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:59.739
push it through the butter

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.369
see the water become cloudy 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.369
which means its mixing with the butter milk

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:07.180
so we'll keep on doing this

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.119
if you don't take all the butter milk out

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:10.610
it will spoil 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.779
the butter after a day or so

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:17.069
and it will be useless. So if you want to store it in the fridge

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.779
for about a week or so then you have to do this

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.199
once you have done the first lot

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:29.919
pour it out

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.400
then pour in some more ice water and continue until the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.739
water comes out clear

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.349
push hard because you will

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.369
find there is butter milk in the air pockets

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:43.999
left within the butter itself

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:50.999
you can see how the water is cloudy so there is still some in there

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.869
So this is the last time i need to do it

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:59.839
there is almost no cloudy water at all

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.699
the water is still pretty clear

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:06.449
so this should be the last time

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.199
next with some cling wrap place the

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.589
butter on it

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:13.809
and just 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:20.199
cover it up and thats all we need to do. Make sure its air tight

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.800
Thats all we need to do and just place it in the fridge and use when ever you want

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.440
so thats how simple it is to make butter from one ingredient 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.229
Just remember if you are going to use it straight away don't use the water

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.659
but if you want to store it in the fridge for a week or so

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.629
then use the ice water

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.120
