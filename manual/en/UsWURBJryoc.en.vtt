00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Good morning, and uh, thank you for all assembling.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm here in Syracuse, New York, promoting the Allstate 60 Seconds of Mayhem sweepstakes.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I've gathered you here today to apologize.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I apologize to everyone at the St. Stevens Community Bingo Hall

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and to the citizens right here in Syracuse, as well as my family.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
As you've all heard, I got caught bringing in extra bingo cards.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The allegations are true; I cheat at bingo.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I was born with a gift. I could yell "Bingo!" faster than any other human.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But as the games grew in intensity, so did the pressure to perform.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
A few minutes ago, a little boy came up to me

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and said, "Kirk, I understand why you cheated.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You didn't do it for the prizes or the fame or the immortality.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
You did it because you love the game so darn much."

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I turned to that little boy and I said, "Bingo, little boy. Bingo."

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
On the football field, my competitive nature made me a hero.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But in the bingo halls, it's made me a monster.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
A bingo monster.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Bingo deserves better. The good people of Syracuse deserve better.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I forfeit all my bingo winnings and records,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and I hope you can one day forgive me.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This incident in no way reflects my sponsor Allstate

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
or the wonderful New York area agents.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The good news is, the 60 Seconds of Mayhem sweepstakes will continue,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and I hope one day, one of my bingo rivals wins the skiboat, motorcycle, truck, and RV.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Thank you again for your time.
