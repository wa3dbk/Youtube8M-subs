00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.000
and had utilises initiative and an apparent
softening confinement from live

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.130
that if that wasn't enough for you where the
real estate it turns that get that's the from

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.549
the commissary anyway right it's just that
this was slightly better equipment that was

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.869
unauthorized

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.460
that's your punishment

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.050
for we look better understand as well first
of all

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.490
by people cut walk in with guns

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.109
to a political rally

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.560
and that's ok right this guy's got somebody
had a gun

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.170
on his boss

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.450

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.500
is gonna serb in once one month in solitary

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.930
dino it depends on the jurisdiction because
of the vienna likes i get all that right

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.180
but at the same time is an appropriate punishment

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.550
hi i don't one side is a look at the big have
all the guys that will be there right brother

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.300
right before europe jail for eight months
when lindsay lohan and looked like bob cocaine

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.890
accomplished like it is one of that starting
at you think that's right

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.309
she was in jail for a thirty seconds red so
i don't in then

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:31.150
he has the wrong kind of headset for his music
rights salt n forum

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.080
one no and looked at

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.660
easy i hate the idea of solitary confinement
i'm convinced that it causes psychological

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.660
damage okay

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.719
that this could be a punishment for something
so small n my

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.659
deaths than just guessing here is that

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:08.570
the instead

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.589
they probably didn't like

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.069
he probably robbed though

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.859
nor the guard survivors supervising in the
wrong way

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:17.849
is that such a thing

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.159
they consistently on the throne and garbage
than a half ago by from a concert

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.879
or they can do this insanely park

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.039
punishment is that

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:31.539
they use that discretion in this way if they
like him in the first place

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:32.899
the syrup sent

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:33.829
so

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.409
billy wright man in there and i mean i'm outside
a local street cred but

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.680
work that you know that this wasn't there
but

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.639
that they ended up with the voters free credit
she's until below when you look up weapons

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:46.409
transmissible
