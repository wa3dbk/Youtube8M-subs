00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.760
ERIKA STORM WASSER: Welcome to
Wine With Wasser, another

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.820
Spaces original.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.920
I am here with J Alexander
Martin, who is one of the

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.060
founders, and the current
executive vice

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.130
president of FUBU.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:09.780
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: Yes.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.380
ERIKA STORM WASSER: OK, so the
most important question of our

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.822
Wine With Wasser interview,
red, white, or rose?

00:00:16.822 --> 00:00:18.140
J ALEXANDER MARTIN:
Let's go rose.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.020
ERIKA STORM WASSER: OK.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.570
Boom.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.470
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: Wow,
that was instant.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.140
Movie magic.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.310
ERIKA STORM WASSER: So, what is
it about fashion and style

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.700
and design that drew
you to this life?

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.060
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: Back when I
was a kid, I used to change

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.830
my clothes like, three or four
times a day, just because.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.980
Based on the weather.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.310
I mean, today I've probably
changed three times.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.520
ERIKA STORM WASSER: Just
to come here, right?

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.200
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: Yeah.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.730
This is from a company
called Surat.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.540
And the fabric is waterproof,
or water repellent.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.980
ERIKA STORM WASSER: No way.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.720
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: Yeah, so--

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.470
ERIKA STORM WASSER: So if
I spill the wine on you?

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.210
J ALEXANDER MARTIN:
It'll just--

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.600
No, really.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.570
Actually, it'll just
fall right off.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.280
ERIKA STORM WASSER:
That's awesome.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.660
J ALEXANDER MARTIN:
Roll right off.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.310
ERIKA STORM WASSER: I love that
you think about this.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.220
J ALEXANDER MARTIN:
Oh, you have to.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.489
ERIKA STORM WASSER: What was
your inspiration behind FUBU?

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.380
Like, it started with hats.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.850
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: Right.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.460
My partner, he was
making hats.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.160
I was in the military.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.140
I was a radio man
in the military.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.610
And when he was making hats, I
was looking to try to get into

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.140
the business.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.450
So I said, listen, hey, man.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.640
I'm like, let's make a line.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.130
And he was like, I don't
want to make a line.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.880
What are you talking about?

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.840
And I said, no, trust me.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.330
Trust me.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.690
I'll do it.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.170
I had $7,000 dollars.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.720
I took $5,000 of it, and
I gave it to him.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.660
And that $2,000, I had
that for shopping.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.910
I probably bought two things.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.860
Normally I would wear jeans
and something [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.900
That's all I had.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.010
But I had to change my look and

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.600
appearance to be respected.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.840
Before that, it was like,
what's this guy doing?

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.710
Is he about to steal
something?

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.320
It's about how you
present yourself.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.770
So actually, I moved
into his home.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.370
We turned the first floor
into a factory.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.840
We enlisted a couple of other
childhood friends that were

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.688
in, and we started FUBU.

00:01:54.688 --> 00:01:57.340
ERIKA STORM WASSER: So
FUBU, everyone thinks

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.180
it's For Us, By Us.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.780
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: Yeah,
everyone thinks that.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.240
But it actually, it is For Us By
Us, but I think it's more,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.139
it breaks down with the acronym
is people thought it's

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.790
For Us By Us, and they wondered,
black people?

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.460
It was really for the culture
of music, and the culture.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.520
There was nothing for us to
wear at the time that

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.230
was made for us.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.910
So we fulfilled that need,
and that's just

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.980
basically what it was.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.182
And so when people would say,
chat to us, oh, well, you

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:30.705
know, someone of another race.

00:02:30.705 --> 00:02:32.540
They say oh, can I wear that?

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.130
Man, you can wear that.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.840
What are you talking about?

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.260
The world is bigger than that.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.000
The world is bigger
than Queens.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.820
ERIKA STORM WASSER: What is your
interior design style?

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.240
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: OK.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.680
Oh, great.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.370
I believe I'm called a
conservative but fashionable

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.140
person in spirit.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.420
That's my fashion line.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.125
So when it comes to my design
of a home, I love hotels.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.680
I would live in a hotel,
to be honest.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.070
I just like the convenience of
it and service, because I'm

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.050
bougie, I guess.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.980
So I basically designed my home
around concepts of hotel

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.420
rooms that I've been in.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.280
I love place settings.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.630
I love towels.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.990
I love, like, don't
touch the towels.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.430
ERIKA STORM WASSER: The devil
is in the details.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.280
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: Don't
touch the towels.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.757
ERIKA STORM WASSER:
What do you mean

00:03:13.757 --> 00:03:14.234
don't touch the towels?

00:03:14.234 --> 00:03:15.190
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: Don't
touch the towels.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.140
ERIKA STORM WASSER: What
if my hand is wet?

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.980
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: There's
another towel.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.880
There's a towel on the side
you're supposed to touch.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.850
Those are decorative towels.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.470
Everything I do has to
have a look, and an

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.190
appeal to it somehow.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.510
ERIKA STORM WASSER: I think
that's awesome.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.940
I would love, love to see
pictures of your home.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.840
Will you tweet us
some pictures?

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.460
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: I'll
tweet you a couple

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.580
of pictures, yeah.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.950
ERIKA STORM WASSER:
Thank you so much.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.860
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: Thank you.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.930
ERIKA STORM WASSER: And we
will be tweeting some of

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.910
lovely J Alexander's
amazing details.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.220
His decorative pillows, his
decorative mints that you

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.900
better not even try to touch
on your screen, or he will

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.720
come knock down your door,
and be like, why are

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.980
you touching my mints?

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.192
Get your hands off
of my mints.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.850
He is a true gentlemen,
and a man of style.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.500
Find him at J Alexander
M on Twitter.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.350
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: Yes.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.610
ERIKA STORM WASSER: And we'll
definitely be keeping

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.115
in touch with him.

00:04:05.115 --> 00:04:05.980
J ALEXANDER MARTIN:
Well, thank you.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.870
Thanks for having me.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.310
Thank you.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.534
J ALEXANDER MARTIN:
Appreciate it.

00:04:08.534 --> 00:04:10.470
ERIKA STORM WASSER: Bye, guys.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.215
Do you known Joan Rivers?

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:15.050
J ALEXANDER MARTIN:
Joan Rivers?

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.544
No, but I'm Three Degrees
of Separation from--

00:04:18.544 --> 00:04:20.035
ERIKA STORM WASSER: Do you
realize the big shoes that you

00:04:20.035 --> 00:04:21.029
have to fill now?

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.017
J ALEXANDER MARTIN:
OK, OK, OK.

00:04:23.017 --> 00:04:24.011
Let's just try and
figure it out.

00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:25.005
OK.

00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:26.496
ERIKA STORM WASSER: Oh my
god, I could kiss you.

00:04:26.496 --> 00:04:27.490
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: Just try and
figure it out, all right?

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.030
Just try to figure
that out Great.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.458
I think that could
probably happen.

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:32.410
All right?

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.886
ERIKA STORM WASSER: Boom.

00:04:32.886 --> 00:04:34.136
J ALEXANDER MARTIN: All right.
