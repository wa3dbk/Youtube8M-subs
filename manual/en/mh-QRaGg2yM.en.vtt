00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.469
war has started.

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:19.240
and we are hopelessly outgunned

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.550
Director Fury,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.349
I think it's time.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.949
Here with a mission, sir?

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.660
Trying to get me back in the world?

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.360
Trying to save it.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.430
Doctor, we need you to come in.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.430
I'll persuade you.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.130
What are you asking me to do?

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:54.130
It's called the Avengers Initiative.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.480
Apparently I'm... what was it?

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.720
volatile, self-obsessed,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.450
and don't play well with others.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:11.450
I think they need a time out.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.140
lost creatures to defend you?

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.140
This is nothing we were ever trained for.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.740
I'm bringing the party to you.
