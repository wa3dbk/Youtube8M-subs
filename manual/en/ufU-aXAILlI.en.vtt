00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.630
My name's Jeff Decker. I'm 
a husband and father of four,

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.280
and I sculpt motorcycles for
Harley Davidson, primarily.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.710
My passion in life is restoring
and racing motorcycles.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.780
I've always collected old things,
junk—just drag it home.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.980
It's kind of a Decker motto:

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.910
"If it's free, get it at all
costs." You know?

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.270
I mean, I see something in 
the trash can, and I don't

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.290
care who sees me—if I 
don't think its time has come,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.490
I'll pull it out of the 
trash can.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.200
So I'd work on old motor-
cycles, and then I would

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.300
start sculpting them just
because I never felt

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.720
there was an avenue for 
selling bronze sculpture.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.670
No guy's ever sculpted motor-
cycles before and made a living.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.380
But I'd bring these to events.
And my wife didn't like it,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.960
but I was totally Jack and
the Beanstalk.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.470
I'd go there, and instead of 
coming home with money,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.720
I'd come home with 
motorcycle parts.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.850
But I could sell the parts more
easily than I could my art.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.000
And a time came where
it changed,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.040
and people wanted my art
for the sake of that.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.630
It was an interesting
moment.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.930
I never give myself enough credit
for having a balanced life,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.200
but I think that's false.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.770
I strive for balance because
my family gives me balance.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.570
I'm so polarized in my love
of motorcycling and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.910
sculpting and that motorcycle
culture

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.230
that I find refuge in the Church
and in my family.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.810
I know I'm most certainly
not the perfect Mormon.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.350
And I know the guy teaching
on Sunday isn't either.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.570
So when he makes a 
mistake, I don't relish it.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.690
But I go, "Oh, I'm not the only 
one that messes up."

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.620
You know what I mean?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.400
The vast majority of people I 
associate with

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.860
aren't members of the Church.
But they all tend

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.870
to go away after I get to know
them, and all the stereotypes

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.810
that they think of "Mormons,"
I help break down.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.360
After they've met me, 
they go,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.510
"Mormons are allowed to
love motorcycles?"

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.830
I'm like, "I haven't found a 
scripture that says they can't."

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.030
My name's Jeff Decker.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.660
I sculpt for the Harley Davidson
and Sinners Motorcycle Club,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.770
and I'm a Mormon. (laughs)

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.560
You won't be able to use "Sinners
Motorcycle Club," but it's true.
