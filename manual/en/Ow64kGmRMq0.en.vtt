00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.680
be sure to check out the description box below
for additional information so I got email

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.000
from one of you and her name was Kat, Kat
emailed me that every time she gets her braids

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.090
done they hurt so bad and it's really expensive
and she doesn't want to take them down and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.500
she's has just always gone through this vicious
cycle she's finally coming to a point which

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.260
is what should I do should I take them down
or could you give me some suggestions as far

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.070
as how to deal with really tight hurtful braids
so she didn't say they were heavy she didn't

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.579
say that anything else other than just the
fact that the braids hurt really really bad

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.230
so Kat I'm going to give you some reasons
as to why your braids hurt really bad for

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.710
me to give you some resolutions as far as
how to alleviate that and what you want to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.850
do next time so first the reason why your
braids hurt really bad is because your braider

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.640
either braided your hair extremely too tight
to your standard of comfortableness or you're

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.860
really really really tender headed is that
they will be in tender head is that a lot

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.060
of people think that's a bad thing and I would
rather be tender headed and not to the head

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.920
and me personally I don't think I'm tender
headed because I can actually withstand a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.470
lot of pain but I need that level of knowing
if something is uncomfortable and not so I

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.220
wont lose my hair as one big issue with hair
is things that lead to traction alopecia to

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.591
where hairstyles are so tight that your hair
starts to recede and then you start to start

00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:55.229
lose hair so what I really want to get back
to is that one you can be tender headed and

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.049
that's a very good thing to note braids to
type or two of the style is braids your hair

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.799
to type in stylust please please pay attention
to your clients because they tell you exactly

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.000
what they want they tell you would be hurt
if it doesn't hurt that looks good it doesn't

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.099
look good and you want to please them you
want them to continue coming back to so Kat

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.459
your braids are either too tight or you could
be just tender headed but that still meand

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.750
that your braids are still too tight and another
thing is that people think the solution of

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.310
spraying water on your scalp or on your braids
are your hair helps the pain and it really

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.900
doesn't what water does is it swells your
real hair and it can swell the extension hair

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.620
depending on if using synthetic hair or human
hair so if you're using human hair within

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.450
your braids it will swell your real hair and
a human hair since it's real hair and what

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.170
that does is it tightens the extension hair
around your real hair even further to where

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.920
that leads to breakage in it self and after
the water dries out feels even more uncomfortable

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.390
than what it was before you sprayed your braids
now if you have your hair braided with synthetic

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.590
care water does not wasn't pedicure and all
because water cannot be absorbed into synthetic

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.690
hair only into a human hair so when your hair
is braided and you spray water on your scalp

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.860
for a little bit of relief you will fill little
bit of relief at first but this leads ultimately

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.040
to breakage at the point where your real hair
and the synthetic hair meets because of this

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.849
so water does not work on alleviating the
potential disaster that can happen it does

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:35.959
give you immediate relief to painful braids
but it will not help your situation better

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.980
with your braids in the last thing I want
to tell you this can be this piece of ice

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.970
that I really want to run away that you probably
don't want to run with because your braids

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.409
are so expensive and you invested so much
into it is that you down you have to take

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.659
your braids down because you want to keep
chasing battle with paying for expensive braids

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.650
and having them done too tight and eventually
want to start to lose hair in areas where

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.970
you just can't take a lot of women usually
recede their hair all around their hairline

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.990
area and also around the temples of the head
I realize that this is the most delicate area

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.220
because the hair is on the edges are a lot
finer than the rest of your hair in most cases

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.950
and also its the number one place that has
the least resistance to very tight extensions

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.800
so if you keep going back to this braider
that keeps braiding your hair tight and keep

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.170
paying every all your money you are going
to start losing your hair you will always

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.660
be unhappy with the way your braids feel when
I elaborate they do not hurt when other people

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.110
usually there braids they don't hurt if you
listen to how your scalp feels and you pay

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.760
attention and you know what you can handle
and not handle so Kat I hope that helped you

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.040
and save a little bit of money by watching
my tutorials and even purchasing my DVD on

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.320
braiding your own hair so you have to deal
with that anymore so as always if you need

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.720
more help her any more suggestions or you
need more details about the things I mention

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.350
