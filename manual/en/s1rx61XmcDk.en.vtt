00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:03.929
This is the University of Rochester.

00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:07.105
Our results are that women find men

00:00:07.105 --> 00:00:10.105
more sexy in red. And we showed

00:00:10.774 --> 00:00:13.500
women pictures of men in various colors -

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.886
red, blue, green, gray, white -

00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:19.811
and we found that women viewed the men in red

00:00:19.923 --> 00:00:22.923
as particularly attractive, they

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:25.988
also rated them as more sexually desirable.

00:00:26.378 --> 00:00:29.378
Why that may be the case, we also found that women viewed men in red

00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:32.071
as higher in status.  So, more likely to make money, 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.740
more likely to climb the social ladder

00:00:36.037 --> 00:00:40.000
and it's that high status judgment that leads to the attraction.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So overall, women who view men in red

00:00:43.227 --> 00:00:47.227
view them as high in status and they find that very sexy, very attractive.

00:00:52.013 --> 00:00:55.013
The basic explanation here is likely twofold: 

00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:59.000
One is a very straightforward, learned assocation,

00:00:59.257 --> 00:01:02.257
the other is a more provocative, biological predisposition.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.530
The learned association idea is that I think in our culture

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:10.756
we tend to view red as a powerful or a strong color,

00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:11.917
and so it's straightforward to see women 

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:14.889
viewing men in red as more powerful, high in status, 

00:01:15.047 --> 00:01:18.847
and then that could lead to them liking them and being more attracted to them.

00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:22.855
The more provocative explanation is the biologically-based explanation.

00:01:22.988 --> 00:01:25.988
In that, there is a parallel between human

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.425
and non-human primates in how they respond to red. So

00:01:29.425 --> 00:01:32.072
in the wild, female primates

00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:35.276
view the alpha male, who's typically more red, as

00:01:35.276 --> 00:01:38.248
more attractive.  They are more likely to mate

00:01:38.248 --> 00:01:42.103
with males who are more red and who are alpha males, etc.

00:01:42.214 --> 00:01:45.214
And we seem to be viewing a parallel here in females. 

00:01:45.215 --> 00:01:48.140
So human females who view a man in red

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.459
are more likely to be attracted to him, want to 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.038
engage in sex with him, etc.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.180
and they aren't aware of this.  It's a very 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.053
underlying, deeply ingrained kind of tendancy.

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:04.001
So we say in our culture that men act like animals in the sexual realm,

00:02:04.087 --> 00:02:08.087
well it looks like women maybe are acting like animals as well in that same sort of way.

00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:14.304
I really don't think we have a cultural sense

00:02:14.304 --> 00:02:17.304
that red is an aphrodisiac for men. 

00:02:17.648 --> 00:02:20.648
We do have that sense for women. So, 'The Lady in Red,'

00:02:20.648 --> 00:02:23.620
is the sexy lady, right? We don't have the analog

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.499
in men.  We don't have 'The Gentleman in Red,'

00:02:26.657 --> 00:02:29.657
being provocative or sexy. I don't think it's something

00:02:29.657 --> 00:02:32.211
that our culture is aware of.  We do, however, 

00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:35.434
have a sense that red is a powerful color. So I 

00:02:35.434 --> 00:02:38.434
think that men know to grab the red tie if they want to get 

00:02:38.434 --> 00:02:42.500
a particularly impactful presentation at work, or what have you.

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:45.563
And this brings up Tiger Woods, so Tiger Woods

00:02:45.563 --> 00:02:48.094
wears red on Sunday, when he wants to intimidate his opponents.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.995
He's done this for years, it's actually 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.199
known as 'Tiger Red,' so he's a very good golfer 

00:02:55.311 --> 00:02:58.311
and he probably doesn't need to intimidate his opponents, 

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:01.515
but when he gets to Sunday he typically  wears red, and

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.500
that presumably is having an effect on his opponents.  It makes

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.435
them intimidated, play worse, etc.  It also,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.500
based on our research, may make women in the galleries

00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:14.565
swoon.  They may be more attracted to him.  Which in light

00:03:14.565 --> 00:03:18.048
of recent revelations is a very interesting concept, isn't it?

00:03:19.274 --> 00:03:22.274
This is the University of Rochester.
