i'd like to see what sorts of of
medications that i may need to look up

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.330
in case i'm not familiar with them

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.520
and now i get that already out of the
way

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.310
and nearly half the time

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.720
and i'm somewhat organized so that

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.110
the unanticipated things can be dealt
with that

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.410
typical days here don't exist

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.789
but what i do you cover in a range of
the week with include things like

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.990
getting a blood transfusion happening
and started

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.640
and lp under some actually initiate the
blood transfusions are responsible for

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.409
covering

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.180

so there's a lot of

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.789
of variety and what we do

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.640
that i'd say your file ways to ching

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.580

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.480
get the europeans to work within their
scope to the highest degree of their

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.909

might enhance your practice by
specializing you can go into

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.789
