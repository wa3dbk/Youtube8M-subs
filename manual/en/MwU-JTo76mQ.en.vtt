00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.400
Hi, it's Warren here and I'm going to be giving
you my unbiased opinion of my brand new

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.500
kitchen gadget - The Tefal Optigrill.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.800
Firstly I'm going to explain some of the features of the grill and how it works.

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.100
One of the main features for me is the
light on the front which changes color

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.650
to show you how well your food is being
cooked. The Optigrill also has two

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.769
non-stick plates which will of course
make easy to clean

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.700
when you finish cooking with it. You also get a dripping tray which is pretty standard

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.480
with this type of thing nowadays. One thing I
really like is that the metal plates

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.629
are detachable so you can wash them in the sink or even

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.890
in the dishwasher. When it comes to
using the Optigrill,

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.750
you first need to tell it what you'll actually be cooking in it.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.260
You have the option of six different food
types to choose from. So I've gone to my

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.649
local butcher, just around the corner
to get a really nice piece of steak.

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.860
So firstly I'll press the 'Steak' button and wait for the Optigrill to heat up.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.100
The light on the front will pulsate and then go a different color

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.000
and beep at me when it's all heated up.
Now, it does take about seven or eight

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.790
minutes until it's ready to cook on

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.600
which some of us may think is a bit long to wait. The next step is to

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.700
put my piece of steak on. A really nice feature here is there's

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.710
a sensor which detects how thick it is

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.920
and this is how the Optigrill knows how well it's being cooked.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.140
The light on the grill changes color and beeps

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.770
each time it gets to a cooking stage, which is
rare, medium, or well done.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.600
Now, I like my steak medium, so I know
when the light turns to orange and it

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.579
beeps at me again,

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.960
I know is ready to serve. At the end of
the day all these features are great,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.200
but despite that, the most important
thing is that my steak is cooked

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.800
how I like it. What I found really impressive - when I cut into that piece of steak,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.100
it was cooked perfectly. The only other things I would say is the Optigrill

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.100
is quite big so just make sure you've
got space for it. Also if you're cooking

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.299
things like fish which are quite flaky, you'll also need to put a little bit of oil on the grill

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.600
to make sure it doesn't stick -

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.000
which I unfortunately found out the hard
way. My overall impression of the Optigrill

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.300
is it's a great product with some really good advanced features which really help to

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.600
cook your food exactly how you like it.
