00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.859
East Asian tensions flared at a United Nations
Security Council debate on Wednesday, as Japan

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.140
came under fire from neighboring countries
on its attitude towards unresolved issues

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.140
of history.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.360
While the theme of the day was about the lessons
of war and how to build a lasting peace, the

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.880
dispute just continued to grow.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.929
Kwon Soa reports.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:30.230
China, South and North Korea were united in
condemning Japan for recent actions that have

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.040
stirred controversy in East Asia, denying
its wartime past and distorting history on

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.040
Wednesday.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.700
This happened at a UN Security Council debate
on war and peace marking the hundredth anniversary

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.570
of the start of World War I.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.960
The accusations began to fly when China's
UN ambassador Liu Jieyi said Japanese Prime

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.260
Minister Shinzo Abe's recent visit to the
controversial Yasukuni war shrine had "closed

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.390
the door to dialogue with China."

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.930
South Korean Ambassador Oh Joon and North
Korea's envoy Ri Tong-Il also criticized Japan's

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.470
leaders for the visit.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.880
"Japanese political leaders' decision to worship
at the Yasukuni shrine, where class-A war

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.000
criminals are enshrined, is a direct challenge
to the foundation on which Japan rejoined

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.480
the international community in the post-war
world."

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.380
It is rare for a Korean UN envoy to lambaste
a representative from another country at such

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.479
an open international meeting.

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.630
Japan's UN envoy hit back at the three neighbors,
defending the prime minister's shrine visit.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.200
"He underlined that the purpose of his visit
was to renew the pledge that Japan shall never

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.880
again wage war.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.210
It was by no means to pay homage to Class-A
war criminals or to praise militarism."

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.141
Prime Minister Abe said the same day that
he would ignore an advisory issued by the

00:01:54.141 --> 00:01:59.729
UN Committee on Social Economic and Cultural
Rights last May to punish those responsible

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.990
for the Japanese military's sexual enslavement
of women during World War II, compensate the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.259
victims and issue a formal apology from the
Japanese government.
