What's up guys? This is Kevin from SnowboardProCamp.com

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.380
Here in Whistler we got 35 centimeters
of snow

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.650
and I wanted to make a video to give you
guys some tips

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.620
on riding powder on steep terrain. Big
mountain riding

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.169
is my favorite thing to do my snowboard
and I think these tips

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.900
will really help you guys ride some
amazing powder runs.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.939
There are two things I'm thinking about while
riding in steep powder which really

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:27.470
keep me

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.200
in control and balanced over my snowboard. The
first thing I'm thinking about

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.700
is my back foot, so every time I finish
a turn

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.320
I'm putting pressure on my back foot to
control my speed.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.090
Being in control is crucial on a steep
run like this

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.340
so I'm really focused on pressuring that
back foot

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.840
on my heel and toe turns. You can even
see snow spraying out the sides

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.180
each time I make a turn from the
pressure I'm putting on my back foot.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.239
When I start a turn,

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.870
I'm releasing all that pressure off my
back foot.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.530
So I can get my board around and onto
the other edge.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.249
You can even see in some of my turns
that I'm lifting

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:13.659
my back foot off the snow, to get my
snowboard around.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.210
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.100
The second thing I'm thinking about is my
back hand. So as I go to turn onto my toes

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.829
I'm pulling my back hand backwards, which
is turning my upper body

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.229
to the top for the slope. I keep my
core stiff,

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.979
so my legs and snowboard follow. This
puts me into a great position

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.539
on my toes with my back hand over my tail

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.619
and my body square to my snowboard.

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.759
This gives me the best balance on my
board.

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.119
The same thing happens for my heel
turn. Bringing my back hand forward,

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.369
turning my upper body, keeping my course
stiff,

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.450
so my legs and snowboard follow.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.889
If you use these tips you'll be in
control and balanced,

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:08.200
on steep powder runs. You should get these
skills dialled first

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.640
on an intermediate groomed run, before
trying them

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.700
on an advanced power run. So the next
time

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.430
your local resort get some powder go out and
try these tips

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.810
and let me know how it goes. If you have
