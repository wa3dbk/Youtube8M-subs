Alright, so now I brought you over to the
grass where I'm going to show you some basic

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.780
plyometric movements and what plyometrics
are is just pretty much the body's way of

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.670
developing core strength and agility and movements
that are the foundation for events such as

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.529
hurdling, long jumping, triple jumping, high
jump, pole vault, you can transfer it over

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.939
to volleyball. Volleyball players also do
plyometrics, basketball players. Anything

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.000
that can that is going to give you that vertical
lift and movement as well as a horizontal

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.390
motion for events like the hundred meter hurdles,
long jump, triple jump. Okay, so the first

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.640
one were going to do is called bounding and
what bounding is, is your pretty much doing

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.230
just that. Opposite arm, opposite leg action
where it's almost like a leap, but your also

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.750
trying to get vertical motion as well. Then
were also going to do ups and downs and ups

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.559
and downs are simply, if you recall the A
skip, like the A skip except your going to

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.689
be going up in to the air and your going to
have that arm action bringing you up and a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.321
lift, okay. So when your doing the boundings,
the first one that I showed you, that in itself

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:22.490
can be a work out in itself. So let's say
for example you have a workout regiment where

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.220
your training your athlete Monday through
Friday. Well on Wednesday if you want to get

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.799
them off the track for a little bit, bring
them on the grass and have them do some plyometric

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.880
workouts. So the first set of workouts you
can have a hundred meters of bounding up and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.329
back without any rest. I know it sounds merciless,
but it's actually a very strong core developing

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.789
workout that you could do. Then with the ups
and downs you really only want to do about

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.809
forty to fifty meters of that, up and back
six times. Then there is also another set

00:01:58.809 --> 00:02:02.029
plyometrics that I'll show you on the stairs
after this exercise here.
