00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
My name is Karina Zala, I’m doing Mechanical Engineering, I’m in my final year.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
At the moment I’m on reading week, but Fridays are my busiest days.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I have lectures all day long.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I live in student accommodation and it can be a total laugh.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
As part of the course, we have a lot of projects and practical work to do. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We have a final year project and I’m doing mine on engine performance testing.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The lecturers here are really good and really helpful and they’re easy to talk to and approach. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They know who I am as, lets face it, there’s not many girls on the course! 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It is a male dominated field and I first I was a bit scared

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but I think the mission of the University is to make everyone feel comfortable and professional; 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to feel confident in what they learn.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I did my placement with Case New Holland – CNH tractor plant based in Basildon, Essex. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Splitting apart the front axle from the engine, the engine from the transmission, transmission from the rear axle; 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I was basically taking a tractor apart. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I really enjoyed it to be honest. I love that side of things; I love getting my hands dirty and taking things apart just to see how it works.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I was hoping the spaceship was going to hang around longer than it did because I would have really liked to take a look underneath the bonnet. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
They didn’t even land in the end which was a shame because I had a lot of questions.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I was going to change the title of my dissertation for a while to ‘Transport phenomena in inter-stellar travel: A study of fluid dynamics and momentum transfer in hyper-drive engine functions’

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
but without the craft being here to run diagnostics on I’ve gone back to tractors for the time being.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I think when I first came to University I was a little bit confused; I was homesick; 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I was like a little kid and I’m still a little kid now but I feel more comfortable being on my own and taking care of myself.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I can’t really count how many friends I have made here 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
but I’ve made some really good friends; probably the type that 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
even when you finish University in ten years time, you could still talk to them as if ten years hasn’t even passed. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
When I finish here, I will be confident that I will be able to go and find work 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
but I think at the same time it will be a scary place because I will be stepping up into the real world.
