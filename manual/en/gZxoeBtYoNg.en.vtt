00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.960
The only way we go is with WAECO.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.140
Well here we find ourselves at Bramwell's
Campground.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.160
We're at the base of the OTL.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.150
The Overland Telegraph Line.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.210
What I'm gonna cook up this evening is Brandy
Bananas minus the brandy.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.750
I haven't got any brandy to flambÃ© it, so
we'll just make up a caramel sort of a sauce

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.130
with the ingredients that I've got.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.280
Throw in some super-ripe bananas.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.280
Gobble them down.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.650
Maybe whip out some ice cream out of the WAECO
as well.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.920
Let's get into it.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.410
Alright, these ingredients are:a couple of
ripe bananas here.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.510
One each for me and Jase.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.760
We've got some orange juice.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.360
Doesn't really matter what you use.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.360
Some sugar.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.160
Like I said, full of that goodness and energy
that we need.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.540
And some more good stuff, a bit of butter
as well.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.920
All those combined together into the pan will
make a delicious sauce.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.400
Now this is one of the easiest desserts and
the most delectable desserts ever known to

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.420
me anyway.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.000
So you'll just get the gist when I taste it
and when Jase tastes it how good it really

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
is.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Alright let's get into it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.670
Now you don't want too much heat.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.260
So I'm gonna turn that down.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.650
Okay now, all these three ingredients I'm
gonna put in, you're gonna have to put in

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.580
equal amounts, so that's a humungous spoon
of butter.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.610
Let's put in two big whoppin spoonfuls, I
reckon.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.440
Same amount of sugar.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.800
Brown sugar's probably the go.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.800
One.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800
Two.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.800
Three.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.910
That's about the same amount as the butter's
that's gone in.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.580
Give that a bit of a stir through.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.680
And then last but not least, the orange juice.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.619
One, two, three.

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.630
Now I told you it was very, very simple, didn't
I?

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.759
All you've got to do is just keep stirring
that.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:18.739
It is absolutely crucial at this stage that
you do not burn this, because it will caramelize

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:19.739
very quickly.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.019
And end up burning and sticking on the bottom
of your pot or whatever you use.

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.170
So we'll keep that stirring until most of
the sugar is actually dissolved.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.969
You always taste it.

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.060
Yeah, that's good.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.959
Just place them in there very gently.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:52.790
And all we're looking at doing is cooking
these probably for a minute or so either side.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.029
After about a minute or so when you think
they're sort of softened through on that side,

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:02.310
you're going to carefully turn them over without
breaking them all up if you can help it.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.629
Give it another minute.

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.739
And then they're pretty much ready to be served
and eaten.

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.870
Alrighty, they're softened through.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.450
It's been about a minute just over.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.389
So we'll carefully turn those.

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.720
And then we'll reach for the ice cream, because
it's a pretty good stage to be getting that

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.969
out sticking it on the plate.

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:27.090
And then by the time those bananas are cooked
through on that second half, we'll be ready

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.260
to gobble it up.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.439
Beautiful ice cream out of the freezer here.

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.950
Don't go light on the old ice cream.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.689
Everyone loves the ice cream.

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.169
It's ready to dish up.

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.400
Ready as it'll ever be.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.849
And look how soft those bananas have gotten
there.

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.920
I'll just carefully spoon those onto there.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.920
Now Jasey-boy.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.200
Where are you, mate?

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.340
Desserts are ready.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.239
What are you calling it?

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.890
Well, brandy bananas without the brandy.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.409
There you go, with ice cream.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.930
So you're calling it Brandy Bananas but there's
no brandy.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.189
So what are you calling it.

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.279
Just Banana?

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.449
Bananas and ice cream.

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:16.079
Mate, it's gold.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.169
Literally gold.

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.710
And so easy to make.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:27.390
Even when you're out camping.
