of Paratha which is known as Maski Paratha.

00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:33.211
I have kept this recipe secret for many years
butnow this is a right time to give this recipe

00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:34.211
to the World.

00:00:34.211 --> 00:00:35.211
For this you will need.

00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:42.321
200 grams Wheat Flour, 100 grams All Purpose

1 Tablespoon Garlic Slices, 1 tsp cumin seeds

00:00:52.651 --> 00:01:00.621
powder, 1 tsp Asofoetida or Hing, 1 tsp Ginger
Paste and Salt to Taste.

00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:08.891
First of all I am going to add All Purpose
Flour in to the Wheat Flour, than the 1 tsp

After mixing all the ingredients very well
togather add the Yogurt and around 3 tsp of

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.111
Oil.

00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:18.321
Mix it again and add Water as require to make
the soft Dough from it.

00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:32.701
We have to Knead this Dough very well so it
can become soft and smooth and we can get

00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:46.261
the same consistency as we get in the Chapati
Dough, again I am going to apply some oil

00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:49.640
on it so it don't stick anywhere.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:03:00.990
Now our Dough is ready so I am going to make
the small balls from it of equal sizes.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.220
Now I am going to Roll this cover it with
some flour so it don't stick.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:22.841
First of all we have to make the simple Chapatis
as we make and apply oil on it, and ......now

00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:47.940
I am going to fold it, again Roll a little
and apply some oil on it.Now again fold it

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:57.530
and deep it into the Flour.Now I am going
to Roll it to words the each angle .

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:42.031
Roll out the remaining Parathas similarly.

00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:48.661
Now our Parathas are ready so I am going to
Fry it on Griddle or Tava.

00:04:48.661 --> 00:05:06.041
Now the Griddle is hot enough so put the Paratha
in.

00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:08.011
Now I am going to flip it.

00:05:08.011 --> 00:05:10.071
Again flip it.

00:05:10.071 --> 00:05:14.241
Now I am going to apply 1/2 tsp Butter, apply
Butter on it when it half cooked on either

00:05:14.241 --> 00:05:15.241
side.

00:05:15.241 --> 00:05:28.681
So it can be cooked perfectly and flip this,
again apply Butter on it.

00:05:28.681 --> 00:05:42.191
Press this towords the edges so it can be
nicely cooked with some beautiful Golden Brown

00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:46.841

spot on it.

00:05:56.701 --> 00:06:08.821
