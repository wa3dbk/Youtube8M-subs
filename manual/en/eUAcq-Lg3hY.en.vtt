00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.579
Hello everyone. Here we are with Epoch, a new title running on the Unreal engine on mobiles.

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.800
And the idea is to

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.339
defeat all of these really gnarly enemy robots,

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.410
you're a robot yourself and you have to kind of move around

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.380
in this environment, moving left and
right effectively in different lanes,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.739
avoiding

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.600
the enemy. Ooh, you can see there I 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.220
didn't avoid that and I got a grenade thrown at me.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.290
You can also slow down time and you have lots and lots of power-ups as well.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.700
And it's just a very very cleverly done game. The Unreal engine makes it look fantastic.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.770
I need to be paying a little bit more attention to
what's actually going on on the screen.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.220
You have all sorts of different power-ups as special abilities and it just makes for a 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.370
really really fun title.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.190
It's difficult to kind of think of a title that's similar to this 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.800
the closest one I could think of was Mass Effect.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.260
Mass Effect Infiltrator I think it was called. Released last year or 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.040
the year before. Very similar kind of thing, just moving between cover, but this title

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.810
doesn't have you kind of free roaming within the environment, it's very much just behind cover and moving

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.390
around.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.580
You see there I've just jumped forward into the next stage as it were.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.010
And you get these quite nice little cutscenes as well.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.480
This guy's going to be gnarly, I can tell already.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.780
You can see I've got an option there that slows down time.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.670
Dodge around him, probably should have gone jumped over the top of that actually.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.520
The title is currently about Â£3.50 I think,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.640
on the Play Store so it's a fairly premium title from that point of view.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.159
I was a little bit discouraged to see that it also has in-app purchases as well.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.660
Every time you complete a stage you can then upgrade your gear etcetera.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.450
And unfortunately they decided yes, let's put some in-app purchases in to buy credits with which 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.820
is a real shame really. I think if I've already paid for this title

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.069
then, you know, to then see an opportunity to pay to win

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.189
is a bit off.

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.389
But never mind, those in real life cost a fair bit, so I'm led to

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.219
believe.

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.749
The developers got to eat!

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:20.649
But I think that's one of the only major drawbacks on what is a very very good game.

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:25.469
Like I say, there is this whole factor that you will be buying the game and 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.869
then you'll be seeing in-app purchases options as well to buy credits.

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:31.329
Bit of a shame, but never mind.

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.299
A very very fun game, certainly one of the most engaging I've played in a

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.639
fair while.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.289
You have to duck as well at just the right time, to duck behind, you know 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:43.699
so these guys can't actually hit you.

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:45.279
And you can pop back up again.

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:49.469
So there's an awful lot of kind of watching and learning patterns as well of the 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.649
enemies on screen to kind of

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:58.169
just dodge at the right moment.

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.690
But yes, it's a very fun title, Epoch, 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.200
I think it's certainly one that people are going to want to try out. I wouldn't necessarily call it a killer title

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.459
on the Galaxy Note 2. I think we've had those already but

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.489
certainly it's a game that is very pretty
to look at and as you can see, the 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.469
frame rate

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.249
just solid all the way through.

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:17.229
Epoch,

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.489
definitely worth a play this weekend, I would say.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.429
Just avoid the in-app purchases.
