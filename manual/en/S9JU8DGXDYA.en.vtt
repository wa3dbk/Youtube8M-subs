00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.270
Betelgeuse and Rigel are the brightest stars
in the constellation Orion.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.000
They are easily seen above and below the famous
belt and sword.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.840
Betelgeuse, the 9th brightest star in the
sky, is a red supergiant.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.369
As one of the largest known stars, Betelgeuse
is truly a giant – 14 times more massive

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.390
than our sun and 800 times its diameter.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.350
Betelgeuse is so large that it could contain
over 1 and a half billion of our suns.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.850
If placed in the center of our solar system,
the outer surface of Betelgeuse would extend

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.830
almost to the orbit of Jupiter – engulfing
Mercury, Venus, Mars and the Earth.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.360
Sirius, just outside the constellation Orion
is the brightest appearing star in the night

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.640
sky, however, the size of Sirius is vastly
smaller than that of Betelgeuse.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.100
So why isn’t Betelgeuse much brighter than
Sirius?

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.880
Because it is thought to be around 80 times
farther away.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.149
Marking the heel of Orion, we find the blue
white star Rigel, the 7th brightest star in

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.830
the sky.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.310
Some 1400 light years away, Rigel, also considered
a supergiant, is 17 times more massive than

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.540
our sun and 50,000 times brighter.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.250
What we see in the sky is actually two stars,
a binary system, and is composed of one very

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.630
large, super-bright star, and a small, fainter
star, only observable by larger telescopes.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.940
The light from Rigel illuminates a nearby
reflection nebula sometimes called the Witch

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.649
Head Nebula because of its peculiar shape
that resembles a fairytale witch.

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.740
The blue color of the nebula is not only a
result of reflected blue light from Rigel

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.100
– but is also due to the fact that the dust
particles that make up the nebula are thought

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.750
to reflect blue light more than red.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.509
Have you ever wondered why our daytime sky
is blue?

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.660
It’s for the same reason.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.760
The dust in our atmosphere more efficiently
reflects blue light.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.310
How far away are the stars of Orion?

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.610
Scientists are really not sure.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.620
They estimate the distance at over 600 light
years.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.719
Traveling at the speed of our fastest spacecraft
– some 40,000 miles per hour – it would

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:35.260
take us over 10 Million years to reach the
bright stars of Orion.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.189
The book of Isaiah tells us that the LORD
created the heavens, and stretched them out.

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.409
The vast universe gives us just a glimpse
of His creative power.

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:49.080
I’m David Rives
Truly – The Heavens Declare the Glory of

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.469
God
