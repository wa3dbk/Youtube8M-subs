00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.049
In this clip we're going to talk about the
proper way to remove and replace worn front

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:11.300
brake hoses on a 1991 Ford Explorer. In this
step we're going to talk about the proper

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.110
way to remount your vehicle's tire and the
proper method to snug down your vehicle's

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.670
lug nuts. I've got my tire right here. Here
is my spindle. I'm going to go ahead and just

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:29.160
grab a hold of it and just muscle it up on
there. Right there. I grab my lug nuts off

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:41.230
my tray and spin them down. There is a method
when it comes to snugging down and torquing

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.520
lug nuts that I want you to know. It's called
the star method and what it does is it's a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.609
tightening sequence that ensures the wheel
is tightened down flat and true to the spindle.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.879
If your wheel was tightened down crooked of
course it's going to wobble and the faster

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.519
you go the worse it's going to wobble. Alright
I've got my four way here. We're looking for

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.450
the three-quarter or nineteen millimeter side.
The star method is pretty much exactly what

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.079
it sounds like. You're going to draw a five
pointed star out of the five lug nuts you

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:20.450
have to snug down. I'm going to start here
on the bottom one and go from here up to here

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.680
and from here to here, here to here, here
to here. As you can see what I did was draw

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.200
a five pointed star. Bing bing bing bing bing,
just like that. What that does is seats the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.810
wheel flat and true and allows the self centering
mechanisms built into the rim and lug nuts

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:48.630
to take effect. We're just snugging them now
we're going to torque them later.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.820
you can see why I like to use a four way because
you get that nice spin on your lug nut. It

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:08.220
keeps you from wrenching them down all the
way. Alright there's one, two, three. I've

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:17.940
got to put another little turn on this one,
four and five. And you can see we did draw

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.670
a five pointed star. That is the proper way
to mount your wheel and snug up your lug nuts.
