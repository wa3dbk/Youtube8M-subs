00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.890
What is it about the hour-long crime procedural
that makes viewers all over America - and

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.040
the world, for that matter - tune in time
and again?

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.840
Just look at how many different flavors of
Law and Order we’ve been subjected to over

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.890
the last couple decades.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.490
We’re up to how many different CSI variations
now?

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.840
And that’s to say nothing of Cold Case,
The Mentalist, The Closer, Hawaii Five-O...

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.460
the kind of shows that pull in ridiculous
ratings in prime-time, and are truly evergreen

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.520
in syndication.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.150
I’m at a loss to explain it.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.100
But from the moment the opening credits hit,
bam.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.220
You’re in.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.080
Buckle up, grab a caffeinated drink, and...
wait.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:11.790
This is a video game?

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.270
I was wondering why everyone looked a little...
uh... uncanny-valley-ish.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.540
Indeed, this is Ubisoft’s new NCIS game
for all the major consoles, because when you’ve

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.140
got a license to adapt the hottest hour of
naval crime busting on television, you want

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.329
to make sure to hit all the platforms.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.180
The game plays out as a series of four episodes,
starring... well, digital representations

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.020
and soundalikes of the cast.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.509
There’s a reason those credits didn’t
give the actors’ names.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.509
Anyway.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.270
These stories put you in control of the various
members of the team, as you collect evidence,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.640
interview witnesses, perform autopsies, conduct
various forensic tests, and...

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.530
I suppose you could call this hacking.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.530
Alright.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.670
So the gameplay itself boils down to some
distressingly easy motions, simple matching

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.430
games, and wandering all over crime scenes
looking for that last bullet hole you missed

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.430
before.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.840
The most intense the game gets are the deduction
board segments, where you combine the discrete

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.510
pieces of evidence in order to come to an
understanding of the murders, and interrogation

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.819
sequences, which combine quicktime witness-pressing
with Phoenix Wright-style contradiction by

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.069
making you call out the suspects lies.

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.760
That’s pretty much it.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:39.160
Graphically, the game is about as middle-of-the-road
as it gets.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.790
On the one hand, everyone’s recognizable...
on the other, man do their lips and teeth

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.790
look weird.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.070
That’s where I usually get hung up.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.070
Lips and teeth.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.430
And you wonder why I prefer anime?

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.140
The stories you play through were actually
written with input from the series’ main

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.160
writing stable, so they’ve got the twists,
turns, and interconnections you’d come to

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.320
expect from an hour of quality television.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.230
The vocal work, however... alright, here’s
my main beef.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.660
The soundalikes do a passable job, and if
you’re not familiar with the show itself,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.980
you’d pay it no mind.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.400
But the trained ear can tell that Gibbs sounds
nothing like Gibbs, it takes Ziva an episode

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.280
and a half to tell the difference between
Brooklyn Jewish and Israeli Jewish, and Ducky...

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:35.580
is 
actually voiced by David McCallum, star of

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.280
stage and screen, - and along with Robert
Wagner as DiNozzo Sr, the only voices from

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.350
the actual TV show to grace the video game
with their presence - turning in what might

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.520
be the best line reading in video games in
the past 20 years.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.040
Everything he says sounds natural, in-character,
and... well, frankly, sets the bar too high

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.220
for the rest of the cast to reach.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.790
It’s unfortunate that the whole performance
is marred most grievously by the excellence

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.030
of one particular member.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.880
The whole experience is going to run you maybe
six hours, not much longer than if you sat

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.460
down and watched four episodes of the show
itself.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.919
But that’d mean you miss out on the game’s
dirty little secret: the fact that one play-through,

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.009
from start to finish, yields all 1000 achievement
points.

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.180
That’s right, this may be the easiest thousand
points in existence.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.789
I expect the PS3 trophies work much the same
way, while the Wii gamers out there... well,

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:32.789
too bad so sad.

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.050
Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to
go curl up on the couch and watch 18 back-to-back

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:53.470
episodes of CSI, on any of the fifteen channels
that offer such a line-up.
