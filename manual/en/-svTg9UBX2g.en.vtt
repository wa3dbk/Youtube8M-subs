Hi everyone!  I'm Noreen and welcome to my kitchen!

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.949
Thinking two years ago. I remember I

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.060
Did a video a series of videos for Mother's day dinner?

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.009
And I did steaks, and I did sides I did a bunch of stuff and in the side video

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.878
I did my Sunday onions not too long ago. I did a video

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.430
Where we had Sunday onions with something else and I link to that video

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.789
But I realized this Sunday onions probably deserve their own video

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.929
So here it is we're going to make Sunday onions, and this is how I do it

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:54.699
um send the onions absolutely positively without question or substitution must be made with

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.280
Vidalia onions sweet Sweet Vidalia if you live on the west coast or in the western region of the country and

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.368
You do not have access to vidalias then I would highly suggest that you use a walla Walla onion

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.609
Which is a sweet onion then comes out of Washington state and that would be a viable substitute what I do

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.060
is I take

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.299
the tops off of each onion, and

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.239
then I like to take the course the

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.569
outer layer of the onion off

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.930
Or you know take off as much onion until onion looks too nice and sometimes

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.839
That layer just below

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.139
there that's better that one didn't look so good [and]

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.870
[these] are so delicious you aren't even Gonna believe it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.970
Yeah, don't cut the root end off very important. Thank you

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.299
just cut the stem end off and give yourself a good amount of surface area because

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.300
We're going to need to hollow that out

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.679
So that we can put our goodness yours back now

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.010
We're going to wrap it into foil, and rick has already heated up the barbecue, and these is it ready to accept these now

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.430
okay, and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.390
don't leave this sticker on there either because [sounds] of course I

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.059
love Vidalia onions, they're just the bestest onions ever and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.140
They're so delicious

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.190
And this is the time of year when [you] get them now in the spring you know when the first fidelia's hit the stores

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.190
It's an exciting time

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.270
And just get that

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.959
These aren't that bad but no these are nothing like that yellow or white on them those are horrible?

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.339
All right, I'm just [joking] today. Yeah, I'm here sensitive. That's right

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200
All right

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.259
So let me bring my board over here. What we're gonna

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.639
Do now is take [a] paring [knife] and I cut my butter with this, so that's why it looks like that

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.100
okay, do not pay attention to the rings of the onion just kind of

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.679
We're going to want to put a bouillon cube in here and some butter. So we want to make a place to put that a

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.719
Little [comb] you're going to put your knife in there at an angle

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.809
and kind of cut [around] so that

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.440
Kind of like you're going [to] take the core out of a cabbage that's really the best way for me [to] describe that good

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.070
So I'm going to do that with all three onions

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.050
Just like that

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.030
It's like that [I]

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.699
Don't throw the onions away, you can use it in something

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.679
If I were going to make if I were going to slap a some mushrooms or something to go with them dinner

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.959
Then I would do that all right. I'm gonna grab some [aluminum]. Foil doesn't look like my thumb, buddy

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.660
What I look like my dog died

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.480
Holy Mackerel, honey

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
a double-layer [coil] please

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.870
Thanks cross it right like [that]

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.860
And I take one [knorr] bouillon Cube, and is the beef bouillon Cube because that's what I like

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.949
Then I kind of crumble it up in the center just

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.760
like that

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.479
We take a couple pat's of butter just

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.290
[like] that now the bullion has a lot of salt in already all I'm going to do hit this with some pepper

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.080
Okay

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.870
pick up

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.780
Just like that

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.190
and

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.780
then

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.570
We're going to go finish these other two, and we'll be back when I have read put these in the coals

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.269
Equals [our] [one] good here these just go right into your coals just [nestle] em in there

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.930
And how long do these usually take about half an hour? Oh, okay?

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.100
Whatever, so they need to stay under the grade in the coals for about thirty minutes

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.689
And then when they're ready to come out we'll bring you back, and we'll open one up and show you what it looks like

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.090
All right, these onions have just come off the drill and look at that

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:31.660
I

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:38.100
Promise you these the most delicious side to a grilled steak that you will ever ever have [Yoona's] outer layer here

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.149
They got a little dark super [sit] next to [your] delicious. It's still good. It's real

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.260
super delicious

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:51.089
Charge perfectly, and it's got that flavoring from the bouillon Cube, and then the pepper and the butter

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:57.299
And [it's] just made its own little song long hauls perfect. I hope that you try these onions

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.750
They are must-have for the summer. I hope that you love them

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.899
I've demonstrated them a couple other times here before so

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.579
I'll go ahead and put a recipe which I don't think you really need one, but I'll put a recipe anyway

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.039
I hope you try it. I hope you love it

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.259
