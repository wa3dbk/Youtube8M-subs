00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.713
- Well you read the title,
so you know what you're

00:00:01.713 --> 00:00:02.831
getting into in this video.

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:04.682
So growing up, my mom always told me

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:06.203
you gotta try everything once baby,

00:00:06.203 --> 00:00:07.898
you don't have to eat
it if you don't like it,

00:00:07.898 --> 00:00:09.274
but you gots to try it.

00:00:10.184 --> 00:00:11.850
Apparently my mom was a sassy black woman.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.708
Anyways, that was good
advice because it got me

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:15.624
to try things that I
normally wouldn't try,

00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:17.968
especially things like
sushi, which ended up being

00:00:17.968 --> 00:00:19.240
one of my favorite foods.

00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:21.602
Unfortunately, no amount
of advice could get me

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:24.261
to try these foods, you'll
see what I'm talking about.

00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:26.696
Here are the 10 weirdest
foods in the world.

00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:28.554
Fried brain sandwiches.

00:00:28.554 --> 00:00:31.316
Perhaps you'd like a nice
chianti with this one, Clarice.

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:34.478
Made from fried calves
brains, this dish is popular

00:00:34.478 --> 00:00:37.748
in El Salvador, Mexico, and
even the good old US of A.

00:00:37.748 --> 00:00:39.664
Apparently, brains have a mushy texture,

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:42.222
and very little flavor,
so it's highly recommended

00:00:42.222 --> 00:00:44.919
to use lots of sauces to help flavor it.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.787
I have a question, how
disturbed is the person

00:00:46.787 --> 00:00:47.678
that came up with this dish?

00:00:47.678 --> 00:00:48.677
Like, for real.

00:00:48.677 --> 00:00:50.430
Whoever you are, you need
to just, like, lay off

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.613
the zombie movies, because
they're influencing you

00:00:52.613 --> 00:00:54.331
a little bit too much.

00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:55.319
It's a little bit unhealthy.

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:56.841
Rocky Mountain oysters.

00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:58.443
But Matt, what's so gross about oysters?

00:00:58.443 --> 00:00:59.858
Well, as you can see from the picture,

00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:01.808
Rocky Mountain oysters
aren't oysters at all.

00:01:01.808 --> 00:01:03.701
In fact, that's just
the fancy name given to

00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:05.745
what they really are, fried testicles.

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:08.367
Taken from either a bull,
a buffalo, or a boar,

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:11.026
these are popular in parts
of Canada and the USA.

00:01:11.026 --> 00:01:12.721
They're peeled, boiled, rolled in flour,

00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:13.882
and then deep fried.

00:01:13.882 --> 00:01:16.099
Oh, and they come with a
delightful cocktail sauce.

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:17.865
(soffs) Cocktail.

00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:19.501
For real though, how does one go about

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:21.820
procuring the materials needed to cook

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.843
such a delicacy?

00:01:22.843 --> 00:01:24.562
You would have some
serious balls of your own

00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:25.898
to try and go grab some bull nuts.

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:28.815
Sorry, Bessie, but I gots
to eat dinner tonight.

00:01:29.563 --> 00:01:30.747
This next one's called Balut.

00:01:30.747 --> 00:01:33.568
I, oh, this one.

00:01:33.568 --> 00:01:36.030
Popular in the Philippines,
Cambodia, and Vietnam,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.223
balut is a boiled chicken or duck egg,

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:40.911
with an almost completely
developed embryo.

00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:43.122
This is essentially their
equivalent of hot dogs,

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:44.569
which is sold by street vendors.

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.670
You know, I've been an
omnivore my whole life,

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.726
but, like, this is the
closest I've ever come to

00:01:48.726 --> 00:01:50.717
wanting to convert to vegetarianism.

00:01:50.717 --> 00:01:52.260
Deep fried tarantula.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.170
Oh god, no.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.389
That's it for me, I'm out.

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:57.269
We're done, video's over.

00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:59.243
We gonna have to get
through this one quick.

00:01:59.243 --> 00:02:01.367
Popular in Cambodia,
tarantulas are deep fried

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:03.189
and eaten as a tasty treat.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.966
You can buy them
individually, or in a pile

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:06.487
to eat like french fries.

00:02:06.487 --> 00:02:07.532
Okay, lets go to the next one.

00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:08.428
Frog sashimi.

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:11.060
It's not easy being green.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.120
That was a terrible impression.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.948
In Tokyo, raw, skinned
frog is a popular dish.

00:02:14.948 --> 00:02:16.329
And if that isn't fresh enough for you,

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.708
some chefs will actually
cut open a live frog,

00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:20.810
and pass the still
beating heart over to you

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.772
for immediate consumption.

00:02:22.772 --> 00:02:24.745
Which is, believe it or
not, a popular delicacy

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:25.669
in some areas.

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.956
After that, uh, appetizer,

00:02:27.956 --> 00:02:30.231
the rest of the frog is
served in its entirety

00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:32.414
on a plate to you along
with some raw seafood.

00:02:32.414 --> 00:02:33.303
Yummy.

00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:35.882
Seriously though, who would
ever want a still beating heart?

00:02:35.882 --> 00:02:39.237
Other than that one witch
doctor guy from Indiana Jones.

00:02:39.237 --> 00:02:43.265
Kali Ma. Kali Ma.

00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:46.701
Kali Ma.

00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:47.307
Da fuu?

00:02:47.307 --> 00:02:48.081
Hakaral

00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:50.136
Popular in Iceland, hakaral is made by

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:51.843
gutting a Greenland or basking shark,

00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:54.338
letting it ferment for two to four months,

00:02:54.338 --> 00:02:56.277
after which it reeks of ammonia.

00:02:56.277 --> 00:02:57.938
It's available all-year
round, and is often

00:02:57.938 --> 00:02:59.737
served as cubes on toothpicks.

00:02:59.737 --> 00:03:01.176
Aww really, just little bites?

00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:02.441
That's disappointing.

00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:04.762
I was hoping for a large
slab of ammonia smelling

00:03:04.762 --> 00:03:06.603
fermented shark meat.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:07.360
(gags)

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.839
Fugu.

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:10.389
Fugu is the Japanese word
for poisonous puffer fish.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.687
These fish are filled
with a poisonous toxin and

00:03:12.687 --> 00:03:15.264
only a specially trained
chef with years of experience

00:03:15.264 --> 00:03:16.120
can prepare it.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.059
Strangely, some chefs actually choose

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:20.102
to leave a little bit of
the toxin in the fish,

00:03:20.102 --> 00:03:23.074
which causes a tingling
sensation on the lips

00:03:23.074 --> 00:03:23.980
and tongue.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.674
What's weird to me though,
is that this fish is

00:03:25.674 --> 00:03:27.961
reportedly really bland,
so why would you risk

00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:30.120
eating it, knowing that
you could potentially die,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.558
or at least swell up from the poison.

00:03:32.558 --> 00:03:36.303
Uh, hey guys, I think he left
too much poison in the fish.

00:03:36.303 --> 00:03:37.631
Casu marzu

00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:39.123
Mmm, Matt,is that bread pudding?

00:03:39.123 --> 00:03:42.885
No, it's sheep's milk
infested with insect larvae.

00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:43.429
Yum!

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:45.020
Found in Sardinia, Italy,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.682
translucent worms are added to the cheese

00:03:46.682 --> 00:03:49.141
to help promote fermentation.

00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:50.220
Why would anyone do that?

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.086
What's most disturbing is
that some actually choose

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:55.661
to brush off the bugs before
eating a spoonful of cheese.

00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:58.227
Yeah, that's right, some
prefer to brush off the bugs.

00:03:58.227 --> 00:04:00.130
Not all.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.023
Oh god, I don't do bugs,
lets just keep it moving.

00:04:02.023 --> 00:04:02.963
Yak penis.

00:04:02.963 --> 00:04:04.240
Well this one speaks for itself.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.283
Popular in Beijing,
China, this one's known as

00:04:06.283 --> 00:04:08.187
the dragon and the flame of desire.

00:04:08.187 --> 00:04:10.602
Or, as I call it, big, honking yak dick.

00:04:10.602 --> 00:04:12.529
Consuming this giant
piece of yak dick jerky

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:15.280
is supposed to be good for
you, according to the locals,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.184
and costs hundreds of dollars.

00:04:17.184 --> 00:04:19.726
What's really interesting is
this is not an exclusive dish.

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:22.386
The restaurant that sells
is has animal genitalia

00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:24.464
in almost every one of its dishes.

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:26.447
Here's another good question,
how does somebody become

00:04:26.447 --> 00:04:28.642
inspired to wanna cook animal penis, like,

00:04:28.642 --> 00:04:31.266
did someone at some point
say to the restaurant owner

00:04:31.266 --> 00:04:33.867
go eat a dick, and he
was like, hey ,good idea.

00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:34.945
Thank you.

00:04:34.945 --> 00:04:36.501
And finally, tuna eyeball.

00:04:36.501 --> 00:04:39.206
Found in Japanese grocery
stores for about one US dollar,

00:04:39.206 --> 00:04:41.285
this come surrounded by severed muscles,

00:04:41.285 --> 00:04:43.838
and fish fat, and apparently
it tastes like squid.

00:04:43.838 --> 00:04:45.626
Which is weird, because,
I would have thought

00:04:45.626 --> 00:04:46.765
it tasted like tuna?

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:48.505
Prepared by being seasoned and boiled,

00:04:48.505 --> 00:04:50.745
this is a very common dish with many fans.

00:04:50.745 --> 00:04:52.412
You know, out of all the
foods that I've shown you,

00:04:52.412 --> 00:04:53.771
this one doesn't even gross me out.

00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:54.839
In fact, I'm cool with it.

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:56.117
I just have a question,

00:04:56.117 --> 00:04:58.878
what the (beep) kind of tuna
has an eyeball that big?

00:04:58.878 --> 00:05:01.118
Do they have, like, giant mutant
tuna in Japan or something.

00:05:01.118 --> 00:05:03.712
It looks like they plucked
out Godzilla's eye.

00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:04.219
Damn.

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:05.681
Anyways, that's all for this video, guys.

00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:07.017
I just wanted to share those with you,

00:05:07.017 --> 00:05:08.561
and hopefully you weren't too disturbed.

00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:10.361
But hey, at least you
learned something, right?

00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:11.776
And I will see you guys next Saturday

00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:13.042
with a brand new video.

00:05:13.042 --> 00:05:15.872
Peace.

00:05:15.872 --> 00:05:17.334
Hey guys, thanks for watching my video.

00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:18.414

And if you've already done those things,

00:05:28.024 --> 00:05:29.940
then go out and get a bite to eat.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.214
I'm sure your appetite's
real high right now.

00:05:32.214 --> 00:05:34.373
You know, I'd probably
avoid, like, seafood.

00:05:34.373 --> 00:05:37.555
You know, or, yeah, just pretty much

00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:40.358
any food at this moment,
because you'll probably yak.
