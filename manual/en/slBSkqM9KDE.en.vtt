Welcome to Draw Tip Tuesday!

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.290
In case you don’t have any ideas what to
draw - here’s a suggestion: look down.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.450
What do you see?

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.330
The best models ever - patient and always
there: your feet.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.390
Pick any drawing tool you like.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.590
Put your sketchbook on your lap, or sit in
such a way that you can see your feet as well

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.320
as your paper.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.470
Look down and have a good look at the floor;
the space around your feet.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.700
That’s the negative space, around your subject.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.840
Draw this space rather than your feet.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.770
It will help you to know where to draw what
and see proportions.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.220
Don’t worry about the outcome, just follow
the shape that you see, and trace it with

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.650
your pen.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.439
This takes a bit of practice, but you can
do it!

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:04.540
As you can see, I started off by drawing one
foot larger than the other, but I don’t

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.540
mind.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.270
It’s a drawing, If I wanted a perfect representation
of my feet, I could have taken a photo, and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.540
I can tell you - even a crooked drawing of
my feet is much more interesting than a photo

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.920
of them!

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.119
Now that you have the overall shape, start
adding details - again, look at the negative

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:37.990
shapes inside of the shapes - for example,
the space between the toes.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.069
Then, look at the shadows.

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:48.520
Using just a little bt of cross hatching,
you can indicate darker areas, to create a

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.600
bit of depth.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.749
There you go.

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:00.850
A fun drawing of a pair of crooked feet with
bony toes!

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.579
Thank you for watching this video!

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.450
Now will you let your feet inspire you today?

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.619
Whatever you do, Make awesome art.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.610
