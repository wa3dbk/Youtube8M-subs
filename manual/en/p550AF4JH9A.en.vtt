00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.040
Personality is a great thing to have, but
it's not always essential.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.880
Volkswagen cars fill our roads not because
they're the most fun to drive or the most

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.100
alluringly designed (far from it) but because
they're generally very well-built.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.790
Coldplay has been a chart success not because
its music is interesting or exciting but because...

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.060
actually, I'm not sure where I'm going with
that example.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.100
Does a game need a personality?

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.780
I thought so, until I played Snail Bob.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.300
This is a game with a bland art-style, a forgettable
universe, and a hodgepodge approach to gameplay

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.230
with no real identity.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.540
And yet each of its elements has been engineered
with a high level of skill and precision,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.350
making it a pleasure to play.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.980
You play the part of a snail.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.520
A snail called Bob.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.820
That's pretty much all you need to know about
the story.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.890
What's important is that you guide Bob through
each level by interacting with a wide variety

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.219
of objects, gadgets, and creatures in time-honoured
Rube Goldberg fashion.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.860
We've seen dozens of casual physics games
like this before, of course, and plenty of

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.820
them are better presented or present more
original twists on the formula.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.520
But few are as tightly designed or nicely
varied.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.450
One minute you're working a magnet and a makeshift
seesaw to get you to the level exit, and the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.640
next you're parachuting from the top of the
screen and squeezing balloons to help blow

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.030
you clear of danger, or unleashing a genie
and making a wish to help get past an Egyptian

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.119
sentinel.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.050
The learning curve is perfectly pitched, with
puzzles growing increasingly elaborate throughout

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.220
its three worlds.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.530
Crucially, they never grow hair-tearingly
obtuse.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.230
Added to this is the persistent secondary
goal of having to find the three stars hidden

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.610
around each level.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.580
These can be concealed behind level furniture,
expertly camouflaged, or hidden in plain site.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.970
As obligatory three-star systems go, they're
a lot more fun to acquire than simply executing

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.980
each level to perfection.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.090
It's just a shame that Snail Bob is so unassuming
in every other respect.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.240
Its universe is so painfully by-the-numbers
it almost hurts.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.200
Its comic book cut-scenes are so lacking in
character, purpose, and artistry that they're

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.450
actually quite hard to digest.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.920
To call the art-style ugly is wrong.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.229
It's too bland for that.

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.290
Suffice to say the lead character resembles
the kind of thing you'd see doodled on the

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.979
folder of a moderately talented GCSE Art student.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.110
While this lack of personality would spell
the end of many an inferior game, Snail Bob

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.319
deserves a chance if you've exhausted the
prettier, bolder examples of the genre (like

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.319
Wimp).

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.159
Far more attention has been paid to its mechanics
than its personality, but we're surprisingly

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:22.739
fine with that.
