00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.930
Hello and welcome to Proko, my name is Stan
Prokopenko.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.500
Today we’re learning about the lips.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
Lips are very expressive.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.180
Many muscles working together to pull on various
parts of the lips.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.970
Also it's the only feature that involves bone
movement.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.320
BASIC FORMS

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.800
the tooth cylinder that fits right between
the nose and chin, can be simplified into

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.590
a bloated tuna can.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.300
By bloated I just mean that the wall of the
cylinder curves out rather than being flat.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.770
This comes into play when looking at the lips
from any angle other than straight on.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.340
The bloated tuna can affects the surface forms
of the lips.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.660
The center line of the lips gets pushed outward
and when viewed from top or bottom, the lips

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.120
wrap around the cylinder.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.780
Notice that from this angle, the corners of
the lips are actually lower than the bottom

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.470
of the bottom lip.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.490
Try to avoid drawing the lips on a flat surface.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.179
MAJOR PLANES

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:16.420
The major planes of the lips are very simple.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.550
They are very much like a staircase of 3 steps
from the chin to the base of the nose.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.899
In fact, if you look at the head from profile,
the entire front of the face is like a staircase.

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.590
The major planes alternate from top plane
to bottom plane.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.360
When drawing from a front view, this staircase
is usually indicated by alternating dark and

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.360
light shapes.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.030
Dark, light, dark, light etc..

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.700
Let’s go over a little bit of anatomy

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.880
I’ll probably go into more depth on the
anatomy in a future series.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.229
I plan on covering facial expressions, and
the anatomy is important to understand for

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.229
that.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.209
For now, let’s just take a little peak.

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:59.300
The red portion of the lips and the part directly
above and below is called the orbicularis

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.300
oris.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.820
It originates at the corners of the lips called
the nodes.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.479
These nodes are visible as ‘bumps’ since
so many muscles meet and overlap here.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.959
In this simplified diagram you can see that
there are a lot of muscles that attach around

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.569
the orbicularis oris and pull on it to form
various expressions.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:30.319
The orbicularis oris can also tighten to form
an ‘O’, or to blow a kiss..

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.780
The lips attach to the tooth cylinder at the
base of the nose and the top of the chin.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.930
MINOR FORMS

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.849
The top lip has three forms and the bottom
lip has two.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.489
Think of these forms as squishy little pillows.

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.760
The rounded form in the middle of the top
lip (called the tubercle) is shaped like a

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.500
heart and wedges between the two forms of
the bottom lip.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.749
When looking at the lips from an angle, these
forms overlap each other adding depth.

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:03.280
When drawing a foreshortened object, I always
look for overlapping lines to show a form

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.409
is in front of another.

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.530
Overlapping forms are indicated by T intersections.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.349
The lower left overlaps the tubercle, the
tubercle overlaps the lower right, the lower

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.480
right overlaps the top right, and the top
right overlaps the far corner.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.980
The local value of the red portion is different
from the local value of the skin.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.860
The relationship depends on the race of the
person.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.829
With darker skin, the lip could be lighter,
and with lighter skin, the lip could be darker.

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:37.510
If the person is wearing lipstick, that would
change the local value of the lips.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.349
Because the lips have a bit of moisture, the
highlight will appear brighter and sharper

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.410
than the highlights on the skin.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.000
Unless of course, the skin is also wet...

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.569
When shading the lips, pay attention to the
minor planes changes of both the top lip and

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:52.829
bottom lip.

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.849
The darkest tones will usually be around the
crease, corners and core shadows at the top

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.891
of the top lip and bottom of the bottom lip.

00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:01.150
Each of the squishy pillows will have subtle
tones indicating their volumes.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.599
This upper region of the lips usually has
a gradation revealing the rounded ‘tuna-can’

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.019
shaped tooth cylinder underneath.

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.739
In the middle of the upper lip region is the
philtrum, a concave depression composed of

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.440
two planes.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.010
The darker plane of the philtrum will be on
the opposite side of the dark on the overall

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.060
upper lip region.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.320
The edge of the upper lip has a small ridge,
or top plane that sometimes catches light.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.780
I try to play down this effect and avoid drawing
a white outline.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.560
This could look like a milk mustache.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.860
The ridge that borders the bottom lip is steep
in the middle and softer on the outsides.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.500
The lower lip region has two pillars that
angle inward toward the top.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.410
Together these two pillars form an arch under
the bottom lip, which is often in shadow since

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.170
it faces downward.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.780
At the corners of the lips, there are bumps
where many of the muscles connect.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.160
The volume of the nodes is similar to a bean.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.190
When shading, make sure to think of it as
a rounded form that pinches inward.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.510
The roundness of the bean creates a soft edge
at the outside and top.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:27.570
The pinch creates a sharp edge at the inside
and bottom.
