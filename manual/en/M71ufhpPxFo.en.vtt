00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.300
Today

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.259
Ron Doubt joins me in the 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:06.890
Wild Salmon Kitchen to

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.139
illustrate how he makes his fabulous

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.370
wild salmon caviar.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.370
Ron stirs up a mixture of 1 1/2 tablespoons

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.070
up salt to four

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.060
cups water to rinse his eggs.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.170
I used to strip the eggs from the skein

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.050
by hand although I found it to be an

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.090
extremely time consuming process.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.680
I have since discovered using a

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.560
racquetball racquet is just as efficient.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.440
In just a few minutes Ron separated

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.190
several skeins from the individual eggs.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.980
Before putting the eggs in the brine

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.690
they should first be rinsed in an isotonic

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.730
saline solution.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.220
That is approximately a three percent solution.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.110
If you find the egg membrane shrivels,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.100
a condition known as plasmolysis, cut

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.379
back on the amount I salt

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.490
or if the membrane burst, cytolsis,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.200
add a little salt. Monitor and adjust.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.100
In this recipe we use sake but it's

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.560
really just personal preference.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.920
In the past I've tried south of the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.390
border

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.670
version substituting tequila for sake

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.880
and a (Russian) modification

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.790
using vodka. I love Ron's basic recipe

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.770
The marinade ingredients are

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.070
water, soy sauce, sake, rice vinegar,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.640
and sugar. Ron poured the eggs

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.900
into the marinade or brine and let

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.670
them soak

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.619
for one hour.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.619
Ever the perfectionist, Ron stirred

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.729
through the eggs and

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.170
once or twice picked out small bits

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.289
of membrane. In order to dry the eggs, Ron

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.120
spread them among four strainers and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.620
set them in front of a fan

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.150
for about 20 minutes. In a little over

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.930
two hours

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.180
our caviar making yielded over

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.560
five hundred and fifty dollars worth of

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.650
beautiful

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.300
red wild salmon caviar.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.099
