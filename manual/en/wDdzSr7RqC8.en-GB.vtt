Hi guys,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.009
Today, I'm going to show you how I make soy
milk at home with just soy beans and water.

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.280
You can flavour it with your choice of sweetener
or use this plain soy milk to make other things

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.820
like your own tofu or cultured cheese. Keep
in mind that this soy milk tastes very different

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.870
from most commercial brands which usually
have a dozen ingredients or more. But this

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.330
is so easy and super cheap to make, I hope
you'll try it.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.090
To start, soak a cup of dry soy beans in fresh
water for a day or two. You can usually find

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.760
it in supermarkets where dry beans are sold.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.620
I just soaked these for one day. A little
foam on top is ok and totally normal. Just

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.660
drain the beans, then put them in a bowl like
this. Add more fresh water and now we'll remove the skins.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.620
All you do is reach in and rub the beans between
your fingers. This is my quick and dirty method.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.149
I want to get most of the skins but I
I'm not going to worry if there are some left

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.750
in.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.450
Picking them out is tedious, so to make it
easier, I add more water, mix the beans around

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.829
and kind of skim the top as the beans are
heavier and sink to the bottom. Just repeat

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.300
this a few times.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.679
With the skins, just throw them out or add
them to your compost.

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:11.709
Now, drain the beans again and put them in
the blender. My one cup of dry beans turned

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:18.079
into 3 cups once rehydrated so I worked in
two batches. This is half the batch. To that,

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.729
I added about two and a half cups of water.
So that's about five cups of water total.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.439
Now get your nut milk bag and strain the milk
out. If you don't have a nut milk bag, a jelly

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.179
bag like this will work. Or, use a few layers
of cheesecloth over top of a sieve or colander.

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.719
I don't have either of those things so I can't
show you but I'm sure you can figure it out.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:45.189
Squeeze the bag or cheesecloth gently but
firmly to get all the milk out. The leftovers

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.829
are known as okara. It's full of protein,
fiber and other nutrients so you can actually

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.539
use it in other recipes for a boost.

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:54.649
I found lots of ideas

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.840
on google but let me know if you
want to see a specific recipe from me on it.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.469
Now, the raw soymilk needs to be boiled to
get rid of that planty plant taste.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.030
Bring the soymilk to a boil on high in a large
pot. Stir it constantly so that the milk doesn't

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.310
start to form a skin on the bottom on the
pan. Let it boil for a couple minutes but

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.340
keep stirring it to keep it from sticking
to the bottom and to stop it from boiling

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.030
over.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.980
After a couple minutes of this, turn the heat
to medium or medium low. At this point, you

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.980
can let it simmer for just 10 minute or more,
up to a couple hours. Taste it now. It will

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.590
be a bit beany and may be a little bitter.
The longer you cook it, the more the proteins

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.500
will break down and the beany and bitter flavour
will get less and less.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.760
It will start to smell a little bit on the sweet side.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.660
You will want to keep an eye on it so it doesn't bubble over.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.760
During this process, a skin will form on the top; it's known as
yuba. You can stir it back in and it will

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.230
dissolve though some people skim it off and
use it for other stuff like Chinese soups

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.900
and dimsum.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.500
I let this batch simmer for about a half hour.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.140
Finally it's ready! Taste it and add a sweetener
if you like.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.500
I love it hot, especially on a cool autumn day like today.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.340
And with maple syrup which is

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.630
probably my favourite tasting sweetener.
Showin' my Canadian pride again.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.650
To store, keep it in the fridge for up to
3 days. And that's it. Thank you so much for
