00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.150
A woman is suing the reality show she was
on for broadcasting her vagina uncensored

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:15.669
Hi folks, welcome to the 
New Show, I’m Ross Everett and here are

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.040
the top seven reasons not to go on a reality
TV show. Straight from the mouth of someone

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.840
who was on one.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.430
1 – It’s not actually real. I know you
like to think that the Bachelor really does

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.640
find love amongst all those pretty women and
that the Jersey Shore gang is a ragtag group

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.300
of trouble makers. But behind those cameras
are producers encouraging interactions that

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:46.690
make for better storylines. Sean Klitzner
did a bang up job pointing this out:

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:57.160
2 – They edit the footage to make you seem
a certain way. The brilliance of television

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.820
is that what you see on the screen isn’t
necessarily the way something played out.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.140
Every reality show needs drama because reality
shows are just basically high school but for

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.270
adults. Miserable adults. So in order to produce
drama where there might be none, reality shows

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.360
use a magical trick called editing where they
can make it seem like someone is reacting

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.150
in a dramatic way, even if in reality everything
was fine. For example: this is Josh. Josh

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.100
is my producer. Josh, can you make a concerned
face for us? Perfect. Now, I’m going to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.340
say something that they would say on a reality
show and lets see how Josh reacts. I saw Jenna

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.600
and Mark hanging out last night. (previously
shot reaction of Josh). See how we made it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.330
seem like Josh cared about Jenna and Mark.
Watch this, Josh how do you actually feel

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.369
about Jenna?

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.680
Josh: Who’s Jenna?

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.979
Ross: Tadaaaa. Editing.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.009
3 - Your past revealed

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.960
Dark histories have a habit of revisiting
people on reality shows. Whether it’s dirt

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.909
being dug up by the producer to make a better
story line, or those skeletons from your past

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.630
coming forward to collect on your fifteen
minutes of fame, if there’s something you

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.710
don’t want people knowing you can bet it’ll
rear it’s ugly head once TMZ is willing

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.870
to pay for the photos. No one’s perfect,
but at least in private, you can pretend you

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.870
are.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.250
4 – Public Embarrassment

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.520
Every reality show contract allows them to
broadcast any footage they take of you that

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.090
may or may not be embarrassing, defamatory,
or surprising in nature. In short, you’re

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.069
signing up to allow yourself to be humiliated
in front of a national or International audience.

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.290
Case and point, a girl who was on VH1’s
Dating Naked had her whole downstairs broadcast

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.700
uncensored on television.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.770
5 – YOUR VAGINA MIGHT BE BROADCAST ON NATIONAL
TELEVISION

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.450
Now, if that appeals to you, by all means,
disregard this video strip down and cam up

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.180
because we have different end goals. But,
if you’re of the belief that your balloon

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.209
knot is reserved for you and maybe a couple
special people, listen on and don’t go on

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.080
a reality show. Specifically one called “Dating
Naked”

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.500
6 - Fleeting Fame

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.640
Aside from a select few, most reality stars
fade into obscurity quicker than they can

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.780
read you the daily specials a t the Olive
Garden. So, even if you are the breakout star

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.750
of Teen Date Pad or whatever contrived reality
shows will be coming out, unless you’re

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.769
The Miz or Jeremy Renner, get ready to have
it all come crashing down around you.

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.760
7 – YOUR VAGINA MIGHT BE BROADCAST ON NATIONAL
TELEVISION

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.430
I just feel like this needed to be on the
list twice because I want it to stick with

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.800
you. If you go on a reality show. There is
a chance that your vagina could wind up on

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.190
national television. And then on the Internet.
And then on your kids’ friends’ phone.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.880
And that’s going to be a weird PTA meeting.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.540
So, what do you think would be the worst reality
show to go on? Let me know in the comments

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.290
down below. I also want to take this time
to let you know that our charity drive for

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.690
the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention
in memory of Robin Williams has surpassed

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.890
our goal of $1000 and I wanted to take this
time to thank anyone who donated or spread

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.360
the word about the charity. We’re a small
community, but a powerful one and that’s

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.830
pretty great. Don’t forget to like this
video and subscribe to the channel and if

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.560
you want to see the FridAMA with Matt Lieberman
you can click this annotation or the link

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.500
in the video description. I’m Ross Everett,
and I don’t want my vagina to be broadcast

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:30.139
on national television. Here’s a little
bit more.
