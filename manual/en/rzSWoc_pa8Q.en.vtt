00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.949
The Kangaroo 4 or Kangaroo four as many would like to call it

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.539
it the fourth paraglider of a family

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:17.509
of performance wings

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:18.560
in

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.949
tandem

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.550
of course in our experience in world records

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.929
both in solo flights as in tandem

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.489
was essential

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:32.520
to the development of this new project

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.740
it was planned a top performance wing at maximum performance in its class

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.190
The technology used in this wing, the real stretching, projected stretching

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.580
are above any number that can be imagined in a tandem wing

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.190
and that created the challenge of making the wing pilotable

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.120
and ease usage

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.600
 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.830
Among the technologies used we have the mini ribs

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.140
which are little profiles in the trailing edge, we have the 3 risers

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.610
and the total reduction in the line metreage

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.860
which helps us in the the performance

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.760
an exceptional quality
even in tandem

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.660
in the thermals entrances, the last
technologies that we have in

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.160
 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.060
high performance wings on the market

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.130
like vectran lines,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.250
the profiles which already are high pressurized maintain

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.620
the wing stable on both low speed

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.500
and high speed

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.970
the speed resources it has

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.720
and gliding are excepcionals

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.240
it’s really is a paraglider made
for long flights and it already has a name

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.240
to hold up in it’s family, the Kangaroo 2, o Kangaroo 3 that were world records

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.240
it’s a wing really thought out for long flights e world records
