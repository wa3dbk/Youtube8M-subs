00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.700
My name is Abby Jones and I am talking about
the process for moving into a new apartment,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:15.019
a new space and how to make that process easy
and efficient and to help you set up easy

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:22.090
and efficient spaces. So and right now we're
in the kitchen, and we're talking about how

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:29.140
to organize your kitchen and how to set it
up so it's efficient and well organized. And

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:37.760
some ideas that I have for storage in a kitchen,
here's some ideas, some things that I'm using.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:48.420
We have hanging baskets. Those can come in
very handy in kitchens for storing food or

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.600
you can store napkins there, you can store
pretty much anything in these. These wooden

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.800
troughs are also really useful. You can store
a lot of different things in those. Any kind

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.110
of bowls can add a decorative touch and are
also good for, I use this for a fruit bowl,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.400
you could use it for pretty much anything.
But decorative bowls work well. These baskets

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.619
help create spaces in your pantry in particular
or in your cabinets, can help contain things

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:33.350
in larger spaces. Some kind of cup or a vase,
those kinds of things can be good in kitchens

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.840
for keeping utensils that you use a lot. There's
all kinds of storage for dry goods that you

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:49.090
can get at craft stores, a lot of different
places, even estate sales are great for finding

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:59.570
this kind of thing, garage sales. And so those
are good to keep your dry goods in. Other

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.979
storage ideas are tension rods can come in
handy for, I've used this one to make a towel

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:19.850
rack. This dish rack can always come in handy
as kind of a storage for wet dishes and also,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:28.160
something else that I like to have in my kitchen
is an empty Kleenex box or some kind of empty

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:37.890
box. I'll get mine, just a second. I have
this empty box that I use for keeping plastic

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.660
bags so it's easy to stuff them in there,
it keeps them well contained and they're easy

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.230
to get to.
