Hi! My name is Adria. I am a professional
juggler here at Expert Village.com. In this,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.490
is where we learn to juggle three scarfs.
You have already been introduced to scarfs

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.720
and see how they differ from balls and see
how the action required for scarfs differs

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.429
from balls. Well here we are going to see
how the grip for three scarfs differs from

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.819
balls. In order to throw three scarfs, you
have to be able to throw two from one hand,

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:32.189
which means you have to hold them separately
from each other. One scarf is held between

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.370
the thumb and the first two fingers of the
hand. The second scarf is held with the ring

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:47.300
and the pinky finger against the palm. The
first scarf released will be the scarf on

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.370
top. The second scarf released will be the
one on bottom. Now, we are going to use the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.570
same cross arm motion that we learned. Crossing
the arms and dropping and then catching with

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:13.020
the other hand. So, we lift drop, lift drop
catch, lift drop catch. One, two, three and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.760
as you can see, we can keep the motion going.
The scarfs move slowly and they have plenty

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.020
of time to fall, so you have plenty of time
to catch, there is no reason to hurry. Lift

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.900
drop, lift drop catch, lift drop catch, lift
drop catch, lift drop catch in one smooth

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:39.610
continuous motion. This is a three scarf cascade.
As you can see we are using our whole arm

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.700
making a circular motion, dropping the scarfs
at the top of the apex, catching them with

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.450
the other hand on their way down and continuing
the circle.
