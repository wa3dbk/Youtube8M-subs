00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.130
We're almost done making our little window
gift tote out of a piece of typing paper and

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.340
a page protector, a plastic page protector,
or a piece of transparency asitate. We're

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.230
going to go back to our box now. We use that
to hold it in place while we tape our sides.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.100
Just makes it easier to make sure that the
tote maintains its shape. Now you can get

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.400
all crazy and hide this tape, in fact, you
know, you might want to. I'm not going to

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.309
this time. Or, you can even use double stick
tape and run it along the inside. Oops, I

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.519
did that on the wrong side. You want your
flap to go toward the back of the bad instead

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:52.479
of toward where your window is. There we go.
Fantastic. I'm just going to crisp up this

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:58.030
edge a little bit. Give it a pinch so that
it will stand up, making little adjustments.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:10.180
Now we're ready to add some handles using
a, this is a eighth inch hole punch. You can

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.140
use a standard quarter inch hole punch if
you like. I'm just going to make four little

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:28.460
holes. And I've got some twine here for my
handle. I'm going to thread it through the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:52.780
back, through the front, around the front,
our the back again, and normally I have my

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.400
little knot on the inside of the tote, but
this time I'm going to make a little bow on

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:07.750
the outside of the handle, just to show you
another option. Oops, we need to lengthen

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:22.189
that. And, we're going to just tie this in
a square knot

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:31.319
and then make our bow. That makes the bow
not come undone. Cute. Give that a little

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:39.310
trim. Adds a little bit of personality. It's
slightly different way of doing it. Then you've

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.489
got, when you're holding your little handles,
you've got a little bow at the top. I just

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.479
think that darling.
