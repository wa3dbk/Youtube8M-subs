00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:11.576
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We started from day
one, the first day of school,

00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:16.586
talking to the students about how
do they want their school to be,

00:00:16.586 --> 00:00:18.576
how do they want their
classroom to be?

00:00:18.796 --> 00:00:21.446
What does it look like,
feel like and sound like?

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:25.926
We talk a lot about being
respectful, so the students know,

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:28.836
when they're in the
hall, other classes are

00:00:28.836 --> 00:00:30.816
in their room, and they're learning.

00:00:30.936 --> 00:00:35.206
So if we're loud, we're interrupting
them, they're not being respectful.

00:00:35.456 --> 00:00:39.496
So we talk a lot about
helping the students.

00:00:39.496 --> 00:00:44.406
We want the students to
understand why there are norms,

00:00:44.556 --> 00:00:50.436
and why there are rules,
and there is consistency

00:00:50.896 --> 00:00:54.176
across the building,
from our staff members.

00:00:55.196 --> 00:00:58.176
&gt;&gt;When I got the job,
and became principal,

00:00:58.476 --> 00:01:01.396
I met with every staff
member individually

00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:06.136
and asked them what their
vision was for the school.

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:10.476
Where did they want the school
to go, and then what were--

00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:14.226
how did they think
we could get there?

00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:19.466
And based on their results, even
though I had my ideas in my mind,

00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:25.786
but based on their results, we
started forming committees and teams,

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:30.136
we had a discipline team, we formed
an instructional leadership team,

00:01:30.286 --> 00:01:34.586
which consisted of
teachers who I knew were--

00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:38.386
had best practices and were
implementing best practices

00:01:38.386 --> 00:01:38.896
in the room.

00:01:38.896 --> 00:01:42.806
And so I started building
the shared leadership,

00:01:42.806 --> 00:01:47.396
and giving the staff members
ownership by forming the committees,

00:01:47.646 --> 00:01:51.996
working together, because I
wanted them to see that it's not

00:01:51.996 --> 00:01:55.526
about the leader telling
them what to do.

00:01:55.526 --> 00:01:58.786
We have to own it as a staff.

00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:04.406
&gt;&gt;The Care for Kids Program has
allowed a structure and a framework

00:02:04.586 --> 00:02:07.866
for us to teach the
social, emotional,

00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:11.416
intellectual components
for the children.

00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:19.006
We were doing it, and trying our
best to do it, but the structure

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:25.156
of the morning meetings and the
afternoon meetings, and the resources

00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:31.906
that we have, to really be
intentional about how we interact

00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:39.066
with students, has definitely taken
it to-- took it to a whole new level.

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:43.946
Some teachers, the Care for Kids
might come naturally for them.

00:02:44.126 --> 00:02:46.556
For others, it might
be more of a struggle.

00:02:47.506 --> 00:02:51.836
The framework is there,
they can pick up the book,

00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:56.726
and structure their morning
meeting and their afternoon meeting

00:02:56.726 --> 00:02:59.466
and so forth, using the resources.

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:04.876
And so it's helped everyone quickly
be able to implement it successfully,

00:03:05.056 --> 00:03:07.886
consistently, school-wide.

00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:11.346
We've been able to do it, and
I've noticed the interactions

00:03:11.346 --> 00:03:17.806
between students and also
between the teachers and students,

00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:20.606
the interactions are more positive.

00:03:21.786 --> 00:03:23.376
&gt;&gt;I make it a point to be

00:03:23.376 --> 00:03:26.966
in a morning meeting
every day, to participate.

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:31.786
That's one way I can get to know the
kids, but I also want the teachers

00:03:31.826 --> 00:03:36.256
to know that I value the
program, because they have to--

00:03:36.256 --> 00:03:42.226
it has to come from me, and showing
that this is a valuable program,

00:03:42.226 --> 00:03:45.976
we believe in it, so I'm
always in a morning meeting,

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:53.126
and then I do walk throughs daily,
in classrooms, because that's one way

00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:56.866
that we can help move our school
forward, is if I'm in there,

00:03:57.056 --> 00:04:00.216
I'm observing, interacting
with the students.

00:04:00.496 --> 00:04:03.476
I will ask the students,
tell me what you're learning,

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:04.696
why is this important?

00:04:05.326 --> 00:04:08.956
They need to know how to
articulate their learning.

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:12.926
So that's one thing I look for, and
then I'm looking at instruction,

00:04:13.176 --> 00:04:17.446
and providing feedback to the
teachers on areas of growth,

00:04:17.446 --> 00:04:24.266
and we've built this culture where
they are-- they accept feedback,

00:04:24.266 --> 00:04:27.096
they want to improve, or they want

00:04:27.136 --> 00:04:31.106
to know how they can help
a child be successful.

00:04:31.106 --> 00:04:35.206
&gt;&gt;It's just so rewarding
when I have visitors come in,

00:04:35.426 --> 00:04:41.526
substitutes come in, and they
have-- always comment about the kids

00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:46.886
and how they seem happy, and
wanting to learn, and really wanting

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:51.376
to do their best, and we have put a
lot of the learning on the students.

00:04:51.896 --> 00:04:57.636
When we talk about, we conference
with students on their work,

00:04:57.636 --> 00:04:58.856
and on their assessments.

00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:03.296
They set individual learning
goals, so they have it--

00:05:03.296 --> 00:05:07.246
they want to do well for
them, rather than just for us.

00:05:07.246 --> 00:05:10.776
And it's something that we
have to constantly work on,

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:14.996
but we're putting a lot of
ownership on the students,

00:05:14.996 --> 00:05:18.326
and so that they become
lifelong learners.

00:05:19.696 --> 00:05:25.596
&gt;&gt;Learning cannot occur until you
have a safe environment, and that--

00:05:25.596 --> 00:05:31.346
no matter what academic program
you put in place, if you don't have

00:05:31.346 --> 00:05:34.996
that environment where students
feel safe, and they're willing

00:05:34.996 --> 00:05:38.296
to take risks, and you have
the relationships built,

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:40.556
learning will not occur.

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:44.786
And so I would tell any
principal that that's what--

00:05:44.986 --> 00:05:48.026
when you think about trying
to raise your test scores,

00:05:48.026 --> 00:05:50.756
and all the requirements,
that won't happen

00:05:50.896 --> 00:05:54.066
if the students aren't
able to take risk.

00:05:54.066 --> 00:05:58.756
Our students want to do well,
they want to do well for us,

00:05:59.656 --> 00:06:01.496
and then they want to
do well for themselves.

00:06:01.776 --> 00:06:07.216
They are proud of the school, and so
they want to do well, which, in turn,

00:06:07.216 --> 00:06:12.266
it helps with achievement scores,
it pays off in the long run,

00:06:12.436 --> 00:06:15.936
it really pays off if you set that,

00:06:16.386 --> 00:06:18.976
you have that environment
for learning.

00:06:19.126 --> 00:06:20.536
Our teachers can teach now,

00:06:20.536 --> 00:06:21.976
and students can learn,
because they feel safe.

00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:25.876
