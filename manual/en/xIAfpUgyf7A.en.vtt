00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.480
Now I like shooting fests as much as the next
guy.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.500
Sometimes I’m just looking for a game that
lets me feel like I am all powerful and the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.700
baddest of the bad, the toughest of the tough.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.030
But for the most part, I’m more of a thinking
man.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.530
So obviously I have always been a fan of the
Socom series.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.260
I like carefully planning things and understanding
that one well placed bullet is often better

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.940
than a million sprayed everywhere.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.699
One shot, one kill.

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.250
And after Socom 2, the series seemed poised
to become one of the best tactical shooters

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.910
on any system.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.460
Socom 3 once again has you take control of
an elite group of U.S. Navy Seals as you work

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.840
to spread peace throughout the world.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.610
The story has you deploying in North Africa
as you fight the military group lead by a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.430
ruthless general.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.070
Like every game sequel, it needs to introduce
new aspects as well as improve others and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.979
Socom 3 does this in a big way.

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.890
The addition comes in the way of vehicles.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.810
You will now have Jeeps, Hummers, Tanks, and
others that will help you traverse the maps.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.590
And because of the addition of vehicles, Zipper
Interactive was able to increase the size

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.950
of the maps.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.290
What was entire maps in the first two games,
now is just an area of the much larger map.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.840
This makes for much more engrossing and deep
missions as you will have to move across the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.869
maps with your squad to complete the multiple
objectives.

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.869
Each mission will take a good amount of time
to complete.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.530
In these missions, you will still be doing
the same basic Socom stuff such as neutralizing

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.100
areas, rescuing hostages, and planting explosives
and watching them go boom.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:24.700
A personal favorite.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.310
Everything feels great too, with a control
scheme that has been being improved with each

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.340
entry.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.150
You will very easily give commands to your
squadmates and for the most part they will

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.910
listen and do what you say.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.889
But probably the one aspect that Socom will
always be remember for its online play.

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:46.061
It’s too bad the online servers have since
been shut down because back in the day, this

00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:50.049
was the premier PS2 online experience.

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.230
But even without its fantastic online play,
Socom 3 is still worth playing today.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.150
The missions can be completed multiple ways,
either tactically, aggressively or a combination

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:16.000
of both, and the new larger maps make for
a game that no PS2 fan should go without.
