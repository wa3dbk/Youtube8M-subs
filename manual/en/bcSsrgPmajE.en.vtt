00:00:09.126 --> 00:00:12.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In this converted navy
facility near the San Diego Airport

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:16.276
thoughtfully applied technology
is transforming public education.

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:19.566
&gt;&gt;We're going to want to focus on the
advertising throughout the school.

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:21.856
&gt;&gt;Larry: They're doing things,
they're producing things

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:25.226
so the purpose "tech" in High
Tech High is not for consumption.

00:00:25.616 --> 00:00:26.486
It's for production.

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:29.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A former high school
carpentry teacher with a law degree,

00:00:30.016 --> 00:00:33.726
Larry Rosenstock became
founding principal and C.E.O.

00:00:33.726 --> 00:00:36.016
of High Tech High in 1998.

00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:40.246
&gt;&gt;I tell our visitors who come
here "Stop any child that you want,

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:43.776
grade six through twelve at random
and ask them what they're working

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:44.886
on and watch what happens."

00:00:44.886 --> 00:00:46.316
They'll look you in the
eye and they'll talk to you

00:00:46.316 --> 00:00:47.306
about what they're working on.

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.076
&gt;&gt;Alex: So what we're going to
do in this class is we're going

00:00:49.076 --> 00:00:52.406
to make a movie or like a
documentary on everything we learn.

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:57.096
We're learning about physiology
but we're also learning about like

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.236
after effects which
makes videos and stuff

00:01:00.636 --> 00:01:01.316
so we're bringing them together.

00:01:02.716 --> 00:01:06.266
&gt;&gt;Narrator: High Tech's 2,500
students gain entrance by a lottery

00:01:06.656 --> 00:01:10.386
and represent a cross-section of San
Diego's public school population.

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:12.526
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: Okay, trace it out.

00:01:13.346 --> 00:01:17.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And whether they choose
to focus on the arts or sciences all

00:01:17.486 --> 00:01:19.766
of them are engaged
in rigorous projects.

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.466
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And the one thing
we want to be careful about is

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:24.006
that we don't add your DNA
to these samples and you come

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:25.656
out in the end with your DNA barcode-

00:01:25.656 --> 00:01:30.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In an 11th grade biology
class students are developing a DNA

00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:33.876
barcoding process that will help
African law enforcement officials

00:01:34.256 --> 00:01:35.486
convict poachers.

00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:38.326
&gt;&gt;Teachers: These are photos
that I got last week from one

00:01:38.326 --> 00:01:40.056
of our collaborators in Nairobi.

00:01:40.356 --> 00:01:41.206
This is an eland.

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:43.726
&gt;&gt;I know everyone is really serious
about it because it's a serious issue

00:01:43.726 --> 00:01:45.846
but this is really a lot
more fun than you'd be able

00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:47.106
to do in any other classroom.

00:01:47.186 --> 00:01:49.976
&gt;&gt;A lot of people donate stuff
because we are a non-profit.

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Whenever
possible, projects are designed

00:01:52.906 --> 00:01:56.576
to serve the local community whether
it's creating a storage system

00:01:56.576 --> 00:01:57.576
for the YMCA.

00:01:57.576 --> 00:01:58.956
&gt;&gt;David: We have a
new storage facility-

00:01:58.956 --> 00:02:00.766
&gt;&gt;We can actually take this out.

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:04.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Or designing an
assistive technology device.

00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:06.176
&gt;&gt;David: She used it for the
first time and moved that bar up

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:07.686
and down the paper for
the first time herself.

00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:08.796
Her eyes just lit up.

00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:11.706
It was the first time that she'd
been able to do something on her own

00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:15.806
and it was just the students were
tremendously touched, I was touched.

00:02:15.806 --> 00:02:17.556
It was just a really
amazing experience.

00:02:18.746 --> 00:02:19.416
&gt;&gt;What's going on here?

00:02:19.416 --> 00:02:21.366
&gt;&gt;It's a fat that builds up.

00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:24.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Instead of grades on high
stakes tests at the end of the year,

00:02:24.826 --> 00:02:27.886
students are assessed
on an ongoing basis.

00:02:28.236 --> 00:02:31.566
&gt;&gt;Rob: Assessment is not an
endpoint; it's not an end activity.

00:02:31.796 --> 00:02:34.176
It's something that
goes on moment to moment

00:02:34.566 --> 00:02:38.076
so teachers are always checking for
kids' understanding and so forth

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:41.536
and we're always asking kids to in
a lot of different contexts to kind

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:43.666
of describe what it
is they're working on,

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:45.406
what it is they've
discovered, what their plan is

00:02:45.446 --> 00:02:47.036
for the next day and so on.

00:02:47.036 --> 00:02:48.546
So assessment is folded in.

00:02:48.806 --> 00:02:49.396
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: Good work guys.

00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:49.956
&gt;&gt;Student: Alright, thanks.

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:53.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They are also judged on
their individual digital portfolios

00:02:53.896 --> 00:02:56.746
and their stand-and-deliver
presentations of learning.

00:02:56.746 --> 00:02:58.996
&gt;&gt;Student: I will start this
presentation of learning today

00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:01.346
with math and physics
followed by Spanish I

00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:02.636
and finishing off with humanities.

00:03:03.036 --> 00:03:05.916
&gt;&gt;Christopher: Instead of taking
finals at our school we do POLs,

00:03:05.976 --> 00:03:08.536
which is a presentation of
learning where we get up in front

00:03:08.536 --> 00:03:12.046
of the whole class and the
teachers and a whole panel of people

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:14.856
and tell them exactly what we learned
this year, how it can be applied

00:03:14.856 --> 00:03:17.816
to real life, and how you've
developed in critical thinking

00:03:17.816 --> 00:03:19.356
or developed in other things.

00:03:19.436 --> 00:03:22.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students are also
assessed on their contributions

00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:25.866
to group projects like books on
the ecology of San Diego Bay.

00:03:26.136 --> 00:03:30.396
Larry: These are really high
quality efforts by kids as opposed

00:03:30.586 --> 00:03:34.816
to memorizing 3,000 biology
words to prepare for the AP exam.

00:03:35.276 --> 00:03:37.966
We want kids behaving
like scientists,

00:03:38.376 --> 00:03:41.466
and behaving like photographers,
and behaving like graphic artists.

00:03:41.746 --> 00:03:43.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The High
Tech model is working.

00:03:43.586 --> 00:03:44.956
&gt;&gt;Student: Point one
which is that line-

00:03:45.236 --> 00:03:47.656
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The original high
school has grown into a network

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:49.596
of eight public charter schools.

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:51.036
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: And maybe you
could put that same kind

00:03:51.036 --> 00:03:53.066
of text here, here, and there.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.186
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And 100 percent

00:03:54.186 --> 00:03:57.046
of High Tech High graduates
are accepted to college.

00:03:57.366 --> 00:03:58.926
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: I really
believe in this place.

00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:00.516
I've been here since the beginning

00:04:00.516 --> 00:04:04.416
and I think it is absolutely
the true way to learn.

00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:06.036
&gt;&gt;Gabby: And the brown is
fine in the background?

00:04:06.036 --> 00:04:08.056
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: Yeah the brown is fine
as long as you put those words in.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:09.356
&gt;&gt;Okay, thank you, Okay?

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:12.236
