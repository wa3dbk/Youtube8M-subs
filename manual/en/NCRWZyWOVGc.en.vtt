00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.740
Welcome to Adelaide.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.000
Welcome to the 2012 Santos Tour Down Under.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.990
We're here at Rymill Park, which is the start of the Down Under Classic

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.580
the precursor, of course, to the Santos Tour Down Under

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.950
and the riders will be riding, effectively, around

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.630
Rymill Park on a circuit that's approximately

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.010
two and a half kilometres long

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.230
and it's going to be an absolutely bumper event, as it is every year.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.260
What do the riders look forward to and what can

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.370
they expect to get from an event like this?

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.810
It's a serious race, the riders are actually quite nervous

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.820
because it'll be the first race since the off-season.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.220
They would have been racing all year last year until October

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.200
and they've had the off-season, they've done the Winter training.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.930
They'll be nervous to see how they're going.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.860
This is definitely a sprinter's course, a sprinter's race

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.060
The sprinters in general, you know, they've got a

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.600
quite healthy ego, they'll be out there trying to show

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.160
the other sprinters who's number one.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.530
Yeah Pat, it's really an opprtunity for the riders

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.130
to just get those cobwebs out and really show what they're made of

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.260
and really have that initial ride under their belt

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.980
before the Tuesday, Stage 1 of the Santos Tour Down Under

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.330
and from a spectator point of view, it's absolutely magnificent

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.260
to be able to be so up close and personal.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.690
Anywhere around this track is a great viewing area.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.540
My favourite spots are off Rundle Road itself.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.310
Anywhere from The Stag Hotel down is magnificent

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.070
it's where the start is, it's where the finish is.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.600
You know, that's right Jeff, and it's an opportunity

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.890
for the spectators to get up close to the riders.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.830
The riders are pretty easy going and you can grab 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.230
a photo or a signature from your favourite rider.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.450
It's magnificent, you don't get this kind of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.930
opportunity many places in the world

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.740
to see a world class event with world class riders.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.200
So, spectators and people interested in the event

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.770
can register for the Team UniSA Supporters Club

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.000
and of course you'll be able to watch these videos and any

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.220
video updates from the Supporters Club website as well.
