00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.170
A doctor and an aid worker are the first Americans
to contract Ebola, the deadly virus that’s

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.850
popped up in four African countries since
March.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.299
The disease has several strains, with mortality
rates ranging from 50-90%.

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.860
There is no cure or vaccine yet.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.840
You can get Ebola by coming in contact with
an infected animal, which is why people in

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.900
Africa are at significantly higher risk, because
of their tendency to eat bushmeat.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.890
Once a person’s got it, it can spread fairly
easily from human to human through pretty

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.140
much all bodily fluids.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.550
Once you are infected, Ebola is extremely
aggressive, causing the walls of our smallest

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.469
blood vessels, called capillaries, to separate
so that blood starts leaking.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.329
“It is a very painful and agonizing death
that no one would want to go through,” says

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.329
Dr. Joseph Fair, a virologist working in Africa.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.650
This is by far the worst outbreak of the disease
ever documented, with over 672 deaths and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.650
counting.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.840
Another far too deadly situation is in Gaza.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.690
One of the main reasons Israel invaded Gaza
is to destroy the many tunnels Hamas has dug

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.940
to smuggle all kinds of stuff - including
themselves - beneath the heavily protected

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.570
Israeli border.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.320
These passageways were how Hamas got into
Israel, captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.470
and dragged him back to Palestine, where they
held him for 5 years.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.760
Hamas eventually traded him back in 2011 in
exchange for the Israelis freeing hundreds

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.630
of Palestinian prisoners.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.080
If you want to gain a more complete understanding
of the current conflict, The New York Times

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.930
has a must-watch video that takes you inside
of the tunnels.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.520
Both Hamas and Israel have accused each other
of using drones in the current conflict, which

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.009
is the latest proof that advanced technology
is seeing more action on the world’s battlefields,

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.370
but Japan’s Prime Minister wants them expanded
into our most peaceful event.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.680
Saying that his country should hold a “robot
olympics” in 2020 alongside the summer olympics

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.360
it will host in Tokyo.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.799
The goal is to stimulate growth in the robotics
industry.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.909
The olympic events that I could see working
are weightlifting, swimming, boxing, and track

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.909
and field.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.500
That’s our comment question of the day:
what event do you want to see in the 2020

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.040
robot olympics?

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.750
Hopefully the games will lead to important
advances in robotics, much like the ten best

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.000
breakthroughs in science did for their respective
fields last year, which were making brains

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.260
clear, the discovery of a new solar cell,
lab-grown organoids, realizing that cerebrospinal

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.560
fluid washes through the brain while we sleep,
microsurgical gene-editing, learning more

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.010
about the microbes that live inside us, a
step towards a vaccine for a disease that

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.730
affects millions of babies, deriving stem
cells from cloned human embryos; and gamma

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.700
ray detection in exploding stars billions
of light years away.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.599
The breakthrough of the year was a new way
to treat cancer by harnessing a person’s

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.010
immune system.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.130
You can watch the full video below and take
our poll of the day: what field of science

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.409
will 2014’s biggest breakthrough come from?

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.940
With the rate of glacier depletion around
the world, what we really need is a breakthrough

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.459
in oceanic refreezing science.

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.090
But since that’s not gonna happen any time
soon, we’ll be seeing a lot more of videos

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:21.930
beautiful glaciers - like this massive archway
- collapsing into the sea.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:30.030
The woman holding the camera may be overreacting
a little bit, because this is what a real

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.170
close call looks like.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.920
Well that’ll do it for today’s episode
of TDC.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.690
Thanks for watching, I’m Bryce Plank.
