00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.705
From the farm
to the fork

00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:23.958
There are 22 cows
Only 14 of them produce

00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:27.560
Earlier this year I sold 2 or 3 of mine

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.735
Since there was increasing demand

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.640
I bought some more cows from local farmers

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.120
We try to keep pretty much the same type of breeding

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:48.140
so that we have cows that graze

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.743
that are not confined and can grow at their own pace

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:58.015
we're careful with the food, we buy cows that eat grass exclusively

00:00:58.255 --> 00:01:00.255
and they eat hay during winter and still, wander around even when it snows

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.030
It's a bit hard but we manage to do it

00:01:05.955 --> 00:01:10.250
Most of the time, after slaughter, we store the cows in the freezer room

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.670
for around fifteen days

00:01:12.955 --> 00:01:17.955
for the meat to become tasty and tender

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:19.455
We call this “maturation”

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.675
We slaughter 2 cows a week

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:27.580
one to mature and the other goes to be processed

00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:32.030
Almost all of it is sold on demand

00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:34.895
By word of mouth only, we do not advertise

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.300
Now that's a car!

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.175
Seriously, you can go anywhere with it, it's light

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.170
you can turn around on a narrow path

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.260
while with a big 4- wheel drive you can't, and it uses very little gas
you can turn around on a narrow path

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.670
while with a big 4- wheel drive you can't, and it uses very little gas

00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:56.760
Little by little as I was settling down

00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:01.940
I ended up with 450 sheep

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.995
Part of it is meant for direct sale

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.165
and the other part is reserved for Eid-el-Kebir

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:16.780
It's a breed that exclusively eats grass
These are lambs that eat only grass

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.146
It's a breed accustomed to mountain conditions

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:23.035
Today we're going to the slaughterhouse before we load the crates

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.943
The animal is going to come out of the freezer room, to be weighed again

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.745
and depending on the weight and the waste

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:37.955
we have to define the number of batches

00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:51.785
We are going to take the crates and put meat in it

00:02:52.335 --> 00:02:55.785
but we're going clean it up before we put anything in the crates

00:02:57.745 --> 00:03:01.385
You have to put on a hygiene cap, a clean blouse shirt

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.005
and antibacterial shoes

00:03:07.165 --> 00:03:10.470
We have a certified slaughterer

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:18.335
with very strict specifications so that we can market and guarantee the meat as being “halal” (authorized)

00:03:20.135 --> 00:03:24.470
Now that we have weighed the sheep, we're going to take it to the processing room

00:03:35.995 --> 00:03:38.465
We sell meat without any intermediary at its fair price

00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:43.920
I calculate how much time I spent on processing the meat, at the slaughterhouse, on delivery

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.135
all the supplies I used like plastic bags and crates

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.360
add then our profit margin and come up with a selling price

00:04:06.595 --> 00:04:11.440
We check the meat upon arrival to be sure we have the right temperature

00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:17.561
To maintain the meat at the right termperature, we have a freezer room that is compliant with laws and regulations

00:04:19.255 --> 00:04:22.400
We have a processing room that allows to process the meat

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.220
tie it up and vacuum pack it

00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:35.470
Eventually, the goal is to provide a diversity of products from our farm

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:38.980
raw products like a living lamb or any other animal

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.375
or freshly killed lamb or bovine meat

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.035
we would also offer a large selection of processed products

00:04:49.615 --> 00:04:53.186
such as filet mignon or sausages

00:04:54.398 --> 00:04:55.660
Here is your order

00:04:55.835 --> 00:04:57.785
God bless you ! Thank you !
