00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.859
In this clip I"m going to tell you how to
make Gobi or cauliflower Pakora. So let's

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:35.770
begin. First we take ground gram flour. Five
spoons. Add some garlic paste to it. A little

00:00:35.770 --> 00:01:10.500
salt as per the taste. Ground coriander, cumin
seeds, red chili and Ajwine. Now add water

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:20.930
to it and stir it well so that a thick paste
is formed. Keep on stirring till the paste

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:35.060
is formed completely.
Add some more water as per the requirement.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:43.310
So here the paste is formed. Take the cauliflower.
Now we dip this cauliflower into this already

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:52.510
prepared paste and put it into the already
heated oil. And let it heat for approximately

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.409
two to three minutes till the time it becomes
dark brown in color, which is an indication

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:27.700
that it's ready to eat. So now I guess it's
ready. So I'll take it out.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.220
So your Gobi Pakoras are ready to eat. So
you can eat it with either tomato ketchup

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.270
or mustard sauce.
