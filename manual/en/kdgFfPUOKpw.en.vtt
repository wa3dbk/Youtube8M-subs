00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:03.971
WE HAVE BEEN COVERING THE
REPUBLICANS NOW IT'S TIME TO GET

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:08.075
AN UPDATE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE
OF THE RACE SURGING BERNIE

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:09.176
SANDERS.

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:11.178
&gt;&gt; BERNIE SANDERS IS DRAWING
MORE THAN 10,000 PEOPLE AN

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:12.346
APPEARANCE.

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:15.749
&gt;&gt; MORE THAN 15,000 PEOPLE
SHOWED UP AT HIS NEXT EVENT AND

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:21.655
THEN LAST NIGHT IN PORTLAND HEÑi
HAD THE BIGGEST CROWD YET, A

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:23.857
REPORTED 28,000 PEOPLE SHOWED
UP.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:30.230
&gt;&gt; YEAH, AMERICA.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.164
YEAH.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:35.335
&gt;&gt; AMERICA, DO YOU FEEL A
BERNING SENSATION?

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.305
&gt;&gt; IF IT IS ANYTHING BUT
EMOTIONAL PLEASE CALL YOUR

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:39.506
DOCTOR.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:44.745
&gt;&gt; IT SEEMS HE TAPPED INTO THE
POPULIST ID OF THE DEMOCRATIC

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.848
PARTY AND SEEMS TO BE SURGING
AGAINST ITS EGO.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:51.852
&gt;&gt; BUT WHY ARE PEOPLE PAYING
ATTENTION TO BERNIE SANDERS?  I

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.187
THOUGHT HE WAS JUST A CRAZY
SOCIALIST.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.822
HE'S A SOCIALIST, RIGHT.

00:00:55.822 --> 00:01:02.729
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY IT LOOKS LIKE
MR. MAGOO JUST WANDERED INTO THE

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:03.830
RACE.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.968
OH I WILL BE PRESIDENT, WHY NOT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:09.102
OH, YEAH. FREE COLLEGE TUITION

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:12.172
&gt;&gt; HEY MILLENNIALS KNOW WHAT I
JUST DID?

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.074
I JUST NAILED MAGOO.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:20.514
NAILED IT!  OH, LARRY, YOU
NAILED MAGOO.

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:22.950
BUT NOT EVERYBODY ON THE
PROGRESSIVE PARTY IS THAT

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.084
EXCITED TO HEAR HIM SPEAK.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:26.320
IN FACT, SOME WON'T LET HIM
SPEAK AT ALL.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.691
&gt;&gt; BLACK LIVES MATTER
PROTESTERS SHUTTING DOWN

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:32.693
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNIE
SANDERS FORCING HIM TO LEAVE HIS

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:36.363
OWN RALLY ON SATURDAY IN
SEATTLE.

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:39.967
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SEATTLE FOR BEING
ONE OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:50.777
CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.547
&gt;&gt; SAY HER NAME?  SAY HER NAME?

00:01:53.547 --> 00:01:57.084
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THINGS ARE NOT GOING
WELL WHEN BLACK WOMEN UPEND

00:01:57.084 --> 00:02:00.687
YOUR EVENT AND START RECITING

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:05.125
OLD LYRICS FROM DESTINY'S CHILD,
RIGHT?

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.794
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, THESE WOMEN ARE
FROM BLACK LIVES MATTER, WHO HAD

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.297
AN ISSUE WITH THE SANDERS
CAMPAIGN NOT PAYING ENOUGH

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:11.531
ATTENTION TO THEIR AGENDA.

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:14.835
NOW, LADIES, I AGREE THAT BLACK
LIVES MATTER BUT BLACK MANNERS

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:16.269
MATTER AS WELL.

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:22.142
ALL RIGHT?  AND JUST KEEPING IT
100, IF WE ARE KEEPING IT 100,

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:25.479
AND ALSO BASED ON THE
DEMOGRAPHICS, IF BERNIE SANDERS

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:29.783
RALLIES WERE A BEN AND JERRY'S
ICE CREAM FLAVOR, IT WOULD BE

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:30.317
NILLA, PLEASE.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:33.587
&gt;&gt; KEEP IT 100.

00:02:33.587 --> 00:02:36.056
KEEP IT 100.

00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:39.826
&gt;&gt; THE CHOCOLATE'S IN THERE
SOMEWHERE, BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.229
EAT A LOT OF VANILLA TO GET TO
IT.

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.630
THAT'S ALL I AM SAYING.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.733
BUT THIS DIDN'T DERAIL BERNIE'S
CAMPAIGN, HE ACTUALLY LET THEM

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:50.904
SPEAK AND THEN HE HIRED A MEMBER
OF BLACK LIVES MATTER TO HIS

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:51.505
CAMPAIGN.

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:54.174
BUT NOT ALL -- YEAH, SURE.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.810
BERNIE WAS VERY NICE.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.412
HE WAS VERY GRACIOUS ABOUT IT.

00:02:58.412 --> 00:03:01.381
BUT NOT ALL PEOPLE RESPECTED HIS
LETTING THE BLACK LADIES SPEAK.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.850
&gt;&gt; I WOULD NEVER GIVE UP MY
MICROPHONE.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:04.885
THAT SHOWED SUCH WEAKNESS.

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:09.089
THE WAY HE WAS TAKEN AWAY BY THE
TWO YOUNG WOMEN.

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:15.028
BELIEVE ME, THAT'S NOT GOING TO
HAPPEN TO TRUMP.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.831
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S NOT GOING TO
HAPPEN TO TRUMP?  IS THERE

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.967
ANOTHER TRUMP?  HE IS ALREADY
TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF IN THE

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.235
THIRD PERSON.

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:26.807
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YOU'RE WEAK SANDERS YOU
GOT BEAT BY GIRLS WITH BOOBS!  I

00:03:26.807 --> 00:03:31.411
WOULD HAVE JUST BUILT A WALL
AROUND THE STAGE AND MADE MEXICO

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:32.379
PAY FOR IT.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.083
ALL RIGHT?  THAT'S WHAT TRUMP
WOULD HAVE DONE.

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:39.886
I AM OFFICIALLY ENDORSING TRUMP.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:40.754
ALL RIGHT.

00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:43.323
SO HERE WE GO.

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:46.960
SO WE HAVE GOT THIS CRAZY
SOCIALIST WHO'S PROMISING FREE

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.464
COLLEGE, HAS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
SHOWING UP TO HEAR HIM TALK.

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:55.368
AND WILL MAKE SURE BLACK WOMEN
WON'T YELL AT US.

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:57.037
OKAY?  SO IT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD.

00:03:57.037 --> 00:04:02.909
SO WHY ELSE SHOULD WE TAKE HIM
SERIOUSLY?  SANDERS HAS

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.545
DETHRONED HILLARY CLINTON IN NEW
HAMPSHIRE AFTER TRAILING HER BY

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:07.547
DOUBLE DIGITS BACK IN MARCH.

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:08.682
LOOK AT THAT.

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:10.450
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, MY GOD.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.153
OH, NO.

00:04:13.153 --> 00:04:19.459
NO!  IS THIS HAPPENING AGAIN?  A
CANDIDATE OF PASSION IS ABOUT TO

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.766
OVERTAKE HILLARY?  SHE'S ABOUT
TO GET OBAMA'D BY AN OLD WHITE

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:27.367
MAN?  OH, MY GOSH.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:31.338
I MEAN, LOOK, IT IS ONE THING
FOR A COOL BROTHER TO JUST BURST

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:34.274
ON THE SCENE AND ALL THAT
BROTHERNESS JUST SPILLS OUT ON

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.075
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:36.376
THAT'S JUST SCIENCE.

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:40.380
ALL RIGHT?  BUT WHEN PEOPLE ARE
MORE INSPIRED BY A GUY WHO

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.384
LOOKED LIKE THE ABOUT TO RETIRE
DEAN OF STUDENTS AT OBERLIN, I

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:47.354
HAVE TO ASK, YOU HAVE GOT TO
START ASKING, WHAT THE HELL IS

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:49.556
GOING ON?  OKAY.

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:53.760
SO FOR MORE ON THIS PHENOMENON
WE THOUGHT WE COULD CHECK IN

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.396
AGAIN WITH CLINTON CAMPAIGN
OFFICIAL CARLOS JORDANSON.Ñi

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:57.531
CARLOS, THANK YOU.

00:04:57.531 --> 00:04:59.900
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; Larry: WELCOME BACK,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.868
WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW,
CARLOS.

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:04.871
I HAVE TO ASK YOU, ARE YOU
CONCERNED AT ALL ABOUT BERNIE

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:05.939
SANDERS'S RISING POPULARITY.

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.107
&gt;&gt; NO WAY.

00:05:07.107 --> 00:05:11.878
WE HAVE GOT THE BLASE VOTE
LOCKED UP IN THIS ELECTION.

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:12.979
YEAH.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:18.819
IF IT IS GOING TO BE HILLARY
VERSUS JEB IN A BATTLE OF

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.086
ATTRITION. THAT'S WHY I'M
INTRODUCING OUR SLOGAN: 

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:23.790
HILLARY 2016, HASN'T AMERICA HAD
ENOUGH EXCITEMENT FOR A WHILE? 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.692
OUR NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGAN.

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:28.495
&gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THE
BEST KIND OF SLOGAN.

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.231
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE
PROBLEM?  DO YOU THINK LIBERALS

00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:33.500
AREN'T EXCITED BECAUSE SHE IS
NOT LIBERAL ENOUGH?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.604
&gt;&gt; I GUESS THAT POSSIBLE, LARRY
IT JUST HAS NOT BEEN IMPORTANT.

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:41.508
WHEN YOU HAVE GOT SOMEONE LIKE
BERNIE SANDERS WHO IS EXCITING

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:46.046
AND GENUINE AND WHO NO ONE
DOUBTS CARES ABOUT THE MIDDLE

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:49.049
CLASS, I MEAN, THAT GUY -- HE'S
LIKE A DREAM FOR A PROGRESSIVE

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:51.418
LIKE ME WHO ISN'T ALREADY LOCKED
INTO THIS OTHER CAMPAIGN.

00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:53.486
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:55.956
WAIT, HOLD ON.

00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:56.957
CARLOS, CARLOS.

00:05:56.957 --> 00:05:59.893
I SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE NOT THAT
EXCITED ABOUT HER.

00:05:59.893 --> 00:06:01.628
YOU ARE MORE EXCITED ABOUT
BERNIE.

00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:03.396
&gt;&gt; OH, NO.

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:05.498
&gt;&gt; THIS GUY.

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:08.301
IT IS LIKE -- IT IS LIKE THIS.

00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:09.502
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:11.004
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES YOU
ARE DRIVING WITH SOME FRIENDS

00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:14.441
AND YOU GO TO SIX FLAGS FOR THE
DAY BUT INSTEAD YOU END UP AT

00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:18.111
THE DENTIST'S OFFICE BUT YOU
STILL HAVE A GREAT TIME.

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:18.879
THAT'S ALL THIS IS.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:20.080
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO, NO, HOLD ON.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.781
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:24.884
&gt;&gt; Larry: HILLARY'S, YOU ARE
COMPARING HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN TO

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:27.454
A TRIP TO THE DENTIST'S OFFICE,
THAT DOES NOT SOUND GOOD.

00:06:27.454 --> 00:06:31.725
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS YOUR NEXT QUESTION?

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.159
&gt;&gt; Larry: LOOK.

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:37.330
I REALLY BELIEVE THIS IS ABOUT
PASSION, WHEN ELIZABETH WARREN

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.465
DECIDED NOT TO RUN.

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:42.402
&gt;&gt; STOP, STOP, STOP.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.336
SHE WILL HEAR YOU.

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:45.171
&gt;&gt; Larry: ELIZABETH WARREN?

00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:51.945
&gt;&gt; AH, NO!  SHE IS NOT, SHE WHO
IS NOT ELIZABETH WARREN.

00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:56.082
&gt;&gt; SORRY

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.084
NOW, I DON'T WANT TO GET YOU IN
TROUBLE.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:01.154
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE THE EXCITEMENT
IS WHEN I MENTION NAMES LIKE

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:02.022
ELIZABETH WARREN --.

00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:04.391
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT IS ALL THE TIME
WE HAVE.

00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:05.025
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK!

00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:07.494
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO, NO, NO.

00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:08.595
&gt;&gt; WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.664
&gt;&gt; Larry: I SAY WE WILL BE
RIGHT BACK.

00:07:10.664 --> 00:07:14.067
&gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE YOU ARE AVOIDING
AT ALL ISSUES, CARLOS, LOOK LET

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:17.304
ME JUST SAY, YES, I FEEL LIKE
YOU ARE NOT EXCITED ABOUT YOUR

00:07:17.304 --> 00:07:18.505
CANDIDATE.

00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:19.806
YOU ARE MORE EXCITED ABOUT OTHER
CANDIDATES AND THAT'S A BIG

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:20.573
ISSUE.

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:21.841
HOW DO YOU THINK HILLARY CAN
WIN?.

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:25.945
&gt;&gt; HEY, MAN, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
BE SO FOCUSED ON EXCITEMENT?  0

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.981
YOU KNOW, LIKE, OH, EXCITEMENT.

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:31.818
HEY I AM EXCITED TO EAT BROCCOLI
BECAUSE IT CONTAINS VITAMINS,

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:34.387
YOU DIG?  THAT IS WHAT
HILLARY IS, SHE IS EATING

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:35.455
BROCCOLI.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.058
IN FACT THAT'S OUR NEW NEW
SLOGAN, VOTE FOR HILLARY, 

00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:41.661
SHE'S YOUR BROCCOLI, AMERICA.

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:42.395
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S ENOUGH.
164
00:07:42,395 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
CARLOS JORDANSON, EVERYBODY!  WE
WILL BE RIGHT BACK!
