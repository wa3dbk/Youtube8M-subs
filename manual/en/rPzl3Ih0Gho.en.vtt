00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.820
So what on earth is this, Vanessa?

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.380
This is a Kaiserschmarrn. What did you say?

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.800
Kaiserschmarrn, it's the Emporer's nonsense. Yes.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.560
It was the favourite dish of the Emperor Franz Joseph

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.060
of Austria, the last Emperor. And what it is,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.080
is basically, a very very fine pancake batter,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.640
but not, you can't use a mix or anything.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.780
It's made with rum and you know, and really nice.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.380
And the eggs are separated,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.780
and so they are made into stiff egg whites,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.160
and the other one is pancake batter,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.620
and then it's folded under with soaked raisins.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.400
The raisins are soaked in rum. And then it's quickly,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.520
three minutes on the stove, in a cast iron pan and butter.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.700
Yes. And then it goes in the oven, it's baked.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.220
Oh. Okay. And at the end it's going to be torn,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.160
a few rum soaked raisins on top, some icing sugar,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.740
and some, it's a plum confit, goes on top. Plum confit.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.520
Right. It's called zwetschgenrosta.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.980
Zwetschgenrosta Okay. Kaiserschmarrn.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.960
Kaiserschmarrn. Only at the Gingerbread Cottage.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.800
Ha ha ha! Only at the Gingerbread Cottage

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.160
and the Sacher Hotel probably. And the Sacher Hotel.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.700
Yeah. Yeah, look at this, wow. It's fantastic.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.020
Totally fantastic. So, you fold it over and rip it up or?

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.540
No, just leave it. It goes in the oven, just over baked,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.900
and then it's ripped. Oh okay. Nice. Yep,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.380
this here can go in the oven. It's going now in the oven?

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.860
Yep. It goes in the oven. This is a two part deal.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.660
Yeah. See how it puffs up nicely. Yep. It's like a soufflé.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.320
Soufflé, okay. Follow you over to the oven now.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.400
Not too shabby of an oven. Yeah.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.660
How long do you cook it in there? Seven minutes,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.240
maybe. At what, 350? 350 325 350 depending on the oven. Convection oven.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.600
Yeah. So until brown or what? Until golden. Until golden.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.920
Okay, we'll be back when you prepare it. Ha ha ha.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.830
