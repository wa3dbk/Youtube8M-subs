00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.410
Hello everyone and welcome to this week's
game development log video diary! And this

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.110
week, I am very excited
because for the first time, I'm going to be

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.869
demonstrating the new multiplayer auctioning
system in my game,

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.560
which is basically like an in-game E bay!

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.190
You're probably familiar with auction systems
in games, especially in mmo's where's there's

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.310
often one centralized
auction house where you can buy and sell pretty

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.760
much any item you want at the click of a button,
and that's something I'm not really a fan

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.760
of. I find it a bit cheaty that you can get
pretty much any item in the game whenever

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.941
you want as long as you have enough
money. I want to encourage my players to have

00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:41.210
to travel the world to get exotic items, to
encourage them to craft their own weapons

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.649
and armor, and so my auction system is a little
bit different.

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.949
So what I've done is, instead of having one
central auction system, I've given every single

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.200
regular shop in the world
its own personal auction system, but just

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.219
for the item categories that the shop already
supports. So if I open up this shop here you

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.030
can see I've now got these two tabs on the
side. This one is just the usual shop that

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.000
I showed you last time, but clicking on this
tab opens up the auction section of this shop,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.360
which, as you can see, still comprises of
the same categories.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.790
So now I'll give you now a quick demonstration
of how the auction system works. We've got

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.430
two players here, this
player in the santa hat who we'll call santa,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.270
and this other player in the armor who we'll
just call Bob.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.670
And as you can see, Bob's pretty poor, he
doesn't have any money, but he does have some

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.860
rubies and some clothes that he really wants
to sell. So Bob goes over to this shop here

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.780
and he sees that the shop will buy his rubies
for 1.3k, and his clothes for just 80. But

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.530
of course Bob wants to make a bit more money
than that, so he's going to try his luck out

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.460
in the auction.
So he auctions 40 of his rubies for 1.5k each,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.310
and starts auctioning his clothes for 100
each.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.980
Now at the same time Santa comes along here,
and as luck would have it he's actually looking

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:10.099
for rubies to buy! So he opens up the shop
and sees that rubies cost 1.9k which is a

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.099
bit expensive for him, so he takes a look
in the auction section.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.390
And here in the auction section you can actually
see the offers appearing as Bob auctions off

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.390
his clothes.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.159
So Santa sees the 40 rubies that are being
offered for 1.5k, and he's pretty happy with

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.819
that price so he buys half of them. And because
Santa loves a good deal he starts buying off

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:38.019
some of the clothes as well. Now Bob has already
left the shop and he's gone off to run around

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.969
in the fields or something, but you can see
that even though he's already left the shop

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.609
he's still getting the money for the offers
as Santa buys them.

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.969
And that is pretty much the auction system
in a nutshell. I've still got loads of features

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.609
to add to this system,
But for now it's a good foundation, and something

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.260
that I'll be able improve on in the future.
I'm fairly happy with how it has turned out,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.249
I think this system will be able to reward
sellers who have taken time to acquire

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:06.560
or craft the items that they're selling, but
at the same time it doesn't allow buyers to

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.720
just get whatever item
they want whenever they want it without even

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.819
moving, because I feel that that takes out
a lot of the fun from the game.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.330
So that is it for this week! Thanks a lot
for watching this video. I would really love

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.790
to know what you guys think of the auction
system so please leave a comment below with

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.019
any feedback or suggestions that you might
have. Next week I'm going to be starting the

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.189
combat system so that should be fun. But until
then, do subscribe if you haven't

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.329
already, have a great week, and I will see
you all next time.
