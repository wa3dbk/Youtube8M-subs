00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:06.850
Ralph: Hi, I'm Ralph.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.000
Chris: And I'm Chris.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.650
And we're down in the Crutchfield studio to
give you a close look at the Bose SoundDock®

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.140
Series II speaker system for your iPod.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.110
This is a great accessory.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.680
You just slip your docking iPod or iPhone
right in here.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.830
It charges it while it's on there.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.669
And look how slim and sleek and good-looking
this system is.

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.939
It fits into just about any décor really
nicely.

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.480
Ralph: Oh yeah.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.060
And you can also use this with other things
as well, because it has an auxiliary input

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.149
in the back.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.850
So you could plug in your computer, instead
of using computer speakers.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.090
Or you could use another kind of MP3 player
if you wanted to, and still get that great

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.210
room-filling sound with those devices as well.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.360
It also has a remote with an interesting feature
on it.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.420
Now, most of these remotes will do stop/start,
fast forward/back.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.680
But this one lets you skip through playlists.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.820
So for example, you're in the kitchen.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.019
Your husband puts something on, on his playlist.

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.221
He leaves to go mow the yard.

00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:05.221
What are you going to do?

00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:06.659
Chris: I'm going to change it!

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.250
Ralph: Yeah, I thought so.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.890
Chris: Normally, I'd have to go to the speaker
system, though, and change it on my iPod.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.270
But this remote lets you do it right from
where you are.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.299
Ralph: Right, so if you don't want to listen
to that, you can skip to this, or even skip

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.299
down to that.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.680
Chris: That's a pretty sophisticated feature.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.680
Ralph: Indeed it is.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.680
Chris: Really nice.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.680
Ralph: Saves me many steps.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.329
Chris: So this is a great system if you just
want to share your music with family and friends

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.140
from your den, your kitchen, your bedroom
— wherever you have it.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.460
But let's say you want to take your music
on the go.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.460
Ralph: Right.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.420
You can, because there is a SoundDock® Portable.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.420
Chris: Exactly.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.609
It's just a little more compact, folds up
nice and neat, has a handle, and also comes

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:49.340
with a rechargeable battery, so you don't
have to worry about plugging it in anywhere,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.560
which is a really nice feature.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.619
You can also get an optional travel bag, just
to keep it safe while you're on the road.

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.189
Ralph: And to keep that finish looking handsome.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.189
Chris: Exactly.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.909
Ralph: So if you'd like to know more about
