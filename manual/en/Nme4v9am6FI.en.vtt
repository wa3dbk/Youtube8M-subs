00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.120
welcome back everybody

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.349
well as you can see i finally got this gun out of Becky's hands

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.709
only because she ran out of bullets though

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.050
well i want to take just a moment

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.020
to go over some of the features this scope
has on it we'll start with the windage and elevation

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.029
controls

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.230
this is called the ackey track ajustment

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.240
they're covered with metal caps

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.630
they're not plastic so they're gonna
last

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.900
the adjustments can be made with your finger tips

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.480
as you make your adjustments you can
actually feel this knob click

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.459
so when you have to change settings or
repeat them is very easy to do

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:40.370
because you can feel those clicks

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.020
let's move to the front of the scope
this is the bigger end of the scope

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.110
is the objective lens they call it the
eluminator lens system

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.240
this is important or low light periods
when animals are most active and this

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.230
scope im telling ya you look at this scope in low light situations

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.650
it looks like broad daylight well move back to the back of the scope where the cross-hairs are

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.600
they actually call this the ackey reticul

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.980
instead of just cross-hairs on some of
these models they have actual precis

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.640
aiming points what this does is as it
allows very easy adjustments for shots

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.280
anywhere from two hundred to five
hundred yards

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.480
along with that

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.200
you know if you use some spots there's
kind of a sweet spot in them and sometimes

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.570
it's hard to pick up your animal not with these scopes they got a  very large view

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.890
inside of it and it makes it just makes it quick and easy to pick up your target

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.799
you can rest assured if you buy one of the
scopes its gonna last for a lifetime

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.970
and redfield backs that up with a
lifetime guarantee which is nice and you

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.159
don't have to be the original owner if
you've got a redfield scope you just

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.040
send it back to Oregon they will either repair it or replace it with no charge

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.899
so far

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.000
all of the scopes seem to be in perfect working order

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.370
but in the rare event a scope does have to be sent back for one reason or another

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.579
it will first

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:59.579
find itself in the hands of Alan ransom for some live fire testing

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.450
what we do regularly

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.600
for customers that have

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.979
either a point of aim or point of impact or a issue with their scope

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.879
our technical services group
first tries to walk them through

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.139
some diagnostics over the phone if that doesn't work

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:19.529
we often recommend that they send it in
and then we do live fire testing and we

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:26.529
try to duplicate the problem after having

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.399
only seven of every one hundred thousand
units sold are found to be defective

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:53.159
with a track record like that we can confidently head

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.549
over to the shipping department

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.949
and watch finished red field revolutions go right out the door

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:03.260
although the these revolution scopes have been designed manufactured and

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.930
tested with precise

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.769
attention to detail hopefully

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.769
all of that dedication to quality is proving useful in Colorado

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.810
some cow elk come in to our left at 25 yards

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.860
we thought that there could be a bull behind them then i heard a rustling in the leaves up in the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.939
scrub brush the oak brush above me

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.959
and all of a sudden i saw out of the corner of my eye some elk ears

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.219
and some cows moving and then i saw more and more and i listened to Jerry say

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.969
there's a bull in there

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.049
i had to turn around from

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.939
being set up in a whole different
position to a new position

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.359
and shoot off hand

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.849
but they're only twenty five yards so
i thought i can do this i can do this

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.869
and they were all milling around
together and

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:03.860
and the bull was to the back of them

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.510
and i was pointing more left and

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.510
and Jerry was telling me he was more right hes going to the right hold it to the right the farthest one to the right

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.310
i was just confirming with Jerry that i was on the right elk

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.440
and i said hes standing to his left hes standing between those two trees yes shoot and

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.440
i heard shoot shoot shoot

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.759
did i get him? you sure did

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.820
he went over here yeah and the bull went here

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.409
he was the lightest colored one and you kept

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:45.569
saying the lightest color and its so dark right now

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.139
and i pulled my rifle and i could see him better

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.750
through my scope than the naked eye

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.009
which is amazing

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.240
this is fantastic

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.570
should we go look at it

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.960
it should be  right up in here

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.979
oh hes broken

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.750
hes broken bad

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.250
his tops broken

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.879

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:20.589

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:24.049
is he dead touch him oh hes dead

00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:26.469

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.389
and hes meat for my friends it was really important for me to get this elk

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:46.630
very important

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.030

and it gonna make her feel real good

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.849
this has to be the most incredible hunt ive ever been on

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.449
to have such bad bad weather

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:19.199
