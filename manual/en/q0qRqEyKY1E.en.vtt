Hello again, everyone.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:10.170
I’m Heitor Fraga and I’m here today to
talk about that new trailer of Batman – Arkham Knight

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:20.340
that just came out, and is focused
on Harley Quinn. I know that guys like RealComicBookGamer

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.730
and a lot of other ones will probably do a
video about this same trailer too, so I’m

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.910
here to talk not just about my impressions
and opinions, but also what that trailer meant

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.810
to me, as a modder.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:46.350
I’ll preface myself saying that I’m doing
mods for the Arkhamverse since 2012, so,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.100
that's three years now. I’m basically Mr. Jag modding
teacher, don’t matter what he may say about

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:06.880
it. I am. Okay? You have to admit it. Until today, I wasn’t really enchanted
by the graphics of Arkham Knight. I mean

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.000
it IS really beautiful, that’s obvious, of course, 
and I would be blind if I didn’t noticed

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.380
it. But what I’m saying is that the graphic
of the game wasn’t making me any surprise, y'know?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:31.720
Once the game was so delayed, like, months, and it’s been released to this new generation of consoles and PCs, I was indeed

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:40.369
expecting this and maybe even more of the
game, visually. The mechanic of the game , of course, were

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:49.770
sold to me since the first moment, but I wasn’t
really impressed with the graphics. I really wasn't, until

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.990
trailer came out.    So, to be honest...

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.360
I don’t exactly know WHAT was the thing
that make me so damn much impressed, in the trailer, but in

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.939
the moment that Harley jumps over that cop,
in like… Second seventeen, I think, my heart

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:17.950
go all like OMGINEEDTHISSHITRIGHTNOW. That
was the moment that this cinematic effect

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:33.280
they’re trying to sell these past months, with all the trailers and gameplays, the 
same that is in the lightning, and in the
materials, and the reflects, that all came

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:42.670
to me like in just one second. I was basically
punched in the face by that cinematic atmosphere they've created, y'know?

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:52.180
In that moment, and I was already impressed with everything in this shot, I pause the video and restart

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:08.480
it, from the beggining, paying attention to the textures in things. The clothes, the walls, the floor, the skin of the characters, and I don't know if any of those

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:30.690
are new, somehow, if there's an difference between PC and PS4 - of course there are -, or if the video has been somehow improved, or if I just

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:38.349
haven’t noticed it before, but this game
is so fricking beautiful, man... I mean, those textures

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:44.510
probably have four thousand pixels, dude. That's the double of the biggest one in Arkham Origins,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:53.550
for example. It’s incredibly detailed, and
each particle in that closed universe seems

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.910
to be in the right place, doing the right
thing at the fucking right time, you know what I mean?

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.799
Much of that is due the engines they’re
using to render the game, and for how big

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:20.639
these new 3D models probably are, as the game have, like, 60 GB. These models are probably three or four times more softened than the

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.889
ones used in Arkham Origins, that is naturally
a more squared game, wich I personally don’t

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:34.279
like, because I don't like the graphics in Arkham Origins. To me they are a backset in comparison to Arkham

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.289
City and even Asylum. And I'm so impressed

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:49.490
with the graphics in this trailer... I may be talking shit here, I sincerely don't know. I don’t even know why am I making this video, right

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:57.279
now, but I felt that... urge, to express my thoughts
about it, y’know? I’m really just fricking

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:12.219
out here, but I’m really, really excited
about modding Arkham Knight like... Twenty days now, twenty one days. Because I am 100%

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:17.009
sure that game will be fucking awesome.

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:24.059
I could say more about the trailer, about
the graphics, I could say why I’m love with

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:30.349
Catwoman and Poison Ivy in Arkham Knight – what
probably could stand for a whole video, because

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:36.059
I’m truly in love with both –, I could
say how much hyped I am about that Harley

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:41.180
gameplay, despite the fact that I am kinda
unsure about that detective mode they’ve

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:59.039
shown for her, in this same trailer, Harley’s
one--I'm repeating myself here. But I’m having big hopes that Arkham Knight will be...

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:10.929
Okay, it certainly will be the best game in the franchise. It will be. God want it to be. It will be. The best game in this fucking franchise.

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:16.339
I won’t ask for likes, comments or anything
like that in this video, because I’m really not

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:23.499
putting any serious effort into this one,
this video, but I’ll accept all of it with

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:34.729
as much love as I have for Selina and Ivy. Almost. Almost, not exactly the same love. I actually have to thank you, if you watch

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:40.800
me saying bullshit so far. So, thank you very
much, guys, you’re all awesome! As I’ve

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:47.479
said in my previous video, I’m truly blessed
for this channel, and that all due you guys.

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:51.529
Thank you all again, for real! Thank you all.

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:57.449
That’s it for now. Stay tunned, I think. I’m not sure if I’ll be posting any more videos

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:02.219
like this one… It’s very probably that
I’ll, because is mad funny record things

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:04.289
like that, and… I love you guys, okay?

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:06.659
See ya next time!
