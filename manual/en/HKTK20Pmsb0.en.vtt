00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.410
In this segment, we're going to varnish our
plate which is removed. And, you will also

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.480
varnish the head of the screw and you will
go back to your surface area and actually

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.369
varnish the plugs at the same time. Now, you
won't get electrocuted because you're going

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.180
to use a sponge brush and you're just going
to brush the surface of it. Any place that

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.990
you've painted you need to varnish and that's
what will keep the paint solid. And, if you

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:34.250
remember, the varnish is water based, it comes
in gloss, satin and matte, so whatever surface

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.960
you're doing sometimes you might want to just
leave it matte. If it's something that won't

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.440
have water use around it, you don't even have
to varnish it. Granite is shiny, so you need

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.200
the gloss and you'll need at least three coats,
letting them dry in between, make sure their

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:59.129
completely dry and then varnish that, your
screw and your plugs, all three coats. And,

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:09.500
it's simple enough using your wax paper again,
just pour it out, take your sponge brush and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.490
you just brush along. It actually goes on
a little milky, but it dries clear. Try not

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.540
to make bubbles, the sponge brush tends to
make the bubbles, but you get it nice big

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:31.799
strokes with it, so it's nice to use. Just
make sure it's all covered. Try to make them

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.710
in the same direction. And you can actually
drop your screw in here and do it at the same

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.560
time, if you want to, but it's not necessary.
Just make sure you do three coats, all of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.150
the edges and that you have it covered well.
So, what you want to do is let this dry and

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.049
then you'll do another two coats. Make sure
it's dry in between. The three coats gives

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.280
you a nice, solid finish. It makes the colors
look deeper and richer and it tends to match

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.609
the sheen of your granite.
