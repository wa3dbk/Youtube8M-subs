00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.090
First, take a Snazaroo paint in sparkle pink and load it onto a face painting sponge.  

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.160
Check that the colourâ€™s not too dark on your wrist before you apply it to the face.  

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.000
Very lightly apply a small amount of the colour right on the apples of the cheeks to create a rosy glow.  

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For the cat ears load up some Snazaroo face paint in white and create two triangles

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.050
starting on the eyebrow extending up into the forehead.   

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.170
Add a small tuft of white fur right in between the ears 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.260
and also use the white paint to fill in the area between the nose and the top lip.  

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.260
Next take a fuchsia pink colour and paint in a small bow.  

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.280
Start with a circle right in the middle and then add two tails either side.  

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.300
Switch to a black paint and give everything an outline.  

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.300
Start with the ears and be very careful to keep your lines as thin and neat as possible.  

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.040
Use light wispy strokes to give the tuft of fur some definition.  

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.120
Also outline the bow to make it really stand out.  

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.040
Paint a couple of small flicks on the outside corners of the eyes to look like wispy eyelashes 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.340
Then connect the nose down to the top lip with a thin straight line.  

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.120
Round out the bottom edges with a small triangle and then carefully outline the rest of the muzzle.  

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.160
Add a few different size dots on each side and then paint in some whiskers.  

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.170
Finally add a small pink nose and finish it off with a black outline.
