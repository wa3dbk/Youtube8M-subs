00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.070
Frontside
Start by trying this trick in the frontside

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.380
direction as many riders find it easier.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.500
Frontside 180 to tail butter, switch backside
180 out.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.660
I've broken this whole trick down into a bunch
of stepping stones to make leaning it as easy

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.660
as possible.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.820
If this is a new trick for you, then try each
of these steps a couple of times, then spend

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.490
most of your time practicing the actual trick.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:48.000
Step 1: Sliding
While riding, slide a frontside 180 then a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.690
switch backside 180.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.980
Pay attention to the to the line of approach.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.790
I'm setting up with using a obvious heel edge
turn to slide the frontside 180 and using

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.980
my toe edge to slide the switch backside 180.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.380
If you watch closely you'll see that the frontside
180 is more of a rotational movement where

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.720
my upper and lower body both rotate together
and the switch backside 180 is a counter-rotated

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.119
180 where the upper and lower body rotate
against each other.

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:26.540
Sliding these 2 180s will give you the most
basic movements involved in this trick.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.119
Step 2: Add ollies
Ollie a frontside 180, then ollie a switch

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.229
backside 180
This uses the exact same entry path and movement

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.950
as step 1 with a rotational 180 followed by
a counter-rotated 180.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.330
The ollie is one of the most fundamental tricks
in snowboarding.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.540
All good riders use ollies and nollies into
and out of their butter tricks.
