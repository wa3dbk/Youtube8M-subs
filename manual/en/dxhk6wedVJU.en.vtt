00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.750
Hi. I'm Christine Dustin. I've been a

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.250
competitive swimmer since I was 5 years

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.440
old. I've competed at the national and at

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.540
the collegiate level. Now I'm a swim

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.460
coach and the Fin Fun swim instructor.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.710
Mermaid tails are a super fun way for

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.260
kids and adults to play, use their

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.480
imagination, build swimming skills, and

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.410
get a great workout. But first, let's go

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.150
over some important safety tips. Step one: This is for

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.340
the kids. Always swim with adult

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.239
supervision.

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.190
Any time kids are in the water, adults

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.719
should be constantly watching to make

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.469
sure they're safe.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.370
Step two: Make sure that you are swim

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.890
ready. Remember our first video about your

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.930
swimming ability. It's very important to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.510
be swim ready certified. If you can't

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.070
swim with two legs you aren't ready to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.930
swim like a mermaid. Swim ready

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.239
certification is mandatory for mermaid

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.760
certification. If you haven't completed

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.500
this training yet, please watch this

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.220
video now.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.909
Step three: Always put your monofin on while

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.320
sitting at the edge of the water. Even

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.610
though you're super excited to put it on,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.350
you'll need to wait until you're close

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.750
enough to slip into the water.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.820
Trust me. It's a lot easier and safer this way.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.659
Step four:

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.850
Only swim as a mermaid in places where

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.430
you would normally swim as a human.  If

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.930
you aren't comfortable swimming in the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.750
ocean without a tail, don't do it with

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.000
a mermaid tail on. If you can't swim in

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.800
the deep end without a tail,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.410
don't do it with a mermaid tail on. If

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.330
you normally stay close to the edge or

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.820
the wall without your tail, stay close to

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.619
the edge or wall with your tail on.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.369
Step five:

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.500
If for any reason you need to get out of

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.179
your tail quickly, you can kick it off

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.490
while swimming. First wiggle your feet

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.649
out of the tail. You will usually pull

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.360
one foot out first and then use that

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.160
foot to push on the fin to get the other

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.650
foot out. Then pull your tail down and

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.090
swim out of your tail.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.450
Step six: Kids you don't have gills!

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.970
Remember your upper body is still human

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.920
so you'll need to breathe the same as

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.080
you normally do when swimming. Don't

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.770
hold your breath

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.080
and don't dive too deep. Make sure you're

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.849
near the surface so you can breathe when

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.800
you need to breathe. A good tip is to

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.180
roll over onto your back

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.010
and float when you need to rest, and then

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.390
just breathe normally. Step seven: When

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.830
you show up to the pool with your pretty

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.269
tail on you're definitely going to make

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.950
a splash. But make sure you're

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.150
considerate of the other swimmers

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.190
there. Your monofin is going to make

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.290
you swim faster so make sure to watch

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.600
where you're going. A good tip is if

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.340
you're on your back make sure you have

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.410
your hands above your head. And if you're

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.180
on your front make sure you also have

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.680
your hand in front of you and that

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.340
you're watching where you're going. We

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.810
hope all the little mermaids out there

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.150
have fun and swim safe. Make sure to watch

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.160
our other Fin Fun safety videos for more

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.900
instructions. Thanks for watching!
