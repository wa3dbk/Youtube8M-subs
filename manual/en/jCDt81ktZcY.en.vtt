00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I finally bought a SONY's Camera, cyber shot.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's been long time since I bought a digital camera before.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So what I got here is...

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Sony Cyber shot DSC WX150.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What do you think about this??

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's a small camera, well it is just a compact camera.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I actually wanted to buy a better camera,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but I am not a proffesional cameraman and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I didn't think that I need a better or high quality camera for now.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Well I think I would buy something better in the future soon.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I just need to take some pictures and videos for fun.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I would say that cameras now are high quality and it can record full HD video's and high definition pictures.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The camera I got is, DSC WX150, it has 18.2MP Exmor R CMOS sensor

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It says 10x optical/20x Clear Image zoom

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Well...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I don't think there is something else I can tell you about this camera...

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You know what, it say superior auto, high speed AF. AF means auto focus, I guess...

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I am sorry I actually don't know about any terms like this and spec..

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Well, 18MP, Full HD Video and, High speed AF are pretty enogh for me now.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Also it was inexpensive.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
My camera I used to use is now old and ibought it about 4 years ago, which is Panasonic's Lumix

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It was....10MP camera I think thats it, so...

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
(I am talking to myself so never mind...)

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Anyways, now I will try this product and will show you how the video looks like.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So check out the videos I got.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Sample video in the bright room

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Now zooming

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
This is the maximum. It doesn't foucus good here.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Outside the house 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Like this, how is it?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
It is just a compact camera so I would say this is good enough.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Recording while walking

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
You know what I don't even know if it is good. lol

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Now self shooting. I wonder how it looks like.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I actually can't show you my room since it is messed. lol

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Well this is it.
