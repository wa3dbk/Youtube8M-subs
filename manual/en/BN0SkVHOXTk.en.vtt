00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.940
The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, is
home to the nation's first fully-automated

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.470
electric bike sharing station - make that
two stations - thanks to research questions

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.289
posed by civil and environmental engineering
assistant professor Chris Cherry. "We have

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.080
electric-assist bikes that have an electric
motor in the hub that allows users to go up

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.080
hills with more ease. We also have regular
bicycles that are included in the system so

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.420
if someone has a preference for regular bicycles
they can use those regular bicycles." One station,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.769
located in Presidential Court, uses power
off the grid. The other, on the Agriculture

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.249
campus, uses solar power. Registered members
of Cherry's pilot program easily check out

00:00:54.249 --> 00:01:00.210
bikes with a swipe of their university ID.
"When the user wants to check out a bike, first

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.129
they have to check out a battery. Here we
have the battery vending system that allows

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.940
us to distribute the right battery to the
user. The battery that ensures the minimum

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.000
state of charge - meaning they can go a certain
distance on a single change. We give them

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.600
the battery - this is a lithium-ion battery,
they close the door. Then we send them to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.480
a bike - an electric bike thatâ€™s ready to
go. They slide the battery in the back, lock

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.280
it up and then check the bike out." Cherry
and his team are collecting data on a number

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.060
of questions related to safety, environmental
impact, and travel behavior to see if electric

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.610
bikes could become more popular here in the
US. "One of the main motivations for including

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.610
electric bikes in a bike sharing system is
I was hoping to expose more people to a relatively

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.590
very efficient mode of transportation. A lot
of people won't bicycle around campus and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.480
East Tennessee because of the terrain and
weather and other things. Electric bikes can

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.500
help overcome that." According to Cherry, electric
bikes also overcome air quality and environmental

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.750
health issues by displacing other more polluting
modes of transportation.
