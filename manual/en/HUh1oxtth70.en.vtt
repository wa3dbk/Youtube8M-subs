Welcome everyone to Raphofleo’s Minecraft
Tutorial on Adding the Mineplex Server to

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.690
play Multiplayer mini-games in Minecraft.
I am Raphofleo.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.339
I’m using my four sword rating scale to
approximate the level of difficulty of the

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.930
content in this video.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.769
One sword being for Minecraft beginners and
four swords being for Master Minecrafters.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.029
This tutorial is for Minecraft beginners.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.679
I’ve rated this video with a difficulty
level of one out of four swords.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.680
I’ve been playing Minecraft for Xbox 360
for a while now and I do plan to check out

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.670
the extended maps provided with the Xbox One
version.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.400
In addition to Minecraft on Xbox, I also enjoy
gaming on Mojang’s Mac and PC version of

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.700
Minecraft.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.470
As you know, Xbox Live provides its own infrastructure
for hosting multiplayer Minecraft experiences.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.120
The Mac and PC version of Minecraft requires
a few additional steps.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.890
Don’t worry, the steps are just a click
or two away.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.750
First, let’s load Minecraft.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.750
We’ll open Finder, go into our Applications
menu.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.360
For this tutorial we’re using Minecraft
version 1.8.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:30.090
We’ll click Play. We’ll maximize our window
here.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.600
Now when you see the Minecraft title screen,
click Multiplayer.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.930
Now we see the Play Multiplayer window.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.229
Click Add server with your left mouse button.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.580
In the Server Name field, feel free to leave
the default “Minecraft Server” title or

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.060
update however you like.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.920
Since we’re going to add the Mineplex.com
server, we will left-click into the Server

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.920
Name field and change the title to Mineplex.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:23.060
Next, click into the Server Address field
and type the url mineplex.com

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.800
Click Done.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.560
After returning to the Play Multiplayer window,
click the Mineplex.com server listing you

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.740
just added.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.680
Click Join Server.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.600
Now, here we see our standard load screens.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.100
And…

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.000
We’ve done it! We’ve been placed in one
of over 50 lobbies on the Mineplex server.

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.369
We can move our Minecraft avatar forward to
explore the lobby full of custom Minecraft

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.520
mini-games.

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.309
By walking into any one of these portals,
we will be teleported to the waiting area

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:08.540
for that mini-game.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.309
Before you start exploring, let’s say you
have a friend playing Minecraft on the Mineplex

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:16.290
server and you would like to join his or her
game.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.219
Even though you and your friend are both logged
into the Mineplex server, you won’t be able

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:25.040
to play together until you’re in the same
Mineplex Lobby.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.219
Since so many Minecrafters are logged in,
playing multiplayer mini-games simultaneously,

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.639
Mineplex separates players into lobbies.

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.189
Each lobby contains the same set of mini-games.

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:41.159
To find out which lobby you’re currently
in, highlight the gold Clock in your hotkey

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:48.159
bar by pressing 2 (or any other key you’ve
assigned to this slot) on your keyboard.

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.769
Assuming you are still using the default mouse
controls, click the right mouse button (or

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:04.129
control click on a Mac). The Minecraft Control
screen refers to this as Button 2 or the 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.279
Use Item button.

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:10.109
After right-clicking, the Lobby Selector window
will load.

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:17.010
The block highlighted in green shows which
server you’re currently logged into.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.510
As you can see here, we’re currently logged in
to Lobby number 23.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.180
Let’s say you just spoke with your friend
on Skype and you know that they are in Lobby number

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.639
19.

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.940
Move your cursor over number 19 and click
the left mouse button (known as button 1 or

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.840
the Attack button).

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.009
We’ve made it to Lobby number 19!

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.770
Now, before jumping into your first mini-game
with your friend, explore the Tutorials available

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.849
on the Mineplex server.

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.319
Watching Tutorial videos are a quick and easy
way to build a stockpile of gems.

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.870
Gems allow you to purchase mini-game perks
and fun character improvements on the Mineplex

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.530
server.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.180
From the main spawn area, walk over to the
villager offering a gem reward for the Welcome

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.789
Tutorial.

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.900
The Welcome Tutorial gives you a large gem
reward and equips you with the basic skills

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:18.900
you’ll need to have on the Mineplex server.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.720
Before watching the Welcome Tutorial, let’s
walk over to the Party Tutorial to learn how

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.720
to communicate and play mini-games with our
friend.

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:43.409
Click the right mouse button which we learned
before is the Use Item button.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.060
After watching the Party Tutorial, we will
have the skills to link up with our friend

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.439
and select our first mini-game!

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:55.720
