Hello today we are going to talk about cleaning
road dirt from your tires. This is a very

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.610
important process in cleaning the vehicle
so what I am going to do is just give you

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.990
some general guidelines to make sure that
you adhere to and successfully clean your

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.170
tires and make sure that there aren't any
hazardous materials embedded in your tire.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.540
The first thing you always want to do is inspect
your tire, look at it to make sure there aren't

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.359
any nails in it or anything like that that
have been accumulated during your driving

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.810
and after you have inspected it you are just
going to spray it down. I am going to take

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:45.100
my sprayer here and then just spray the tire
down. This helps to loosen the dirt before

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.949
we start brushing it off with our brush and
now that it is wet we are going to apply our

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:00.590
wheel cleaner or our tire cleaner and basically
this is just an all purpose cleaner used for

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:10.430
cleaning any kind of surface area. I'm going
to take my brush, tire brush, and just brush

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:23.590
my cleaner into there. You see the suds start
to foam and also get the wheels because a

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:32.310
lot of your road dust accumulates on your
wheels and continue to brush and sometimes

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:43.020
if the cleaner starts to dry you'll hit it
again with your sprayer and make sure you

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:58.890
get around the lug nuts and then just spray
the tire off and you see that your tire is

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:25.520
clean. You will take a microfiber towel and
wipe the towel down, wipe the wheel area down

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.680
and
now what you have is a tire that is clean

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.700
from any road dust and you're ready to apply
the tire dressing of your choice.
