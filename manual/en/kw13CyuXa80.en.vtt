Jo here at the Holiday Michael's Party. I want to show you how we've 

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.051
taken the ornaments off the tree

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:20.453
and decided to make a beautiful window treatment. 

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:26.192
We just put some garland over the window and we've got these beautiful glitter ornaments.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.964
Most of you who know me know I love glitter. Well I've got a new project today

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.501
to show you that's going to make quick and easy ornaments and they're going to look fabulous. 

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:39.672
The product we are going to use is called Glitter-It and it is a very liquify type glue. 

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:42.675
So pick out any color of the wonderful glitter we have

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:45.678
now notice I am using our little tray to catch out glitter. 

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:49.015
Any size ornament will work, but you need to use glass. 

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:52.218
So we're going to take this and we've taken

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.321
and we've just cut the tip off of our Glitter-It and we're

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:58.324
going to put it down in the bottle. What you want to do is you want to rotate

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:04.264
this around and you want to make sure that the whole entire ornament is covered with this glue. 

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:06.900
Now don't shake it because what happens is

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.568
well we tried that, thinking oh that will really cover it good

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.571
is it puts bubbles in it and then the glitter doesn't stick. 

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:16.776
Have a little container because we want to save the Glitter-It and put it back in our container. 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.412
This is what makes this such a great value, because you could probably get 30 

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.614
or more ornaments out of a bottle of that. 

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:26.186
So I've chose this beautiful pink glitter and I am just going to pour it in

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.354
Can't have too much because we can pour it out. 

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:33.526
I'm just going to make sure that I have completely covered that whole ornament. 

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:38.398
Look at how beautiful that is. So all we need to do is put the cap back on and 

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:42.902
you are ready to go onto the next ornament. Now I will tell you, you can use this glitter

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:46.106
on any kind of glass bowl or anything that you maybe want to put

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.975
glitter inside, so remember how fun these are.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.545
I want to see what kind of combinations you came up with. Show me on Facebook.
