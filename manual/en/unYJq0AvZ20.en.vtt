Hi, everyone. My name's Pete Miller publisher of this book here: You Can Be A Wedding MC

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.189
The wedding I'm just about to MC is just about to start

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.049
So I'm just going to make this a quick message to welcome you to the site. You'll find a lot of things here

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.129
That will give you a help to be you're the best MC, and there's lots of secrets derived, developed from writing this book

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.740
I own an agency called The Wedding MC Hotline, we supply professional MC's to all the major venues in town

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.020
this book really is a plug and play if you like

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.110
To use the computer terminology. I've made it as easy as possible for you to pick up a book and run with it

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.459
This is the largest selling book of its kind in the world and what people love is the templates in the back

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.460
there's a template for how to introduce the

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.650
Bride and Groom, when it comes to speeches how to introduce the speeches plus lots of little funny one liners I picked up over the years

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.729
I've been doing this for ten years and absolutely love it. I think I have the best job in the world really

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.970
I mean who else can say every time I go to work it's a party

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.209
It's true, and hope you do the very very best of job now. This is a great investment

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.619
It's only 47 U.S. dollars and really that amount of money

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.369
It's a very small investment to pay for something that you've got to get right

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.039
Most of the MC's work is done before the wedding not when you're getting up with the microphone

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.799
but before you get to the wedding and the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.869
wedding party details is a very very important sheet, look out for that. The reception run sheet of course that's

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.119
essential and you need to get with the bride and groom

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.889
There's a template called interview which is on the right questions to ask the bride and groom

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.790
There's lots and lots in here, in fact if you're buying the ebook then

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.858
You've got the very best version, see I published this in 2000, it was the year 2000 and then again in

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.759
2004 it was updated and revised

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.549
but since then I've kept adding to the ebook which is the one that you're going to buy because

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.919
It's the very very latest, I mean probably tonight because I'm always learning stuff right, so I come home

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.390
I type it into my word document

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.029
I make it into a Pdf document, and then I upload it to the website it's too easy so you're getting the very very very latest

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.629
There's all kinds of traditions about for the ethnic weddings

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:12.219
There's everything that you need and if you don't find it, if for some unknown reason if you don't think it's appropriate then I will personally

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.989
give you one hundred percent refund that's absolutely guaranteed, so

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.650

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.720
