00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.640
Life on the ocean waves can be pretty exciting.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.740
There's screens to look at.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.590
And a snack shop.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.270
And someone cooks you dinner every day.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.290
It's a great way to see the world.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.780
Until something goes wrong.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.920
Because hundreds of miles from land, no-one
can hear you scream, and help could be a very

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.300
long way away.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.720
And the worst thing that can happen on board
a ship?

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.460
Apart from sinking...

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.189
Is a fire.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.680
Ships are full of narrow corridors, made up
of metal boxes which keep heat in, making

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:41.430
the fire hot, but also have a tendancy to
warp, causing more damage, as well as having

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.399
holes for wiring and the like just big enough
to provide them with Oxygen and help the fire

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.399
spread.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.840
Firefighting on ships is no fun at all.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.480
Which is one of the reasons the US navy has
been working alongside various universities,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.879
including Virginia Tech, to develop SAFFiR
- an android firefighter capable of safely

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.220
entering a room, extinguishing the fire, and
getting out without putting any human lives

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.220
at risk.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.740
Sort of like this, but better.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.040
But why an android?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.320
Why so much effort and expense into creating
the most difficult to perfect, expensive to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.540
build, tricky to maintain robotic form?

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.210
Well quite simply because ships are built
for humans.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.990
They have narrow corridors.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.579
they have raised bulkheads in the floor and
steep stairs which a tracked robot can't climb.

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.119
And they have heavy, outwards opening doors
with heavy, tricky locking handles.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.090
And, after years of development, SAFFiR is
finally ready for trials, it'll begin fighting

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.670
real fires on board a real ship from July,
according to the navy.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.119
The ship in question will be a retired landing
dock which is routinely set alight to test

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.110
new firefighting equipment - so it's not exactly
a sea trial, so to speak, but if it works,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:06.429
SAFFiR could just be a revolution in firefighting.
