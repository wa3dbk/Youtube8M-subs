00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.799
Edward?
Privateering: is that dangerous?

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.230
We are not the men meant to govern

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.650
We take

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.919
and spend,

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:23.880
and live heartedly

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.480
Wherever we go

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.060
We are moments away from the grandest prize
of all.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.109
Ten thousand times above what we could pull
off any Spanish ship.

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:37.609
That ain't a fortune, it's a fantasy.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:43.699
To fight beside a man so driven by personal
gain and glory is a hard thing, Edward!

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.699
if you continue on your present course,
you will find you are the only one walking

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.379
it!

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.320
The men who call themselves Governors of this
Island:

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.219
Charles Vane,
Ben Hornigold

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.640
and Ed Thatch...
... be hanged by the neck until dead.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.160
When I turn around,
there's not a man or woman that I love left

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.510
standing beside me.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.290
This will be your fate if you fail to cooperate.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.000
I will choose a new path
but I will never cooperate with those bastards!

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag.
Edward Kenway story trailer.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
AC4 Black Flag

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
