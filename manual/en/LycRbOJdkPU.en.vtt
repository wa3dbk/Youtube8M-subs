00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.000
[Dramatic Music Plays]

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.379
Please don't go! Not the Camel! Can't I just have a secret?! Please!

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:17.379
Just one secret! Please don't go! You're being unfair. Stay with me! Please! Wait! I'll show you!

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.910
I'll show you how I do my bangs...

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.090
Bangs are like a frame for your face. I'd say they're the most important thing aside from eyebrows

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.980
You don't look good without eyebrows.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.970
Bangs take up about half of the right side of my head.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.380
And my bangs are kind of divided into three main sublayers starting from my chin to the bottom of my nose.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.690
I often give myself haircuts, because I like to make sure that the top layer is 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.690
is lined up with the bottom of my nose.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.670
This piece is looking a little bit long, so I'm just gonna give it a little trim.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.380
Snip, Snip, Snip

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.160
You want to cut it upwards, otherwise you're just gonna have a big straight chunk..

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.530
and it's gonna look really awkward, even when you curl it.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.890
I'm just gonna fix another few pieces as well and then I'm gonna proceed to curl it.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.430
The reason I like such layered bangs is so they have that winged effect when I curl them. 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.200
And I'm going in again with the scissors. Snip snip snip. 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.320
I kind of like cutting them in triangles, just so they don't have that..

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.590
chopped look that I was talking about earlier.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.680
And there you go. Looks fine to me, so I'm just going to pin up the top layer.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.570
The top two layers, rather. 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.210
And then curl the bottom outwards. Just gonna pull the straightener away from the root. 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.689
And kind of curl it.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.710
It's gonna sometimes go the wrong way, but you just fix it the right way, it'll stay like that I promise. 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.620
You can count on me girl. 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.920
You can count on me. 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.000
And then you keep doing that. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.210
Sometimes it will go the right way, sometimes it won't.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.560
Curls like to stick together, so you just gotta tell 'em what you want them to do..

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.620
and they will do what you tell them to. 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.640
So that one went the wrong way, flip it the right way. And after you just run your fingers through it and 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.300
it will stay that way, don't worry about it. 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.409
And I'm doing the last one on the bottom. 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.449
Curling it outwards. There it is... Very nice. 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.150
It's starting to have that kind of winged effect that I was talking about. 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.119
Even on the bottom layer, I have a lot of hair, so mine are typically more 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.529
winged than other peoples when they try it.

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:25.389
But it still looks good none-the-less. So I'm taking the next layer down 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:30.639
I'm gonna pin the top layer and I'm just gonna work on the middle layer. Which is a small layer.

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.309
But an important one, 'cause we like layers around here.

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:35.659
Gonna take that...

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.549
..fix a stray hair that's been annoying me for this whole video.

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:40.790
and then

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.869
curl it outwards like you did before.

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:48.829
There it goes, it went the wrong way, you make it go the right way. You tell it!

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.509
There we go. That is WINGED.

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.959
And then you take the top layer down. 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.540
And you do the same thing with the first
two you and you something a little bit

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.540
different with the one that's right
above your forehead.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.040
So I'm curling that outwards. I'm pulling up and away, because it gives the roots and..

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.540
everything volume. I really like... 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.040
voluminous bangs. I really hate flat bangs.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.239
And, I'm doing it again. 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.059
There it is! Make it go the right way.

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:26.459
And then you take this first little piece and you pull it up and down.

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.619
Rather than sideways, and you get this little flip (this ugly little flip) 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:32.629
I work with this little thing every single day

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.069
You kinda look like Cruella Deville for a second, but you just pull it the way you want it to go

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.150
while it's still hot and it will stay. 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.669
So there it is, there's the finished look. And just to make sure that it stays a little bit more

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.239
you put your homemade hairspray on there, 'cause we don't like chemicals that much.

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.039
You take one cup of water and four
teaspoons of organic raw sugar.

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:57.689
You put that in there, you dissolve it completely, like, completely, otherwise it will..

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.379
clog up your spray bottle.

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:07.859
And then you pour it in your bottle, and then you refrigerate it.

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.799
This is great stuff, you can use alcohol as a preservative, I choose not to. 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.209
It's an old trick, but a good one none-the-less. And there is my hair spray.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:21.849
The bottle I chose mists really well, so it doesn't just wet your hair. 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.999
There are my back layers, I brought them to the front. 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:27.319
And that's the finished look. Nice, isn't it?

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:31.580
It's kinda like Farrah Fawcett, but I like it like that. And that's how I do my magical, secret bangs. 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.620
I hope you enjoyed it!

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.639
