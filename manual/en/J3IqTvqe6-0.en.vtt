00:00:03.244 --> 00:00:05.156
Something is disturbing
in the underworld.

00:00:07.297 --> 00:00:10.116
I feared it is the first top place
for Maul flourish.

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:13.356
This imply with the rebels.

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:16.956
It is up no relevance to the senate
compared to the Separatist threat.

00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:21.196
Begin your attack.

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:28.374
This is war, Stela.

00:00:31.288 --> 00:00:32.355
Onderon is ours.

00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:35.276
And we will keep reminding them,
until we get it back.

00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:37.476
Stela is a born leader.

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:41.156
There will be more droids coming.

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:43.396
Choose your target wisely.

00:00:45.164 --> 00:00:46.942
For the Republic!

00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:49.276
Time is not on our side.

00:00:49.964 --> 00:00:52.756
We believe you five can get
onboard this Separatist dreadnought.

00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:54.636
And steal that encryption module.

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:57.252
You are our secret weapons.

00:00:59.164 --> 00:01:01.076
Their are some citizens
of the Republic

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.621
who believe the Jedi order
is not what it use to be.

00:01:04.444 --> 00:01:06.956
If willing to destroyed the Temple,
the attacker is.

00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:09.236
Too great links they will go.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.796
To keep from being caught.

00:01:16.324 --> 00:01:19.076
We can help you reclaim Mandalore.

00:01:24.764 --> 00:01:28.876
The resurrection of our warrior past
is about to begin.

00:01:30.084 --> 00:01:31.777
Mandalor will be yours,

00:01:32.684 --> 00:01:35.836
and Kenobi,
this Sith pretended Dooku,

00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:38.243
and all our enemies.

00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:40.396
Will fall.

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:51.829
Watch out!

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:59.996
You are a clone, in a soldier,
in a Republic army.

00:02:01.764 --> 00:02:03.236
Our mission depends on it.

00:02:10.884 --> 00:02:12.716
I sense a deep anger in you.

00:02:17.164 --> 00:02:19.396
Everything
that you fought so hard for,

00:02:19.736 --> 00:02:20.996
will be destroyed.

00:02:21.347 --> 00:02:22.116
Anakin!

00:02:23.324 --> 00:02:26.876
Sometimes heroes fall
despite their strenght.

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:30.285
For Mandalore!

00:02:40.964 --> 00:02:41.836
Remember,

00:02:42.927 --> 00:02:44.436
they can only be two.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.516
And you are no longer my apprentice.
