Now, I?m going to do a bunch of grass down
here. If I just put it all solid green, it

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:22.290
won't be very interesting. So I'm going to
do wet and wet with this. Start off with a

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:30.390
yellowish - yellow and cobalt together. This
is going to be sort of a yellow tone up here.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:01:03.399
Turned out to be more of a green tone, but
we can correct that. Keep it wet by adding

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:21.319
color; lots of water. Okay, and it's cobalt
blue and yellow. Continuously. But just in

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:38.369
different amounts of density and different
relative amounts of yellow and blue. Now that's

00:01:38.369 --> 00:02:03.909
way too much blue. But I can move that around.
This all has to be done in one step, because

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:59.650
it's wet and wet. Okay. Leave it like that
for now. Remove any of the hard edges.
