Hi I'm Kim from Simply Beautiful in Austin,
Texas. We are going to talk about how to apply

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.970
makeup for work. Makeup for work is a more
defined style. You want to highlight your

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:17.520
eyes and your lips but keep the overall look
soft. If you have florescent lighting at work

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.590
you want to keep it into the gold tones to
counteract the greenish hue that you will

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.140
get with the florescent lighting. So we are
going to just do a regular standard makeup,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.960
first with our concealer under the eye and
blend well. You want to go forward with your

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:44.120
foundation dotting it around the face using
your cosmetic sponge and blending it. Blending

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.960
it all don't forget under your jawline. This
is our standard practice. Don't forget your

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.770
moisturizer and your skincare regimen before
your concealer. Now we are using more warm

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.510
tones because we don't want to use anything
too garish and bright so we are going to go

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.740
with a neutral palate with Nancy today so
we have a little bit of a neutral pink, a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:15.210
neutral brown and then a flat brown and a
flat white. Using our biggest floppiest brush

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.380
with the most bristles we are going to do
the pink color which is our most neutral color

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.040
and sweep it from the lash line to above the
crease in the eye and bring it out just slightly.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.979
You want to keep this neutral and remember
my tips, always blend. Blending is the key

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:40.470
to good eye shadow. Using your compact bristle
brush, the medium size we are going to go

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:49.869
with the second shadow, put it on, tap it
off so you don't get it on your clothing and

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.560
just in the crease of the eye and a little
bit above it bring it up and out and blend

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.630
it up. You can use your finger tips to blend.
By bringing it above the brow bone you are

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.109
going to open and widen your eyes without
creating a very dramatic look. Using the smallest

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:18.870
bristled brush that you have we are going
to go with the darker mat color across the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:28.930
eyelashes as close to the lashes as you possibly
can and blend, blend, blend. That is beautiful.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.499
Take your soft dark brown pencil. I think
black is a little harsh for the work space

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:47.939
but a dark black brown pencil and dotting
it across and smudging, that works. Go underneath

00:02:47.939 --> 00:03:00.040
with the pencil and blend again with your
small bristled brush. Your blush is applied

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:10.879
quickly with the flat head brush, sweep it
around on your cheek, chin and forehead. A

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:19.669
liner, a neutral color liner that works with
your skin tone. I think corals and bronzes

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:30.159
and pinks are the best for the work space
and a lipstick with your lip brush. Give yourself

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.729
a good coat and you can refresh it throughout
the day with your lip gloss.
