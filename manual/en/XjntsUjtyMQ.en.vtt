00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:09.179
My name is Joseph Shung Chiang Lee. I am the
member of the Calcutta Racing Pigeon Club.

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:19.480
My advice on how to keep the pigeon fit and
free from disease. The main thing is to keep

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:33.440
your loft clean and dry and then feed them
healthy hygienic food and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.760
every 3 months you should de-worm your bird
by giving fibosims or sestophyn. To deworm

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:51.660
your bird at least 3 months, once in 3 months.
Then every night in the night you should go

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.609
into your loft with your torch. You check
their droppings. If the dropping is loose

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:03.280
or if it is green in color or white, that
means there is something wrong with your pigeons.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.930
You should immediately separate the pigeons
and keep them separately and then you have

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:19.840
to treat them. The main advice I give to the
fans here for making the loft free from disease

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.810
whenever they get any pigeon in from outside
or any friends have given you pigeons, keep

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.990
them separately for at least 10 days. Observe
them, if they have no disease then you mix

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.500
them with your pigeons. The main disease always
comes from outside. When you bring some pigeon

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.450
from outside, they might contain some disease
that will spread into your loft. So you should

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:54.200
always keep the outside pigeons at least 1
week or 10 days separate, then you mix with

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:03.630
your loft. Then of course, you have to give
chemical back to your pigeons to get them

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:14.250
free from all the fleas and the feathers and
all that. We give them chemicals back by mixing

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:25.480
in their water. Some insecticide thing that
they use for dogs. That is one insecticide

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.240
that they use for the dogs. So mix that in
the water and we dip the pigeon into the water

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:40.670
to clear the fleas. So this we usually do
about every 4 months and that is setting all

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.170
we need to do to keep our pigeons free from
the disease.
