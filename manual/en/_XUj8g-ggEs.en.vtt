BUT MEETING YOU AND
JIMMY OLSEN AND MR. WHITE,

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:25.591 align:start position:0%
ON THE WHOLE,
I'D SAY IT'S BEEN SWELL.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:28.327
SWELL?

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:29.828
YOU KNOW, CLARK,

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:33.332 align:start size:75% position:25%

PEOPLE LEFT IN THE WORLD

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.269 align:start size:75% position:25%
WHO FEEL COMFORTABLE
SAYING THAT WORD.

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:37.270 align:start position:0%
WHAT WORD?

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:38.404 align:start size:38% position:63%
SWELL.

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:41.340 size:75% position:38%
REALLY? I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT WAS KIND OF NATURAL.

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:42.341 align:start position:0%
OOH...I'M SORRY.

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:43.842 align:start size:25% position:75%

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:50.849 align:start size:63% position:38%

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:52.851 align:start position:0%

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:54.353
REX, THIS IS, UM...

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.854 size:84% position:42%
CLARK KENT.

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:57.356 align:start size:13% position:88%

00:00:57.423 --> 00:00:59.358 align:start size:88% position:13%
UH...LOIS?

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:01.927 align:start size:50% position:50%
HEY, WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:04.297 align:start size:88% position:13%

WITH YOUR COAT?

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:06.299 align:start size:75% position:25%
DO YOU LIKE MR. WHITE?

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:09.268 align:start position:0%

HE WAS REALLY NICE.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:10.570 align:start size:50% position:50%
HEY! COME HERE!

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:12.805 align:start size:50% position:50%
COME ON!
GET IN HERE!

00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:14.807 align:start position:0%
LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.

00:01:14.873 --> 00:01:17.042
DO WHAT HE SAYS.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.511 align:start size:38% position:63%
GET IN HERE!

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.512
DON'T...DON'T
DO ANYTHING.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.280
WE'RE COMING.

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:22.815
EXCUSE ME.

00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:24.317 align:start position:0%
GO ON, BACK THERE!

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:27.320 align:start size:75% position:25%
PLEASE DON'T
POINT THAT AT ME, SIR.

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:29.822 align:start size:75% position:25%
YOU COULD HURT SOMEBODY 
WITH THAT.

00:01:29.888 --> 00:01:31.591 align:start size:50% position:50%
OK, OK,
HOLD IT THERE!

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:32.625
JUST A MINUTE, MISTER.

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:34.494
I REALIZE OF COURSE
THAT TIMES ARE TOUGH,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.830 align:start size:75% position:25%
BUT THIS ISN'T
THE ANSWER.

00:01:37.896 --> 00:01:41.767
YOU CAN'T SOLVE
SOCIETY'S PROBLEMS WITH A GUN.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.469 align:start size:50% position:50%
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.005 align:start size:50% position:50%
I'LL TURN OVER
A NEW LEAF.

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:49.308
SEE? HE DOESN'T REALLY
WANT TO HURT ANYBODY.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:52.445 size:84% position:58%
RIGHT AFTER I RIP OFF
THIS LADY'S PURSE.

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:53.679 align:start size:88% position:13%
OF COURSE.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.748 align:start size:63% position:38%
COME ON, LADY,
HAND IT OVER.

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:58.151
LOIS, MAYBE YOU BETTER...

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.956 align:start size:88% position:13%
LOIS,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:10.763 align:start size:88% position:13%
AAH!

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.472 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:20.806 align:start size:38% position:63%
CLARK!

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:22.808 align:start size:50% position:50%

ALL RIGHT?

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:24.310 align:start size:38% position:63%
CLARK!

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:26.312 align:start size:50% position:50%

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.315 align:start position:0%
GOLLY! I GUESS
I MUST HAVE FAINTED.

FAINTED?

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:32.318 align:start size:38% position:63%
YOU FAINTED?

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:33.952 align:start size:88% position:13%
SORRY.

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:46.332 align:start size:38% position:63%
SWELL.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.302 align:start size:75% position:25%
REALLY, LOIS, SUPPOSING
THAT MAN HAD SHOT YOU?

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:50.869 align:start size:75% position:25%
IS IT WORTH
RISKING YOUR LIFE

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:52.271 align:start size:75% position:25%
OVER $10,
2 CREDIT CARDS,

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:54.207
A HAIRBRUSH,
AND A LIPSTICK?

00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:56.108 align:start position:0%
HOW DID YOU
KNOW THAT?

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:57.843 align:start size:50% position:50%
KNOW WHAT?

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.146 align:start position:0%
YOU JUST DESCIBED THE EXACT
CONTENTS OF MY PURSE.

00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:06.018 align:start size:50% position:50%
UM...WILD GUESS.

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:10.489 align:start position:0%
UH, TAXI!
