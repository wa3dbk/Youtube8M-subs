it's pretty remarkable

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:25.230
but we're going even further than that

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.919
because what we've done

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:33.919
is we've written an application ourselves
I

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.090
Brian tell you about this

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.620
incredible engineers are chief is the chief
architect for all our video maps i'd like

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.800
when you come up and show the students

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.750
I

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.970
thanks very much you know I've been working
on video editing software for a long time

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.210
once a pretty groundbreaking products fifteen
years ago spinal cut pro

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.310
three years ago with a new line of the

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.810
this year I had the opportunity to work on
another one

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.100
I'm really bright on

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.660
and for the most exciting things I've ever
worked on

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.020
you can now report each day video

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.620
and it was beautiful thing transitions in
titles and share your finish or of movies

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.390
all on the device that carried a pocket every
day

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.260
it's really amazing let me show it to you

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.160
does it bring this up

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.420
and you can see the icon haven't up on that

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.869
so once we bring up the application you get
a list of all the projects

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.230
you have

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.000
and I'm going to go ahead and just up on this
project

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.750
delegate lead heading in harmony

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.530
I can see the clips but had added

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.970
this project down here along the bottom

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.070
go ahead with its own over suing the landscape
he should have the same view here

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.140
and let's go and do a little bit of editing
on this

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.179
I can record directly in the meantime what
I want

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.319
four I can choose from existing

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.900
%uh clips and voters there on the device

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.789

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.980
you put this in

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.790
and I can't

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.429
and change the scale of the time line down
here

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:26.819
and we're going to select this clip

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.659
I can just grab a pen

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.239

and photos automatically get ken burns effect
on them

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.349
it's like going to just go back to the beginning

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.809
and I can pan around I can zoom in

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:07.339

to the end organized ken burns effect on that

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:10.819

well

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.119
two things transition want to do that

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:19.969
