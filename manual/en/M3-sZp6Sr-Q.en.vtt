Hi this is Matt Senatore on behalf of Expert
Village, and today we're going to learn how

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:15.070
to make my grandma Josephine's chicken parmesan.
Now let's add some seasoning to our sauce.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:23.540
So let's add a tablespoon of garlic powder,
we're going to add a tablespoon of oregano.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:31.930
Now when you're adding your spices, just add,
add a little bit in the beginning. Don't add

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.572
too much in the front. You want to do it as
you go. Every half hour you want to taste

00:00:36.572 --> 00:00:40.340
it and add, add to your sauce. You don't want
to do too much in the beginning because you

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.860
can't take it out once it's in. Then we're
going to add a half a tablespoon of salt,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:57.300
then a half a tablespoon of red pepper, for
that little, little bite, little zing. Then

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:08.520
a tablespoon of basil, and my favorite, two
tablespoons of sugar, because I like it sweet.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:25.260
Then we're going to mix that in. Just mix
it in so you don't really see the oregano,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:36.259
just kind of mix it in there. Okay, then we're
going to cover it. Now we're going to let

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.299
this cook for about an hour and a half to
two hours. Now every half an hour, go to it,

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.219
give it a little taste, see if you need anymore
sugar, if you need anymore salt, if you need

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.459
anymore pepper, see what it needs, and add
to it. Don't add too much in the beginning.

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.069
Make sure you add it as you go because like
I said, once you put, if you put it in the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.209
beginning and you put too much, your sauce
is ruined. So now that we're letting this

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.270
cook, we're going to cut the meat.
