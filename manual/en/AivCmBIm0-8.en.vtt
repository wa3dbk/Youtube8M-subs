00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.370
&gt;&gt;Kooberz: Hey Everyone! Kooberz here, and
today is the long overdue re-start of my series:

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.100
Videogame stuff made out of Lego. For the
first tutorial, I'm going to show you how

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.660
to make the Portal robots uh, Peabody and\'85
I forgot the blue guy's name. And I'm also

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.519
going to make Wheatley here, and these are
the same models I used in my video, Portal

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.390
2: Part 1, which you can see on my channel.
So let's get started and I'm going to show

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.630
you how to make these.\
\

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.050
So first up is the orange robot, Peabody.
Um, these are all the things you'll need,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.050
and uh, if you're wondering these black, small
tube pieces are the black tubes that come

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.929
in some Lego sets. I cut them because it's
the only way I could figure out how to make

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:54.129
them small enough so uh what you'll have to
do is cut them down to size to make them fit.

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.629
So here's the process. You take a one by three
plate, two of these little triangle uh pieces

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.400
right here and one there\
\

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.710
[pause]\
\

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.740
and one there like that. Now a one by one
brick or plate\'85 sorry. Put that in the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.280
middle and then a orange dot for her eyeball.
\

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.190
\
[pause]\

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.740
\
Now, you take two of these little clamp pieces

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.740
and they don't fit on quite perfectly, but
one right there and one right there like that.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.590
One for the top, and one for the legs. Now
we attach a uh, long tube which I've cut onto

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.890
the top of here like that, and you just take
two droid arms and attach one like so to the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.009
side\
\

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:50.890
[pause]\
\

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.960
and this one to this side and now she's got
her arms. \

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.000
\
[pause]\

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.680
\
Perfect. Now we take the other small little

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.850
tube and put it on the bottom clamp, clamp
it in there. Now you take the other two droid

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.520
arms\
\

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.200
[pause]\
\

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.240
One like that\
\

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.920
[pause]\
\

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.920
one like that. Oh I screwed this up last time.
Make sure that the knees are out. The uh,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.780
so that they're going like this because our
knees don't bend the other way. I put this

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.360
one on backwards. \
\

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.540
[pause]\
\

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.069
Just like that. There you go, and now Peabody
is correct. Now um, I built this to try and

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.920
imitate the video game model as much as possible
so her legs uh are not she doesn't\'85she

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.519
doesn't stay up. So I use a bit of clay for
my animations, stick her on the ground and

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.700
she's great and she can walk around. \
\

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.250
\
Ok, so now lets do the blue guy. \

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.500
\
\

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.610
So these are all the pieces you'll need to
build the blue robot. Um, these are the sort

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.459
of different droid arm pieces and everything,
so here's where we'll get started. \

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:57.709
\
\

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.299
Now, the number one important thing to do
is start with this piece, which has studs

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.569
on all sides, but start with this piece up
because you don't need to use that part for

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.999
anything. So, we're going to\'85actually we'll
attach those later. \

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:12.249
\
\

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Take two of the little um, pistol guns and
attach them on the side facing upwards just

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.500
like that. \
\

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.940
\
Then you take the little arm clamp thing,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.810
attach it going down onto the pistol here.
\

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.680
\
[pause]\

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.739
\
Like that, and now take two of the little

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:42.470
droid arm things the thicker ones and stick
the hole in the thing, like so. Be childish

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.260
if you want to make a joke about that. :p\
\

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.849
\
Alrighty, so there's his arms. He actually

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.200
looks like a pretty cool skeleton without
the circles. Now we take these T-bars here.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.569
You can find them in lots of the Star Wars
pieces and stick it on the bottom like so.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.819
\
\

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.020
\
So now he looks like uh\

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.270
\
[pause]\

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:04.439
\
a terminator with his skin cut off. And now

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:11.439
take two more of these and attach one like
that\'85and the other like that. Like so.

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:15.239
\
\

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:15.760
[pause]\
\

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.070
And now you've got your own little brainiack
robot. Hehe. \

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.730
\
[pause]\

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.470
\
And so now we just have to take two of these

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.470
circles, you know, two of the disks. White
disks. One on the front, one on the back.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.650
\
\

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.660
[pause]\
\

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:37.660
And take a one by one blue dot tile, stick
it on that for the eye just like that and

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.090
then turn him over. You have a little antenna
piece the little\

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.560
\
[pause]\

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.440
\
you know, what are they called\'85stick shift.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.880
And attach it on the back, that's his little
antenna. Ta Da! And now you have the blue

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.100
robot and he's quite maneuverable you can
actually bend his arms, he can cheer. He can

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.480
do all kinds of stuff he's pretty cool. He
can uh \

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.170
\
[pause]\

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.300
\
He can call a touchdown for the FortyNiners.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.420
Aww, Forty Niners. \
\

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.780
[pause]\
\

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.930
Ok, so now we're going to make Wheatley. You
have to take another one of these um, pieces

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.910
with the studs on all sides but this time
we leave the bottom of the piece going sideways

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.230
instead of up like on the blue robot. So\'85\
\

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.590
\
first take one of these clamps. Attach it

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.900
on the top and do the same thing on the bottom,
one of these clamps. \

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.419
\
[pause]\

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.320
\
just like that. And then take two handlebar

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.890
pieces. This is all Wheatley really has at
this scale to give him some emotion in animations

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.500
because they move side to side and attach
that on the top\

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.900
\
[pause]\

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.500
\
and attach this on the bottom. \

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.300
\
[pause]\

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.710
\
and now take two disks just like the blue

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.790
robot. Now it could be white or grey. I chose
grey just so he didn't look like the blue

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:03.790
robot uh, with his arms cut off. And uh, attach
the other disk onto the back like so.\

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.240
\
[pause]\

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.060
\
and a light blue\

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.930
\
[pause]\

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.530
\
disk for the circle. I mean for his eyeball.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:16.000
And just twist the things inside. And you
can use the back panel to attach him to whatever

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.660
you want and um \
\

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.060
[pause]\
\

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.600
you know, take something like this and you
can move him to the side like he does in the

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.570
videogame, like Wheatley. Haha!\
\

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.710
\
Ok, so that's today's tutorial for all three

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.569
robots from Portal 2, which I love, I love
that game!\

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:32.819

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.940
show you something really cool, I'm going
to turn the camera really, over here. It's

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.229
kind of secret unless you've seen it before.
\

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:47.479
\
\

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:54.230
Oh ho! Look at this! This is my current animation
right now and it's a very large model of New

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.970
York City here. And uh\'85\
\

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:57.370
[pause]\
\

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.740
right now it's going to be uh\'85Batman! It's
going to be Batman the Dark Knight. Uh, the

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.080
big fight on Wall Street between Batman and
Bane's forces. So\'85\

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.870
\
[pause]\

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.980
\
It's going to be truly epic in scale. If you

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:16.020
like that, if you like Batman, if you like
Lego animation, please subscribe and follow
