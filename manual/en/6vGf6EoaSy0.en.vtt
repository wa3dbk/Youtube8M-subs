Hi I'm Tim Gipson and I'm going to talk to
you about how to paint a bathroom. Now you

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.150
will need a roller and you want a roller that
has at least a 3/8 inch deep roller to it

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.529
and one thing to keep in mind as far as rollers
and what thickness of rollers to do is that

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:26.230
the thicker the roller the heavier the texture
of the paint so if you've got walls that are

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.500
very rough like a concrete wall then you will
use a thicker roller so you are able to get

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.840
the paint in there. The smoother the finish
the shorter the nap but the 3/8's is kind

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.890
of a standard and works best for painting
most rooms. The next thing you will need is

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.170
you are going to need a good paint brush for
cutting in around the edges and corners and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.300
then you will need some painter's plastic
and some tape and one thing that is handy

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.710
is that you can get these paint masks and
it has actually masking tape and plastic all

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.379
in one so I'll just rip off a small piece
to demonstrate so now what we can do is we

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.240
can take this and around all the areas that
we are going to paint we just mask this on

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.539
and then you will pull your plastic out so
you can cover your counter tops you can put

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:23.900
it around the base molding, cover up the floor.
Now once we do that what we want to do is

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.509
we want to take our paint and we actually
want to cut in an edge that is at least about

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.649
two and a half inches up the wall and then
once we do that that will allow us to take

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:45.200
our roller and as you can see our roller will
come down and before hitting down here on

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.819
the counter we can get about two inches from
the counter so the first thing we want to

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:54.460
do is we want to work in an area and we want
to do what we call cut in the edges so you

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.310
want to do the corners of the room with a
paint brush, you want to do around the edges

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.689
and if you are not doing the ceiling then
you want to do the edge around the ceiling

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.910
and then use a roller to get the main part
of the wall. If you happen to be like in this

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.470
case, like in the bathroom where you are painting
the ceiling the same color you don't have

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.660
to worry about that but you do have to use
the brush still to get the paint into the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.880
corners so I'm Tim Gipson and that's how to
paint a bathroom.
