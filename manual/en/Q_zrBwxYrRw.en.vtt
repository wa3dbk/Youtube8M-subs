GREG HAREM: Now to place our greenery, you
just want to take one of your tea leaves,

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.980
the longer ones, cut in about three to four
inches, all the way to the spine, but don't

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:24.050
cut the spine, and just tear the excess off.
Do that to both sides and cut about that much.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:35.260
And you just kinda insert it into your oasis.
Take a second one; you want to cut it a little

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:45.570
bit higher than the first. I said do the both
sides, making sure you don't cut the spine.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:58.230
Again, about that much. Insert at an angle.
Just give it a little flair. Next, take your

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:10.850
dark tea leaf, roll it up, like so, take your
stapler, go underneath between the two layers

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:22.009
and staple about three times. And then you
go on to the top, do the same thing. This

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:32.659
way, this will really secure it. Again, cutting
your excess off

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.460
and insert to one side. Now, you'll be doing
this with several different types of greens.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:47.020
It's the same thing I just showed you with
this. I always like using this. Just add a

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:58.079
little different color, kind of a little texture.
All about repetitive steps in these parts.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:07.499
'Cause you want to give your edge of your
container, like soften it a little bit. Again,

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:13.140
just to the side. So next, I'll be showing
you how to split the tea leaf to make kind

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.000
of more of a fanning look to it and add more
interest.
