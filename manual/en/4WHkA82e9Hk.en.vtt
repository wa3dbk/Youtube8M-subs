00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.840
Everyday, when Nyabel Wal thinks of preparing food for her family of five,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.219
she has only one option: to harvest the wild grass

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.940
that grows near her home, known locally as 'woor'.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.180
The plant grows virtually everywhere in South Sudan, and it is believed to be the only weed holding the

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.770
deteriorating lives of thousands of people

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:34.390
in Upper Nile State from starvation. Once Nyabel has collected enough wild grass,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.699
she prepares it for cooking. Nyabel's 12-year-old nephew

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.679
says he is tired eating the same thing all the time.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:01.049
Nyabel recently traveled for six days to look for food only to come back empty-handed.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.720
The nutritional status for children like Gonor Pal

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.290
has increased at an alarming rate in
South Sudan as the conflict there continues.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.630
In response, UNICEF has deployed a rapid
response team

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.550
in remote areas such as this one.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.120
These teams bring desperately needed services like health screening and treatment

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.880
as well as delivering life-saving
supplies such as ready to use therapeutic foods,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.900
micronutrient supplements and medicines.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.900
The situation is bad. It is a dire situation. We've talked to mothers.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.630
A lot of them are are skipping meals, cutting down on rations,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.260
eating wild foods, so access to food
is

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.459
the biggest problem. Access to health also contributes

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.780
to the nutrition situation, the sanitation situation. So it's

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.930
a broad spectrum of

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.910
access services that are
contributing to the nutrition situation in South Sudan..

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.220
When the UNICEF rapid response team visited the neighborhood,

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.290
it was confirmed that Nyabel's daughter
was suffering from severe acute malnutrition.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.690
The child was treated with therapeutic
food in an effort to bring her back to good health.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.660
The dream of a safe and peaceful South Sudan

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.720
is becoming a living nightmare for
children. As the tireless

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.950
efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance continue,

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.450
hundreds of thousands of children in South
Sudan's three most conflict-affected states

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.650
remain at imminent risk of death and disease.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.150
Much-needed support from the international community

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.730
is urgently needed and may spell the difference

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.520
between life and death for thousands of children

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.480
and their families hanging onto life in South Sudan.
