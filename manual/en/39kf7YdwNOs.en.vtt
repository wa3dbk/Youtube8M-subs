00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.869
So this example we will be looking at a Monod
Growth Kinetics and the problem statement

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:18.519
is; That if we wanted to produce a recombinant
protein in E. Coli once the cell density has

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:25.380
reached 400 million Cells/Liter. How long would we
have to wait for us to reach this cell density

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.380
if we started an initial inoculation density
of 10,000 cells/L, and a glucose concentration

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:44.410
of 100 g/L. And we know that for E. Coli growth
on glucose Umax is 1.3 inverse hours. Ks, the Ks constant

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:54.730
is 2.2E-5 g/L. The death constant is 0.02
inverse hours, and we are going to assume

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.840
that 1 cells is approximately 1 ng of cellular
mass.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.780
So the first thing that we are going

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:16.860
to do is write mole balances for the concentration
of cells and substrate. So for our cells

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.510
we are going to have a change on our concentration
of cells over time. So since we are in a batch

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:30.510
reactor it is going to be equal to the rate
of growth of our cells minus the rate of death

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:40.920
of our cells, and so for our substrate the change
in the concentration per time will be equal

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:50.280
to the negative rate of growth of our cells,
and so now second we are going to define our

00:01:50.290 --> 00:02:00.410
rate law expressions. For monod growth kinetics
the rate of growth is equal to mu max times

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:10.750
the concentration of substrate times the concentration
of cells over the constant ks plus the concentration

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:21.920
of our substrate. And the rate of death is
equal to the death constant times the concentration

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:32.500
of cells. So third we need to calculate the
concentrations of our cells initially and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.500
the desired concentration based off of the
mass we assumed per cell. So our initial cell

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:53.100
concentration in g/L is going to be the 10,000
cells/L that we started with times 1 ng per

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:05.520
cell, and to get it in to grams per liter we are going to
have that 1 gram is 10 to the 9th nanograms. So we

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:16.970
are going to have 10^-6 g/L of cells initially,
and then the final concentration of our desired

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:31.650
cells also in g/L will be the 400 million cells per liter
that we want to reach. Times the same 1 ng/cell,

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:45.569
and 1 gram per 10^9 ng. So we want to get
to a point of 0.4 g/L of cells. So now we

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:52.349
can plug in these mole balances for the cells
and substrates, and then the rate laws for

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.220
the growth and our death of our cells. As
well as the initial concentrations for our

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.220
cells and substrate, and then vary time to
try to figure out how long it would take us to get to this

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:12.230
0.4 g/L of cell. So here is the output from
plugging in all of those expressions into

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:20.349
polymath, and after varying the time. You
can see that the top line of Cc. The concentration

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:27.349
of our cells our final value is 0.40 and then
the time it took use to get there is the last

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:32.199
variable t, which is 8.28 hours.
