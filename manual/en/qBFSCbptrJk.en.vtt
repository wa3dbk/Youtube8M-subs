00:00:00.631 --> 00:00:03.156
On the ground
there was a footprint.

00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:06.569
A big footprint.

00:00:07.938 --> 00:00:11.567
So, I was hooked
from that moment on.

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:14.611
I started spending
all the time I could spare
searching for the beast.

00:00:14.678 --> 00:00:16.805
Then I spent time
I couldn't spare.

00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:20.011
That's how I lost my job
and my friends.

00:00:21.352 --> 00:00:22.614
It's so sad.

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:25.450
Well, I didn't tell it
so you could cry
in your sprouts,

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:27.717
or whatever that is, darling.

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:32.585
I'm telling it so that
your father won't make
the same mistake.

00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:36.662
I appreciate
what you're saying,
Dr. Wrightwood,

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:38.964
but there's a big difference
between your story and mine.

00:00:39.036 --> 00:00:41.004
Not as big as you think.

00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:42.197
Maybe even bigger.

00:00:42.273 --> 00:00:44.468
(GEORGE CLEARS THROAT)
No, no, no.
You're kidding yourself.

00:00:48.812 --> 00:00:52.248
I remember what you told me
when you came into my shop.

00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:56.218
Bigfoot can come live with us.
We'll accept
the responsibility.

00:00:56.954 --> 00:01:01.254
Can you imagine
what a Bigfoot would do
to your home?

00:01:02.826 --> 00:01:04.225
Yeah, well, I can.

00:01:04.828 --> 00:01:06.295
You're good people.

00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:09.358
I'm gonna say this once.

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:14.029
I'm gonna say it simple
and I hope to God
for your sakes you all listen.

00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:17.563
There are no
abominable snowmen.

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:19.666
There are no Sasquatches.

00:01:19.977 --> 00:01:21.774
There are no Bigfeet!

00:01:29.053 --> 00:01:30.953
Am I missing something?

00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:47.500
Oh, Lord! Lord God!

00:01:47.738 --> 00:01:50.400
Dr. Wrightwood,
say hello to Harry.

00:01:55.512 --> 00:01:56.774
Harry?

00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:07.589
(EXCLAIMS)

00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:15.960
Isn't he something?

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:20.969
Oh, yes, he's so smart, too.
I mean, George has taught him
how to sit.

00:02:21.205 --> 00:02:22.399
To sit?

00:02:33.217 --> 00:02:35.947
We haven't quite
perfected it yet.

00:02:37.287 --> 00:02:38.481
Hungry?

00:02:46.797 --> 00:02:48.697
He lives here with you?

00:02:48.932 --> 00:02:50.331
Temporarily.
