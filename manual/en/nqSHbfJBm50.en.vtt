00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.360
THE DAY'S TOP STORIES,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.000
A

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.370
WOMAN ACCUSED OF TERRORIZING TO

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.770
WOMEN DURING ROAD RAGE INCIDENT

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.400
APPEARED IN COURT.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.240
SHE SAT IN COURT FLASHING GRINS

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.590
AND ALL KINDS OF GESTURES.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.980
SHE CHASED

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.350
HIM OUT OF --

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.720
NUMBER

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.130
TWO WOMEN DOWN.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.730
ONE OF THE WOMEN INSIDE THAT

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.230
CAR, SHE WAS A PASSENGER.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.600
HELLO.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.860
WALK US THROUGH WHAT

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.630
HAPPENED.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.440
I SAW A LADY DRIVING CRAZY.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.170
SHE LOOKS CRAZY.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.740
I LAUGHED AT IT.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.210
AS SHE CONTINUED TO GET CLOSER

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.030
TO US SHE CUT US OFF.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.490
SHE SLAMMED ON HER BRAKES,

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.890
TAILGATED IS AGAIN BEEN CUT US

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.660
OFF A SECOND TIME.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.600
AFTER THAT WHEN SHE WAS IN THE

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.370
SLOW LANE, THAT IS WHEN I CHOSE

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.570
TO FLIPPER OFF -- FLIP

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.670
HER OFF.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.100
WE WILL GET TO THAT.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.510
HOW SCARED WERE YOU?

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.870
I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE, THIS

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.640
HAS TO BE FAKE.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.440
SHE HAS TO BE JOKING.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.580
SHE IS ANGRY.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.550
WE CAP'S DRIVING.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.890
AFTER I FLIPPED

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.090
HER OFF, SHE WAS

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.560
ANGRY.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.790
SHE TOLD ME TO ROLL DOWN MY

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.120
WINDOW.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.730
I TOLD HER NO.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.760
AS WE CONTINUE TO DRIVE WE

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.260
NOTICED SHE WAS CLOSE TO OUR

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.730
TAIL.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.300
AS SOON AS SHE GOT THE CHANCE

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.870
SHE CUT IN FRONT OF US.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.040
WE SAW THAT GO ON FOR A LITTLE

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.970
BIT.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.370
WE REALIZED THERE WAS AN ISSUE

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.710
WHEN IT CONTINUED.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.410
OBVIOUSLY IT ESCALATED TO THE

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.550
POINT WHERE IT IS BEYOND YOUR

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.190
TYPICAL ROAD RAGE.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.450
DO YOU REGRET HOW YOU HANDLE THE

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.390
SITUATION.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.790
YES.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.490
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT AGAIN.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.730
I REGRET IT.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.690
IT WAS NOT A GREAT IDEA.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.930
PEOPLE DO IT DAILY.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.130
I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS A BIG

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.930
DEAL.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.740
I THOUGHT SHE WAS DRIVING CRAZY.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.010
IT WASN'T AGGRESSIVE.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.210
IT WAS MORE PAY ATTENTION TO THE

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.880
ROAD.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.410
THEN I DID A WHOLE PAY ATTENTION

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.650
TO THE ROAD.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.530
THAT SET HER OFF.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.890
YOU FELT

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.290
RELIEF WHEN YOU

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.520
FOUND AN OFFICER.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.990
YES.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.630
THAT MUST'VE BEEN A RELIEF.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.800
IT TOOK US A WHILE TO

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.030
GET TO

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.930
THE CHP.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.130
WE ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.600
AREA.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.710
WE'RE PASSING THERE.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.510
I DIDN'T KNOW IF WE WERE PASSING

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.980
IT.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.620
DELANEY AND YOUR FRIEND, I'M

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.090
GLAD YOU ARE SAFE.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.620
A LESSON LEARNED ON HOW TO BE

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.030
CAREFUL OUT THERE.
