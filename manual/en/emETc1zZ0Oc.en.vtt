00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Is this recording...? Yes

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:05.037
OK... We've just arrived to the hotel.

00:00:05.037 --> 00:00:07.037
Hi, this is HarryAndBillyBrick Productions!

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:10.341
Moises (*one of our best fans) this is for you...

00:00:10.884 --> 00:00:11.701
Really?

00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:13.091
Nope.

00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:15.691
Well, tell us what is the plan.

00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.691
Now, I'm going to have a drink... See you later

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:22.969
While I wait him, I going to see what TV channels I can see.

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:30.662
I have the same at home...

00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:34.514
What...?

00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:44.055
Seriously, is this real?

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.379
It can be moved this door. Is a joke?

00:00:48.902 --> 00:00:51.902
Is there anything or anyone?

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:00.458
Nothing...

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:02.442
I don't know...

00:01:05.194 --> 00:01:07.194
Things of life, I think.

00:01:07.907 --> 00:01:09.907
Well, let's continue watching the TV...

00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:13.941
What th...?

00:01:16.948 --> 00:01:18.948
This is not funny...

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:32.466
Nothing

00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.028
There are only water...

00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:35.557
Have you brought me a bottle?

00:01:35.557 --> 00:01:37.557
Nope. If you want it, go you four it...

00:01:39.297 --> 00:01:41.300
OK, I'll go after this.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.195
Well... Did you see or feel something strange before?

00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:45.200
Nope

00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:49.980
I was here waiting for you when that door....

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:53.120
What...

00:01:54.488 --> 00:01:56.490
I think I saw this bottle shaking...

00:01:58.338 --> 00:01:58.725
What?

00:01:58.725 --> 00:01:59.782
That bottle!

00:01:59.782 --> 00:02:01.642
That's impossible!

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:05.640
OK, it doesn't mind... The point is that door 
 was closed quickly and there wasn't anyone 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.389
What t...

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.390
The bottle fell down! There isn't anyone! What th...

00:02:17.013 --> 00:02:19.010
I put it on the table!

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:23.540
I don't like this... Is this ajoke?

00:02:28.113 --> 00:02:32.110
It's dark now! Let's go to sleep!

00:02:38.313 --> 00:02:44.310
Hi! This background change... It is not Chroma or special 
 effects. We have just moved to another room.

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:48.440
This is... Look! Partner money! Just kidding!

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.520
This is not funny!

00:02:52.753 --> 00:02:57.750
We have come to another Hotel because last night was really scary. 

00:02:59.723 --> 00:03:04.720
We think it's a kind of spirit or dark spectre 
 that is trying to make pur lives miserables...

00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:09.500
There were real cases of this... It's true. It's real.

00:03:15.068 --> 00:03:19.070
Guys... It's half past two...

00:03:21.198 --> 00:03:23.200
And he is not on the bed...

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:27.590
Did you hear that?

00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:34.500
I think he's there...

00:03:36.214 --> 00:03:38.210
Are you OK?

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:41.820
Please, please...

00:03:42.703 --> 00:03:44.700
What...

00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:47.670
What is happening?

00:03:51.287 --> 00:03:54.902
Hi! What do you expect? Were you thinking that I'd 
 make a final scare or something like that?

00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:56.900
Maybe they didn't think that

00:03:58.141 --> 00:04:06.040
Well... Can we film again this shot? I like the lightning. It's 
 really intimate and deep... Better in black and white isn't it?

00:04:08.303 --> 00:04:09.069
Do you accept?

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.070
I accept!
