00:00:04.848 --> 00:00:06.055
What did he say?

00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:07.681
I was not able to give it back.

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:10.264
Why? Did he refuse?

00:00:10.306 --> 00:00:12.973
He’s out of town.

00:00:12.973 --> 00:00:16.056
To attend a funeral.

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:27.306
Ruby’s both grandmas are still alive, right?

00:00:27.306 --> 00:00:28.055
Yes.

00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:35.055
What do you think if I treat them 
with lunch?

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:39.055
I think we could get to know each other.

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:44.055
I’ll tell them. I think her grandma 
on mother’s side will be ok.

00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:45.055
What about the other 
on her father’s side?

00:00:45.055 --> 00:00:50.306
She’s kinda unique. 
Very principled and straightforward.

00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:05.139
Get in.

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:06.806
I’ll walk.

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:07.598
Why?

00:01:07.598 --> 00:01:09.055
I prefer walking.

00:01:09.055 --> 00:01:13.015
How about going to a comic book store?

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:13.556
A comic book store?

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:18.181
Oh!

00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:19.055
How are you?

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:20.055
Hi.

00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:21.055
Were you heading for here?

00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:23.055
Yes.

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:28.055
This is Kyle, living in my house.

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:30.055
How do you do?

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:31.222
Hi, how are you?

00:01:31.222 --> 00:01:33.055
She’s my ex-co-worker.

00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:35.055
Oh, hi.

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:37.055
Your face is really small!

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.015
Is that a compliment?

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:40.055
I envy you.

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:42.055
Yours is small too.

00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:47.055
I am Sunmi Myong.

00:01:47.055 --> 00:01:50.055
I am Kyle Huntington.

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:57.264
My sisters told me to be nice to you.

00:01:58.222 --> 00:02:00.431
I’m so touched and happy!

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.973
I think I married to the best in-law.

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:06.055
Do you mean it?

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:07.055
Sure.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.431
Let’s go see your parents tomorrow 
with this good news.

00:02:13.723 --> 00:02:14.806
Shall we?

00:02:14.806 --> 00:02:20.931
Yes. We can’t make them lonely 
on Christmas Eve.

00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:23.055
You’re right.

00:02:23.055 --> 00:02:27.055
Jade, we’re gonna be kicked out 
of the business.

00:02:27.055 --> 00:02:30.181
Oh no. Didn’t they want to see you 
to raise the rent?

00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:31.514
No.

00:02:32.055 --> 00:02:36.055
They know our business makes a good profit, so they want to take it over.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:36.973
Then what should we do?

00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:39.639
Find another place.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.514
It might not be easy to find one 
in a good location.

00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:45.306
That’s why we need to own a place.

00:02:45.306 --> 00:02:48.306
The same can happen when we make 
a good profit in another place.

00:02:48.347 --> 00:02:52.306
One beats the bush 
and another catches the birds.

00:02:52.347 --> 00:02:54.181
Right.

00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:57.264
We’d better hurry to find a new location.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.055
Gosh, what’s this smell?

00:03:04.055 --> 00:03:06.222
Hey, did you wash your feet?

00:03:06.222 --> 00:03:07.473
Huh?

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.264
They’re not dirty.

00:03:11.306 --> 00:03:14.055
Gosh, go wash the feet. Now!

00:03:14.055 --> 00:03:17.055
They didn’t sweat today.

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:20.015
Then how could they smell this bad?

00:03:20.015 --> 00:03:20.806
Get up!

00:03:20.806 --> 00:03:22.347
What’s the big deal?

00:03:23.181 --> 00:03:24.931
I smell nothing.

00:03:24.931 --> 00:03:26.556
Nothing? Just get up. Now!

00:03:27.055 --> 00:03:31.055
Your mysophobia gets worse 
with your age.

00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:33.181
Mysophobia?

00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:35.055
My goodness. You are foul-smelling!

00:03:35.055 --> 00:03:38.055
Mom, you like fast-fermented bean stew.

00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:40.765
And my feet smell is not as terrible as 
the smell of it.

00:03:40.765 --> 00:03:43.055
Gosh, it smells so bad. Gosh!

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:44.556
Go wash! Go!

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:49.431
Hey, don’t hit me!

00:03:49.431 --> 00:03:55.055
Gosh, he spoiled the clean comforter 
with bad stench all over.

00:03:55.055 --> 00:04:01.055
Can’t believe this. Can’t live like this.

00:04:01.055 --> 00:04:02.055
What should I do?

00:04:05.264 --> 00:04:07.056
Gosh!

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.055
Hey, were you in my room?

00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:14.055
&lt;Of course I was.&gt;

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:19.055
I can’t believe he’s my own son…boy…

00:04:28.848 --> 00:04:33.306
Mom, don’t wear a thick make up.

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:35.556
I don’t.

00:04:36.055 --> 00:04:42.473
You’re an old woman. Just wear lotions, not some shiny eye shadows.

00:04:43.765 --> 00:04:46.055
Buy me a lotion before you nag me.

00:04:46.055 --> 00:04:49.055
Your make-up looks so cheap.

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:51.055
To your eyes only.

00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:54.055
My mother-in-law looks decent 
without make-up.

00:04:54.055 --> 00:04:59.097
Oh, give me a break. Women need to take care of their looks as they age.

00:04:59.097 --> 00:05:02.097
That doesn’t mean 
you should wear whiteface.

00:05:02.097 --> 00:05:03.389
Shut up. Get out.

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.181
Mom, please listen to me.

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:09.264
I do what I like to do, 
and you do what you like to do.

00:05:09.264 --> 00:05:15.055
If you don’t like the way I do, then go back your home or to your mother-in-law’s.

00:05:19.055 --> 00:05:22.890
&lt;Should I get rid of all those cosmetics?&gt;
