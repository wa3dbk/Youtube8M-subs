00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:05.900
Hi I'm Dr. Adrienne Mulligan of Camp Verde
Veterinary Clinic in Arizona and I'm here

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:13.500
today to talk to you about broken toenails
on behalf of expertvillage.com. Dog will get

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.240
broken toenails for a variety of reasons.
But, the primary one is often going to be

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.650
when you yourself are trying to cut there
nails and you go to deep into the quick. It

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.369
is not necessarily a broken toenail but it
does create quiet a lot of bleeding and scares

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.480
most people. This is my assistant Amber and
this Bonkers and he's we are going to show

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.430
you a few little things about working with
toenails. You probably have to get your vet

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.840
to teach your how to trim toenails but, that
is a little more then our scoop today. But,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.859
lets say that I am trimming Bonkers toenails
and when I do lets say that I go to deep.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.589
Now I'm not going to because it really hurts
it wouldn't be nice but it starts to bleed.

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:58.199
If you put your first aid kit together as
we talked about then you should have some

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.110
styptic powder to stop the bleeding but, if
you have not got any thing special like styptic

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.320
powder the best thing to stop the bleeding
in this area is flour. The kind flour that

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.440
you would cook with. So go grab some flour
pack it on the nail and then you are going

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:23.600
to put some kind of a bandage on. Your bandage
should consist of a little bit of antibiotic

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.220
ointment that you could put on top of the
flour that is right if it is mix together

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:36.280
and then a telfa pad that you should keep
in your first aid kit. To cover the nail and

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.390
then you should have some vet wrap on hand
in your first aid kit and just do a little

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:52.870
bandage around that foot. Not real tight just
roll it around and then a good way to keep

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:02.380
it on is to put a sock over it. This is not
a sock but you could use a regular sock to

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.580
do something like that and you could use some
tape as well to just tape that not tightly

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.780
just loosely to the top of his to the top
of his bandage to his foot. Then you got a

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.510
protected toenail to take your dog to the
vet.
