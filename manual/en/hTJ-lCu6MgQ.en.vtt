00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.450
Hi everyone!  We're at Battery Park right now.  And behind me is the Statue of Liberty.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.520
I'm going to be a tourist today and explore the city of New York by visiting different places.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.030
But I wanted to share with you my outfit of the day.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.020
I took a little shower at the fountain.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.920
But to keep it casual and nice and breathable,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.510
I'm wearing just a cotton, yellow top.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.510
And I love yellow and purple, I think it's the perfect complimentary color.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.780
So to accent that purple, I have my bag with me.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.880
To keep the rest of our outfit neutral, I have my wet, very, very wet, grey jeans.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.810
And some brown sandals.  And we're ready to explore the city.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.340
We're here because you are... 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.470
gorgeous!

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.860
We are in Brooklyn and behind us is the Manhattan skyline.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.100
It is gorgeous and it's so beautiful.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.450
So breezy... so Titanic.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.060
But I wanted to share a styling tip with you.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.490
One of the things I love to do and you see me do this a lot on the blog

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.180
and the videos as well.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.650
I like pairing proportional volume.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.450
So whenever I wear a loose shirt like this, 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.540
I like pairing it with a very tighter, kind of slimmer bottom.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.600
So skinny jeans are perfect.  Tights are perfect too

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.620
if this was untucked, 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.190
But just loose and tight, it goes together very well proportionally.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.130
We're in Grand Central Station.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.300
And a lot of films and movies were filmed here.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.150
It is such an iconic place, it is absolutely gorgeous.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.780
I can spend hours here.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.620
The lighting, the colors, everything.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.680
I wanted to share a second styling tip with you.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.500
I picked up this vintage necklace from Sammy D. Davis

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.430
And I love going to vintage stores, selecting more older, unique neck pieces.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.730
But to have a more experimental look, I basically wrap the necklace outside of my collar.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.140
So it's more modern, more experimental.  

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.740
I think it's a nice, fun vibe.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.390
We are at Times Square, the heart of New York City.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.980
I love, love the buildings.  I love the lights,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.000
and I especially love the energy of this place.  I love New York.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.160
But thank you so much for being with me today!

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.890
I hope you enjoyed the styling tips.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.400
And being with me as we explored New York.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.120
But I will see you soon on Youtubeland.  Bye!
