00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.500
Add style and storage with this adjustable
shelf system called a Mandal headboard

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.640
and is great for the bedroom or any room where
you want to add a decorator touch. It s simple

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.640
to build and makes a great weekend project.
Let s get started. ll need eighteen, six-foot

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.990
long 1 by 2 inch hardwood boards. You ll also
need three more 1 by 2 s cut to 27 inches

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.449
long. Plus a drill, drill and driver bits
and wood screws. A complete list of plans,

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.569
including the tools and materials you ll need
can be found at Menards-dot-com. The shelves

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:41.159
are pre-finished Dakota shelf sections. The
number and position of the shelves you install

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:48.159
is up to you. The 27-inch long cross-pieces
are screwed into the edges of the six foot

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.459
long boards. Two of the cross-pieces are set
back three and one-eighth inches from the

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:59.579
ends and the third one is centered. This way,
the crosspieces will be properly spaced to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.470
attach to walls with studs spaced 16 inches
on center. There is also a three-eighths inch

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.530
space from the top of the cross piece to the
first six-foot board. This helps assure proper

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.530
spacing if you decide to build more than one
unit and stack one above the other. Assemble

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.030
the unit by pre-drilling and attaching with
number eight inch and half long screws. Check

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.110
to make sure the unit is square. Use a section
of scrap wood and a clamp to ensure the next

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.310
board is properly spaced. When all three cross
pieces are attached the unit is ready to mount

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.310
to the wall. Determine where the wall studs
are and using three-inch long construction

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.520
screws, attach the unit to the wall. t helps
to use a long drill bit to get beetween the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.640
boards. Attach one screw to the center cross
piece and check for level. Then attach to

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.640
the wall at each end. Now you can slide the
three-quarter inch shelves into the slots

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.950
between the boards. All that s left is to
fill the shelves with your favorite things

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.100
and enjoy! You can use aspen as we did, or
make it from oak, cherry, or even alternate

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.889
colors. You can also paint or stain the headboard
or leave it the natural color. To stay up-to-date
