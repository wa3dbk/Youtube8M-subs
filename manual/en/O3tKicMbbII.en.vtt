00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.920
Okay. Now do you have all of that down? How
to build your capsule wardrobe with your clothing,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.570
your accessories, with your scarves, your
jewelery, your shoes, your handbags. Now you're

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.570
probably getting really excited, want to run
into the closet and start doing this. But

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.119
I promised you, I'm going to show you how
to build on the first capsule. I'm going to

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.810
take you through the steps to build a second
capsule, so you're not so bored. When you've

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.190
finished wearing this, you want to start with
something new and fresh. And this whole concept

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.720
you can do with your entire closet. Again,
you can do it with your casual wardrobe, you

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.030
can do it with your business wardrobe, and
you can do it with evening wardrobe. So I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.290
decided in my first capsule that it was built
out of the black, red and ivory, I'm going

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.810
to take the red out. I'm going to build my
new capsule with red. So how you do this,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.160
is you take one of the colors out of the original
capsule. That is what we're going to start

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.189
as the basis for our second capsule. So I'm
going to use red. So I'm going to add red

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:18.219
to a few more red pieces, and then I'm going
to add in pure white and gray. So that's how

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:24.430
capsules link together. You pull one color
from your original capsule, and you translate

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.600
it and put it into your second capsule. And
you start building from there. And that's

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.609
how you just keep moving along. For instance,
after I got tired of my gray, white and red

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:41.890
capsule, I might want to pull my gray out
and then start building yet an additional

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.189
capsule. I hope you all got that. It's a great
way to really start building a workable wardrobe

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:55.460
because then everything eventually will start
working together a whole lot better and you

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.709
will have things that will go together and
complete outfits.
