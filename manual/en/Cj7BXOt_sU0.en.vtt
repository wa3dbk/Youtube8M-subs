00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What I like the most about being a Navy Diver is just the freedom. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Just being able to float and move around in the water so easily and just 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
being able to see everything there is to see. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm Chief Petty Officer Rebecca Jones and I'm a Navy Diver.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We have the capabilities of doing a wide array of different jobs. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
From working underwater on a ship or doing salvage work recovering any 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
asset that has been lost in the water. Or recovering after a storm or 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
doing humanitarian aide. At a moments notice we can be ready to deploy 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and do whatever recovery or whatever job that we're told to do.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
To work on the recovery for hurricane Katrina was quite an experience. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We drove through there and from the coast to a mile inland it was gone. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Complete destruction, I've never seen anything like that, and just to be 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
able to be down there and help with the recovery was a great feeling. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Some of the cool equipment that I get to use as a Navy Diver range from scuba, 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
we also use surface supply diving apparatus. That's the big yellow helmet 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
with the umbilical that goes to the surface that provides air um 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
communication so we can talk back and forth and if we were diving in 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
cold water it even provides hot water to the diver. Other apparatus that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
we use are specifically for SEALs, which is the Mark 25, which is a re-breather, 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
so there's no bubbles, so its super stealthy.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If you wanted to become a Navy Diver you would go visit your Navy Recruiter 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
let them know, "I want to be a Navy Diver," and they would let you know that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
you need to pass the physical screening test, the PST.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
How you can prepare if you want to become a Navy Diver is to start working out. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Run, swim, do push-ups, do sit-ups, do pull-ups. Get physically ready because 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that's one of the most demanding parts of dive school, is the physical part of it. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Women do exactly the same thing that the men do. Were- there's no special standard 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
for a woman.  

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So after you pass the PST test you will go to Great Lakes and go to boot camp. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
After boot camp you'll go to a Navy Diver prep course for 32 days, 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and once you graduate that prep course you'll then go to Panama City, Florida

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and go through Second Class Dive School.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
After you graduate second class dive school you can go to a command where 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
you do ships husbandry, which is working on ships in the water and ship repair.  

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You can go to a salvage command, you can go to an E.O.D. command, which is 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Explosive Ordnance Disposal Command and support E.O.D. You can go to a 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Naval Special Warfare command where you'll support the SEALs.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Some of the other training you can receive as a Navy Diver ranges from being 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
able to jump out of an airplane and do parachuting. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Being able to work with explosives in the water and out of the water. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Being able to handle a weapon.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
As a Navy Diver you-there's so many different commands that you can go to 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000
all over the world. You go from Guam, to Hawaii, Japan, Florida, Virginia, 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
California, Washington. There's just so many places and so many choices as a Navy Diver.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
What makes a good Navy Diver? Someone who is loyal, someone who's committed, 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
someone who is part of the team and wants to be a team player. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Diving is a very dangerous job. You have to be able to understand physics, 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and diving medicine and how the ocean and pressure affects a human body. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The job is very demanding, whether you are moving a giant patch to a ship that 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
weighs hundreds of pounds in the water or if you're swimming the entire length 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
of an aircraft carrier. 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
While you're Active Duty the Navy will provide tuition assistance so that you 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
can take college courses. Also the travel. I personally have traveled all over 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000
the world several times and seen so many countries I couldn't even list them all.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
How have I changed as a person since I became a Navy Diver? I'm stronger, 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I'm more confident and I know there's nothing that I can't do. 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
If you wanted to become a Navy Diver, go for it. It's the best job in the world.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
