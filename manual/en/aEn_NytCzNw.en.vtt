First thing I want to say is:

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.460
I've joined the campaign!

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.650
I had a friend, 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.980
Ayrton Senna

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.440
He must be dying of laughter

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.140
Because you know, the narrator speaks very much

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.790
besides being narrator I also speak a lot,

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.030
I speak a lot by nature.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.340
He got me the nickname "Parrot"

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.470
and this is a campaign

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.630
to save the parrot.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.710
and the parrot is the Galvao Parrot...

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.850
I'm with the Galvão Parrot and not open.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.810
I'm supporting the campaign, go ahead.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.210
Save the Galvão Parrot this very rare bird.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.940
He is with the campaign and does not open

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.650
Everyone now Shut up, Galvão!

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.640
Let's save him.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.880
Cannot be afraid, speak: 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.980
SHUT UP, GALVÃO!
