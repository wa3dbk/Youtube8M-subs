Hi! I’m David Kaynor for expervillage.com
and I’m going to give a brief overall introduction

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:14.389
to the parts of the violin. Here we have a
violin that I play a lot, and it’s really

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:29.669
totally together; but here I have a violin
which comes apart, and I thought I’d just

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.930
give a quick overview of the parts. Here in
my hands is the violin’s top, which is sometimes

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.150
referred to as the sound board, and this is
a piece, this is actually two joined pieces

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.190
of carved spruce. Now on the inside we can
see now—we can’t really see that it’s

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.610
two pieces, but there’s a seam right down
the center here where the two pieces are joined

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:05.960
together. And this side, this is the base
bar which is, I’m not able to give a scientific

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.240
description of the base bar’s function,
but I can say that it adds structural strength

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:22.830
and effects the characteristics of the vibration
of the top; and the base bar is made of spruce.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:32.310
You can see a penciled name here which may
be the name of either the maker of the violin

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.850
or a person that did some repairs on it, this
violin has had a hard life; it’s had many

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.500
repairs, we have patches of spruce, another
wood which are attempts to stabilize some

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:52.670
cracks which developed. And we have copious
quantities of glue which are probably the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.590
result of several different attempts to repair
it. That’s the top.
