00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.610
So I wrote a book called Three Cups of Tea.
Has anybody heard of Three Cups of Tea? [Applause]

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.850
And the title is in honor of a village chief
in Pakistan who said if you want to business

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.730
here, you need three cups of tea. Now, my
daughter Mira’s fourteen, she sometimes

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.180
joins me, and she can rap what three cups
of tea means, or slam or rap it, but I’m

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.970
not going to embarrass myself. So three cups
of tea means the first cup you’re a stranger,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.870
second cup a friend, and the third cup you
become family. For family, you’re prepared

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.140
to do anything, even die. But some of you
might not know about is the subtitle. And

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.079
the publisher originally picked the subtitle
“One man’s mission to fight terrorism,

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.699
one school at a time.” Now, I’m a military
veteran, but I was opposed to that because

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.170
I said the reason I do this is to promote
peace. Well the publisher, Viking Penguin,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.210
disagreed with me. So I went to New York and
assembled a jurga. A jurga is like a tribal

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.240
conference. And these were the leaders of
the whole Penguin Putnam publishing empire.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.229
The CEO, head of marketing, and head of publicity.
And I told them please change the subtitle

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.720
to “one man’s mission to promote peace
one school at a time.” They said Greg, this

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.209
is your first book, and you need to learn
a couple things about the publishing industry.

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:31.320
Only one out of eight books makes a profit,
and two-thirds of all bestsellers are pre-chosen

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.260
by the publisher. So we’d like to promote
this book, but you need to be fighting terrorism,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.819
so we can pitch the media and your book will
do well. Well finally I conceded, but if you

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.860
work in Pakistan or Afghanistan or Africa,
probably here in Springfield too, you never

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.080
settle a deal without driving a hard bargain
on the side. So I said if the subtitle doesn’t

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.470
do well, change it after a year to “one
man’s mission to promote peace.” So in

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.641
2006 the subtitle of the book came out, subtitle
“one man’s mission to fight terrorism

00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:08.470
one school at a time,” but it didn’t do
very well. So a year later, March, sorry,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.060
January 2007, they changed the subtitle to
“one man’s mission to promote peace one

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.100
school at a time,” and now for 190 weeks
in a row it’s been a New York Times bestseller,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:33.010
currently number two. [Applause] Three Cups
of Tea is also, the military is very interested

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.840
in Three Cups of Tea. I never planned it that
way. Many senior military commanders read

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.810
the book. Now, I only found out recently it’s
actually their wives read the book first,

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.880
and said honey you got to check this out.
Probably in Springfield, kind of the same

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.780
thing going on here right? All the women’s
groups, book clubs, and churches and everything

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.120
else. Well let’s give all the women and
book clubs a big round, thank you. [Applause]
