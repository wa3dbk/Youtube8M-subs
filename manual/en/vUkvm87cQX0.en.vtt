KISUM’s makeup that I’m going to show you today is not stronger than other rappers in Unpretty Rapstar, so this could be good for daily makeup, too.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.633
First, Kisum has very clear skin with circular face shape.

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:53.645
So first, match the tone by applying concealer around the eyes, tip of the nose and around lip which has different tone

00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:57.500
And cover the flaws.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.280
When I saw the show, her makeup wasn’t soft and moistureless

00:02:02.283 --> 00:02:06.474
But because she has very white and clear skin, it was like a glutinous rice cake.

00:02:06.474 --> 00:02:12.629
So, I’m going to cover the whole face with bright semi-matt type foundation

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.549
And put powder on brush to lightly brush around oily parts.

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:22.480
And Kisum’s cheeks were flushed and tip of the chin was little bit red.

00:02:22.483 --> 00:02:29.019
So, I have applied bright pink color blusher on both cheeks and tip of the chin to infuse life into face.

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:36.879
On this part, it is just to make Kisum’s babish look, so don’t apply it strongly then you will look as if you were bumped lol

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.412
I will only apply highlighter on nose.

00:02:39.412 --> 00:02:46.000
I wanted to skip shading to make Kisum’s cute impression, but I wasn’t able to give it up.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.484
But I didn’t make it to egg-shaped face

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:52.504
But I just reduced the size of both sides to cover the wide face.

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:54.140
Now, it’s finally for eye makeup!

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.600
First, I’m going to draw thick line on the inner and outer part with black gel eyeliner.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.720
Especially for outer part, I’m going to make it thick which is drooping shape.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.140
For under, I’m going to fill the waterline thin.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.560
Just like the upper line, I’m going to draw thick line only on the outer part.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.180
And with brush, smudge the line to make it clean.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.720
When I saw the video, it seems that she used shading shadow

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.740
I have lobster-eyed but I don’t really have fat on eyes.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.420
But Kisum has fat on eyes which makes her look cute

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.520
So I didn’t use shading shadow but I used pearl shadow with shading color on the whole eyes.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.160
And I also applied beige pearl shadow on the double eyelid line

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.080
And applied dark color pearl shadow which is twice thicker than eyeline to make my eyes look deep.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.180
Lastly, I’m going to apply pearl shadow on the underline and inner part of the eyes.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.660
And curl the lashes with eyelashes curler and apply mascara finely.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.020
Kisum draws her eyebrow in triangle shape with pointed shape

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.940
But she didn’t make it long and for the edge part, it was circular shape.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.880
So, I made it little bit thicker with brow pencil that matches with my hair color.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.900
For lip, she used natural colors that makes glow

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.640
Such as tone-downed rose pink color or natural pink colors.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.260
But because I have many fluorescent colors, I didn’t apply foundation on lip

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.960
And applied tint once to make it natural.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.060
Like this, I’m done with Unpretty Rapstar Kisum’s makeup!
