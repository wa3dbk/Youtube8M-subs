Hello and welcome to Todd's kitchen. This is just an informative video on how to look after

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.749
your chopping boards. Now i use many
different types of chopping boards

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:13.539
in my day to day uses. I have two wooden ones here as you can see but i also use plastic ones

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:14.429
as well

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.730
but personally when it comes to chopping
boards you just go wrong with the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.029
wooden ones. But you do have to look after them to. So as my first time for cleaning

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.910
chopping boards. Now if your like me you chop up allot of garlic, you chop up allot of onions

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.489
and what that does is leave then smell on the chopping board so they end up smelling like

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.780
garlic or onions. So the best way to remove the smell from chopping boards is

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.000
with some table salt

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.050
just make a little pile there

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.410
and we are going to use half a lemon

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.940
so it's gonna

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.510
drip some of the lemon on

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.190
the salt. Now we are using the salt as an abrasive so put the lemon on

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.370
and just rub that all around

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.660
the chopping board in a circulation motion

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.960
just like so

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.790
and what this will do is

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.990
the salt is going to help push the lemon into the chopping board

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.820
which will remove

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.170
the smell of what ever you have been using, being garlic or onions or fish

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.920
so rub that all in

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.370
then with some paper towel

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.450
just rub it down

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.970
and just dry it

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.040
like so with the paper towel

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.760
and its that simple

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.080
thats a lovely smelling

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.509
chopping board once again

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.180
Now cleaning them with the lemon and the salt

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.630
will also removal allot bacterial but you know what there is an even better way to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.220
remove the bacteria and for that we will use an
everyday household item

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.450
and thats white vinegar. So simply pour some of the vinegar

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.650
onto the board

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.750
just like so

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.759
i have seen on the internet people recommending you use watered down bleach

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.140
to sanitise the board

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.650
Now look at it this way, do you really want to use a harsh chemical

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.750
on something your food is going to be touching

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.570
Bleach is an incredibly harsh chemical so i don't care how much you dilute

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.740
it down, there is no point using it

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.539
when you can use something line vinegar that you can out on food anyway

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.400
and does exactly the same job

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.750
so please stay away from the bleach and use the stuff that does exactly she same job

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.790
but doesn't have all the harsh chemicals inside of it

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.659
So once done we will let that air dry and what that will do is

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.099
its going to prevent

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.159
any build up a bacterial forming on your chopping board. So you can be rest assured theres not going to be any

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.859
left over E. coli

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.749
staphylococcus or any nasty germs left on the board that may have been transferred there

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:37.849
when you were chopping up some say red meat. You will be wondering how often you should do this

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.309
They say once a month but me personally because i use them allot

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:45.559
i like to do them once a week just to be on the safe side but keep in mind you also want to wash

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:47.649
them daily after each use

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:51.419
