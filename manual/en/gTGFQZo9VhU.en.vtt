This is Chris Thomas from Superior Beds here.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.280
I thought I would write travel blog as well,
brought to you from the Costa Del Sol, in

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.280
a five star Hotel.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.910
I shall give you some updates as to my opinions
as to this bed that I have been sleeping in

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.570
over the last few nights.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.400
As you can see it is a very wide bed, it’s
two queen-size joined together, so it’s

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.189
210 cm in total, 105 and 105.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.800
It’s very nice to have a very wide bed.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.649
You don’t feel your partner moving and turning
through the night which is a very big advantage

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.979
and enables you to get a good night’s sleep.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:45.199
It’s very firm as you can see, um, possibly
too firm for long-term use for someone of

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.079
my size and weight, but certainly for the
last few nights it’s been really, really

00:00:51.079 --> 00:01:03.269
good, so if we take a closer look at it we
can see the base is just a very basic metal

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:13.770
structure, very firm, and the mattress is
probably 25-26 cm in depth, that’s very

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.030
strong, and as I said it’s very firm.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:28.329
This is probably a contract-made bed specifically
for a good quality details, and it’s pocket

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.579
springs.

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.760
The bed is actually a zip and link bed.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.899
You can see that they join here, but there
is the zip and there is covering material

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.820
over the zip, and there is a topper on top
of that.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.710
Now, in terms of the zip and link, you don’t
really feel the zip and link.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.670
The zip section, you are definitely aware
that it’s there if you want to be aware

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.639
of it, but it doesn't adversely affect your
sleep or your movement on the bed.

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:09.050
That’s it for me.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.020
Thank you very much!
