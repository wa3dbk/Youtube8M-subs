00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.240
If you cover up the answers on these, see
how you do.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.730
If you are only getting about 60% right or
something like that, you know you got some

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.340
work to do with the medical terminology.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.370
Even though there is only 9 questions on Medical
Terminology, me, if I was to write the exam,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.839
I would leave out Medical Terminology and
Anatomy questions because I feel they are

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.870
built into having to code and come up with
the right answer.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.230
If you know your Medical Terminology and Anatomy,
you are going to be faster, more efficient,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.230
and more accurate.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.589
But, it is what it is; you do have straight
up Medical Terminology and Anatomy questions.

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.519
For Anatomy, remember, you got figures in
the front of CPT and all throughout the CPT

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:01.519
book.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.940
They actually used to all being in the front,
and now they moved them.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.430
For example, the Integumentary, they have
a picture of a skin that is used to be in

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.430
the front of the manual.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.460
Now, it is at the front of the Integumentary
Surgery section.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.430
You have to be a little bit more aware of
where these images are, and we are going to

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.790
review them briefly as I go into each CPT
section.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.560
Don't forget, you got illustrations probably
in your ICD manual.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.330
CPT is pretty standard, even the standard
version of the professional.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.780
I highly recommend you have the professional
version of CPT.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.500
If you don't, you are missing a lot bells
and whistles that could help you tremendously

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.440
on the exam.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.210
For ICD-9, the publisher, it doesn't really
matter too much.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.800
There are some particular versions that are
not allowed on AAPC exams so make sure you

00:01:50.800 --> 00:02:52.530
go to their website.
