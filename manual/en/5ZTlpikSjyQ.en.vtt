00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.720
When Brian and Audrey Skaggs got married,
they bought an old fixer-upper out in the country.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.020
Audrey taught preschool and
Brian dedicated his life to being a cattle rancher.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.920
This is my ranch manager, Jet Skaggs.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.840
Life was going well.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.640
Then Jet got sick.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.040
He had problems breathing, cried constantly, and couldn't gain weight.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.700
Brian and Audrey took him to several doctors
but no one knew exactly what was wrong.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.520
Doctors gave the Skaggs a devastating diagnosis:
Jet had a heart defect

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.780
and the only thing that would save him was a risky heart transplant.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.160
With time running out a donor heart miraculously became available,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.020
and 11 month old Jet received a heart transplant.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.360
He's much more susceptible to infections.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.100
The household that he lives in needs to be
as clean an environment as possible.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.280
Mold, mildew and fungus are things that we would worry about.
Even the common cold can be a threat to Jet.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.500
So what do we say, can we do this?

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.100
Let me hear you people!  Are you with me?
Then let's do it!

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.720
So, do you think we should move this bus
and see what's behind it?

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.280
Let's do it!

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.120
(Crowd chanting "move the bus")

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.020
You guys know what to say, so say it with me!
Here we go--bus driver!  Move the bus!

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.400
With the old house we were getting to a
breaking point

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.660
where we were, you know, in a desperate situation.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.780
The siding was rotted, the roof was beginning to cave in.
It sat on basically just the dirt.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.720
Oh my gosh!

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.720
Oh wow!

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.720
Wow!
This is gorgeous!

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.840
[We donated our faux wooden beams for this renovation.]

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.240
We had a major mold problem,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.260
and after Jet's heart transplant
we were gonna have to do somethin' drastic.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.340
Now, I don't have to worry about the home.
I can focus more on care for Jet.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.820
It's a real big sigh of relief, knowin' that the house ain't gonna make him sick.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.860
So Jet, what do you think of your new house?
Thumbs up?  Yeah!

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.380
Well, I guess there's just one thing left to say:

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.380
Welcome home Skaggs family!  Welcome home!

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.800

of our donated wooden beams during the renovation.]
