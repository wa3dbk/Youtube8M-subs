00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:05.690
 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.280
On February 20th 2013 many people's

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.140
lives were affected by this landslide. 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.600
ADOT set out on a three-pronged approach to restore traffic in the area.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.960
step 1: was to restore

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.319
emergency access and begin initial
geotechnical work

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:27.369
the second part was to pave the and 20
detour

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.560
Mike and now we've begun

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.560
the final repair on the US 89 im

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.460
in order to realign the roadway
sixty-foot to the east we need to

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.199
excavate the existing slope

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.839
the most important part is get it
fraction into a size where we can get a

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.359
lock together in the bikers

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.039
will take the excavation from hillside

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.100
transported down in off-road rock trucks

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.179
and place it in the buttress consisting
mainly of the rock material from your

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:00.679
expert.

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.010
the amount of material that needs to be
moved on this project

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.450
is enormous we have approximately a
million cubic yards

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.800
rock excavated from the mountains
that'll be

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.790
drills working on top excavator loading
trucks trucks going up and down the hill

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.470
placement but you're saying

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.690
basically the goes gonna go down in the
but rich is gonna come up

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.120
until that point we could have more
moment and with all the activity that's

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.050
going on there

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.790
it triggered some movement on the slide
it's that same mass that just decided to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.640
move just a little bit further down the
hill

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.680
it's nothing that we can't control by
getting that buttress

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.970
put in place that's when we think the
slide will lock itself into that

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.630
buttress

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.900
and then we can schiff the road over and
build it on its new alignment this

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.230
project is very important to all those
communities

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.200
that were able to benefit from the and
20 beat war

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.230
and we need to restore mobility to this

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.510
area in US 89 is a critical link

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.780
to that mobility
