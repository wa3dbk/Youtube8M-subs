Mr. Potato Head Batman is looking for a fully
nutritional balanced breakfast that 
will give me the energy i need to fight crime

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.910
at night, and I heard that you can give that
to me. Hey there Batman there is nothing more

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.220
nutritional then Play-doe I can make you this
breakfast. But you are going to have to wait

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.230
it is going to take a little time. so come
back in about five minutes. Wait five minutes,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.200
alright but it better be good other wise i
am going to sen Robin in here. Wait a minute

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.200
he is not scary at all. Um I am going to send
in myself. Batman out. Batman doesn't scare

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.370
me no matter, I am going to make him a breakfast
that every super hero can use. Its the one

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.290
handed Taco waffle from Taco Bell. What super
hero doesn't need an extra hand while eating

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.130
breakfast? You do Batman. You do. To make
this delicious meal we are going to need five

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.630
cans of Play-Doe. Orange Play-Doe, brown Play-Doe,
yellow Play-Doe, white Play-Doe and light

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.520
brown Play-Doe. We will also need Play-Doe
accessories. Like our safe plastic pink Play-Doe

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.209
knife and Play-Doe roller. And the most important
thing is the waffle iron. which can be used

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:37.250
from this Breakfast Time Play-Doe Set. To
make the waffle we will need four different

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.250
foods. The waffle the sausage the eggs and
of course who can forget the cheese. Preferably

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.610
grated. Now this first part is tricky if you
use the full waffle iron you get two thick

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.520
waffles. We will only make waffles for one
sight. so Take the Play-Doe and mash it only

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.520
on this side. now roll the Play-Doe evenly
until it fully spread. across the entire waffle

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.720
site. once the rolling is done carefully lift
the waffle from the waffle iron and fold it

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.310
into half. and you will notice not the waffle
looks like a taco shell. the sausage is much

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.360
easier. Just roll out some dark brown Play-Doe.
now to make it a perfectly circular piece

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.060
of sausage lay down a play doe cap then using
your safe plastic Play-Doe knife trace out

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.060
the cap. Mark the know perfectly circular
sausage with small and tiny crooks making

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.820
it to be a perfectly authentic piece of sausage.
and fold this piece of sausage into the waffle

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.820
taco shell. This now creates a perfect plat
form to hold such things as eggs and cheese.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.360
We want our eggs to be as authentic as possible.
So we mix some white for the egg whites and

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.360
yell for the egg yokes. make sure to carefully
mix and match the two colors so they look

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.720
like perfect set of egg yokes and egg whites.
Now gently place the eggs into the waffle

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.870
taco between the Waffle and the sausage an
alternative way for making the eggs is to

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.680
cut them into smaller pieces. this will make
it easier to fit the eggs into the waffle

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.680
taco. And now you can insert each smaller
piece into the taco with much ease. oops that

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.380
piece was supposed to stay in there. This
is a delicious looking waffle taco. We have

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.880
not complete three of the four steps the last
step being the most important. The cheese.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.520
each piece of cheese can simply be rolled
out. Now sprinkle the cheese on top of the

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.440
waffle taco. And wal la you have your self
a delicious breakfast specimen. Batman can

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.440
not be displeased with this great work of
art. Mr. Potato head, what in Gotham City

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:39.090
is that? It looks like a taco but with a waffle
and eggs and sausage what is this? This here

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.800
is the waffle taco. The most interesting but
delectably wonderful breakfast that your taste

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.800
buds will ever savor. Well if you say so Batman,
will take a bite. Well that is terrific. Batman

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.310
actually feels stronger. Thank you Potato
