A lot of students feel that their learning in school is...

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:08.536
kind of useless, because they put all this effort and time into coming up with

00:00:08.536 --> 00:00:12.666
a great research paper, and they turn it in, and it just ends up in somebody's drawer.

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:16.461
But with a Wikipedia assignment, they put it onto an article,

00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:20.358
on Wikipedia and thousands if not tens of thousands of people end up seeing their work

00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:22.924
Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that anyone can edit.

00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:25.318
On Wikipedia everything is published live,

00:00:26.472 --> 00:00:28.429
so as students are working to develop their articles,

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.813
They are getting constant feedback sometimes from the Wikipedia editing community.

00:00:32.813 --> 00:00:36.813
Our students are learning how to edit Wikipedia as part of their coursework

00:00:36.813 --> 00:00:40.734
and they are assisted by Wikipedia ambassadors who are trained by our program.

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:46.573
More than 500 classes have participated world-wide so far,

00:00:46.573 --> 00:00:49.619
We are constantly adding new classes.

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:54.124
Back in fall 2010, we had a student who was participating in a course at Georgetown University

00:00:54.124 --> 00:00:58.563
where he re-wrote the article on the National Democratic Party of Egypt

00:00:58.563 --> 00:01:01.922
This was before the revolution in Egypt

00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:02.812
about two months before it.

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:08.053
When the revolution started happening, as the protestors were taking to the streets in Cairo

00:01:08.053 --> 00:01:12.145
People all around the world turned to Wikipedia to learn about the political party

00:01:12.145 --> 00:01:14.936
that president Mubarak was affiliated with.

00:01:14.936 --> 00:01:18.857
And what they found there was the article that this student had written.

00:01:18.857 --> 00:01:21.107
I did, I wrote the article - the whole thing

00:01:22.107 --> 00:01:25.822
and it's something that isn't in a stasis.

00:01:25.822 --> 00:01:27.405
I mean it's information that's changing.

00:01:27.405 --> 00:01:33.536
I quoted news articles which again are very temporal and related to now

00:01:33.536 --> 00:01:37.583
and yeah I will go back in a few months to make sure that

00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:43.922
when the next president is elected, if it's not what I say in the article

00:01:43.922 --> 00:01:46.479
that I change it to make sure! (laughs)
