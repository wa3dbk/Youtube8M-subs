00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.200
[Narrator]:  Hurricane Katrina.  

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.230
One of the most devastating natural disasters in US history.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.340
More than 1800 people lost their lives

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.390
while countless others lost homes and livelihoods.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.460
Five years later, the waters have receded but

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.530
Katrina's legacy remains.  Why

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.640
did Katrina become a category 5 storm in the Gulf of Mexico?

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.750
And what made it weaken before landfall?  It's 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.780
questions like this that NASA researchers hope to answer this hurricane season. 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.840
The Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.020
mission, or GRIP, is a field experiment that looks at 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.060
how tropical storms form and develop into major hurricanes.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.090
[Kakar]:  This experiment is designed not only 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.100
to help the experts better understand which of the tropical disturbances

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.130
will develop into tropical storms or hurricanes, but also help them 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.190
predict which ones will intesify to monsters and 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.210
which ones will fizzle out rapidly.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.260
[Narrator]:  During the 2010 hurricane season, NASA deplyed its piloted

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.300
DC-8 and WB-57 and unmanned 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.320
Global Hawk aircraft in a massive effort to collect as much 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.520
data as possible, arming hurricane researchers with the 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.560
information needed to predict the growth and intensification of 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.610
hurricanes.  [Braun]:  With the DC-8 and in particular the wind LIDAR

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.640
we're going to get continuous wind measurements in the environment of the storm, something that we've never

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.690
been able to get before.  With the Global Hawk, the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.740
expectation is that because of its 30 hour duration, flight duration, 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.880
we're going to be able to be out over storms for up to 20 hours or so, which is

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.590
about 2-4 times longer than what we'd be able to do with conventional aircraft.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.620
When you're out there only getting very brief looks for short periods of time

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.630
it's very easy to miss those critical events.  And so, with GRIP

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.650
we think we have a very good chance of being able to see those processes

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.680
much more easily than we've been able to do in the past.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.700
[Narrator]:  Each aircraft brings its own set of expertise.  The DC-8,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.740
stationed in Ft. Lauderdale, carries NASA researchers into 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.820
hurricanes, allowing them to study the storm from the inside out.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.850
It is capable of reaching altitudes of 42,000

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.870
feet and is helping scientists with sensor development and verification

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.900
and studies of the planet's surface and atmosphere.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.930
The Global Hawk-  This remotely piloted

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.770
aircraft, stationed out of California, is capable of flying at

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.810
60,000 feet and is providing information on lightning, wind speed and other 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.880
environmental factors in a tropical cyclone.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.920
The WB-57, stationed in Houston, Texas, 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.970
is a high altitude, piloted airplane capable of 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.990
reaching the dizzying height of 65,000 feet.  It's 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.200
instruments retrieve data on the upper atmosphere.  

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.230
This fleet of specially outfitted aircraft will give researchers an 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.240
unprecedented look inside the mechanics of storms.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.270
[Braun]:  The benefit of studying hurricanes with so many instruments at once is that it 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.300
gives us a more complete description of the atmosphere, both within the storm

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.340
and in the environment.  Within the storm, we want information 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.390
not only on the winds within the storm, but also the temperature, humidity, 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.440
and precipitation in the eye, the eye wall, and the rain bands.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.450
All that information is critical to understanding how the storms 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.520
evolve.  [Narrator]:  GRIP will also gather data from a much 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.540
higher vantage point, outer space.  The TRMM, Aqua, 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.560
Terra, and Cloudsat satellites provide data to scientists

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.580
on Earth, giving them a comprehensive look at storms

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.610
from different perspectives.  [Halverson]:  GRIP is designed 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.700
to take the latest technologies that NASA can bring to bare. 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.740
Satellites, aircraft that fly in the storm, aircraft that fly over the storm, 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.850
systems on the ground, let's put it all out there for 6 weeks and 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.910
see what we can learn about the physics of these storms.  [Narrator]:  The flights

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.960
conducted through GRIP this hurricane season will undoubtedly provide 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.000
vital information on the lifecycle of hurricanes. 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.030
This information will help scientists predict the birth of potential hurricanes

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.060
and understand why some tropical cyclones can go from a

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.090
category 2 to a category 5 hurricane in a 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.650
matter of hours.
