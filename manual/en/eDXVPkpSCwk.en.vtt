Whats up guys this is Diybykev

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.880
and today I'm gonna show how to repair
not charging

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.890
lets get started so as you can see my

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.960
adapter is working it has plugged in

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.900
in my computer but when I turn it on it
kind of shut down

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.909
that's because the adaptor isn't working
properly

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.529
and today I'm going to show you how to repair it

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.840
so let's get started so flip over
your computer so can you can see the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.460
back said

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.620
and then just the removal every single
screw

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.800
in it  then just pry open the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.960
this kind of door and then take out your hard
drive

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.250
your RAM

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.580
and the battery and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.220
below the battery you can see than
there where

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.220
few more screws ok am not sure how well
you can see that

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.579
okay and when you have done that

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.060
let me stablelize my tripod

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.039
and when you have done that ''Ou''

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.920
I'm sorry i dindnt remember
than you have to take

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.920
out your DVD Drive than flip over your

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.460
PC carefully open it becouse its

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.139
stable anymore and

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:44.569
take out your a keyword and then just
remove

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.119
every single screw and and then just

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.819
open your PC so when you open up your PC

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.329
you should see something like this , this is the motherboard

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.990
what you're looking for is in this side

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.720
powerjack

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.600
so

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.349
when you see your powerjack you should release it

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.410
by unscrewing hanges on both sides
and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.970
then you should be able to take out your powerjack

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.550
that's exactly what I'm gonna do
now so

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.569
it was a little bit harder to dig down to dc powerjack

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.890
Bocek but I finally did it I took out my
motherboard I took off the display

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.620
and this is why your computer isnt
charging

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.390
so this is the Jack as you can see

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.299
it the has lossen one of the wires
the ground one

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.610
and now I'm going to just solder it back
so its

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.920
working and I don't have to buy new part
for my computer

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.079
so I just soldered back my lossen wire

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.100
and now it should work properly and now
I'm going to

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.140
put but my computer and turn it on and
see if it's working

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.220
so

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.370
assembled my computer and as you can see
my adapter is working

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.960
now going to put it in my computer
as you can see

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.670
charging indicator is shown and that
mean it's charging

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.680
and yes the computer to turned on

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.840
and i have done it and if you like this video
