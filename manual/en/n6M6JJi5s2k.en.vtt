00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.000
Cycling the Cameron Highlands

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.860
Malaysia is a little bit different

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.260
but in truth

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.460
it's quite Western and modern

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.020
so we headed inland to the old British tea plantations

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.120
where I rented a circus bike and aimed
for the top of the highest mountain in the area

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.180
I have to remember to ride on the
left side of the road in this country

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.800
thought stop signs the world over were
spelt S T O P

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.780
so far it's bit too civilized

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.060
and touristy

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.280
it is that way somewhere

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.500
the mountain is 6,666 feet high

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.960
finally I've left the main road

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.220
and begin on the winding climbing road

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.980
then I meet a big bus on this tiny road

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.300
it's the tea plantation tour bus

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.480
that's a traffic jam

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.140
the tea plantations begin to appear

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.740
I reached the turn off towards the mountain top

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.420
I take a break to experiment

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.520
do green tea leaves tastes like tea?

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.840
Nope

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.320
gotten awfully steep

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.500
as a result

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.240
I'm walking

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.920
a sun shower

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.080
getting higher

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.460
almost there

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.420
made it

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.300
no I have to ride all the way down

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.340
success
