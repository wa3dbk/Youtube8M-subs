Hi! I'm Louis Ortiz on behalf of Expert Village
and we started to show you the basic preparation

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.570
for the homemade pasta and I'm back here to
show you what the finished product should

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.870
look like. We've got a nice pasta dough ball,
if you will here and there's just a tiny bit

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.470
of tackiness to it which is okay. It was a
little bit more tackier early on throughout

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.509
the 5 minute kneading process and all I did
was sprinkle some semolina on the cutting

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.840
board and pick that up with a dough ball.
It just massaged into itself. So it's got

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.380
a nice tender feel to it. Again, as dough
should do, you punch into it and it starts

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.520
to come back. I'll show that to you one more
time so that you will know exactly what we

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.550
are talking about. So I punch it and it starts
to rise and come back on. So that's what we

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.420
are after. Now that it is done and needed
the way that we want and also as a side note,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.080
we did not use a knife or anything to cut
this. You never want to do that. You want

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.570
to keep it all together and just folding it.
Never try to separate it with a knife or try

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.660
to tear it because it is just going to lead
to a whole bunch of inconsistencies in the

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.250
pasta machine and in the recipe as well. I
am just going to knead it a little bit more

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.480
and it's obviously hard to illustrate the
feel of this on video but you'll get the hang

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.990
of it. As long as you can match this color
and again, it's popping back out, so it's

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:43.210
good. So I've just got some plastic wrap here,
so we are going to wrap this guy up and push

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:52.890
the air out of there.
There's our finished pasta product. Now while

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.190
we get everything else ready, I eat the sauce,
the salads all other kinds of things, I'm

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.159
just going to let this guy rest and chill
literally inside the refrigerator for 10 or

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.619
15 minutes and actually the cool temperature
will allow it to firm it up a little bit which

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.141
will go through the pasta machine in a much
uniformed fashion after it happens. So we

00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:19.480
are going to go ahead and throw them in the
refrigerator and we will come back and show

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.450
you how to make pasta.
