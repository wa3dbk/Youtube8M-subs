From the studio that nearly

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.170
destroyed the X-Men franchise with
"The Last Stand," comes the film

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.160
that destroyed your favorite X-
Man...

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.210
VOICE (CONT'D)
Wolverine

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.560
VOICE (CONT'D)
Journey to 1970's Canada, where

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.450
everyone dresses like it's 2009.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.000
VOICE (CONT'D)
And no one has a Canadian accent.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.590
VOICE (CONT'D)
Witness Marvel's most hardcore

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.590
character get completely neutered in
his own extremely, boring movie

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.500
VOICE (CONT'D)
Watch as Wolverine's centuries of

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.040
war are glossed over in one
montage to instead make time for

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.510
things no one wants to see
Wolverine do:

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.810
VOICE (CONT'D)
Go on dates!

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.120
VOICE (CONT'D)
Chop wood!

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.750
VOICE (CONT'D)
Get stuck in traffic!

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.110
VOICE (CONT'D)
And fumble around in the bathroom!

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.350
VOICE (CONT'D)
And if you thought they could only

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.659
ruin Wolverine - wait until you see
what they did with Deadpool...

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.240
VOICE (CONT'D)
The "merc with the mouth" - gets

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.240
his mouth removed, and trades his
cool costume for eight-minute abs

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.830
and magic eye shadow - Oh and he
also gets a grab-bag of random

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.479
mutant powers that Deadpool never
had.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.130
VOICE (CONT'D)
Are we sure that Brett Ratner

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.080
didn't direct this?

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.650
VOICE (CONT'D)
Get excited when they introduce fan-

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.830
favorite Gambit!

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.770
VOICE (CONT'D)
Then get immediately disappointed

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.250
when you realize that he's only in
the movie for 5 minutes.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.190
VOICE (CONT'D)
Instead spend time with some of the

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.170
lamest mutants you've never heard
of...

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.920
VOICE (CONT'D)
Wraith

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.229
VOICE (CONT'D)
Agent Zero

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.750
VOICE (CONT'D)
Bolt

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.979
VOICE (CONT'D)
And Silverfox?

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.000
VOICE (CONT'D)
Wow Marvel, really scraping the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.049
bottom of the barrel huh.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.619
VOICE (CONT'D)
Prepare to learn the origin of

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.640
boring Wolverine facts like...

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.229
VOICE (CONT'D)
Where he got his jacket.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.280
VOICE (CONT'D)
And the super boring story behind

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.310
his nickname.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.130
VOICE (CONT'D)
Blah blah blah blah blah.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.909
VOICE (CONT'D)
Ugh. Really?

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.510
Strap in for an action movie with

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.109
effects so bad...it barely looks

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.319
better than the leaked rough cut

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.999
everyone pirated online.

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.139
Featuring...

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.230
VOICE (CONT'D)
This horrible CGI camera trick

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.909
VOICE (CONT'D)
This weird CGI ladder.

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.310
VOICE (CONT'D)
This awful CGI facelift.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.209
VOICE (CONT'D)
And unforgivably terrible CGI claws

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.010
VOICE (CONT'D)
That somehow look worse than the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.150
first three X-men movies.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.849
VOICE (CONT'D)
So get ready to crank up the volume

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:45.849
in one of the shout-iest. Films. Ever.

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:04.239
VOICE (CONT'D)
RAAARAAAARGH this movie sucks.

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.790
VOICE (CONT'D)
Starring...

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:29.629
VOICE (CONT'D)
X-Men Origins: Wolverine.

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.230
VOICE (CONT'D)
Why can't you movie studios just get along? America needs to see Wolverine fight the Hulk...right?

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.790
