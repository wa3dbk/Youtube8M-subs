00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
The Catch in Average

00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:11.566
This costume parade goes on
for an hour in the U.K.

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:20.633
All people with income must
walk by within one hour.

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:27.666
Numbers - Part 3
The 48-minutes Trap

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.500
The parade is arranged
in order of height.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.933
The heights are proportional
to the income.

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:48.866
The first marcher struggles upside down
with his head buried in the ground.

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:57.100
A bankrupt business man
making losses.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:08.166
Next are people standing straight
but stuck on the ground like ants.

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.300
A housewife working by the hour

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.433
A newspaper delivery boy

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:20.600
They are merely a few centimeters tall.

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:27.100
They are followed by
one meter tall marchers.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.100
The aged

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.600
The unemployed

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.066
A street vendor with a bad business

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:35.633
An unrecognized genius painter

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:41.266
For over 30 minutes,
people's heights remain at

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:49.633
barely over one meter,
the height of dwarves.

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:54.700
However

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.033
after 48 minutes,
the heights rise drastically.

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:11.166
A college graduated officer worker
and a principal over two meters tall.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:17.100
A colonel over five meters tall

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.700
An unsuccessful lawyer

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:30.533
At the last minute,
we see giants tens of meters tall.

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:36.733
Prince Philip, the husband of
Elizabeth II is 60 meters tall.

00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:43.533
The executive director of Shell, an oil
and gas company, is 110 meters tall.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.766
The last marchers are so tall
that their faces are covered by clouds.

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:58.100
Income Distribution (1971)
by Jan Pen, a Dutch economist

00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:07.833
In this visual statistics of
income disparity in the society

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:14.200
more than half are
dwarves under one meter.

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:20.400
However, the average height is

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:29.300
170 centimeters that
we saw around at 48 minutes.

00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:37.800
The catch in average

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.266
"It's not as easy as it seems to
be included in the average group.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.000
Annual income

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.533
Age

00:03:47.533 --> 00:03:49.066
Height

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:50.533
Weight

00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:54.566
Academic record

00:03:56.566 --> 00:04:06.200
"Average" is a representative value
that sums up a certain group's data.

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:14.366
But what if you can't understand
the total and the distribution?

00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:22.033
Normally mistaken as the average
is the value in the middle, the median.

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:29.266
Mode is a value that occurs
most frequently in a set of data.

00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:36.166
Without considering the median and mode,
the average cannot represent a group's data.
