00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.540
This K&amp;N air intake system is designed to
increase vehicle power and acceleration by

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.990
reducing restriction in the intake path.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.740
The 57-1555 air intake has received a CARB
EO number and it is street legal in all 50

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.740
states.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:43.000
This air intake system fits 2006, 2007, 2008,
2009 and 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee with 6.1

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.830
liter engines in addition to other vehicles
identified on the K&amp;N website or catalog.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:55.620
K&amp;N power testing showed an estimated power
gain of 12 horsepower at 5000 RPM with this

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.120
air intake installed on a 2007 Jeep Grand
Cherokee SRT8 with a 6.1 liter engine.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.890
Actual results will vary depending on the
condition of the vehicle, mileage, weather

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.140
and other variables.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.960
With the air intake installed we ran the vehicle
on the dyno to test the sound comparison verses

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:29.240
the stock intake.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:47.580
The intake kit includes components that have
been designed or matched to the needs of these

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.270

the emissions inspector can see it when the
vehicle is required to be tested for emissions.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.819
California requires testing every two years,
other states may vary.

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:47.210
It will be necessary for all K&amp;N high flow
intake systems to be checked periodically

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.249
for realignment, clearance and tightening
of all connections.

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:56.220
