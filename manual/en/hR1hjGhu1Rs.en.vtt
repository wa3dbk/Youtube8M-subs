00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.300
Darine, does it affect on you negatively in some areas,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.050
if it happens that these areas contradicts your TV's policy?

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.040
In other words, you might be accused by some people since you work for "Al Jadeed" TV?

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.720
I'm going to tell you an interesting thing that occurred to me during the war.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.760
I live at "Ain Al Remaneh" that usually tends to 14th of July sect more than the 8th of July sect nowadays.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.540
At that time, "New TV" was broadcasting from that area,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.140
so they chose me to join the News broadcast team, mainly Mr. Firas Hatoum

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.760
to escort him whenever there are interviews

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:47.640
with political sects against our TV's political point of view.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.330
This is where I blame the Lebanese citizens

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.150
which made me feel sad.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:04.950
Why should it be that if I'm from that area, my attendance will resolve the conflict!

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:16.580
Lately, I guess "New TV" is becoming more democratic or liberal.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.700
Especially now that we're on "Orange TV",

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:27.030
which indicates that "New TV" is expressing not its point of view alone,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.640
but also it's taking into consideration all other TV channels point of views.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.500
This I consider the marketing plan that our TV channel applies

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.930
and should be applied by all other TV channels too.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:46.830
Exactly, our democracy should be reflected in our Medias tools.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.510
But still, it's not wrong that each channel relies on a specific political system.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.150
Definitely, but they should make sure that their broadcast targets all the Lebanese.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.490
Darine, now done with politics we're going to discuss your personal life.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.200
One of your hobbies is Horseback Ride?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.080
True, it's not just a hobby, in fact I practice Horseback Ride.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.570
I used to practice horseback riding at Down Town Beirut.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.380
What is the feeling that you get from the horseback riding?

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.650
Does it mean that Darine is always in control?

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.800
Well this a hobby since childhood at the age of 10.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.420
I used to own a horse called "Jawhara" that died later on.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.450
Then I continued such kind of sport that grants me some freedom.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:50.150
When I'm feeling down it makes me feel happy

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.500
and if I'm feeling happy it makes me even happier.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.280
Darine, how are you treated by your coworkers at "New TV"?

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.030
You and several coworkers started the weather cast together,

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.070
Darine is the one who's getting promoted

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.640
and has shows of her own. Before, others had shows of their own too.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.900
How do you think the employees are treated in your TV channel?

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:27.790
In our TV channel, the management gives the opportunity to each of us to show his skills,

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.980
it takes into consideration Darine, Cynthia, Firas, Nancy,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.100
meaning all coworkers will be evaluated upon their efforts.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.050
For example, Mr. Riad Ebayseh that started a new venture as reporter,

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.910
where later on many reporters tried to imitate him.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.380
So, the management supported him even more depending on his projects.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.210
Ms. Nancy El Sabeh's potentials also appeared as a reporter where she took a new line.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.250
In my TV, I was liked and known for being witty and having the sense of humor in my shows,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.990
these skills appeared in my "Telteh Sebteh maa Darine" entertainment show.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.190
Then, in my "Sameedoun" show I proved my skills as a negotiator.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.790
So, I was given the opportunity to be creative,

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.750
meaning that I was able to submit and implement my ideas.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.930
So I submitted a new idea, then the TV manager Mr. Dimitri

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.900
proposed on me his new idea and asked me to choose either his or my idea.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:42.890
I decided to proceed with his idea; since he used to be a director and finds that his idea fits me better.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:52.610
Darine, sometimes I feel that it's easy to appear on TV nowadays,

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.360
While there are people with the required skills, education level, and potentials are not getting this opportunity.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.910
Suddenly, a young cute lady, tall, has the features of a model appears in a TV show.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.980
Do you feel sometimes that you've been studying hard for 4 years to get your diploma,

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:19.020
like many people that are watching us now and feeling the similar suffers that we used to face before joining the TV?

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:26.490
To be honest Elie, it's very possible that based on good-looking female features makes her appear in a TV show for few months.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:36.320
But the important thing is to keep up, the proof is that many good-looking girls that used to appear on TV now disappeared.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:46.300
The Press could be with or against these girls, but if these girls made personal efforts they definitely could have preserved their TV career.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.040
Do you think that the education alone is enough to be a successful TV presenter?

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.470
Unfortunately, the education alone isn't enough.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.720
Because the TV reflects visual contents that our viewers are judging,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:10.980
so at the end you can't be a successful speaker and ugly or visa verse,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:17.210
meaning you should have both looks and brains.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:25.250
It's not obligatory to be a journalist, you could be a business man, or lawyer, or anything else,

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:33.750
the important thing is to be a good speaker and negotiator with charisma, like you Elie.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.460
Thank you Darine! That's kind of you.
