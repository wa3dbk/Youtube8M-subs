Today on Violet Vision.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.100
Big curly updo.
You need a hair curler/straightener, bobby

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.100
pins, flower pins, hairspray.
The finished look.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.100
Proper photos in the blog post.
Celeste's hair was already mostly curled from

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.100
the last style.
We did this look after taking out hime style

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.100
hair so the top was uncurled.
You can use a curling wand, straightener or

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.100
pin curls.
Doesn't really matter as long as it's mostly

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.100
curly.
Pull the hair up into a high pony tail.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.100
Use fingers not a brush so it's not too neat.
Leave a couple of the curls hanging on one

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.660
side.
Twist the ponytail once and bunch to the scalp.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:51.140
Scrunch the curls towards the scalp and pin
in place.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:02:00.450
Bunch most at the top and over one side.
Fix up any curls which need it with the straightener.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:03:03.290
Add lots of hairspray.
Add flower hair pins all over the place.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:58.490
Taadaa finished.
Quickly, send more photos to the housemate.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:41.420
Thanks for watching, see you next time.
