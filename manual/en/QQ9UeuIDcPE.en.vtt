00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.320
Rock climbers are very mobile people.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.560
That means we claim the right

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.400
to get into the car and drive
into the mountains every weekend.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.800
For instance, here in the Dolomite Alps,
driving through the mountain passes...

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.360
Safety is essential.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.040
Aesthetics are very important to me.
They give me elevated moments.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.400
To look at the Tre Cime,
at the rugged rocks,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.480
when the clouds are moving slowly over
the mountains while the sun sets...

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.840
That moment really touches you
deep inside your soul.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.680
Precision in the planning phase...

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.440
It's crucial, I'd say.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.840
Many mistakes can be made
in the planning phase,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.640
which you will later truly regret.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.400
Like forgetting certain things.
Special equipment, for instance.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.760
It is certainly possible
that an undertaking fails.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.800
So the project can only be as good
as the planning itself.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.480
During these difficult expeditions,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.320
you might reach a point
where you have to push through,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.760
because otherwise
you won’t make it home.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.400
And then your strength and will

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.680
to persevere is absolutely crucial.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.760
I've been climbing for over 35 years

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.040
and eventually you
let your body do the work.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.920
You no longer give any thought

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.960
to the next step, the next grip.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.480
You just go with the flow.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.080
It's one single sequence of motion,

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.120
only interrupted by hanging the rope
into the safety hooks.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.760
Shit!

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.360
You often miss your grip.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.920
In the beginning,
being at a height of 500 to 600 metres

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.800
can leave you breathless.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.200
But after two or three days,
you get used to it.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.440
Even if you fall,
you know nothing can happen to you.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.400
The rope can hold tons,
the hooks are mounted,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.720
there's nothing to hit,
so what is there to worry about?

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.880
The moment I can set out
and am underway,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.040
I'm incredibly happy
 about being privileged enough

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.880
to experience these moments.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.040
Ultimately,
we're hunting for these moments.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.120
For me,
that’s what really enriches life.
