two cups of the Doritos into the food
processor or blender and blend them

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.489
until they're about the size of bread
crumbs

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.120
when they're done they should look
something like this

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.780

crumbs to the process Doritos and mix

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.150
well if you want yours to be spicy just
add some cayenne to make sure about a

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.200
teaspoon will do risk three large eggs
in a bowl

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.950
fill a container or bowl with one and a
half cups of all-purpose flour

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.750
dip each piece of cheese into a beaten
egg mixture then tap off the excess then

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.750
dip it into the flour and coat it
completely

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.060

then put in the refrigerator for 30 to

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.720
60 minutes after the cheese has come out
a refrigerator place them in the deep

fryer two at a time for about two to
three minutes depending on their size
