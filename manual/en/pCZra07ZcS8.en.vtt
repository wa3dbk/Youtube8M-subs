00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.390
Hello my name is Patrick McMenamin the owner
of Caledonia Bar here in Budapest and I'm

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.190
here on behalf of Expert Village to talk about
whiskey and particular Scotch whiskey. When

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:21.769
serving a good Scotch of whiskey individuals
will have a different preferences of course

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:29.739
you always have to pour the whiskey first,
the measure is entirely up to you, of course

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:36.240
if your working a business such as my own
Caledonia you absolutely have to be precise

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.940
about the measurements. But if your drinking
whiskey at home you can serve as much or little

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.350
as you want. Then after your serving a whiskey
to a customer or a guest in your own house

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:56.220
you should offer always offer them choice
of either some water or indeed some whiskey

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:04.859
lovers will still like some ice in there whiskey.
So you should always present that as the offer

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:11.289
to your guest rather than doing it for them,
it is said by many whiskey connoisseurs that

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:19.979
a touch of water just a touch maybe the same
again whiskey brings out the flavor of the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.200
whiskey. That seems to be the whiskeys experts
of view it should naturally be the whiskeys

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.539
experts view but it should naturally be a
touch of water as such. Like I said ice is

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:39.789
a preference my personal preference is not
to include ice in a good single malt whiskey.

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:49.340
There after is just a matter of enjoying you
can smell a good whiskey you can smell the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:02:02.959
peat if it's good peaty whiskey, and you should
enjoy the flavors and in your mouth for a

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:09.150
while, just throwing a whiskey down then your
throat is not very wise and you don't enjoy

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:21.980
the flavor.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.340
You can really really taste the flavors of
a good single malt and if you breath back

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:37.210
out those flavors just extenuate themselves
and that's how really whiskey should be enjoyed,

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.410
whiskeys not for throwing back one after another
and certainly not certainly not.
