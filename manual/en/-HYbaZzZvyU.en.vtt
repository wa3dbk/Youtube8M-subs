over a hundred seventy participants in attendence

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.949
and many of the participants from the

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.119
fourteen and fifteen classes

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.490
should go on and play college football at a high level

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.340
like to start off by talking about some
of the top performers in the two

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.150
thousand thirteen class

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.820

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.510
out

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.720
is probably the most impressive punting
prospect at camp

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.280
when he has a great frame

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.640
