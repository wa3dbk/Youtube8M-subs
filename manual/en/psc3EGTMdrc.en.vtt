00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:26.910
So, first of all, if you want to do a lime
juice, the best thing to do is mind your fingers,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.070
but cut it down the middle.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:36.750
Then you put it into what we call Mexican
Elbow; put it in this way around so the top

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.150
bridge of the lime is facing out at you, so
it goes against it.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.430
Most people do it the other way around.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.610
And the reason for that is when you squeeze,
you won't get it into your eyes.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.770
So, generally, that's about 25 ml, depending
on how big your lime is.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.990
That looks about 15 to me, but 15 to 25ml.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:07.690
And it's always good to just tip it with a
straw to taste how bitter that is.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.330
Yes, that's a nice fresh one.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:25.420
So, that's your lime juice.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:34.990
Fundamentally, the best way to cut your lime
is straight down the middle.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.070
With a Mexican Elbow, make sure that your
lime goes bridge way up, so that the bridge

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.420
of it is facing you.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.570
This means that when you squeeze it, it doesn't
fly up into your eye or anyone else's eye

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.140
and then you just press hard.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.170
You may have generally 15 to 25 ml of fresh
lime.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.710
And that's how to squeeze a lime with a Mexican
Elbow.
