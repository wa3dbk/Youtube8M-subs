00:00:05.062 --> 00:00:07.079
You think you can lock me up in here?

00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:09.424
Little do you know I can walk through walls!

00:00:10.127 --> 00:00:10.688
Ow.

00:00:10.723 --> 00:00:11.675
Foiled again.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.094
I swear I could walk through walls once.

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:15.964
Was that just another glitch, by any chance?

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.137
My name is Murphy Pendleton.

00:00:18.172 --> 00:00:20.249
I was arrested because I have a silly name.

00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:24.843
They tried to make me go to prison, I said "No, no, no".

00:00:24.878 --> 00:00:28.238
And then they said "That's not how prisons work."

00:00:28.273 --> 00:00:30.275
So I went to prison.

00:00:34.412 --> 00:00:36.337
I hope you're all writing these names down.

00:00:36.372 --> 00:00:38.716
These are the people you blame if you hate it.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:40.767
Hi, Sewer.

00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:41.827
It's not Sewer.

00:00:41.862 --> 00:00:43.589
It's Officer Sewer.

00:00:43.624 --> 00:00:45.710
Anyway... It's all set, cupcake.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:46.806
OK...

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.195
Batenburg.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.448
Make it quick, huh?

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:50.180
OK.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:51.646
Can I run?

00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:53.024
No.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.976
Wahey, I'm ruining the atmosphere!

00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:57.110
Never let the player control the camera.

00:00:57.145 --> 00:00:58.065
Murphy, stop it.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.092
That's why we're walking so slowly, OK?

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:01.897
For the atmosphere, so stop it.

00:01:01.932 --> 00:01:03.879
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:01:03.914 --> 00:01:06.012
I left you a present on one of the benches.

00:01:06.047 --> 00:01:09.590
Well, I actually left you two presents, but one's just a stick,

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:11.157
so I didn't want to get your hopes up.

00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:14.130
Oh, I can run in the shower room.

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:15.616
Because that's a safer place to run.

00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:16.811
Hey, Murph.

00:01:16.846 --> 00:01:18.067
Let me tell you a little secret.

00:01:18.102 --> 00:01:21.651
When the showers are on, the cameras fog up and we can't see a thing.

00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:25.408
Not that I've been looking or anything.

00:01:25.443 --> 00:01:27.371
Just... Uh... Just kill him, OK?

00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:28.634
Ah.

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:29.823
Er... Murph?

00:01:29.858 --> 00:01:31.935
This radio thing...

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.653
Not only is it recording, but apparently I've just broadcast that to the entire prison.

00:01:36.654 --> 00:01:38.130
So... yeah.

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:39.529
Damn.

00:01:39.564 --> 00:01:41.057
It was such a great plan as well.

00:01:41.092 --> 00:01:43.932
Except for the fact that the cameras weren't fogged up when you came in, 

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:48.101
which might make them put two and two together later when they have a dead body in here.

00:01:48.136 --> 00:01:50.242
Just waiting for present number three now...

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:51.259
Yep...

00:01:52.013 --> 00:01:53.509
He's taking a while...

00:01:53.544 --> 00:01:55.367
I could have a quick shower...

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:55.961
Oh, there he is!

00:01:55.996 --> 00:01:57.691
Right on time, I see.

00:01:57.726 --> 00:01:59.432
I like a punctual man.

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:01.723
Jesus, you scared the hell outta me.

00:02:01.758 --> 00:02:04.503
You scared the hell out of me, I thought you were an insane cancer.

00:02:04.538 --> 00:02:05.734
What's going on?

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:06.722
Where's Sewell?

00:02:06.757 --> 00:02:07.528
I'm here.

00:02:07.563 --> 00:02:08.085
Oh!

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:10.069
I have no idea what's going on here.

00:02:10.104 --> 00:02:11.269
Wait a second...

00:02:11.304 --> 00:02:13.731
I said "Jesus, you scared the hell out of me".

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:17.200
But isn't that what Jesus does?

00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:17.819
Wh...

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:19.227
Oh, you deserve to die.

00:02:19.262 --> 00:02:21.900
You're nothing but a tutorial.

00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:23.522
You don't recognise me, do you?

00:02:23.557 --> 00:02:27.342
Just because you're the protagonist of a new Silent Hill game doesn't make you famous.

00:02:27.377 --> 00:02:29.655
You're not supposed to be in here.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.722
What, you take up all eight showers?

00:02:31.757 --> 00:02:32.858
You're not that fat.

00:02:32.893 --> 00:02:34.386
We used to be neighbours.

00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:36.318
What a small world, eh?

00:02:36.353 --> 00:02:38.069
Well, I suppose that's relative.

00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:39.130
Oh, I know who you are.

00:02:39.165 --> 00:02:41.296
It's a good job I'm such a fast runner.

00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:42.845
He didn't even have time to turn around.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.157
Oh, it looks like the lock is broken.

00:02:45.192 --> 00:02:46.102
I can't open it!

00:02:46.137 --> 00:02:48.203
This is a violation of my rights.

00:02:48.238 --> 00:02:50.537
Sewell didn't tell me this was going to be illegal.

00:02:50.572 --> 00:02:53.316
Please stop staring at the weird folds under my arm.

00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:55.229
Who the hell do you think you are?

00:02:55.264 --> 00:02:57.773
My name is Murphy Pendleton.

00:02:57.808 --> 00:02:58.464
...The Third.

00:02:59.552 --> 00:03:01.100
Wait a second, what's your name?

00:03:01.135 --> 00:03:02.660
N...Napier.

00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:03.859
Oh, for God's sake.

00:03:03.894 --> 00:03:06.150
Two guys, one naked, in a prison shower.

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:10.010
I'm trying to avoid the prison rape jokes here, because they get old incredibly fast,

00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:12.312
but they name you Napier the Rapier.

00:03:12.347 --> 00:03:13.363
Fantastic.

00:03:13.398 --> 00:03:15.910
You have a very secure towel, by the way.

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:16.921
Thank you.

00:03:16.956 --> 00:03:19.921
One wants to keep their dignity in moments like this.

00:03:19.956 --> 00:03:20.697
Aha!

00:03:20.732 --> 00:03:21.408
Thank you!

00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:22.968
Now I have a weapon!

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:30.499
You know...

00:03:30.534 --> 00:03:31.528
The funny thing is...

00:03:31.563 --> 00:03:32.748
I'm only in here...

00:03:32.783 --> 00:03:33.788
for car theft.

00:03:33.823 --> 00:03:37.211
I figured if I commit a crime in here, they'd send me back out again.

00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:38.347
That's how it works, right?

00:03:38.382 --> 00:03:39.694
It's like a rotating system.

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:41.243
Oh, no.

00:03:41.278 --> 00:03:43.832
All this blood, however will we wash it all away?

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:44.491
Oh, wait!

00:03:44.526 --> 00:03:46.059
This plan is genius!

00:03:46.971 --> 00:03:48.955
I don't think he's seen me.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.808
This is what happens when you play too much Metal Gear Solid.

00:03:51.843 --> 00:03:54.873
If I can just make it to the door.

00:03:54.908 --> 00:03:56.231
OK.

00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:57.812
I made it to the door.

00:03:57.847 --> 00:03:59.053
I win?

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:02.881
Why?

00:04:02.916 --> 00:04:04.158
You know exactly why.

00:04:04.193 --> 00:04:04.986
But they don't yet.

00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:06.060
So be quiet, please.

00:04:08.022 --> 00:04:08.998
Yay!

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.057
In my restless dreams...

00:04:11.092 --> 00:04:12.202
I dream that I...

00:04:12.237 --> 00:04:14.186
am eating a giant marshmellow.

00:04:15.946 --> 00:04:19.763
There's nothing worse than waking up from a dream and realising it wasn't real.

00:04:19.798 --> 00:04:21.673
And waking up in prison as well.

00:04:21.708 --> 00:04:23.580
Oh, and the names are back.

00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:25.503
Oh, Officer Sewer.

00:04:25.538 --> 00:04:26.924
Why is my floor wet?

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:28.314
Did you bring the sewer with you?

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.255
Rise and shine, cupcake.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.054
Why are you calling me cupcake?

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:35.359
We name you all after different kinds of cake instead of prisoner numbers.

00:04:35.394 --> 00:04:37.509
It makes the place feel a bit happier, you know?

00:04:37.544 --> 00:04:41.191
Unfortunately it doesn't help the cannibals we've got locked up here, but never mind.

00:04:41.226 --> 00:04:42.473
You're under arrest.

00:04:42.508 --> 00:04:44.203
I think you're a little bit late for that.

00:04:44.238 --> 00:04:46.080
Guess today's the big day, huh?

00:04:46.115 --> 00:04:48.423
You're moving to a different prison!

00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:50.083
I bet you can hardly wait.

00:04:50.118 --> 00:04:52.845
Prisoner secure, though not necessarily emotionally.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.988
Open room 302B!

00:04:55.023 --> 00:04:56.876
Who's getting my room after I've gone?

00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:58.679
Oh, some guy with long hair.

00:04:58.714 --> 00:04:59.612
Come on, Murphy.

00:04:59.647 --> 00:05:00.844
Let's go for a walk.

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.880
Can we go for a run instead?

00:05:02.915 --> 00:05:03.411
No.
