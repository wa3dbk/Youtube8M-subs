00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:07.939
One of the frustrations that you're
bound to

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.620
come across every time you're out shooting,
particularly doing travel photography

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.080
when you're shooting portraits on the
street you must come to a decision

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.070
as to what you're gonna do with that
background.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.999
Hi, I'm Bryan Peterson and you are watching AdoramaTV.

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:25.249
AdoramaTV presents

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.689
'You Keep Shooting' with Bryan Peterson.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.730
Hi, I'm Bryan Peterson and I'm the author
of 'Understanding Exposure'

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.450
and 'Bryan Peterson's Field Guide to Understanding Photography'.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.520
I'm here in Chandni Chowk, the biggest market in all of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.490
New Delhi

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.220
and I have characters galore down here. I love coming to this place.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.790
And in particular, I met a really nice man
this morning who's got

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.140
gorgeous eyes and I want to shoot his portrait. The problem that is created by this

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.980
particular idea as always is I need to pay attention to my background.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.320
You will notice behind him there is a number of wheels.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.940
This is an area
of automotive parts that's being sold all

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.840
along Chandni Chowk market in this particular locale.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.280
As a result I need to be conscious of that. More often than not, when we're shooting portraits

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.850
we get so focused on the person we don't
pay attention to the background.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.450
That's critical.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.820
So, in this instance here notice what
happened if I don't get in close enough

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.460
I've got a background left behind him
clearly

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.640
from automobile wheel covers that are
quite distracting and a solution

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.180
real simple. Either zoom with your feet or in this case the 24-120.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.970
Get in tighter, make my point of view
and take a look at that one!

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.260
I think you'll agree that that's a much much better image.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.180
So, the key here is clean up the background by
simply zooming in a little tighter.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.320
Don't think that you have to show
everything. More often than not

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.400
that will get you in trouble. Hey until next time, this is Bryan Peterson saying

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.740
you keep shooting!
