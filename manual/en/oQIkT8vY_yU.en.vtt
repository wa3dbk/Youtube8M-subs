00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.970
WELCOME TO THE 2011 CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW.
ITS TUESDAY, JANUARH 4. I'M NATALI MORRIS

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.900
COMING TO YOU FROM LAS VEGAS THIS WEEK. IT'S
TIME TO GET LOADED.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.470
CES HAS NOT OFFICIALLY KICKED OFF YET. YOU
CAN SEE WE ARE ALL STILL SETTING UP BUT I

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.050
THINK IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THIS WILL BE
THE YEAR OF TABLETS AND MORE TABLETS. WE ALREADY

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.119
KNOW THAT VERIZON IS PLANNING TO SHOW OFF
AT LEAST 4 DIFFERENT 4G TABLET RUNNING GOOGLE'S

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.460
ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM. WE ALSO KNOW THAT
TOSHIBA IS RELEASING A TABLET TOO. IT WILL

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.489
BE CALLED THE TOSHIBA TABLET AND ALSO BE RUNNING
ANDROID. LENOVO WILL ALSO HAVE A FEW ANDROID

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.960
TABLETS OF THEIR OWN. AND VIZIO, THE TV MAKER,
HAS ALSO SAID THAT THEY WILL HAVE AN ANDROID

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.809
TABLET CALLED THE VIA TABLET WHICH WILL WORK
WITH THEIR VIA PHONE AND VIZIO TVS. WE ARE

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.149
ALSO ANTICIPATING THE BLACKBERRY PLAYBOOK
AND POSSIBLY AN HP PALMPAD. SO LIKE I SAID:

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.680
TABLETS. STAY TUNED FOR SPECIFICS.
IN ADDITION TO THE TOSHIBA TABLET, TOSHIBA

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.280
IS ALSO PLANNING A 3D LAPTOP THAT DOES NOT
REQUIRE 3D GLASSES. THIS LAPTOP IS FOR SINGLE

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.030
VIEWER, MEANING YOU CAN'T GATHER AROUND THE
LAPTOP AND HAVE YOUR FRIENDS ENJOY THE 3D.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.001
IT ALSO HAS FACIAL RECOGNITION FROM THE WEBCAM
BUT AGAIN, ONLY FOR ONE PERSON AT A TIME.

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:24.229
THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT STAGES BUT WILL
BE FUN TO SEE HERE AT THE SHOW. STAY TUNED
