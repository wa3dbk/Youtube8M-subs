Hey, I'm Ann Myrick, and today, I'm going
to show you how to choose a wall color. Many

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.360
things to think about. First you want to think
about, where, what room you're going to be

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.361
working with? and what the activity is in
the room, and what I mean by that is, you

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:26.680
don't want to put a real bright, bold color,
in a bedroom, because a lot of times, the

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:35.559
color will kind of keep you kind of energized,
and not be a calming color, so it really depends

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.239
on what room we're going to painting, or what
room we're going to be changing, so you want

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.949
to think about what the room is, what the
activity is, in that room. You want to think

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.670
about the light. Do you have a lot of light
in that room? Do you not have a lot of light?

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.399
If you have rooms that don't have a lot of
light, then you want to be careful about really

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.510
dark color. Is there already furniture items
in that room, that you need to work with,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.430
as far as the colors within that color scheme,
that you need to work with? All your major

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:23.060
paint companies have great paint fans, that
you can go and just work with, and they designate

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:33.090
the paint, the textures you can use on those
paints, and it's great information, to just

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.380
sit down and look at your paint colors. Another
thing that I will always tell a client, is

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.840
whatever paints, there are many paint companies
that you can go and get individual, big individual

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.920
swatches, and a lot of times, I will take
these big swatches, or I will take a swatch

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.780
and put three or four together, and make a
really big swatch, and put it in that room,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.670
that I'm going to paint, and see what it does,
within a twenty four or a forty eight hour

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.200
period, because a lot of times your paint
will change, and it will be a color that you

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.110
really don't like, and so what I do many times,
is I put a big swatch on the wall, and I will

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.160
look at it, morning, noon, and night. I'll
just tape it right on the wall, and look at

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.389
it morning, noon, and night, and see if it's
the color I really like. Sometimes I'll put,

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:29.651
if it's like a green that I want to work with,
I'll put five or six different greens that

00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:33.870
I really like, and then I'll slowly pull the
ones down I don't like, and then I'll end

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.200
up with the one I love. I'm Ann Myrick, and
that's how you pick out a paint color.
