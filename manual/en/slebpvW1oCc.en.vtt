high-density polyethylene. Our sheds are low-

or peel. All roof, wall and floor panels are
stain-resistant and easy to clean.

rays. So put away your buckets of stain and
paint, you will never need to repaint or varnish

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.170
a Lifetime Storage Shed.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.710
Lifetime sheds use blow-molding technology
which allows the walls, roof and floor to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.710
be doubled walled for added strength and durability.
Many companies only use injection molding,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.079
which gives weak single wall construction.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.659
Our double walled sheds also have heavy-duty
steel reinforcements inside the walls to ensure

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.549
superior strength and durability, making Lifetime
sheds stronger than any others on the market.

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.810
With an eighteen hundred (1,800) pound total
snow load capacity, the high-pitched steel-reinforced

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.150
roof allows for quick drainage of rain and
snow. It also provides a 6 foot 8 inch interior

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.350
height from floor to truss, making it easy
to walk around, stack boxes, and store pretty

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.519
much anything!

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.130
Lifetime sheds are not only built for strength
and durability, they also have an attractive

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.570
appearance and design to accent the beauty
of your backyard.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.440

storage solution. With its durability and
