I'm a home healthcare worker.

00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:06.400
I care for elderly,
the handicap.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.367
I just got caught up into really
helping and caring for people.

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:16.500
The jobs didn't pay much, but it
was just such a satisfaction to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.934
help someone that needed help.

I am going to Washington, D.C.
to be with the President,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.767
stand by his side to give
the homecare workers a level

When you're unable to go and do
your shopping like you used to

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.667
do, and do all the other things
-- the traditional holidays,

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:51.233
be able to climb
up and down stairs --

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:52.967
I cannot do that myself anymore.

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:56.233
And I think it's so important
that we have people who have the

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:59.500
compassion in their hearts to at
least take the time to listen to

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.133
something that every human
being deserves to have.

Pauline Beck:
I showed him what my daily life
was like as a homecare worker.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.567
I still remember it like
it happened yesterday.

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:21.533
This photo here is where he's
actually setting the breakfast.

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.900
Yeah, he was just
a coworker then.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.433
I think that he really
kept his promise to me,

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:31.934
because he promised he was going
to do everything he can to help

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:37.133
me out, and he asked me about
my concerns and my feelings,

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:40.000
and he did it; he kept it.

I do this type of work because
I have a compassion for people.

That's a human being, it's a
