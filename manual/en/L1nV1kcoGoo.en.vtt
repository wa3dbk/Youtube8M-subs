00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
one, two, three, four!

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.320
Rev up your engines!

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.680
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.410
if your car's old radio doesn't work anymore,
stupid old thing, then stay tuned because

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.320
today I'm going to show you how to replace
a radio in your car, now modern radio, CD

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.550
players, mp3 players, are so cheap there's
no sense of tempting to get your old one

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.140
fixed, I've had customers that want one of the
original radios fixed, some of them spent

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.230
hundreds of dollars and they end up with
a radio that doesn't even work as good

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.300
as this $59 one, now to get the radio out
of the way, first you got to get the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.610
covers off, in this case bottom here's
the snaps off and then there's two

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.110
little Phillips screws you take off for
the front cover, so you remove them both,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.120
then get a skinny little screwdriver
like this, to take the front off, because

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.920
the top part here is real tight, you get
the screwdriver and you pry it off, be

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.340
careful not to break anything off, but
eventually you'll be able to pry the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.290
whole thing up and pull it out and out
it comes, now this radio just has two

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.479
giant screws here holding it in place, so
we'll take them off, and off they come, then the whole

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.759
radio assembly just pulls right out and
then comes the tricky part, you got to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.960
hook all the wires up, now you can see
the wires here are on a clip, you squeeze it

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.159
and all the wires come off and the new
radio comes with the same type of clip

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.060
of all the wires,
you just have to match them up and just

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.979
be happy that the Box has all the wires
and where they go and in this case we're

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.880
extremely lucky, because the connector
for the new radio is the same as the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.590
connector from the old radio, snaps right
in, so in this case we won't have to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.899
rewire anything, but if you're not lucky
they come with directions, the red wire

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.130
is the ignition when you turn the key on
it sends power to the radio, the yellow

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.579
wire is the battery wire that goes
direct from the battery and has power all

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.330
the time to keep memory in the radio,
it's not that complicated, but in the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.870
case of a car like this that has four
speakers, there's not an eight speaker

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.830
wires, so it takes a little bit of time,
then you get the bracket from the old

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.290
radio, slip the new radio into the
bracket and screw it in on the sides, if

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.800
you look closely you'll see there's two
screws on each side that you screw in

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.810
you just screw them in tight, then
you get the antenna wire and plug that

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.819
in, and snap in the main wiring harness

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.040
then we just slip the whole assembly
back into a hole and bolt up the sides

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.599
put them in nice and tight so the radio
doesn't rattle, then pop the cover back

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:53.260
on, snap in place and screw it in then
pop the gearshift lever cover it back in

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.459
now comes the moment of truth, we'll turn
on the key and see if it works, three, two,

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.980
one, it's coming on, and here we go music

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.280
not bad for $50 radio, so next time your
old radio craps out, why not replace it

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:20.640
