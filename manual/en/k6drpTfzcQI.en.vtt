00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.499
What would Easter be without
a basket filled with

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:11.869
brightly colored eggs?

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.209
Decorating eggs is easy and
inexpensive, using a simple mix of

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.000
food coloring, water and vinegar.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.660
To create a rainbow of beautiful
eggs, here's what to do.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.999
Step One:
Choose and prep the eggs.

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:31.179
Select large white eggs.  Brown eggs
don't show color as well.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.420
Before you color, you'll need to hard
boil the eggs, or removed the yolks

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.390
and whites by blowing them out.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.450
To blow out an egg poke a small hole in
each end of the egg with a large needle.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.620
Hold the egg over the dish,
and blow into the top hole.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.870
The raw egg will drip into the bowl,
and leave an empty, and intact, eggshell

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.630
ready for color.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.570
For hard-boiled easter eggs, make sure
they are completely cooled to room

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.640
temperature before coloring.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.230
Step Two:
Assemble Materials.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.520
Here's what you need to transform white
eggs into colorful, easter orbs.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.170
Newspaper, to cover your table or
workspace,

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.990
eggs, blown or hard-boiled,

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.130
food coloring,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.530
white vinegar,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.300
smile bowls, or cups of hot water,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.840
tablespoons, for dipping.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.380
Step Three:
Make the dye.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.579
Fill each bowl three-quarters full

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.670
with warm to hot water.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.410
The waters shouldn't be so hot
it will burn your hand.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.340
Leave enough room in the cups so the water
won't overflow when you drop in an egg.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.950
Add one tablespoon of white vinegar to
each cup of water.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.190
This helps set the color.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.500
Next, add the food coloring.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.659
If you plan to eat the eggs later,
use food grade dye.

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.850
Drop in about 40 drops, or a half a
teaspoon, and stir well.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.680
The more dye you add,
the more vibrant the color.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.569
Get creative and mix up an
assortment of colors.

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.609
Step Four:
Dye your eggs.

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:17.359
Set and egg on a spoon and lower
it gently into the dye.

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:21.480
Let the egg sit in the dye until it
reaches the desired color.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.109
The longer you let it sit,
the darker the color.

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.999
Stir the egg gently to encourage
even coloring.

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:35.139
Remove the egg from the dye, and set it
sideways on an empty egg carton to dry.

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:39.929
Gloss up your eggs by adding a couple
drops of  vegetable oil to a paper towel,

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.929
and gently wiping the eggs.

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:00.149
Dying eggs all the colors of the
rainbow is easy, so make lots.

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:02.929
Use colored eggs in your Easter
brunch centerpiece, tuck them

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:06.419
into baskets and hide them around
the house or yard for a

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.599
traditional egg hunt.
