Hi, I am Tatiana from Sony and I'm here to show you an

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.230
incredibly easy and useful application
available on the Xperia Tablet Z

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.800
called the Remote Control app. This app
allows you to replace

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.150
all of your existing remotes for your
audio and video products

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.490
with a single remote application
available right on the tablet.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.550
From the Home screen tap on the Apps in
the upper right hand corner of your

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.150
tablet.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.390
Open the Remote control app.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.390
At the Welcome screen, tap Add device.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.570
Tap on the device type drop-down menu.
Select your device.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.880
Now, select the manufacturer. If you can't
find the device type or manufacturer, tap

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.780
on Manual setup.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.600
Select Next. You can send the most
frequently used commands, such as changing

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.320
volume

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.390
or changing channels, by making gestures
such as flicking

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.780
or tapping without looking at the screen.
Select the features you want a send with

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.899
gestures by tapping the drop down menu.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.020
The options for gestures are: volume only,
volume and channels,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.789
volume and playback controls, or no
gestures at all. We're going to create

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.990
a gesture for the volume and channels.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.700
Select Next. That's it! Now we are ready to test
it.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.219
Tap on Remote control test. I can now
turn on the TV,

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.189
control volume, change channels, and much
more by using the remote control

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.189
app on the tablet. When you're done testing
just tap on Finish test

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:40.130
and then tap Finish. You will now see
that your device is registered.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.159
You can register up to five devices. To
register other devices, tap on Add device

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.700
and repeat the process. It's that simple.
I hope you have enjoyed this video.
