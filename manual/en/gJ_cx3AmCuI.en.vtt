00:00:02.882 --> 00:00:06.249
- You been on my payroll
a long time.
- Verone, that ain't right.

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.254
Shut up.

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:12.450
I got one last job
for you, Detective.
You hear me?

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:14.516
Look, we've been
all through this.
Yeah?

00:00:14.594 --> 00:00:17.563
Yeah. I said
I can't do it.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.463
Hmm. That's
the wrong answer.
The table.

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:25.698
[Grunting]

00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:30.037
I'm a detective, Verone!
You do anything to me,

00:00:30.108 --> 00:00:33.373
the whole force is gonna
be on your ass
in a minute.

00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:36.937
Shut your mouth!
You fat piece of shit.

00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:38.846
You can stop right now.

00:00:41.386 --> 00:00:44.718
&lt;i&gt;[Whitworth Mutters]&lt;/i&gt;
[Squeaking]

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.280
- What the hell...
What the hell is that?
- Sit down.

00:00:48.526 --> 00:00:50.892
You're gonna regret this.
Just stop right now!

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:54.124
Once the bucket
gets hot enough,
Detective,

00:00:54.198 --> 00:00:56.530
the rat is gonna
want out.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.363
Get...

00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:01.302
And the only direction
it can go is south.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.540
Hey! Get...
Hey!

00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:07.405
Hold that.
[Gasping]

00:01:07.477 --> 00:01:11.675
- Get it off me!
I'll forget it ever happened.
- Shut up.

00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:15.184
Did you know that
your average rat...
&lt;i&gt;[Rat Squeaking]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:18.243
&lt;i&gt;can chew through&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a steel drain pipe?&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:21.722
You see, you have nothing
to worry about when he's
screaming, Detective.

00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:24.851
It's when he goes quiet
that he goes to work.

00:01:24.928 --> 00:01:27.691
&lt;i&gt;[Whitworth]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Stop it! Stop it!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Stop it!&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:27.763 --> 00:01:31.096
Don't be stupid.
Stop it now.

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:35.000
You're in charge of the units
that are watching
my properties, huh?

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.436
&lt;i&gt;What I want is,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I want a 15-minute window...&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:39.940
where everybody...
and I mean everybody...
disappears.

00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:42.875
You hear me?
I can't do it!

00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:45.106
&lt;i&gt;[Moaning, Whimpering]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.945
&lt;i&gt;- [Gasping] Stop it.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I can't do it. Help!&lt;/i&gt;
- Okay. Monica, come here.

00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:52.417
&lt;i&gt;- Help! Help!&lt;/i&gt;
- Shut him up.
Shut him up.

00:01:52.486 --> 00:01:55.512
Help! Help!

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.455
[Squeaking]
&lt;i&gt;Help!&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:57.525 --> 00:02:00.289
Help! Help!

00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:03.057
[Muffled Groaning]
He's biting me!

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.621
&lt;i&gt;- Help! Help!&lt;/i&gt;
- What?

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.601
[Muffled Shouting,
Screaming]

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.034
- You got somethin'
you wanna say?
- [Muffled Screaming]

00:02:11.104 --> 00:02:13.698
He bit me!
[Groaning]

00:02:13.773 --> 00:02:17.038
&lt;i&gt;- Yes, I'll do it!&lt;/i&gt;
- Do what? Say it.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.305
I'll do it.
I'll give you your window.

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.076
[Gasping, Whimpering]
Just get it off me!

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.550
[Groaning]
Get it off!

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.054
You betray me,

00:02:29.122 --> 00:02:31.783
and my rat here...

00:02:31.857 --> 00:02:34.087
is gonna visit
your wife, Lynn... yeah...

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.560
your son, Clay,
and your daughter, Lexi.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.428
Do you hear me?
You understand me? Huh?

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.228
You hear me?
Yes.

00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:44.667
I'll burn your... eyes out!
I'll burn 'em out!

00:02:44.737 --> 00:02:47.763
[Whimpering]
Get it off me.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.833
Good. Now you can go.
Get it off me.

00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:55.175
&lt;i&gt;Get rid ofhim.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Let's go.&lt;/i&gt;
Get if off!
