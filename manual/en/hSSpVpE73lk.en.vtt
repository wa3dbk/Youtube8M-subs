00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.870
We’ve all gotten hookups, right?

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.299
It’s just a fact of life, if you have a
deal you can’t use, you hook your friends

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:08.299
up!

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.410
WELL, we got a fantastic travel hookup from
my sister, Jasmine.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.060
Thanks to JasminePennamma.com, we packed our
bags and headed down to Mexico for a 5 day

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.180
stay at Cabo Azul Resort.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.920
Cabo Azul is located in San Jose, a quick
20-minute cab ride from Cabo.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.650
We checked the resort out online and it looked
nice.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.550
But when we walked into our villa, it took
our breath away.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.720
Each villa has marble floors, a full kitchen,
a Jacuzzi in the bedroom and a luxurious bathroom.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.079
The attention to detail is evident in every
room.

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.480
And the view from the patio left us gasping
for air.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.739
We had a panoramic view of the property and
the beach.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.150
This was our home for the next five days and
we planned to enjoy every bit of it.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.330
Cabo Azul is not an all-inclusive resort.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.440
You have the option to eat in your villa or
at the restaurants on the resort.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.880
The property also has a market with all the
essentials, so we stocked up on breakfast

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.430
and lunch and took advantage of the kitchen
in our villa.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.689
Each kitchen has stainless steel appliances
and is stocked with cutlery, plates and glasses,

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.650
so you can bring food back to your room and
prepare any meal to your heart’s desire.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.990
Not interested in cooking on your vacation?

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.430
Stop by the deli for a quick bite, the poolside
restaurant, or Javier’s, the property’s

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.090
formal dining restaurant.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.210
We enjoyed a delicious dinner at Javier’s.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.259
The atmosphere is amazing!

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.060
You walk in and the ambiance takes over.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.009
With dark wood and an intimate setting, you’re
getting a satisfying meal and an amazing experience.

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.540
Looking to relax and unwind?

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.880
Head over to Paz Spa.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.110
“Paz” means peace and this spa delivers.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.900
Offering a wide range of healing, wellness
and pampering treatments in indoor or outdoor

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.170
settings, this is a great way to spend your
vacation.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.150
Wondering what to do all day?

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.600
This resort has three pools, two jacuzzis
and it’s beachside.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.979
Feel free to layout wherever you like.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.299
We spent most of our days by the beach and
pool and met a slew of interesting characters.

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.249
Be sure to slather on the sunscreen though.

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.489
The Mexican sun is intense.

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.829
When in Mexico, do as the Mexicanos!

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.500
Cabo Azul offers salsa dancing at Javier’s.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.500
We were there with bells on!

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.799
Live Salsa music sets the tone and the encouraging
beat gets people out of their seat.

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.159
Bring your dancing shoes, ladies, this is
a fun event.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.209
Can’t dance?

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.209
Frets not my friend.

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.900
Have a seat at the bar or on the beach side
patio and enjoy the show.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.609
It’s guaranteed to be a memorable night.

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:43.629
Looking for more festivities?

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.189
Cabo Azul has activities on the property to
keep you entertained.

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.139
The resort hosts a beach party and everyone
is invited.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:56.480
They go all out with all you can eat food,
drinks and libations.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.159
After you eat, be prepared for a spectacle.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.809
A fire performer put on an unbelievable show.

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:06.599
From hoops, to whips, there was nothing he
couldn’t handle.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.870
We sat in awe as he tossed fire around his
head effortlessly.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.309
How low can you go?

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:17.689
Next up was limbo and I stole the show!

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.329
Everyone took part as we saw who could go
the lowest.

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.620
With a little liquid courage we all took our
turns under the bar.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.030
Some made it and some wiped out.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.379
What’s left to do after a game of limbo?

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:30.379
Dance!

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.790
The MC fired up the band and we all danced
the night away.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.010
