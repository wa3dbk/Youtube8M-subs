00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.820
What's up guy and girl players of World of
Warcraft. This is Ryutarou aka Tarou and in

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.080
this video I'll be showing you how to defeat
Heroic Lord Marrowgar. For the free complete

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.240
guide, and many others, go to tarouwowguides.com

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.170
The Heroic mode for Lord Marrowgar is fairly
straight forward and the general setup of

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.730
the raid goes mostly unchanged. In this guide
I will only cover what is important and anything

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.220
else you should honestly know if you're doing
Heroic modes. Depending on the class, gear,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.960
and players' abilities you'll want 2-3 healers,
2 tanks, and the rest dps. As for the positioning,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.579
have your raid stand at the back of Lord Marrowgar
just inside the red circle that appears when

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.129
he is selected. If you have a hunter, they
will need a bit more range and should stand

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.280
to the side so they are easily visable to
the raid and range can switch to their Bone

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.559
Spike easier and faster. Standing inside the
red ring will also cause the tanks to see

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.399
more flames than usual and they should cordinate
which direction to strafe in and move in sync.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.769
This is one of the easier Heroic modes and
the main changes are increased health pool

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.539
for Marrowgar, increased damage from Bone
Storm damage and other abilities, and Bone

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.770
Spikes during the Bone Storm phase.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.710
Phase one is extremely simple and dps just
needs to focus on breaking out Bone Spiked

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.600
targets as quickly as possible and burning
down the boss as much as they can.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.210
When phase two or the whirlwind Bone Storm
phase is about to transition, healers need

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.820
to be HoT'ing up the raid, throwing out shields
if possible, and topping off the tanks. If

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.859
you have a hunter, Marrowgar will head for
them first giving the rest of the raid a chance

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:31.880
to flee but, don't scatter like crazy. The
raid needs to stay relatively close together

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.040
or you will get a random person spiked in
BFE with noone to save or heal them. AoE healing

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.840
can be very effective here. Travel somewhat
in a group away from Marrowgar's whirlwind

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.729
until the phase transitions back to phase
one.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.570
At around 20% and just after transitioning
back into phase one, pop Blood Lust or Heroism

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.149
and nuke Lord Marrowgar.

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.640
Just to simplify and recap heroic key points.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.289
Phase One:
Raid stack on Marrowgar's back.

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.390
Tanks strafe in sync out of cold flames.
Around 20% pop BL or Heroism

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.540
Phase One to Two Transition:
Pre-HoT raid and top off tanks

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.330
Phase Two:
Stay away from the Whirlwinding Bone Storm

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.520
Stay semi-grouped up and AoE heal
Immediately kill Bone Spikes

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.550
Phase Two Back to One Transition:
Tanks must pick up together

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.750
Good time to pop tank cds
Helps to have a Hunter MD

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.140
and most importantly, have fun!

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.520
