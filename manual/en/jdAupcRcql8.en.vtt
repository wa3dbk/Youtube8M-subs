00:00:13.168 --> 00:00:14.546
-	Hey, starix.

00:00:15.298 --> 00:00:16.538
How do you do?

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:18.794
-	New image.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.127
-	Childish games.

00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:35.697
-	Markeloff is trying to pass “Angry birds”.

00:00:37.932 --> 00:00:40.832
I’m trying to pass gobbling exam.

00:00:41.953 --> 00:00:46.132
-	I’ve just passed gobbling exam and I feel magnificent.

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:52.535
-	Markeloff, how do you like it here?

00:00:52.983 --> 00:00:53.995
-	Cool.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.202
-	Are the fans pestering you?

00:00:56.583 --> 00:00:57.852
-	Yes, they are.

00:00:58.786 --> 00:01:00.795
-	Is it your way to abstract away from them?

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.105
-	Kind of…

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.993
I’m just very tired.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.176
-	Did you land here yesterday?

00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:07.115
-	Yep.

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:09.056
-	Did you have some time to have a rest and walk around?

00:01:09.537 --> 00:01:10.355
-	Yes, we had liitle time...

00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:12.477
to explore our district.

00:01:13.687 --> 00:01:15.358
-	Which maps will you play with MoscowFive?

00:01:19.893 --> 00:01:22.071
-	Tuscan, inferno?

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:25.607
-	Is it your first experience of playing for money like this?

00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:27.630
Like, to get money per each round you win?

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:28.817
-	Yes.

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:30.132
-	How do you like the idea?

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.387
-	The more money, the better.

00:01:32.387 --> 00:01:33.526
But it’s okay.

00:01:33.932 --> 00:01:34.958
-	You’re already TECHLABS champions.

00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.237
Is it like a bonus?

00:01:36.237 --> 00:01:37.753
-	Yes.

00:01:38.362 --> 00:01:39.763
So if we take into account our champions’ money,

00:01:39.763 --> 00:01:40.581
it’s not bad.

00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:41.558
It’s good.

00:01:41.818 --> 00:01:42.782
Brilliant!

00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:45.903
$ 50 per round is awesome.

00:01:46.892 --> 00:01:48.906
-	What do think about the absence of SK?

00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:52.063
They were disqualified as a matter of fact.

00:01:52.808 --> 00:01:54.491
-	Yes. Well, there are many tales about it…

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:55.945
It’s a pity they didn’t come.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.938
-	Which tales do you mean?

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:02.833
-	Organizers told us one version,

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.881
GeT_RiGhT told me another one.

00:02:06.728 --> 00:02:07.816
-	What did GeT_RiGhT tell you?

00:02:08.314 --> 00:02:09.575
-	It doesn’t matter.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.647
Let’s say his story differed completely from the official one.

00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:15.834
So I don’t know the truth.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.847
It’s a pity they couldn’t come.

00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:20.651
-	Beer of your fan is the most delicious.

00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:21.665
-	I won’t film you.

00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:24.697
-	Kvass tastes good.

00:02:24.981 --> 00:02:27.196
(Kvas is non-alcoholic traditional Ukrainian drink)

00:02:27.196 --> 00:02:28.882
-	Kvass is really tasty.

00:02:29.388 --> 00:02:30.264
-	Ceh9 didn’t try.

00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:35.127
-	Do you drink kvass?

00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:36.798
-	It’s tasty.
