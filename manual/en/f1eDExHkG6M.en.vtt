00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:07.640
Robin seems to be in control at first and
then she became a bit camera shy which seems

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.540
to lead her a way from true identification
and categorization.(Step by step, verbal direction

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:26.510
is either too short or it shot right by me.)
I notice a lack of true presentation via verbalization.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.890
There was no way for me to get a real enthusiasm
for the true craft which should lead to lack

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:50.300
of in depth creativity. Great camera presents.
I must admit, there are too many silent areas

00:00:50.300 --> 00:01:16.390
in the direction flow making the video a bit
less attractive; harder to follow. Its simply

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:37.770
to mild of a project instruction if preformed
without the depth needed to keep me involved.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:52.869
And is this what they call embroidering because
I think she identified the craft once in the

00:01:52.869 --> 00:02:04.770
hold segment. Snowflakes, is a great idea
that could be give a bit more intro and presentation

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.200
and less physical demonstration.
