00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.600
Hello!

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.700
This is Cynthia Sue Larson with RealityShifters.com
and today I'm here to talk to you about living

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.680
in parallel quantum worlds.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.779
The idea for today's discussion came to me
when I was reading a recent issue from...

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.790
well, actually it's from last year, from Scientific
American.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:28.160
This one's all about as it says, "Living in
a Quantum World: Small-Scale Physics has a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.090
Spooky Power Over the World at Large."

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.460
What really thrilled me about finding this
particular magazine with this particular topic...

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.429
and you can find this online... is that basically,
it's saying something that I haven't really

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.019
seen in mainstream scientific publications
until now.

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:52.659
And that is that a lot of the quantum... the
characteristic behavior of quantum particles...

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.569
that we normally expect to see in the realm
of the very, very small is now being observed

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:02.410
in things like plants, animals, and salt crystals.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:10.119
And these recent pieces of scientific experimental
evidence of what we would normally call "quantum

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.659
entanglement" -- and we still call it that
for want of a better term -- is happening

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:22.820
at larger and larger scales of entities...
whether it's a plant, an animal, or a salt

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.820
crystal.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.649
The thing that's so exciting to me about that
is that we're starting to get a glimpse of

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.640
the concept that a lot of the things we'd
expect to see such as quantum entanglement,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.579
quantum teleportation, and quantum entanglement...

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.420
I mentioned the entanglement already.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.630
But there's the teleportation, the tunneling,
and the entanglement.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.330
These sorts of things that you see on the
very, very small scale... normally you wouldn't

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.520
expect to see at the large scale.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.860
However probabilistically we should expect
to see it, and we actually indeed are.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.420
So that's a little bit of the science behind
all of this.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.270
There's something else exciting about this
entire topic for me, and that is that I love

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.340
to hear the experiential side of it as well.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.441
And this month I got the chance to read a
lovely book called, "Traveling to Parallel

00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:17.441
Universes."

00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:23.110
This book is written by Trish LeSage, and
this is a picture of her on the back of the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.110
book.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.690
This is an extraordinary book because it's
the first one that I've really seen talking

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.351
from a firsthand account about the sorts of
things that I often call reality shifts, from

00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:42.820
the perspective of a person who actually recognizes
that she is traveling between parallel realities--parallel

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.820
universes.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.280
I'm just going to read a short excerpt from
her fantastic book.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.881
And here she says,
"It can become a bit confusing, however, when

00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:55.040
the differences and the details are more apparent
from one universe to another.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.010
For example, restaurants that were closed
in one universe are open in another."

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.430
Trish also notices lots of differences in
the animals--the wild animals--that she experiences

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.010
on a regular basis in her life.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.870
Sometimes in one universe they're there; in
another, they're gone.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.850
Sometimes personalities change of both people
and animals.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.630
So I highly recommend this book for anyone
interested in what I call "reality shifts"

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.620
but also basically evidence of traveling to
parallel universes.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.861
And of course, another book that I always
would recommend if you're interested in this

00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:34.400
subject, "Reality Shifts: When Consciousness
Changes the Physical World."

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.540
And I also write about what it feels like
to, as I call it, live with feet in both worlds.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.420
And here, toward the end of the book I'm writing,
"Living with the waking dream experience of

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.250
reality shifting around me feels a lot like
walking with my feet in two or more worlds.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.040
Since I've acknowledged reality shifts, my
life has continued to be much the same in

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.060
most respects.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.730
I still sleep at night, and go about my regular
daily activities.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.320
I still need the simple, basic necessities
I always did.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.850
And I still occasionally feel burning desires
to see an exhilarating movie, go for long

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.240
walks, read good books, or eat delicious meals."

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.470
I then go on to say, "By welcoming a waking
dream state of consciousness, I allow for

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.500
the unexpected to occur.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.960
Even ordinary things, like cooking dinner,
have a different feeling for me.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.470
Sometimes, I've opened my refrigerator to
get something, shut the door, opened it again

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.460
a few minutes later, and found a jar had vanished
and reappeared in that short space of time."

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.340
And that really gives you a sense of how I
feel about reality shifts and traveling between

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.710
parallel universes.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.440
But I'd like you to start thinking about it
as well, and recognizing that this is the

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.040
sort of thing that could be happening all
the time.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.930
We're getting a lot more of a hint from current
studies in science, such as the ones I mentioned

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:06.280
earlier this year about entangled diamonds
and altruistic rats, and when you consider

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.120
that we're getting all of these indicators
that are showing us, "This is what it might

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.020
look like when you do travel between parallel
universes.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.220
You might not notice that the whole universe
is different... you might just see one or

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.400
two small things that are different, and you
can sometimes go back and forth between them."

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.260
So with all of that in mind, I'd like to ask
my favorite question for you to keep in mind

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.980
as well, and that is, "How good can it get
when you travel between parallel realities?"

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.030
So until next time, this is Cynthia Sue Larson
