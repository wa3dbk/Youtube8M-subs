00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Trout is easy to fillet because it has a backbone and a few small bones only along one-third of its length. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
To remove the fillets, insert your knife just below the backbone. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Using a large sharp knife, slide the knife between the backbone and the flesh at the head level. The flat of the blade presses on the row of bones.   

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Open the back cutting from the head to the tail – the secret is to hold the knife parallel to your work surface so that it doesn’t cut into the flesh.  

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Detach the fillet. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You see that the bones are exposed, but you shouldn’t try to remove them right away. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Turn the trout over to remove the other fillet using the same technique. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Since the trout has less solidity, begin in the middle and cut on both sides, remembering to keep your knife parallel to the work surface, i.e., horizontal. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Remove the fillet.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You can leave the fillets as they are or trim off the excess fat, which is the white part under the belly. 
A little tip: Never use the head and backbone of trout to make fish stock – it’s a fatty fish that can add an unpleasant burnt fat taste.  

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.266
