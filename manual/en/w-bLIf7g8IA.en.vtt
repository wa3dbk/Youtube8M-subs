Mondays: no matter where you are in the world, Monday's tend to suck,

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.880
So we decided to create Music Mondays to uplift our spirits

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.120
Every week we're going to review a kpop music video.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.440
Some will be new, some will be old, but all will be awesome.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:24.810
[music]

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.260
This week's Music Monday is the "Sassy Girl" Edition 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.810
With Miss A's "Bad Girl, Good Girl"

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.450
[yes, we know.  Martina messed up.  Oops!]

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.290
[music]

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.630
My favorite part of the song is definitely the flexibility.  Oh yeah!

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.230
Simon!  Simon look at me!  Are you ready?  Watch!

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.420
Oh wow!  Oh.  That's, that's wonderful,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.170
honey,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.690
Oh look, oh my god!  You're so sexy and flexible!  It's great.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.480
My favorite part of the music video is definitely Jia's pink hair. 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.570
Hahahahahahaha!  Pink hair!

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.100
Not that I like pink

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:20.780
[music for Martina to dance to with all her pink stuff]

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.620
My favorite dance move of the video is definitely the flexibility!

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.050
Oh yeah...What!  Ahhh!

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.920
I'm sorry love!  Ahh!  Don't be mad at me!

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.380
Anyways...the real dance move of the song is definitely the sassy part.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.800
I know the kind of girl you are.  Why don't you go in the kitchen

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.650
and make me a sandwich!

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.270
You don't know me!  You don't know me!

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.940
So shut up boy!  So shut up boy before I cut you!  Ahhh!

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.890
Maybe that was a little bit too sassy, but anyways,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.880
it's definitely the coolest part of the song.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.920
[music]

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.640
Now for the English meter.  We've created a complex device using

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.370
special complicated algorithms to calculate the use of English in the song

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.130
5 being "Totally Makes Sense"

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.970
and 1 being "I don't get it?!"

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.100
So Miss A's "Bad Girl Good Girl" gets a....

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.350
5 out of 5!

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.490
So definitely five points out of five.  The context is perfect

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.690
and the grammar is perfect.  But, we did have a baffling moment with Miss A.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.320
A little while ago Simon and I went to Noraebang and we sang it

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.900
and on the screen they said "Shut Off boy"

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.230
instead of "Shut Up Boy."  I can really only think of one situation

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.200
in which "Shut Off" would work properly.  

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.760
"So Shut Off Boy!"  [sound of Robot Simon powering down]

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.330
Cuz you need to go in for repairs you great robot you!  

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.360
Come on!  Let's take you for repairs.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.350
Yeah...yeah that makes sense.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.640
[music]

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.780
So that ends the Sassy Edition of Music Monday's.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.590
We're ending up this week with a contest.  Who do you think is sassier?

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.910
Miss A's "Good Girl, Bad Girl" or T-ara's "I Go Crazy Because of You"

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.710
Leave us a comment below and we'll announce the winner next week.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.710
