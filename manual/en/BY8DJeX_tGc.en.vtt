00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.010
In this video, I want to provide
an overview of neuron function,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.242
which I think of sort of
like how a gun functions.

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:09.700
And we'll go into
a lot more detail

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.740
on how a neuron functions
in later videos.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.490
But in this video.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.120
I just want to give a
bird's eye overview of it.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.910
The function of neurons
is to process and transmit

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.010
information.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.030
Without input, most neurons
have a stable electrical charge

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.250
difference across
their cell membrane,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.770
where it's more negative
inside the cell membrane

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.170
and more positive outside
the cell membrane.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.250
And we call this the resting
membrane potential or just

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.860
resting potential for short.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.740
And this resting
potential is really

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.110
how the neuron is
going to be able to be

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.570
excitable and respond to input.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.040
And I think of this
as similar to loading

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.010
a gun by putting a bullet in it.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.190
Neurons receive excitatory
or inhibitory input

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.090
from other cells or
from physical stimuli

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.530
like odorant
molecules in the nose.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.050
Input information usually
comes in through the dendrites.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.640
Although less often, it'll
come in through the soma

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.740
or the axon.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.550
The information from the
inputs is transmitted

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.290
through dendrites or
the soma to the axon

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.000
with membrane potential changes
called graded potentials.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.120
These graded
potentials are changes

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.980
to the membrane potential away
from the resting potential,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.160
which are small in size
and brief in duration,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.680
and which travel
fairly short distances.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.070
The size and the duration
of a graded potential

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.070
is proportional to the size
and the duration of the input.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.670
Summation, or an adding
together of all the excitatory

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.710
and inhibitory graded
potentials at any moment in time

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.490
occurs at the trigger zone,
the axon initial segment

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.130
right here.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.020
This summation of
graded potentials

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.440
is the way neurons process
information from their inputs.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.250
If the membrane potential
at the trigger zone

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.940
crosses a value called
the threshold potential,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.500
information will then
be fired down the axon.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.380
So I like to think of
this process of summation

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.620
of the excitatory and
inhibitory graded potentials

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.910
at the trigger zone as analogous
to the trigger of a gun.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.361
In fact, that's why it's
called the trigger zone.

00:02:19.361 --> 00:02:22.200
I think of the graded
potentials as being

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.580
like the finger on the
gun, that may be squeezing

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.690
a little harder or relaxing.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.820
But once the trigger of
the gun is pulled back

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.280
past a certain
threshold distance,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.610
a bullet will be fired
down the barrel of the gun,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.860
just like if the membrane
potential of the trigger zone

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.170
crosses a threshold
value, information

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.800
will be fired down the axon.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.590
The way information
is fired down

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.480
the axon is with a
different kind of change

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.040
to the membrane potential
called an action potential.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.980
An action potential is usually
large in size and brief

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.930
in duration.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.220
But it's usually conducted
the entire length of the axon,

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.790
no matter how long it
is, so that it can travel

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.440
a very long distance,
just like a bullet usually

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.207
has no trouble making it
down the barrel of the gun.

00:03:06.207 --> 00:03:08.540
And like a bullet traveling
through the barrel of a gun,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.440
action potentials tend to
travel very quickly down

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.770
the length of the axon.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.510
Action potentials are different
than graded potentials

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.550
because they're usually
the same size and duration

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.480
for any particular
neuron, as opposed

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.250
to the graded potentials,
whose size and duration

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.940
depends on the size and
the duration of the inputs.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.860
Action potentials are
conducted faster along

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.160
larger axons, axons
with a larger diameter,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.580
and along axons that have
a myelin sheath, that I've

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.820
drawn in yellow here.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.770
When an action potential
reaches the axon terminals

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.690
at the end of the
axon, information

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.480
will then cross,
usually a small gap,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.250
to the target cell
of the neuron.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.960
And the way this happens
for most synapses

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.990
where an axon terminal makes
contact with the target cell

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.690
is by release of molecules
called neurotransmitters

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.540
that bind to receptors
on the target cell

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.370
and which may
change its behavior.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.820
Neurotransmitter is then
removed from the synapse.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.300
So it's reset to transmit
more information.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.490
And I think of this part as
similar to the bullet leaving

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.560
the gun, to hit the target.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.890
The input information
that was converted

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.380
into the size and the
duration of graded potentials

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.709
is then converted into the
temporal pattern of firing

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.950
of action potentials
down the axon.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.720
And this information
is then converted

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.050
to the amount and the temporal
pattern of neurotransmitter

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.590
release at the synapse.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.800
These steps are how neurons
transmit information,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.490
often over long distances.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.510
This is the general way that
neurons usually function.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.200
But there are multiple
functional types of neurons.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.330
So let's take a look
at some of those.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.480
Here I've drawn a few
different neurons,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.820
with their somas in red,
their axons in green,

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.310
and their dendrites in blue.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.710
And I've drawn a
line here to separate

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.190
between the central nervous
system on this side--

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.900
so I'll just write
CNS for short--

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.230
and the peripheral nervous
system on this side--

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.364
so I'll just write
PNS for short.

00:05:02.364 --> 00:05:03.780
And there's some
different ways we

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.400
can categorize functional
types of neurons.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.110
The first way is the
direction of information flow

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.230
between the CNS and the PNS.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.110
If a neuron like this
pseudounipolar neuron

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.980
right here brings information
from the periphery

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.480
in toward the central
nervous system,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.320
we call that an afferent neuron.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.070
Afferent, meaning it's
bringing information

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.020
into the central nervous system.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.940
We can also call
this type of neuron

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.970
a sensory neuron
because the information

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.520
it's bringing into the
central nervous system

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.870
involves information
about a stimulus.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.610
And a stimulus is
anything that can

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.970
be sensed in the internal or
external environment, which

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.950
is to say anything
inside the body

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.680
or anything outside the body.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.140
These neurons are
carrying information away

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.930
from the central nervous
system out into the periphery.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.200
So instead of calling
them afferent neurons,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.065
we call them efferent neurons.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.320
And there are two main
kinds of efferent neurons.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.600
The first we call motor neurons.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.830
Motor, which means movement.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.640
These are efferent neurons
that control skeletal muscle,

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.500
the main type of
muscle that's attached

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.095
to our skeleton,
that moves us around.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.080
These motor neurons are also
called somatomotor neurons

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.470
or neurons of the
somatic nervous system.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.120
The other type of
the efferent neurons

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.960
are called autonomic neurons.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.440
And these neurons
control smooth muscle,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.500
like the muscle around
our blood vessels;

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:07.890
cardiac muscle, the muscle of
our heart; and gland cells,

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.285
the cells of our glands
that secrete hormones

00:07:10.285 --> 00:07:11.160
into the bloodstream.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.290
These autonomic neurons are
also called visceromotor neurons

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.800
or neurons of the
autonomic nervous system.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.730
Most neurons of the
central nervous system

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.990
aren't any of these types
of neurons, however.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.940
They're like this
neuron, in that they

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.980
connect other neurons together.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.060
So these are called
interneurons,

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.485
neurons between neurons.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.150
And there are many interneurons
in the central nervous system,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.700
forming very complex pathways
for information to travel.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.450
So that while an
individual neuron

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.870
is processing and
transmitting information,

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.070
these complex
networks of neurons

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.590
in the central
nervous system are

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.810
doing even more
complex processing

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.180
and transmitting of information.
