00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:14.180
With age, skin loses its elasticity and firmness, leaving visible fine lines, wrinkles and sagging skin.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.120
At DSM we have developed new ways to counteract those visible signs of ageing.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.220
Let's dive into the skin's structure to look at some of the key mechanisms that influence skin ageing.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:39.060
Beneath the epidermis, the dermal layer of the skin contains a complex matrix of proteins, proteoglycans, and polysaccharides that make up the so-called extra-cellular matrix.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:47.080
Fibroblasts, which are the main cells in the dermal layer, produce major building blocks of the extra-cellular matrix, such as collagens,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.100
hyaluronan and other components that play an important role in the skin’s overall structural integrity.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:03.240
As we get older - and particularly if the skin is exposed to environmental factors such as UV light - the levels of these supportive matrix molecules in the skin decreases.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.220
The result? The surface of the skin appears more wrinkled and aged.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.180
Let’s move back into the skin to see how these supportive molecules are made.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:22.150
TGF-β is an important endogenous skin molecule due to its key role in the synthesis of collagen and other matrix components.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.230
TGF-β - seen here in its latent state - prompts fibroblasts to make these structural elements.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.210
A protein called Thrombospondin-1 which also occurs naturally in the skin, activates TGF-β. 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.130
Once activated, TGF-β can bind to TGF-β receptors on the surface of fibroblasts.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.220
Over time the activity of Thrombospondin-1 in the skin is reduced.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:59.120
This in turn means that fewer active TGF-β molecules are present, and that fibroblasts in the skin produce less collagen and other matrix components, leading to wrinkle formation.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:11.170
At DSM we have found that mimicking natural Thrombospondin-1 activity within skin is a new and promising strategy for the next generation of powerful anti-ageing solutions.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:20.050
DSM’s SYN®-COLL was the first synthetic latent TGF-β activator introduced to the cosmetic industry. 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:30.210
The structure of SYN®-COLL resembles the active region of Thrombospondin-1, meaning that SYN-COLL can mimic the larger protein’s action on latent TGF-β.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.140
Let’s see how SYN®-COLL can boost TGF-β activity, even when Thrombospondin-1 levels are low.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.050
Thanks to its structure, SYN®-COLL helps to activate latent TGF-β.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.040
With increased levels of active TGF-β now present, the fibroblasts can be stimulated to produce matrix components.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.150
This innovative mechanism made SYN®-COLL the first TGF-β booster on the market.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.080
SYN®-COLL stimulates collagen production leaving the skin looking visibly smoother and younger.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:12.040
This patented technology has enabled DSM to develop more powerful molecules in the anti-ageing area for visible, targeted results.
