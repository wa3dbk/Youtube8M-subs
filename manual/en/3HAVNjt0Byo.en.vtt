00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:00.705
And Nuna6...

00:00:01.132 --> 00:00:02.985
She is so beautiful.
Have you seen her?

00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:26.488
Today we've arrived at the start
of the World Solar Challenge.

00:00:26.987 --> 00:00:30.894
In a few moments we're going
to start driving 3000 kilometers.

00:00:31.048 --> 00:00:34.152
Really exciting. 
Very fun.

00:00:34.713 --> 00:00:39.382
I'm now less nervous than
I had anticipated.

00:00:39.577 --> 00:00:41.811
I'm kind of relaxed,
kind of calm.

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:44.946
The quality of the team is super awesome.

00:00:46.207 --> 00:00:49.043
Right now it's mostly a question
of not making any mistakes.

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:55.035
If we don't make any mistakes we have 
a big chance of finishing first again.

00:00:55.302 --> 00:00:57.320
There are a few really serious teams. 

00:00:57.804 --> 00:01:00.393
Tokai is serious, Michigan is real serious.

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:05.350
There are a lot of good cars, and because 
the solar panel rules have been altered

00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:07.646
the cars will race much closer to eachother.

00:01:07.893 --> 00:01:10.992
Five times world champion Nuna rolls off the lot.

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:53.752
I'm happy. It's really exciting. A beautiful race.

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:57.546
We're right behind Tokai, who are over there.

00:01:57.844 --> 00:02:01.311
I'd say, right now,
we're at first place together with Tokai.
