00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.650
So we have determined by both observing and
by measurements, that the neck pitch angle

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:15.140
on this particular instrument could be improved.
So what are we going to do in order to correct

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:32.300
that? We're going to have to remove the strings
and reset the neck. So let's loosen the strings

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:41.220
and take them off so that we have access to
that neck.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.670
And, as soon as I get all the strings finished,
we'll be right back with the next part of

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:59.280
the process of taking the neck off, resetting
the angle with the use of a shim and getting

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:11.360
it set correctly for proper intonation and
proper set up. Okay. Now we have our strings

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.860
removed from the fret board or from the head
stock. We're just going to roll them out of

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.050
the way for the time being. And now we can
flip our instrument over and we're going to

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:38.439
remove, using our handy dandy screwdriver,
our neck bolts that hold the neck in position

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:50.189
on the instrument. You don't want to take
this off when the string pressure is on because,

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.180
if we do, that neck will just rip out of there
and cause all kinds of problems. Now we know

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.790
that the angle is sitting, tilting too much
this way. So in order to correct the issue,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.870
we are going to want to shim it so that there's
something in this position that can tilt that

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:21.290
neck back just a tiny little bit. We knew
from our measurements that we were approximately

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:31.730
four hundredths of an inch off. So I'm going
to want to put something in there that's approximately

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:43.699
two to three hundredths of inch thickness
that we do not have right now. The other option

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:52.540
is we could shave the back of the neck, but
that's more radical and I'd rather just use

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.579
shims because we can always make adjustments
with shims without modifying the original

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:58.589
instrument.
