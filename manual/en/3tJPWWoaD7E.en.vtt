OLIVIA BLEITZ: Welcome to SBCU.

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:08.810
Today we're going to
talk about a bike that

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.930
has a rode heart and
a city soul, the Vita.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.520
It's a perfect bike for a
female fitness rider, someone

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.070
that wants the speed and
efficiency of a road bike,

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.870
but the confidence and the
stability of a flat bar.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.630
It's a perfect blend
of true road speed

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.474
and the ultimate in versatility.

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:26.390
Today, we're going to
talk about three things.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.070
We're going to talk about what
gives it its road heart, how

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.011
we nurture its city soul, and
all those small details that

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:33.635
make it the ultimate
versatile package.

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:36.230
 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.230
We're going to start off
by discussing the three

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.190
pieces that give
Vita its road heart.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.180
The lightweight frame,
the fitness geometry,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.930
and some extra
features to make it

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.340
really efficient on the road.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.460
Starting with the
light weight frame.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.780
You'll see three options
in the Vita frame.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.180
We have A1 aluminum, E5,
and multiple carbon options.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.520
And on select models
you'll see our Zertz,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.345
which help damp high-frequency
road vibration as they come up

00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:02.470
through the wheels from
the ground to really create

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.260
a soft comfortable ride.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.850
The next piece is
our fitness geometry.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.420
And this all comes back to what
we know that the rider needs.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.000
And we know that
the Vita is going

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.310
to be the best fitting
fitness bike out of the box,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.650
while still having
all the great features

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.100
that you would expect out of
a Specialized women's bike.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.220
Pieces like low standover,
low stack, and a short reach.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.170
So we can fit the
widest range of riders

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.490
regardless of your
fitness goals.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.630
And the final piece
of that road heart

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.210
are 700c wheels on
all models as well as

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.550
road gearing that is
carefully selected

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.415
to create the best
experience for the rider.

00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:40.642
 

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:42.100
One of the features
that makes Vita

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.290
such a great urban commuter,
are its fender and rack mounts.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.810
And also, clearance in the
frame to run that higher volume

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.499
tire in addition to a fender.

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.790
But, of course, it's all on
that same great lightweight

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.930
platform, so when you
get where you're going,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.010
you can easily scoop
the bike up and run it

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.070
up a flight of stairs.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.280
And the final piece of that
city soul are the disc brakes.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.880
So we have select
models with disc breaks.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.630
So you're going to
have optimum stopping

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.963
power, no matter the conditions.

00:02:05.963 --> 00:02:09.320
 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.950
Let's talk about some of my
favorite features on the Vita.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.530
First, the smaller
diameter women's grips

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.290
to help with smaller hands
being more comfortable,

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.430
so your hands aren't falling
asleep or going numb.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.240
Women's body geometry
saddle to help

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.840
with blood flow and comfort.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.260
We put a lot of
time and research

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.920
into our saddles to make sure
that it provides the best

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.100
experience.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.830
We've size-specific
cranks and narrower bars

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.200
to ensure the best fitting
bike right out of the box.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200
So, that is the Vita,
road heart, city soul.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.930
Whether you're hitting the
open road, you're exercising,

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.655
you're commuting, it is the
ideal lightweight, fitness bike

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:44.680
or urban machine.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.034
