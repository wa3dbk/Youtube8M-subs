"Honest reviews and advice".

00:00:04.884 --> 00:00:09.003
Hold tight and welcome to
today's plumberparts.co.uk video.

00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:11.681
Today I'm gonna tell you
how to fit and instal

00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:13.735
a basin on a pedestal.

00:00:13.735 --> 00:00:15.671
This can be quite difficult to do.

00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:18.383
But if you go about it in the
right way, it should be fine.

00:00:18.383 --> 00:00:20.270
You may wonder why I'm wearing glasses,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.142
sunglasses and look
absolutely amazingly cool.

00:00:23.142 --> 00:00:24.555
Well the honest truth is

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:27.401
that I'm absolutely terrified by this job.

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:29.642
If I tell ya, you can't tell anyone else.

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:32.928
But these tiles here are the hardest tiles

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:35.554
I've ever drilled in my whole life.

00:00:35.554 --> 00:00:37.618
So I'm gonna try and time-lapse

00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:39.151
that particular part of the job.

00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:41.317
Because you don't wanna see me crying,

00:00:41.317 --> 00:00:43.285
rolling around on the floor on my back

00:00:43.285 --> 00:00:44.545
and smacking my belly

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:46.457
and basically going completely crazy

00:00:46.457 --> 00:00:47.899
because it's so hard to do.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.317
So anyway, let's get on with this job

00:00:49.317 --> 00:00:50.807
and I hope it all goes well.

00:00:50.807 --> 00:00:53.672
(inhaling, exhaling)

00:00:53.672 --> 00:00:54.505
Let's go.

00:00:54.505 --> 00:00:58.347
So firstly we've actually
got the waster already.

00:00:58.347 --> 00:00:59.668
We've got the tap in and everything.

00:00:59.668 --> 00:01:01.868
We've also got the pop-up
waster already there.

00:01:01.868 --> 00:01:03.262
I always try to put that in first

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:05.057
because once the pedestal is in the way,

00:01:05.057 --> 00:01:06.137
and you've actually fitted here,

00:01:06.137 --> 00:01:08.008
it's a nightmare to get all this stuff in.

00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:10.274
So I recommend you have
all that installed.

00:01:10.274 --> 00:01:13.273
Now, the pedestal actually
sits in this groove there.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.011
Get a tape measure from
the back of the basin

00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:16.658
to the front here and you'll know roughly

00:01:16.658 --> 00:01:18.054
where to seat your pedestal.

00:01:18.054 --> 00:01:19.593
Because really to do this properly

00:01:19.593 --> 00:01:22.275
you need to mock up
the whole installation,

00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:23.108
get a level,

00:01:23.108 --> 00:01:24.639
get your two holes drilled,

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.491
and go from there.

00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:28.297
And then you have to take
it all back down again,

00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:30.551
do your drilling, everything like that

00:01:30.551 --> 00:01:31.676
and put it all back together,

00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:33.249
and get your pipes up where you need them.

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.362
So we'll do that now and let's hope

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:37.662
that it all goes bonkerly well.

00:01:37.662 --> 00:01:39.579
That's roughly 33.5, 34

00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:42.395
away from the wall.

00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:44.223
Just come up here and have a look there.

00:01:44.223 --> 00:01:45.623
And we get our centre.

00:01:45.623 --> 00:01:47.823
So measure across...

00:01:47.823 --> 00:01:49.763
Where you want it to be, in the centre.

00:01:49.763 --> 00:01:51.967
That's 34 inches.

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:53.342
That's like 17,

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:54.350
just there.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.183
Lovely.

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:57.880
Then use the spirit level

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.825
and score all the way down the wall.

00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:01.007
And then draw a line out

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:03.535
at a perpendicular angle onto the floor.

00:02:03.535 --> 00:02:05.626
Also line up, make sure
you're about square

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:06.598
where you wanna be.

00:02:06.598 --> 00:02:08.099
And draw yourself a line out here

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.238
so you know roughly the centre
of your pedestal's gotta be.

00:02:11.238 --> 00:02:14.016
So now we pop this pedestal on the centre.

00:02:14.016 --> 00:02:15.989
On the centre line just there.

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.406
And measure out our distance.

00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:29.640
Once we got that roughly
in the right position

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.580
we can offer up our basin onto there,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.660
make sure that's level

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.827
and then get our two holes
marked for drilling there.

00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:39.227
Perfect.

00:02:39.227 --> 00:02:40.730
So now we pop our level on here

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.986
and make sure it's all nice and level,

00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:43.263
the bubble's in the middle,

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:45.694
and then we can go underneath
to mark the two holes.

00:02:45.694 --> 00:02:47.673
They don't really fix it to the wall

00:02:47.673 --> 00:02:48.759
but they do help

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:50.194
because obviously most of the weight

00:02:50.194 --> 00:02:52.341
is actually on the pedestal foot itself.

00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:54.129
Let's go in there and do that now.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.662
Right so the hole we're
looking for is just here.

00:02:56.662 --> 00:02:58.345
Let's just get in there

00:02:58.345 --> 00:02:59.512
and mark that.

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:05.502
Once you've done that on both sides

00:03:05.502 --> 00:03:08.195
I recommend you also put
the waste on quickly now.

00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:09.699
And also measure the height

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:11.563
you want your waste pipe to be

00:03:11.563 --> 00:03:13.032
if it's not already there.

00:03:13.032 --> 00:03:13.968
Once you've done that,

00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:15.585
you can remove the basin and the pedestal

00:03:15.585 --> 00:03:18.493
and drill a holes through
the brutally hard tiles.

00:03:18.493 --> 00:03:19.652
Right then here we go.

00:03:19.652 --> 00:03:21.412
A few recommendations when
you're actually cutting tiles.

00:03:21.412 --> 00:03:23.410
Use a nice decent tile cutter.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.724
It's a brand new one from Bosch.

00:03:24.724 --> 00:03:26.244
And make sure you keep it wet.

00:03:26.244 --> 00:03:28.046
And try not to run the drill too quickly.

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:30.566
That's basically a heat does these tips in

00:03:30.566 --> 00:03:32.701
so keep em cool and always have

00:03:32.701 --> 00:03:33.951
a little jug of water next to you.

00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:36.995
You can dip it in every
some five or 10 seconds.

00:03:36.995 --> 00:03:37.874
Here we go.

00:03:37.874 --> 00:03:40.124
(drilling)

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.209
(mumbling)

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.042
Come on.

00:03:59.983 --> 00:04:01.134
Just through here.

00:04:01.134 --> 00:04:03.142
You can do it.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.759
You can do it.

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:05.592
Come on.

00:04:06.598 --> 00:04:07.431
Please.

00:04:09.103 --> 00:04:09.936
Oh my God.

00:04:13.951 --> 00:04:14.784
Why.

00:04:15.712 --> 00:04:18.489
Why, why, why. (fake crying)

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.598
Yes!

00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:22.631
Yes, come on. (laughing)

00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:24.802
I've got to do that one more time.

00:04:24.802 --> 00:04:27.588
And also got to hang a shelf unit up there

00:04:27.588 --> 00:04:29.199
which is gonna be four of those holes

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.082
and a toilet roll holder over there

00:04:31.082 --> 00:04:34.198
which is gonna be another
two of those holes.

00:04:34.198 --> 00:04:36.125
(sighing) It's gonna be a long day.

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:37.330
Really long.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.274
And I hasten to add

00:04:38.274 --> 00:04:39.455
I'm not going to be filming any of that.

00:04:39.455 --> 00:04:40.724
Here we go anyway for the next part.

00:04:40.724 --> 00:04:42.382
Blah.

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:44.933
Alright so we got our holes drilled.

00:04:44.933 --> 00:04:47.322
Our pedestal back where we need it.

00:04:47.322 --> 00:04:49.822
And then pop our basin on top.

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:57.096
Now line up your basin with your holes.

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:58.429
But before you fully screw it in

00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:00.333
it wouldn't hurt to just
get a bit of silicone

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.065
and just run that along the back of basin

00:05:02.065 --> 00:05:04.894
to add an extra super fixing to that wall.

00:05:04.894 --> 00:05:06.757
So do that now then get your hose on up

00:05:06.757 --> 00:05:08.164
and screw some screws in.

00:05:08.164 --> 00:05:08.997
Get some tap washers,

00:05:08.997 --> 00:05:10.987
pop them on your screws just down here

00:05:10.987 --> 00:05:13.622
and then run them on and
it won't damage your basin.

00:05:13.622 --> 00:05:15.699
(drilling)

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.802
So this time do the same the other side.

00:05:17.802 --> 00:05:19.725
We've pushed it fully back in.

00:05:19.725 --> 00:05:23.725
Just run a blog of bit
silicone across the back.

00:05:31.192 --> 00:05:32.620
Once you've got those two screws in

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.989
now we do a little bit of silicone in

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:36.411
around the top here and
around bottom there.

00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:38.615
A lot of pedestals will
have two screw holes

00:05:38.615 --> 00:05:41.060
just down the sides here and here

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.753
if you actually fix it to the floor.

00:05:42.753 --> 00:05:43.807
This one doesn't have that

00:05:43.807 --> 00:05:45.643
so we're just going to
silicone it around the bottom

00:05:45.643 --> 00:05:46.476
and around the top.

00:05:46.476 --> 00:05:47.989
That should hold it fine.

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:51.822
Let us get our silicone
up into this gap here.

00:05:55.817 --> 00:05:58.663
That will effectively act as a glue

00:05:58.663 --> 00:06:00.117
to hold that down.

00:06:00.117 --> 00:06:02.305
It's also quite decorative as well.

00:06:02.305 --> 00:06:03.481
That all the way around.

00:06:03.481 --> 00:06:05.360
Tomorrow that will be set so hard

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.532
you won't be able to move it.

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:08.845
Get yourself the trusty siliconeing tool

00:06:08.845 --> 00:06:12.178
and use that to make good your silicone.

00:06:15.386 --> 00:06:17.176
Any bits that you leave gaps or anything,

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:19.539
just fill them and re-go over them.

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.872
That's what I'm about to do.

00:06:26.494 --> 00:06:27.785
So then to finish off

00:06:27.785 --> 00:06:29.176
we just have to run our bead of silicone

00:06:29.176 --> 00:06:31.513
around the bottom here of the pedestal.

00:06:31.513 --> 00:06:32.680
And make good.

00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:47.132
Right, so there we go, all done.

00:06:47.132 --> 00:06:48.723
We've learnt how to measure up

00:06:48.723 --> 00:06:51.592
and instal our basin with a pedestal.

00:06:51.592 --> 00:06:52.906
If you think we've missed anything

00:06:52.906 --> 00:06:54.376
or you think we can do anything better

00:06:54.376 --> 00:06:55.872
let us know via the channel.

00:06:55.872 --> 00:06:58.631
Give us the ever loving amount of love

00:06:58.631 --> 00:07:00.023
that you all give us

00:07:00.023 --> 00:07:03.170
on Twitter, Facebook, the YouTube channel

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.684
and as ever subscribe.
