00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.720
Greeting's all you youtube user's &amp; 
non-youtube user's

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.210
It's been maybe a three years when I
last time did GTA IV

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.579
video

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:16.119
and this time it's not a secret. It's a glitch

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.340
and it's a not just any kindly glitch, it's a
shotgun glitch.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.039
and we all know that there are two types
of shotguns

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.349
there are pump-action shotgun

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.439
and there are automatic shotgun.
What i have

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:30.610
I have

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.810
I am carrying

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.230
a pump action shotgun with me

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.700
and a it's a glitch about this shotgun

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.230
now we all know

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.560
how this shotgun shoot's, right?

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.849
Let's say that

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:49.800
the pump action shotgun is the only gun you
have left.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.400
and as we know it shoot's a bit errr. slo...

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.989
it's not so

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.959
fast to kill enemies. Well

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:02.500
i found this woman and well you see it's too slow

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.890
it maybe take's

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.330
well it's it's too slow or for
example if i shoot this car it will take too

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.620
long for

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.240
it to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.700
explode

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.409
but i'm not going to shoot it now because
I wont get another car

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.490
well what the heck now

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.430
well you know

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.980
well you know it takes it's, it's too slow

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.600
so that's why

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.350
I'm going to show you how exactly it's going to. Hm!

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.570
How exactly the glitch work's, alright!

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.549
and the way how the glitch works
it's it's pretty simple firstly, you

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.520
need to aim

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.890
and aiming works in playstation 3 work's by pressing the L2 button

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.499
and the next thing is you needed

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:51.520
is the press the R2 button to shoot, but

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.770
the important thing is that, each time
when you have shot

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.809
you need to crouch and then go up-down-up

00:01:58.809 --> 00:02:05.020
a little demonstrate will be nice

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.150
Aaaeeerrrr... OK I a bit

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.899
sorry I it was a.. 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.930
let's say that it was a demonstration

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.529
uh... okay so it's very simple actually

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:20.729
just

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:25.039
eeuurr.. but it's very important that you
won't do it too quickly

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.999
Let me show to you a bit

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.969
ok it's a bit ridiculous because you sure don't see anything

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:38.969
but you know that what i'm shooting here
so..

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:42.389
a'wright, do you get it?

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:47.719
and the most fun thing about this
glitch is that it also work's in

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.959
multiplayer

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.810
and as I was talking about the automatic
shotgun well the glitch in the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.619
automatic shotguns its works at

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.970
different way. Actually it doesn't
work at all

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.290
well we all know that the automatic shotgun shoot's automatically

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.259
like that

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:11.469
but with the glitch it looks
ridiculous so it's..

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:16.039
it works but it's bit ridiculous
because that glitch is

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:20.749
working pretty much only working in uh... with the pump action shotgun

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:24.199
now if my friend to remember's how to do
the glitch

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:28.599
i will be appreciated if you would show
how it look's like

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.169
to the other players

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:38.429
please shoot something, but not me with the shotgun glitch that I haav...

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:39.899
You forgot to

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:41.370
crouch

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.119
You remember?

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:44.690
remember, the, the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.450
The pump-action glitch that I have showed you.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.540
Dont aim me

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.449
You remember you need to

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.489
shoot, crouch, shoot, crouch. You know?

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.599
No.. you don't remember. Are you doing it?

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.679
please do it. =(

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:09.059
You see it look's like that

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:13.469
i'm not sure did he do it right, but it pretty much look's like that

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.590
so that the other players. really
don't...

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.289
they're just what the fuck is that other..
What the fuck is that other player

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.899
doing.

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:25.960
*mumble*

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.939
They dont know that you're doing the glitch it's so..

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:32.930
and the best part is that

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.180
*more mumbling*

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.759
can you jonttu please grab the automatic
shotgun

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:45.759
next to pick up the automatic shotgun next
to you

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.659
all right now aim me

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.599
don't come close to me

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:51.699
aim me

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.770
All right, all right good thank you

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.060
he shot me a bit now. I will shoot you

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.290
You see it take's bit sometime to kill him. He
got's the automatic shotgun, so he got

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.319
some time to kill, but we have some
distance so with the its

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:12.240
the pump action shotgun becomes
even more dangerous 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.220
it doesn't matter which distance

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.880
even with the glitch

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.040
I mean... I have killed 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.550
hundreds of players with this
