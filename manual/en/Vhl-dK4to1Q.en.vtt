Hello my friends and welcome
to another Tuesday of tutorial.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.990
I am Leonardo Pereznieto and today
we are going to draw Excalibur, the sword

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.000
in the rock.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.020
We begin by marking
on the paper the size

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.200
we want for the sword.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.000
Then we sketch its axis
and the one on the handle,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which form a cross.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.200
More or less like this.

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:37.929
We verify that we have the same distance

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.000
on both sides and we draw a circle on top.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.000
We do the handle and
the rest of the sword.

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.909
I´m sketching with pencil
so as to be able to erase

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.000
any mistakes.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.489
Good!

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.600
Now we start coloring.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.690
First with a white pencil
and using a square

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.000
to go straight, we draw
the edge on both sides.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.380
Here we can place a little symbol,
as color pencils usually have

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.610
an oil or wax base,
if afterwards we go over them

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.270
with a water base marker,
we still will be able to see

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.700
perfectly what we did with the pencil.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.130
Here we do a decorated
rectangle... for this I do

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.170
the lights with a white
pencil and the shadows

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.100
with a dark blue almost black.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.490
The source of light will be
at the top left, so that side will

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.200
be more illuminated.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.900
Excalibur is a sacred sword,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.789
symbol of power, force and pride.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.030
This sword of light will show
its conquering power over darkness.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.300
It appears as the truth which scares
away ignorance and selfishness,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.439
and brandished by our arm
will be able to extract

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.600
the true wisdom that we hold within each of us.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.019
With a brown marker we
give the base color to the handle

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.769
and with a very fine one,
a black, I did some stripes on it

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.200
and with a beige pencil,
we pull some lights.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.580
Very good!

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.000
I like it how it is looking!

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.019
By the way the list of materials is in the

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.870
information below the video.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.510
With a middle tone, brown
marker, we do the dark

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.000
reflections of the golden metal
and we complement it with a yellow.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.569
Over this with a light yellow
almost white, we give

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.000
the light reflections.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.739
Remember that the color
pencils draw well over

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.709
the markers, but the markers
don´t paint on the pencils,

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.110
therefore the right sequence is
obviously, to first put a base

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.400
with the markers and them
draw on them with the pencils.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.000
We can do the stone with
a couple of tones of gray.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.450
And here, we should do
the shadow of the sword

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.000
so it looks more realistic!

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.670
With a bar of white oil
pastel, which is greasy

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.000
we are able to get even
brightens sparkling reflections.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.379
Good!
We go over the stone again

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.100
so it looks more solid.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.760
Excellent!

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.700
We give it the last touches,
and it´s ready!

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.000
