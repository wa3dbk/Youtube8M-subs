Hey guys Liam here from Tekbloggers.com and
today I have a review of the NOW TV Box.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.030
(intro)

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.780
The NOW TV Box is a cheap smart TV box that
is designed to make your non-smart TV smart.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.510
It has a large selection of apps that allow
you to watch a variety of internet content

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.449
on your TV.

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.940
In the box, you get the NOW TV Box itself,
the NOW TV remote, a HDMI cable and power

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.060
cable. Setup was really simple. All you had
to do is connect to your WiFi network and

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.970
sign into your NOW TV account and you are
set.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.130
The interface of the NOW TV is very intuitive.
All of the buttons are large and you can easily

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.080
find what app you want to watch.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.401
In the Channel Store, you will find a wide
variety of channels to add. From Vimeo to

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:50.690
Revision 3, there is definitely something
to watch. You can also find BBC iPlayer and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.690
Demand 5, but ITV Player and 4OD aren't here
just yet.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.170
Video playback was smooth and the quality
looks great. The box outputs a maximum of

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.140
720p,
which is great for smaller TVs but if you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.520
have a large TV that may be a problem.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.570
With the NOW TV box, you can also access Sky
Movies and Sky Sports which is great for people

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.040
who don't want a Sky subscription. However,
it isn't cheap. To watch Sky movies, you have

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.690
to pay £8.99 a month for the first 3 months,
then £15 a month after that. A Sky Sports

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.460
day pass will set you back £9.99. Everything
else on the box is free so you can watch whatever

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.460
you like.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.590
The remote is pretty simple. The top row of
buttons is for navigating and the bottom set

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.000
is for when you are watching media. There
is also a dedicated button to get to your

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.560
Apps and the NOW TV screen.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.000
The NOW TV Box is a great addition to any
media center or TV. There is a large selection

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.240
of content to watch, and as it's all online,
more and more is added every single day. Being

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.820
able to access catch up services like iPlayer
on your TV is great and accessing Sky TV with

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.110
a Sky subscription will be handy for some
people. However with apps for major services

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.581
like Netflix and YouTube nowhere to be seen
you may want to wait until you purchase the

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:56.581
NOW TV Box.

00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:59.830
You can get the box for £9.99 via the link
in the video description.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.580
