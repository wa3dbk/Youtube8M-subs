[Music]

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.090
This is Hunting YouTube, which aims to show
the best hunting, shooting and fishing videos

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.680
that YouTube has to offer.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.969
First up, let's dwell on the CLA Game Fair
2013.

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.740
There are several films out on YouTube already.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.410
SRSPower got his out the day after he filmed
it.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.410
Good work.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.000
And it's nice to see his style developing.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.849
No longer the long intros with the view of
the dashboard.

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.000
Now it's short, snappy and there are three
of them, walking round the Game Fair and having

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a laugh.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Good telly.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.420
It was great to meet HuntersVermin at the
Game Fair.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.660
Here's his latest, Air Rifle Hunting, Rabbit
Hunt 35.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.769
He describes it as "Not a big bag after missing
a few but glad to get out a run with the rifle

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.090
all the same" making him the Bono of the world
of Hunting YouTube.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.570
Now, let's look forward, and the Glorious
Twelfth of August, the start of the gameshooting

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.129
season in the UK, is just around the corner.

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.350
This is a pretty film from BASCFilms about
the conservation and economic benefits of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.409
grouse-shooting.

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.879
Don't be put off by that description - it
has lots of lovely grouse-shooting in it,

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:04.879
too.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.799
On to fishing and Ron Sutherland hooks a salmon
and trout at the same time in the dusk on

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.950
the river Helmsdale.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.799
See how he gets on in this video.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.659
Last week, I put the words 'semi-naked woman
hunting' into the title of Hunting YouTube

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.840
and, guess what?

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.090
it got lots of views.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.500
So here's my chance to put 'scantily-clad
woman fishing' into the title.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.509
This is Babs Kijewski's channel promo film
and she is actually really good, although

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.509
in German.

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.899
Get it transcribed, dear, like we do so foreigners
can switch on the captions.

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.810
And not only are her fishing videos good but
she always looks amazing.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.860
Back to shooting and viewer DragonoftheEastblu
recommends TheSlowMoGuys shooting bullets

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.619
underwater at 27,000 frames per second.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.050
I have featured these guys before.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.671
They have a whole series devoted to shooting
household objects with an air pistol, and

00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:59.740
some fairly poor gun safety, but rack this
up to HD and play it on a big screen for stunning

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.740
effect.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.750
Now here's a character.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.420
Big Squirrel Hunter is a Canadian called Nevis
Walker who heads out into the tundra after

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.569
squirrels in a manner which makes you respect
these little animals anew.

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.780
In Snowy Head Shot, Nevis finally shoots one
out of an oak tree.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.370
One of the best-made hunting shows on YouTube,
Truth About Hunting, comes to you from Primos

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.370
Hunting Calls.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.970
Hardy anyone watches films in this series
but once you have waded through nearly two

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.070
minutes of preroll, they are a great expo
of different US hunting styles.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.140
You can click on any of these films to watch
them.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.330
If you have a YouTube film you would like
us to pop in to the weekly top eight, send

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.860
it in via YouTube, or email me the link charlie@fieldsportschannel.tv
