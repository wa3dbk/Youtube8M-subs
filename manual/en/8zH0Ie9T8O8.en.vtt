Hi there. I'm digital artist, Aaron Rutten.
And I'd like to talk a little bit about

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.049
coloring line art

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.780
on your computer using a tablet. There's
lots of different kinds of tablets.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.150
There's the smaller ones like the Wacom Intuos.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.520
And there are bigger ones like the Wacom Cintiq 24 HD

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.760
Now drawing on a tablet is a lot
like drawing on paper.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.560
I have my notebook here and I can go ahead
and do a drawing. Let's say, we'll do this

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.840
cactus character here.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.690
Just a little quick cartoon, I'm not gonna

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.110
try to do anything too complicated.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.120
So...

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.190
we have our little cartoon.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.289
We can do this the same way on a tablet

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.820
We'll go ahead and draw. I'm using a
program that's called Corel Painter X3.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.989
So you will need

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.530
software to be able to do this, but
there's lots of software out there. There's even free

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.859
software that you can get.

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.840
You can see I'm using my pen. It works
just like

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.100
the ink pen I was using. It has pen pressure, so I
can press down lightly and get thin lines

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.310
and I can press down firm and I can get thick lines

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.340
I can even erase using the eraser that's
on the end here

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.470
to erase anything that I don't want.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.790
So let's add color to this cartoon here.
We'll create a new Layer.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.060
And a Layer just allows us to put the
color on top of the black.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.380
We'll set the Composite Method
Multiply and we'll pick a green color that we

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.229
want to use for our

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.630
cactus here. And we'll just start coloring it in.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.869
And you'll see that I'm trying very hard
to stay within the lines. But

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.900
if I don't, that's okay because we can always
go and we can erase some of that

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.000
color. You can just fill it in real quick.
Nice and easy.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.329
You don't have to worry about covering up
the black.

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.110
because the green is on a separate layer.
Its tinting.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.899
And then, if you want, you can use your eraser to go in and

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.899
erase anything that you don't want.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.709
I'm just going to do a quick job of this here.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.900
And then if we want to shade this cactus,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.870
we can of course do that. There's little
trick here called "Preserve Transparency" that

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.409
will

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.640
allow us to only paint inside of this green
area. It's kind of

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.739
cool. And we'll paint with some green

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.170
and you can see that I can really quickly
shade

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.519
this here. And I'll give this cactus person

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:49.419
color for their mouth. So there you go. I hope

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.560
that got you excited about creating digital
art using a tablet. Check out my YouTube
