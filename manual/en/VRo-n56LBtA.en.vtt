00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.370
Hi, and welcome to the ValveTime news.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.730
Each week, we’ll bring you the biggest talking
points regarding Valve and the community.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.860
Now, the news:

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.580
The news spotlight was mainly pointed at CS:GO this past week

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.990
with the reveal of the latest community map pack,

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.520
which arrived on Thursday in the form of Operation Phoenix.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.700
The pack is reintroducing eight community-made maps

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.050
which previously featured in the
Operation Payback and Operation Bravo events.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.870
Every map in the roster was voted for by the community

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.420
using an in-game voting system we mentioned
on the previous two Round-Up episodes.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:50.590
The full roster is made up of Cache, Motel, Seaside,
Downtown, Thunder, Ali, Favela, and Agency.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.050
(All of which I may have pronounced incorrectly. I have no idea.)

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.730
Since all of these maps have previously been featured,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.230
the price of Operation Phoenix is considerably
lower than both previous map packs,

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.700
as the pass is available for price of
$2.99 in the US, and £1.79 in the UK.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.240
A new “Operation Phoenix Case”
weapon case series was also introduced,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.310
which, as usual, features numerous
community-created alternate weapon skins

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.840
for a large variety of the game’s guns.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.230
Upon purchasing a pass for the map pack, the player
will be awarded with a Operation Phoenix Coin,

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.870
which tracks the user’s personal playtime and wins

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.260
on any of the maps included with Operation Phoenix.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.350
This time, however, the coin also
doubles up as a competitive stat tracker,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.800
racking up how many kills, wins, headshots,
and MVP awards the player achieves

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.930
while playing competitive matches on both official Valve maps

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.050
and the returning community levels
included within Operation Phoenix.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.030
For more information about this new CS:GO Operation,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.390
be sure to check out our write-up on ValveTime.net
or the game’s official announcement page,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.580
both of which can be reached using helpful
links available in the video description.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.610
Additionally, you may want to check out the update changelog,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.220
as the Operation launched alongside the usual
number of minor map and balance tweaks.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.980
The update changelog can also be found in the video description,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.480
alongside links for everything else we’re talking about this week.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.550
It was revealed that Steam Workshop contributors

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.640
can now create and upload their own unique sticker designs,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.730
which may be added to the game should they
receive significant community support.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.650
An all-new instruction guide was made
available on the Counter-Strike blog,

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.170
which covers all of the basics you’ll need to know
if you’re looking to create your own designs.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.980
This past week was also an important time for Dota 2,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.980
as the release date for the long-awaited
"Free To Play" documentary was finally revealed.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.670
The feature-length documentary was created by a small
team within Valve over the period of a few years

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.100
and takes a close look at how Dota 2 and
the first International tournament in 2011

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.540
affected personal lives of some of the biggest
players in the Dota 2 competitive scene.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.030
The documentary primarily focuses on
the personal sacrifices and struggles

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.230
made by Danil Ishutin, a.k.a. Dendi, Benedict Lim, a.k.a. HyHy,

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.630
and Clinton Loomis, a.k.a. Fear.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.650
While the film was privately screened to attendees
at the International 3 tournament last August,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.970
the documentary will publicly premiere for the
first time at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.700
on Tuesday, March 18th 2014 at 8:00pm PDT.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.920
After a full screening of the film, the premiere
event will conclude with an exclusive Q&amp;A

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.360
with the Valve employees associated
with the creation of the documentary

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.980
and some unannounced special guests,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.500
who we imagine will include some
community figures featured in the film,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.190
such as professional players or commentators such as Tobiwan.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.100
Tickets for the premiere event are available
for $25 from the EventBrite website.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.530
Just... don’t fret if you won’t be able to make it.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.140
The following day, on March 19th 2014,

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.990
the film will be made publicly available
to access on Steam free of charge,

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.280
and we imagine it will likely be added to the Dota 2
or Valve YouTube channels around the same time.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.750
To coincide with the public release of the film,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.420
Valve will be adding an all new “Free To Play”
cosmetic item pack to the Dota 2 store,

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.280
which features player-themed item
sets for Doom, Pudge, and Sven.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.050
The pack will also include a Free To Play themed courier, HUD,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.680
and a pair of wards made by Valve themselves.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.170
As with most items, a percentage of the proceeds from every sale

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.470
will be distributed to the players
featured in the film and the contributors

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.340
responsible for the creation of the
cosmetic item sets we just mentioned.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.830
Since the premiere is almost a full month away,

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.250
we’ll be sure to include a reminder on the show
sometime after the film is added to Steam.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.610
In other Dota 2 news, the New Bloom Festival
event is now coming to a close.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.120
The Year Beast has departed for the final time,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.100
and players now have until Tuesday February 25th 2014

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.640
to redeem left over Jade Tokens for in-game items.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.590
All remaining Flamesalt ingots were destroyed
after the Year Beast’s final departure on Thursday,

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.020
so be sure to purchase your final few
New Bloom chests to avoid losing out.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.220
Gabe Newell took to Reddit earlier this week
to quell a number of recent concerns

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.500
regarding an update to Valve’s Anti-Cheat service.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.800
The update in question was noticed and
highlighted by Reddit user “theonlybond”

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.530
in the early part of last week,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.180
who posted about how the version of VAC
used in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.440
now features the ability to read through
all of a player’s DNS cache entries

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.180
before reporting back to Valve with the information.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.510
Reddit users began to speculate about the use of this service

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.950
and how Valve could potentially be harvesting personal information.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.760
However, while this does sound
rather worrying at face value, fear not,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.340
as Gabe himself stepped in to discuss the
new functionality and how it was used.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.860
Gabe describes how the system was
only in use for around 13 days

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.450
before being deactivated after cheat providers
identified easy workarounds to avoid detection.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.050
Rest assured, however, as, while the system
was publicly active for just under two weeks,

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.610
the system was only used to target known or suspected hackers,

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.680
helping Valve to permanently ban 570 cheaters as a result.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.670
In actual fact, the service did not take all of the
DNS information from an entire machine,

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.740
instead trying to identify particularly suspicious
instances of cheat and hack mechanisms

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.450
“phoning home” to certain websites before banning
the user for having the cheat enabled.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.420
Both posts contain a whole lot of in-depth information
that we’re really not going to get into right now,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.530
mainly because we don’t understand half of it,

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.130
so Gabe helpfully left a brief Q&amp;A at the base
of his message, which reads as follows.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.570
"1) Do we send your browsing history to Valve? No."

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.530
"2) Do we care what porn sites you visit?
Oh, dear god, no. My brain just melted."

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.200
"3) Is Valve using its market success to go evil?"

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.680
"I don’t think so, but you have to
make the call if we are trustworthy."

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.270
"We try really hard to earn and keep your trust."

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.390
Well done, everyone... Panicking about your
internet browser history made Gabe lose his mind.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.410
Good job.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.040
In Team Fortress 2 news, A Crowded Coop
were showing off the first series

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.480
of their new blind box figures at Toy Fair 2014 earlier this week.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.170
An image released to the company’s Facebook wall
highlighted the Spy and Scout models,

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.940
both of which stand at around 3 inches in height.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.590
Both are made entirely of vinyl and appear to feature
poseable arms and some neat weapons.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.780
The Facebook post also mentioned that the
blind box series is due out “this Spring,”

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.260
which we imagine means they’ll probably
be out sometime around April.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.010
In other news, the winners of the 5th
72-hour mapping contest over at TF2Maps.net

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.650
were revealed earlier this week.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.370
The winners were revealed in an announcement
forum post by event organizer Frozen

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.130
before being highlighted in a “Winners Showcase”
video over on the TF2Maps.net YouTube channel.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.920
We highly recommend heading on over if you want to check out

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.410
which maps took the took home the top prizes.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.610
And that brings us to the end of another week of Valve news.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.680
Don’t forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel
and to follow us on Facebook and Twitter.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.490
As usual, our Dota 2 Announcer Pack could
use some love on the Steam Workshop,

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.820
so be sure to head on over and rate it positively!

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.670
Thanks for watching and bye for now.
