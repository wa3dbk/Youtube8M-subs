Inserm presents: Waking Dream

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.560
I am a researcher in cognitive neuroscience,
and dreaming is my area of research.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.480
Some people can recall a dream
nearly every morning on waking,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.440
whereas other individuals recall
their dreams very rarely.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.360
In 1976, Koulack and Goodenough
proposed that as the sleeping brain

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.440
is not capable of encoding new
information in long-term memory,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.680
one needs to awaken shortly during the night
to encode a dream in long-term memory

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.840
and then recall it in the morning.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.520
However, since this hypothesis was
formulated, the amount of wakefulness

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.360
during the night has never
been experimentally measured.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.240
We therefore asked volunteers to come to the
laboratory to sleep with electrodes on their heads.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.000
This enabled us to show that indeed,
when the awakenings are measured,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
high dream recallers show more time of wakefulness
during their sleep than low dream recallers.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.760
We also carried out a study using another
technique, positron emission tomography.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.120
This technique shows which areas of the brain are
working more than others in a given situation.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.400
When we scanned healthy
dreamers with this machine,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.040
we observed a greater activity
in high dream recallers

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.520
than in low dream recallers
in one region of the brain.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.400
This area is known as the
temporo-parietal junction and is involved

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.640
in the orienting of attention towards
stimuli of the environment.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.280
Therefore, because of the
increased activity in this area,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.200
the subjects may tend to be more
reactive to environmental stimuli.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.200
This could explain why they awaken more, and then
get a better chance to encode dreams in memory.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.720
We recorded 20 high recallers
and 20 low recallers

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.760
in a machine that is not
at all made for sleeping.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.800
They had to remain completely
still with the head immobilised

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.840
and a catheter in the arm, and
then we asked them to sleep.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.880
It was therefore very complicated
for the participants, so much so

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.360
that it took us a year and a half to record all
the data needed to complete the present study.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.560
That is why this result is so important,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.800
because there are very few results of this kind
linking dreaming to a particular brain activity.

00:02:34.512 --> 00:02:38.475
There has been one very important
step in sleep and dream research.

00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:44.230
That was the discovery of paradoxical
(REM) sleep by Michel Jouvet

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.524
and others in the 1950s and early 1960s.

00:02:47.524 --> 00:02:53.576
And indeed that one finding
somewhat revolutionised this area,

00:02:53.576 --> 00:02:58.241
since a link was soon made between
paradoxical sleep and dreaming.

00:02:58.241 --> 00:03:02.166
Michel Jouvet's legacy has been
really important and inspirational.

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:05.738
I have had the opportunity to talk
with him, and show him my new results.

00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:13.141
He retains a freshness and youthful
spirit that is quite amazing.

00:03:13.454 --> 00:03:18.578
He has spent a very large part of his
life recording his dreams in the morning,

00:03:18.578 --> 00:03:21.354
transcribing them either
in writing or in drawings.

00:03:21.354 --> 00:03:25.666
It is a collection of dreams that is altogether
valuable for a whole lot of reasons,

00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:29.920
aesthetic as well as
artistic and scientific.
