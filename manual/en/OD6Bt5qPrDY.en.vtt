Hi Fran

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:05.499
This week has been nice.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.420
I had lunch with  my dad. I had not seen him in a long time and I missed him.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.820
I have a bad cold.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.680
We played at RockaxisTV, an internet musical show, and I sucked at singing because of this bad cold.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.580
But we walked around the studio, in Bellavista...

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.440
We walked a lot. That was nice.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.160
I'm staying at Rene and Cristina's house. They've been awesome to me.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:39.260
I have been walking around, and had lunch with Lore. I missed her a lot.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.660
We were at Barrio Italia.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.880
And then, I met with Felipe and Sebastián.

00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:57.321
We played in Valparaíso, despite the fact that I'm still quite ill.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.100
That was good. Playing is always good.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.700
It's tiresome, of course.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.200
We have to carry our stuff and go just for the day and go back to Santiago.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.340
We ate some hotdogs, we played, we grabbed our stuff and went back to Santiago.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.620
René had to drive because he was the only one who had a valid driver's license.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.120
I saw your mom. She says hi.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.740
And then...

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.320
On Sunday we went to Concepción, just for the day, too.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.560
It was a six hour bus ride, we got there by lunch.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.100
We went to an old bike shop, were the show was going to be.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.940
The people were great. The show was fun. Concepción is always fun. The shows are great, there.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.560
We played and went back.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.200
We arrived to Santiago at 5AM.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.420
We took a cab and went home. That's my week.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.280
Travel. Play. Meet friends.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.840
Travel. Play.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.697
Meet friends.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.840
And missing you.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.660
How's been your week?
