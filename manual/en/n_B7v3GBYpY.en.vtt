My name's Lauralyn from the Braiding Lounge
Academy.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.969
I'm about to show you how to start a lock
on fairly short hair, okay.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.350
So, I'm going to be doing it with the crochet
hook method.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:30.160
Okay, when forming a lock, you want to take
your section of hair.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.489
The first thing I do is I roll back and forth
on the end of the section of hair.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.610
What you're actually looking for is to start
some kind of a know in the bottom of the hair.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.290
Dreadlocks is all about loose hair, broken
hair and knots, okay.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.750
So once I've done that, I'm going to take
my latch hook and I'm going to put in to this

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.790
section of hair and I'm going to wrap it around
and bring it through like so.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.149
That's from right to left.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.400
You don't have to go up and down.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.100
The main key of using this tool is of forming
a dreadlock this way is you never go up and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.460
down twice in a row or from left to right
to right to left twice in a row.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.450
You also need to try not to go through the
same hole that you've gone through before,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.450
okay.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:37.060
So, you continue to go in and out, up and
down, in and out, and up and down, and what

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.520
you'll find is the lock will begin to fall
and this method would take you all the way

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.189
up to the base of the lock all the way to
the scalp.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:57.610
So, I'm going to continue on, up and down,
right to left, up and down.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.110
You can see that it's not off the lock, there's
no longer that bottom here, it's actually

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.340
getting closer up to the root, so I'm going
to carry on.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.579
This is probably a couple more turns in there
because what you want to do is get the lock

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:19.849
as close to the base as you can without it
causing discomfort to your client, okay.

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:26.249
So as you can see, that lock has been formed
right up to the base.

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:32.970
This will be a fine piece of short hair so
it can be done and that lock is now permanent.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:41.870
It will not unravel, it will not come out,
and if you want to put a little form on it,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.480
you're quite welcome to just palm roll it
in between your hand as we've shown before,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.019
and you begin to get the roll in there, okay.

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:00.760
So there you have an instant dreadlock that's
with the latch hook method.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.439
And there as you can see, we've just formed
a latch hook dreadlock on to a short hair

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.299
with a latch hook tool and with the latch
hook method.
