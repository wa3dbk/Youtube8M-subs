00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.000
[music]

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.899
Now let's take a look at what the
committee will use to evaluate your

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.500
application for admission if you're
seeking BYU admission right out of high school.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.340
First, we'll take a look at a
standardized test score.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.319
That's an ACT or SAT.

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:19.800
Notice I mentioned both tests.
Both are standardized test scores

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.420
that help with college admission. 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.060
With BYU, we'll look at either test.
We'll use the highest composite test score

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.939
to evaluate your admission application.
We'd recommend taking each test a second time. 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.359
We know they cost money, 
but if you can

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:35.899
60 percent of students who take
those tests a second time raise their

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.789
score, generally. Those who do additional
preparation only increase the likelihood

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.999
of raising that score. Try both tests if you can.

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:47.270
Spring of your junior year take those tests 
and then again in the fall of your senior year.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.900
Next, the committee will look at a high
school GPA. That's an unweighted high school

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.500
GPA on a 4.0 scale.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.100
Beyond standardized test scores and high 
school grades, the committee will look at some

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.820
other elements that certainly influence
the admission decision.  A few I'll

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.930
mention here:

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.150
Your service

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.990
in church, school, community. That would be 
in Young Men's and Young Women's, in scouting,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.840
in community service, school,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.610
in the Church; all of that type of service.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.080
In addition, AP or IB courses.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.030
That's Advanced Placement or
International Baccalaureate courses.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.200
The committee will give additional strength

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.430
for each of those types of classes that
you've taken.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.000
The committee recognizes standardized
national types of classes,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.020
and AP or IB both fulfill those.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.840
Unique personal circumstances: The committee is
interested in you and who you are, 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.240
what you've overcome, where you're coming from;
perhaps a challenge that you've faced,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.070
you or your family, and how you dealt with it. 
We learn about those things from your essays 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.040
or comments from your bishop or a member of the 
stake presidency, or from comments

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.300
that your seminary teacher makes about you.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.000
Talents and creativity:

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.500
That's BYU's nifty way of saying, 
"We want to hear about your athletics, 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.000
dance, music, art, theater, speech, writing-"

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.550
it goes on and on. Anything
outside the classroom that you've done.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.840
Leadership: We're not just looking for
leaders of title.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.060
However, the committee is very interested in
leadership you've developed in the classroom,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.189
in a club, in student government,

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:10.089
in scouting,

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:13.549
in priesthood, in Young Women's, all of that
type of leadership, the committee wants to

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.399
evaluate, including your leadership
in community.

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:20.329
The last factor in that admissions decisions
is seminary attendance.

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.349
Whether you're attending early morning
seminary or release time, the committee

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.389
wants to see that you are on pace to 
complete four years of seminary.

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.279
For those who might be in a rare
circumstance of not having four full

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.500
years completed by the end the senior year,
the committee will look at that.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.500
However, well over 95 percent of our
admitted students are four-year seminary

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.990
graduates, so we encourage you to keep that up.
