(upbeat music)

00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:13.135
- Welcome back to Cute
Girls Hairstyles, I'm Kamri.

00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:14.854
- And I'm Mindy and today
we're gonna show you

00:00:14.854 --> 00:00:17.001
how to do a lace fishtail bun.

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.194
Now if you guys are

00:00:19.194 --> 00:00:22.075

00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:27.020
Now to begin this hairstyle
you're going to need

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.550
a donut maker that matches
the color of your hair.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.933
And you can see on Camry,

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.335
tip your head down, I've
just parted down the center

00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:36.076
and done a french fishtail
right at the top, just to add

00:00:36.076 --> 00:00:38.955
a little bit more something
something to the hairstyle.

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:41.416
Now, you're gonna take your
donut maker and you're gonna

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:44.957
section off a piece of
hair, probably like,

00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:47.151
I mean a pretty good size piece,

00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:50.680
not quite, maybe like
one sixth of the hair.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.316
I mean we want a decent
size amount left out.

00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:54.569
And you're gonna take the donut maker

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:57.216
and slip the rest of it
right through the center

00:00:57.216 --> 00:01:00.698
and just let it fall
naturally so it kind of

00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:02.805
covers the donut maker,

00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:06.421
like evenly spaced out all around it.

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:08.662
Once you get the hair all evenly spaced,

00:01:08.662 --> 00:01:10.334
you have your bottom piece right here

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:13.260
and you're going to pick
up a section of hair here.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.732
This is again, like a
decent amount of hair,

00:01:15.732 --> 00:01:17.695
not a huge piece, and these become

00:01:17.695 --> 00:01:20.770
your two first pieces of fish tail,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.977
like your main strand that you start with.

00:01:22.977 --> 00:01:25.995
So we're going to just do one
stitch of a regular fish tail,

00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:28.711
so take a little piece
off that outside edge

00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:32.114
and cross it over, and add
it to the bottom section,

00:01:32.114 --> 00:01:34.737
and then grab a little
piece off this outside edge

00:01:34.737 --> 00:01:38.219
and cross it over and add
it to that top section.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.634
And that's your basic fish tail stitch.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:43.153
Now on the second stitch that you do,

00:01:43.153 --> 00:01:44.976
you're going to add in hair.

00:01:44.976 --> 00:01:47.635
So we're gonna pick up a
small section right here

00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:51.235
and then we're going to pick
up an outside little edge

00:01:51.235 --> 00:01:53.474
and cross them both together over the top

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:55.669
and into the bottom section.

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:58.431
Of course the bottom section
has no hair to add in,

00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:01.217
so it's not going to get any added.

00:02:01.217 --> 00:02:03.574
We're just gonna take
another outside piece,

00:02:03.574 --> 00:02:06.338
cross it over to the next section.

00:02:06.338 --> 00:02:08.893
So again this is your basic stitch,

00:02:08.893 --> 00:02:10.495
the entire way around the bun.

00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:12.721
Take a small section of hair,

00:02:13.994 --> 00:02:17.637
pick up an outside edge off that section,

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:21.069
cross it over the top and add
it into the bottom section,

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.113
take an outside edge from the bottom,

00:02:24.113 --> 00:02:27.712
and cross it back over and
add it into the top section.

00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:30.196
And you're gonna go over,
around and around, over and over

00:02:30.196 --> 00:02:31.972
until you cover the whole bun.

00:02:31.972 --> 00:02:36.972
(upbeat music)

00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:40.436
When you get here, right to the end

00:02:40.436 --> 00:02:42.397
and you're out of hair to pick up,

00:02:42.397 --> 00:02:44.534
then you're just going to continue,

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:47.278
just doing a regular fish tail.

00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:51.086
For a little bit longer and this allows us

00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:52.770
just a little bit of
fish tail to work with

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.670
on tucking it under the
braid, making it look pretty.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.555
(upbeat music)

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:01.984
Okay, now at this point you can see

00:03:01.984 --> 00:03:03.504
that it's gotten all twisted around,

00:03:03.504 --> 00:03:05.536
like I started over there and
it went around the whole bun,

00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:07.520
you can just move it like this.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.101
So if you don't want the end right there,

00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:10.481
if you want it down on the bottom,

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.919
it's pretty fluid and you can just move it

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.255
to where you want it.

00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:17.436
I'm just going to take
this and sort of tuck it up

00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:20.814
and start tucking it under
this other fish tail.

00:03:20.814 --> 00:03:23.625
Pulling that fish tail over the top.

00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:28.345
And it will require bobby
pinning in some points

00:03:28.345 --> 00:03:30.859
just to hold that fish tail in place.

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:33.877
So tuck, tuck, tuck.

00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:36.973
Up and under.

00:03:39.243 --> 00:03:42.760
And the other thing that I want to do

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.663
is that I wanna make mine
pop just a little bit more,

00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:48.902
so I'm actually gonna just very gently

00:03:48.902 --> 00:03:52.398
go and just tug on that outside edge.

00:03:54.448 --> 00:03:57.106
Just to loosen the hair just a little bit

00:03:57.106 --> 00:03:58.928
and really add to the fullness

00:03:58.928 --> 00:04:01.483
and the effect of the fish tail.

00:04:01.483 --> 00:04:03.446
And then when I've done
that I'm just gonna

00:04:03.446 --> 00:04:05.801
go ahead and secure a few spots

00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:08.500
to make sure it stays
down where we want it.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.069
And there you have it.

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.811
