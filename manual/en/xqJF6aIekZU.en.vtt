00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.009
Hey everybody its Jay withTechhole productions my voice is a little bit

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:07.740
screwed up, I'm feeling a little under the
weather

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.389
but today we're going to build the
world's coolest external hard drive

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.149
Stay Tuned

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.730
so the other day I came into a couple
BigFoot hard drives

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.180
BigFoot drives were made by Quantum

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.070
about fifteen years ago and they were
notoriously bad

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.840
So bad, in fact, that just about
every one that I've come across

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.040
is dead, and this is no exception

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.820
so what I wanna do is open it
up

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.350
I wanna gut it and i want to stick a
little USB thumb drive in there

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.620
with a little extension cable and make a
stupid external drive

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.620
And you may be thinking - "Jay,  why would you do such a thing"

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.360
Why did they build the pyramids?

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.960
Why did we go to the moon? why do
anything?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.190
Because it'll be great and it'll be
a massive inconvenience for anybody that wants to use it.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.710
so I've got the drive, I also have a USB
extension cable that I found in a

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.640
box of trash somewhere, and I've got a
little USB thumb drive. You can obviously

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.710
use whatever thumb drive you like.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.229
This one is 2GB. Aside
from the whole thing being

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.100
just a bad idea it also can't store anything.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.390
I have some double-sided sticky tape velcro
stuff. I also have an assortment of

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.770
screwdrivers here. I've got

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.950
a Torx t8 I also have a couple
Phillips drivers

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.439
and a couple flat head drivers. This disk
shouldn't be too hard to tear down

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:41.070
so I will go and do that now.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.820
I went ahead and removed

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.880
nine screws so far

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.040
Lets see if we can pry this thing apart

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.460
alright

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.810
and there we have it.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.070
We've gotten past the outer casing and in here we
can see

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.530
the platters we can see the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.230
the arms and heads and one of
those big gigantic hard drive magnets

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.160
which I will definitely try to salvage.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.960
definitely try to salvage

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.870
alright so we've taken the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.420
first little off and the six screws
that go with it

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.660
And we should know be
able to

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.720
pry this arm away. perhaps you need to
take these screws out

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.980
and get that magnet loose

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.020
and be careful with this thing it will
bite you

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.980
and break your fingers and all kinds of
fun stuff

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.450
that's the kind of thing you want to
watch out for

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:40.780
as you're prying the sting of up

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.680
we can pivot that a little bit out of the way

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.580
and hopefully lift it off

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.760
And finish gutting the drive. Actually this might be about the extent we're gonna get

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.830
at this point we should have

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.970
mostly an empty shell of a drive

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.790
and inside it

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.889
we will stick that flash drive down and

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.570
...I'm not even sure how that happened

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.060
now we've got the drive pretty well
hollowed-out we're probably not going to

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.940
get this motor out all the way I think
it's friction-fit in there

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.300
Yknow what, lets just try it

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.389
yeah thats probably maybe not coming out so we'll leave that there

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.570
It doesn't spin anymore so that's good.
We need to find a place to

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.350
mount that flash drive, and really it
doesn't matter just stick it in there

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.790
somewhere

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.979
More importantly we need to find
out

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.540
where we're going to run the USB cable
out of the drive

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.560
Since I'm choosing to keep

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.740
the logic board there I think it might
not be a bad idea to kinda run it out

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.010
somewhere near it. There's a little

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.340
indent right here and I'm probably gonna
go ahead and run it out there

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.310
and I'm betting that I can file this
down without too much trouble

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.440
so I'm gonna go grab a file and see if we
can do that

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.760
okay so we'll go ahead and file a hole here

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.120
And I don't want to go too deep with
it

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.349
I want it shallow enough that it's
gonna kinda

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.620
pinch the USB cable, that way I don't
really need to tie a knot in it

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.949
or do any other kind of strain relief on
it

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:16.259
and we're almost there

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.120
okay so now

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.810
we can go ahead and

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.960
put the USB extension cable in there and
we can

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:44.950
sticky down the flash drive

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.850
my hope is that I can screw this cover
back on

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:55.740
and it'll all fit.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.130
after a little readjusting I was able to
get the drive to fit

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.610
just fine and its

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.020
holding the USB cable quite snugly so

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.210
all we really need to do now is run
those screws back in and put the logic board

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.770
back on

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.980
Alright so there we have it - the 8 gigabyte

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.250
Quantum BigFoot drive upgraded with 2
gigabytes of flash storage!

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.430
Lets go plug it in, see if it works

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.130
