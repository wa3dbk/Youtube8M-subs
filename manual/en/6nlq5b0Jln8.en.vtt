00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:06.359
I've always been fascinated with what goes
on behind the scenes of making movies, and

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.521
for myself it's always been common knowledge
that when a movie is shot, they record the

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:18.700
video and audio separately and then match
the two of them up in post. And that makes

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.710
complete sense because they want to get the
best possible quality from each one. But when

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.650
I started shooting online videos, for some
strange reason, it never really dawned on

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.660
me to record the audio separately. I've always
just used the internal microphone on whatever

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.100
camcorder or video recorder I was using. But
the more I began to dissect my videos, the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.899
more I became picky about the overall quality.
So recently I got some advice by from Gideon

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.989
Shalwick, he's a well known Internet Marketer
who makes amazing quality Youtube videos,

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.010
and Gideon recommended to use an external
audio recorder to get top notch quality. The

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.670
recorder he uses is called an Edirol, (I thinks
it's pronounced) and although it has amazing

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.640
sound quality I couldn't resist going for
the Zoom h4n. This thing had amazing reviews,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.180
and with all the extra features, and only
20 bucks more, I couldn't pass this up. So

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.280
if you compare the audio of this video to
some of my past videos, then you can defiantly

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.750
hear the difference in the sound clarity.
Now a professional audio recorder like this

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.909
does come with a bit of a price tag. The Zoom
cost me 300 bucks, but for the difference

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.760
it made in my videos I feel that the price
was well worth it. And the type of mic you

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.380
use also makes a difference in your audio,
but that depends on just how picky you are

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.920
with sound. A lavaliere mic, like what I'm
using now, is probably your best choice. Now

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.049
whats great about a lavalier mic is that it
gets right up close to the person speaking

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.420
so you can get really good quality. And as
you can see I haven't bothered hiding mine

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.159
but there are ways to conceal this mic a bit
more. Now, although these can also get a little

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:16.620
pricy you don't have to spend a lot of money
for decent quality. The one I'm using now

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.849
is called an Audio Technica 3350 and I bought
it off Amazon for $27. (So for that price

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.469
you could afford buy a couple extra for back
up) And yes, just in case you're wondering,

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:35.019
this is a wired mic, it's not wireless, but
since I have it connected down here to my

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.939
portable Zoom then theres no reason for me
to worry about long cords running across the

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:48.389
floor. So my entire audio set up is fairly
inexpensive for a professional level of sound,

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.449
but this doesnâ€™t mean that you have to run
out there and spend a few hundred bucks on

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:59.059
audio equipment just so you can start shooting
video. So just use your onboard mic for now

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:05.089
and as you continue to shoot more and more
video, or if you're making money from your

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:13.109
videos, then invest some of that money back
into your equipment. Trust me there's no rush,

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:18.730
we all gradually improve things as we grow
online, and just getting yourself out there

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.919
for now is really what matters. My name is
Charles Rivera, hopefully you were able to

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:28.669
get some quality information out of this video,
and I look forward to seeing you in my next

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:28.989
video.
