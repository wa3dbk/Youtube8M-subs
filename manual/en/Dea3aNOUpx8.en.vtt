00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:05.549
Hi.

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.740
I am Shawna Coronado and today I am going
to trim my 35 year old tree.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.970
I brought an expert from Bartlet Tree Experts
with me, Tom Tyler.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.655
And he is here to really help me learn, and
help you learn, how to do this.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:24.960
If you look right there you can see how I
have just lopped off the ends.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.619
And I have done that all over the tree.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.870
And now, these if you look right there, those
branches are completely dead and need to be

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.870
removed as well.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.640
So, Tom, can you tell us, why is it important
to prune a tree?

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.620
This tree is not growing in its natural environment.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.579
It has got all the great things it requires
– sun, water, nutrition – so it is growing

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.579
a lot.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:52.579
It becomes very heavy.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.010
It becomes very sick.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.559
It becomes more prone to breakage as a result.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.760
This is what they have done to protect my
baby.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.879
The hostas.

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.350
I was very concerned.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.990
This is going to be my vegetable garden.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.620
And you can see over there I have piles of
rotted manure all ready to spread for the

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.620
season.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.080
I use no chemicals in the lawn and in the
garden so it is very important to me to protect

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.900
what we have and obviously they are doing
a very good job.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:31.110
Can you tell me – by the way, this is Tony
– can you tell me what tools you are going

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.440
to be using today and how you are going to
use them?

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.930
Well I have the ARS handsaw, right here, pole
pruner, and other tools.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.100
And you have this giant backpack.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.290
Do you like climb up like a mountain climber
and?

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.810
Only on ginormous trees.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.460
This is not so ginormous.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.360
All right, Tony, what is the next step?

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.360
All right.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.470
Now that we have trimmed it about 15% and
we got all your conflicting limbs out.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.470
So deadwood and anything that was putting
too much weight at the end.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.580
And now we are going to start shaping the
tree.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.580
Awesome.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.130
So you can get that visual that you want.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:24.770
Behind me you can see that Manuel is cutting
off part of the three that is on the top.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:40.040
Topping off the tree – that is not supposed
to be good, but in this instance, it is ok.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.040
Right.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.040
This would not really be considered topping.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.670
What he is doing is – we call it reduction
pruning – so it is shortening the limbs

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.670
but we shorten them properly.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.980
He cuts them back to other branches so that
the cut will actually heal.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.540
So we are all done and the tree looks 100%
better.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.050
I cannot wait to see the before and the after
pics.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.870
Really, Bartlet Tree Company has been really
great.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.210
They are the tree experts.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:13.190
I can tell the difference.
Ladies.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.860
I found out that Tony is single and he lives
in the Chicagoland area.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.660
Send me a note and you two can chat.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.180
There you go.
