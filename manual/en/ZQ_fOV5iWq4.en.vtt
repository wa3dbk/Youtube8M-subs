Thank you, thank you

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.240
Did you have any idea?

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.840

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.180

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.870
Who am I speaking with?

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.030

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.520
Okay Emily, I need you to stay on the line
with me

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.520
Can you tell me what's going on?

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.559
My friend texted me from her date, she-she
wanted me to pick her up, and I got here and-and

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.719
it was all dark and then I...

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:54.359
I heard her screaming so, so I went in.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:03.909
And there were all these girls, all these
dead girls.

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:14.520
And then I heard him walking in so I hid with
the bodies

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.520
How many bodies?

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.700
I don't know there were so many I couldn't
tell.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.960
Please help me

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.960
[footsteps]

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.960
He's coming.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.570
Okay, Emily, can you get to an exit?

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.570
No

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.910
Do you have anything you can use to defend
yourself?

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.910
No

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.320
Okay, Emily, the police are on their way,
they're almost there, okay?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.780
I need you to stay on the line with me, okay?

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.530
We were supposed to go get french fries

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.770
What?

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:55.210
After bad dates, we go get french fries and
orange soda and then we talk about how funny

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.840
these stories will be when we're married

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.280
[door creaks open]

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.920

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.920
[screams]

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.030
Well, well, well.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.340
I sure do love a good surprise

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.340
[screaming]

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.860
