[David]: Wolfgang!

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.180
[Jason]: Now you be gentle, David. He's just excited, it's his first night night in his new home!

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.220
[David]: Jason, if we don't get him on a bedtime routine now, we never will!

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.460
Bedtime, little man!
[Jason]: He just needs a little time to get used to it.
[David]: I know. We're dads now.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.830
I just want to get this right!
[David]: Wolfgang!
[Jason]: Let him stay up if he wants to stay up.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.079
[David]: No! That's not what parents do. Come to bed, little buddy!

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.160
[Jason]: Is that supposed to be us?
[David]: That looks nothing like me!

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.329
[Jason]: That looks everything like you. Look at the jhorts!

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.289
[squeal]
[David]: How did he find that?
[Jason]: It's just dry humping!

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.960
[David]: You are missing the point! That's enough, Wolfgang!
[Jason]: Come on, Wolfgang!

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.449
[Wolfgang]: Bye!
[David]: Yeah. Say goodbye to the porn stars.
[Wolfgang]: Bye, porn stars.

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.829
[David]: Oh my God.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.050
[Wolfgang]: More tea, Bandito?
[David]: What are these people doing in our living room?!
[Jason]: Okay, now calm down.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.440
Wolfgang's just making some new friends.
[David]: That is a dinosaur in a tutu!

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.590
 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.810
[David]: What the?!

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.270
Jason, do something!
[Jason]: I think he's got it covered!
[David]; Are you -- Really?!

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.479
[Wolfgang]: Scalpel!
[David]: Oh my God!

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.880
[Jason]: Aww, It's an appendectomy!

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.369
[Jazz music]
[David]: You know what? I'm done.
[Jason]: Oh, come on, Dave.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.900
You love Meet and Greets!

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.120
[Jazz music]

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.470
[David]: Little fella finally tuckered himself out.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.350
[Jason]: He looks so cute! I'm really proud of us.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.370
[David]: You know what? Me too. We'll figure this whole parenting thing out.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:56.370
Now maybe we can get some sleep.
[Alarm beeping]
[Wolfgang]: Morning Dads!
[David]: Oh, come on!
