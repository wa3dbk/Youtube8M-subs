Hi, my name is Lillian with Salon de Scottsdale
and on behalf of expertvillage.com I’ll

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.840
now continue on with the next step in giving
yourself a home French manicure. I’ve already

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.570
removed some of the polish, the old polish
off my fingernails but I left a couple just

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:30.640
to show you the easy way to do this procedure.
Put just a little nail polish remover on the

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:38.230
cotton and what you want to do is if you leave
the cotton on the fingernail for just a few

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.550
seconds to soak it and then just kind of gently
wipe. It just comes off a lot easier instead

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:56.719
of just trying to scrub and scrub and scrub
and it just comes off like that and just turn

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.920
it around when you need a clean area and then
you can just go over all of them again just

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.610
to make sure the old polish is completely,
completely taken off. Sometimes it gets on

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.970
the skin and it’s okay to use the polish
remover on your skin, it dries it out a little

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.790
bit but nothing that hand lotion can’t take
care of. So all the polish is completely taken

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:30.340
off and I’m ready to shape my nails. For
a French manicure the most popular way to

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.970
shape your nail is in the square, just a square
nail. The French tips come out just a lot

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.420
better that way, so just with the emery board
you’re going to do a flat motion. When it

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.259
looks flat and the corners of course are going
to be rough, so then you’re going to just

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.159
barely do the corners cause you don’t want
them round, you just don’t want them rough

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:03.280
and then just barely kind of shape them to
where its going to look square instead of

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.969
round and without any rough edges.
