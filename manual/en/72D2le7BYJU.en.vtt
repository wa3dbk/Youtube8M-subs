Hello, my name is Tony Ramirez from Tampa
Bay, Florida and on behalf of Expert Village

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.630
this is how to setup your scanner, let's begin.
So these are the basic settings for using

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.960
your scanner. I have here our software is
already loaded and our drivers are loaded,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.029
I'm using my HP all in one scanner. This software,
the particular software that actually loads

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.710
I know it's a little difficult to see on the
screen right now. But the basic settings are

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.750
basic to every single software. I control
mine with using a photoshop, any software

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.640
that you have, any photo editing, any graphic
program you should be able to control your

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.550
scanner as well. But they all have their built
in software just like this one that actually

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.030
pops up. So once you're in it you have options
to actually scan or preview already except

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.220
the things that are there. I have a picture
already loaded from something I did already,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.920
we have basic stuff to where we can rotate,
zoom into the picture, whatever it is lighten,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.970
darken, sharpen, anything that you want to
do, color adjustments such and such. So one

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.950
of the biggest things I want to give you a
little key note on is the resolution. That

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.560
is probably the most important thing, let's
click there. If you're messing with resolution

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.600
in my recommendation if you're scanning for
instance a photo and you want to be able to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.710
print it out. I would scan it something around
three hundred DPI, right now it is set to

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.960
default two hundred just like it is here.
I just go ahead and click over three hundred

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.630
pretty much anything over three hundred is
kind of a way for just basic printing. But

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.170
around three hundred DPI would give you a
good crisp scan and a good enough print quality

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.670
whenever you're printing out the final product.
Whatever you did to it rather it's adding

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.671
titles or editing the actual photo. So it's
very simple to use if you're going to have

00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:51.280
things for instance, if you want to scan a
photo or business card or something that is

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.150
not as important as far as a resolution wise.
You can scan anything from hundred or under

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.780
if you're going to email it especially on
the website on the website of yours anything

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.400
that transfers. So those are your basic settings,
every software is slightly different of where

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.670
they are and do pretty much the same thing,
again it's your resolution, it's your color,

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.590
zoom, resize, crop all things like that. In
our next chapter we'll show you how to use

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.700
it.
