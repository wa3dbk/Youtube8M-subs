00:00:04.017 --> 00:00:10.612
On May 20, 1973, in the Monza’s motordrome, Renzo "Paso" Pasolini  lost his life in the race

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.200
They say you can write a music without notes

00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:36.878
At 200 per hour riding on two wheels

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:41.285
And so they say that this  music is not made of sounds

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:45.929
But folds and passes, shots and acceleration.

00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:50.520
They say you can run with eyeglasses

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:55.496
Because what you need to see the path is just your heart 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.024
Feeling  the track just below your fingers

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.320
The way it rushes, as life is rushing away

00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:12.284
Oh Paso 
for everyone life has the same goal

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.767
But how to get it, each one has his own way

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:20.145
Riding a violin, a heart or a motorbike.

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.206
They say that everything at 200 per hour becomes indistinct

00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:36.884
The wind stops, even the colors change color

00:01:38.024 --> 00:01:41.160
So the fear,  and even the terror

00:01:42.343 --> 00:01:45.999
They become lighter, lighter than love

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:50.736
They say that at 200 per hour it breaks

00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:55.334
The thin thread that ties between balance and certainty

00:01:56.242 --> 00:02:00.058
And it takes a moment, just a moment

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:04.183
To change the race in a leap or a flight

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.543
Oh Paso
life is a track that you cannot study

00:02:12.338 --> 00:02:15.818
every corner hides the end or the glory

00:02:17.044 --> 00:02:20.295
This is life: it should be played always from memory

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.680
And if Life should be, then, it mustn’t be a Life 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.602
Behind any of a fashion or a red light

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.199
It should be an engine that runs, but also smiles and smokes

00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:43.360
Something that burns, but does not consume itself

00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:06.549
They say you can win even after coming

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.193
Anyway, the joy of the podium jubilation is short

00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:15.989
And it takes more than this to overcome death

00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:20.504
Much more of the talent and the kindness of fate

00:03:21.366 --> 00:03:25.334
They say that for some lives, then, to die is nothing

00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:29.932
Because they still keep beating in people's hearts

00:03:31.072 --> 00:03:34.360
They become history, they become myth

00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:38.435
Like Paso … a blast in an infinite loop

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.712
Oh Paso
The hardest race is against your own life

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.160
She lets you go and maybe smiles at you

00:03:51.637 --> 00:03:55.800
Then she cuts you off and eventually kills you

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.950
They say you can run with eyeglasses

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.523
Because what you need to see the path is just your heart
