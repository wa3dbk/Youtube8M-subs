00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.600
Hello, this is Gino Fort yet again.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.190
Came to introduce you to krumping arm swings.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.959
Krumping arm swings are very strong, and they
make you very tired by the end of the song.

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.109
Of all the techniques in krump that make you
tired is arm swings, 'cause it involves a

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.449
lot of power.

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.660
And you have to stick it.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.179
Now, back in the day when rise, tie-dyes,
krump days, there was a lot of clowning and

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.750
monkey days and other stuff and all this,
but it's a lot more controlled these days.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.750
There's a difference.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.239
A lot of people think that that's what krump
is now.

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.739
It's not.

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.810
It's a lot more controlled, it's on point,
and it's changed.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.399
It's very different now, 'cause tie-dyes brought
a new thing to it.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.730
Well, he switched the style up anyway.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.320
So, when you bring arm swings to the table,
it's very dynamic.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.340
Like, it's the stronger you are the more powerful
you are, the more control you have, the better

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.340
it will look.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.840
If you're very loose and don't have that much
muscle, it's not going to come out as neat.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.800
So, working out, going to the gym does help
you.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.880
For all you all small people out there, I'm
going to show you some arm swing techniques

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.920
and this is how it's going to go.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.250
Now you have a couple.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.700
You have your throws, which is like, out,
very big, sick.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.380
It's very powerful.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.580
Like, while you're doing it, it's out there.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.960
It's almost like boxing in a sense, but it's
very controlled.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.280
So, I'm going to show you a little routine
of arm swings.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.680
So, what you're going to do, your first movements
is going to be with your left arm.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.820
Left arm swing.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.770
You can kind of make the "L" shape if you
want to.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.240
Like, it gives more of a character.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.520
It's like ah, ah, ah.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.280
So, you're going to go one, two three.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.080
Make sure you move your left foot with it.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.040
One, two, three.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.350
Four, five.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.060
Now, when you do that, it's very strong.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.620
It's simple, but just strong.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.850
The stronger and cleaner it is, the better
it looks.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.850
Trust me.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.350
So, you're going to go one, two, three, four,
five.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.849
Try it again.

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.849
Slower.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.019
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.519
One, two three.

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.019
Four, out, five.

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.629
Alright, faster and cleaner.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.830
Five, six, seven eight.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.590
One, two, three, four, five.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:57.579
Now, when you do it you want to have attitude.
