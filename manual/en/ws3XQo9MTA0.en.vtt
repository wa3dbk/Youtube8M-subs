00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.000
Here's an idea.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.147
Maybe the Earth is
computing the answer

00:00:03.147 --> 00:00:04.730
to life, the universe,
and everything.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.961
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.070
If you're unfamiliar with
Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.437
Guide to the Galaxy, the
comedic sci-fi radio show,

00:00:13.437 --> 00:00:15.770
turned to novels, turned to
miniseries, turned to movie,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.120
turned-- well, you get the idea.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.510
First off, you gotta
promise that, as soon

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.980
as this video is over, you're
going to go read some of it.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.992
It's so good.

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:24.700
But more importantly,
there is some stuff

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.460
that we have to get straight
before we go much further.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.120
So there are slight
spoilers ahead,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.731
but also, you're 20
years late, so, yeah.

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.980
So that being said, anyone
familiar with the paperwork

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.442
process necessary
save a Volcoms'

00:00:35.442 --> 00:00:37.150
mother from the
Bugblatter Beast of Traal

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.899
can set their Infinite
Improbability Drive

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:39.925
to these coordinates.

00:00:39.925 --> 00:00:40.800
We'll meet you there.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.460
So The Hitchhiker's Guide
is about, roughly speaking,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.460
everything-- like the
universe, its inconsistencies,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.780
confusiousity, and its
hilarious mysteries.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.264
One of those
hilarious mysteries,

00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:53.680
perhaps the most
important one, is

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.404
about the question of life,
the universe, and everything.

00:00:56.404 --> 00:00:59.070
Because of the imaginations of a
very smart computer called Deep

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.903
Thought, we know the
answer to that question

00:01:00.903 --> 00:01:04.599
is 42, which isn't
too helpful, is it?

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.830
The problem is that we
know the answer, 42,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.854
the actual question.

00:01:07.854 --> 00:01:10.270
Because the question of life,
the universe, and everything

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.370
isn't actually a
question, is it?

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.460
No, it isn't.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.430
It's dreadful.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.170
So here we are, armed with
the most powerful information

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.360
in the galaxy, with
no idea how to use it.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.660
How do we suss this out?

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.057
Simple-- build another
computer, more powerful

00:01:24.057 --> 00:01:25.890
than the first one,
which gave us the answer

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.410
to give us the question.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.800
Ah-ha!

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.400
Splendid.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.796
And that computer,
well it just happens

00:01:31.796 --> 00:01:33.670
to be Earth, which, in
The Hitchhiker's Guide

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.686
is destroyed to make way
for a hyperspace bypass

00:01:35.686 --> 00:01:37.310
before its final
calculations are done,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.530
but that's of secondary
importance right now.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.200
What is of primary
concern is what

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.030
it would mean if Douglas
Adams were onto something.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.380
What if the Earth, and
the rest of the universe,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.190
for that matter,
were a computer.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.250
I mean, I know it sounds batty,
but battier things are true.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.130
Angler fish are thing, and,
uh, Arrest Development is back.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.662
So how might it be that
the universe computes?

00:01:57.662 --> 00:01:58.620
Well, let's start easy.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.640
What does a computer
do, exactly?

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.640
It operates on
information, it engages

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.690
in processes-- mechanical
and electrical--

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.971
that make decisions.

00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:08.470
Those decisions are based on
programs, which at their heart,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.930
are bits-- just
little 1s and 0s.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.210
The output of the program
is fed back into the system,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.700
and the information processing
and creation continues.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.410
What, by comparison,
then, is the universe?

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.940
Well, it's nothing if
not information, right?

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.380
Sure, it's galaxies and stars
and planets and dolphins

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.000
and towels, but
all of those things

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.291
are just made up of atoms,
which themselves are made up

00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:30.570
of particles in different states
that describe all of the stuff.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.610
Furthermore, the
universe is certainly

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.360
the processes which
create and operate

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.690
on all of that information.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.190
#Phisics.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.930
Now, this whole
idea really starts

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.970
to take shape once we get down
to the nitty gritty, or itty

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.620
bit-y, as the case
may be-- emphasis

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.980
being on bi-t-- bit-ty.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.900
[BA-DUM CHING]

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.750
Remember all of those 1s and 0s?

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.620
As it turns out, the way they
behave inside a normal computer

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.440
is pretty comparable
to the way atoms

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.545
behave inside a
universe computer.

00:02:54.545 --> 00:02:56.420
Now, it's true that our
ontological metaphors

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.730
tend to follow whatever the in
vogue technology of the day is.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.740
The human brain and the
universe have variously

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.960
been described as books
and libraries, clocks

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.610
and factories.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.550
But this one, the computer,
has some pretty convenient

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.284
correlations.

00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:10.700
Like how the universe and its
atoms, much like a computer,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.560
have a binary foundation.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.310
Theoretical physicist and
Niels Bohr bro, John Wheeler,

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.350
put it like this.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.570
"It is not unreasonable to
imagine that information

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.445
sits at the core of
physics," in the same way

00:03:20.445 --> 00:03:22.320
"it sits at the
core of a computer.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.800
It from bit.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.800
Otherwise put, everything
'it'-- every particle,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.410
every field of force, even the
space-time continuum itself--

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.930
derives its function,
its meaning,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.650
its very existence entirely from
the apparatus-elicited answers

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.160
to yes or no questions,
binary choices, bits."

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.180
'It from bit' has
become a kind of mantra

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.180
in a sometimes controversial
line of thinking,

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.920
variously called
digital physics,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.680
digital philosophy,
digital ontology,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.334
digital-- so on and so forth.

00:03:46.334 --> 00:03:48.000
These theories hold
that nature performs

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.410
or is the result of calculation,
meaning that nature, the Earth,

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.370
maybe even our brains
are deterministic.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.910
They are programmed.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.960
They are the moving
parts or the result

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.459
of a process, which is run
by a program that has a goal.

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.000
This idea is huge, and we can't
give at the time it deserves.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.500
So if you want to more,
we'll put a reading list

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.180
in the doobly doo.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.400
Now, assuming that you're
sufficiently convinced of,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.549
or intrigued by, the idea
of the universe computer,

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.590
we can start talking about
the interesting stuff,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.610
like, what is it computing?

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.550
What is the goal of the program?

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.430
Maybe it is the heat
death of universe.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.860
Its goal probably
isn't the computation

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.839
of the ultimate question,
whose answer is 42.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:26.020
But what it is, it
involves us-- like, people.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.560
Douglas Adams even described
Earth through deep thought

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.130
as a computer of such
infinite and subtle complexity

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.310
that organic life
itself will form

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.350
part of the operational matrix.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.510
So that could mean two things.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.579
Maybe that organic
life is passive,

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:41.120
and the simulation
argument is right,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.580
and we're all currently
plugged into the matrix,

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.996
and not actually
here, and there's

00:04:43.996 --> 00:04:46.430
nothing you can do about
it, so just don't panic.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.470
Or it could mean
that organic life

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.680
is active in that calculation.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.480
Meaning, we live in or are
a discretized operationally

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.110
complex system composed
not of matter and energy

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.610
but of bits and algorithms.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.620
And that life, and all of its
endeavors-- like science, art,

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.810
getting really good at
bocce, Douglas Adams positing

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.130
that the answer to life,
the universe, and everything

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.470
is 42-- are all just a pursuit
of whittling down our theories

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.790
about the way the world works
into computable, indisputable

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.466
truths.

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:14.840
The purpose of
the program, then,

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.690
being to understand the program.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.189
Or maybe the universe
isn't a computer, or on

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:20.980
the backs of an infinite
number of turtles,

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.110
or squeezed out by the
Great Green Arkleseizure.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.690
But really, just the universe.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.320
And of course, if
we could figure out

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.270
how to ask that bowl of
petunias why it thought, "oh no,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.040
not again" before crashing
into the surface of Magrathea--

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.340
(FROM VIDEO) Oh no, not again.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.925
--we wouldn't be in
this predicament--

00:05:32.925 --> 00:05:33.425
[CRACK]

00:05:33.425 --> 00:05:34.017
--at all.

00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:36.350
(FROM VIDEO) If we knew exactly
why the bowl of petunias

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.400
had thought that, we should know
a lot more about the universe

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.436
than we do now.

00:05:40.436 --> 00:05:41.600
What do guys think?

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.450
Is the universe of computer,
and if so, what's it computing?

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.617
Let us know in the comments.

00:05:46.617 --> 00:05:48.658
And if you look up
"subscribing to Idea Channel,"

00:05:48.658 --> 00:05:50.930
in The Hitchhiker's Guide,
it reads, mostly harmless.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.580
Oh, how do I love math, let me
count the-- oh, wait, I can't.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.560
Numbers aren't real.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.300
Let's see what you
guys had to say

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.800
about the existence of math.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.710
First of all, to all of our
international subscribers,

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.250
thank you for suffering
through an entire video where

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.130
I say math and not maths,
that's just how we do it here

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.540
in 'merica.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.200
Of course, your way makes
a little bit more sense.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.070
HTH128 and a couple
other people point out

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.331
that math must be an objective
part of the universe,

00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:14.080
because it comes from
consciousness, which

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.163
is a part of the universe.

00:06:15.163 --> 00:06:18.330
But I don't know whether or
not consciousness' existence is

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.770
clearly non-metaphysical.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.600
I think it's not--
not that cut and dry.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.990
ManekenT points out that
they agree with the idea

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.740
that math is a kind
of language that we

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.080
use to describe the universe,
and goes one step further

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.000
say that it's a kind
of uber language,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.010
because it's shared
the world over,

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.210
which is a very good point.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.950
Dave Mantel points
out that Brady Haran

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.889
of Numberphile frame
also made some videos

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:37.930
approaching these topics.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.440
We will put some links to
those in the description.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.720
They are awesome, and
you should watch them.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.430
RainAngel111 asks
whether or not there's

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.080
another language other than
mathematics that we can

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.350
use to describe the universe.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.120
Um, I would point you
towards Hartry Field, who

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.286
published something called,
Science Without Numbers,

00:06:50.286 --> 00:06:51.830
which sort of describes itself.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.650
I've seen it described as,
um, not easy or pleasant,

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.790
but possible, and
that's what's important.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.804
MrBrionman points out
the embodied argument

00:06:58.804 --> 00:07:00.720
for mathematics, that
we have a base 10 system

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.010
because we have 10 fingers.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.340
This actually factors
really heavily

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.756
into the work of
Lakoff and Nunez,

00:07:04.756 --> 00:07:06.610
who were featured
in the episode.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.920
Though this is a true for
measuring lengths in America,

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.020
we user base-- ionno.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.810
Uh, yes, the new pronunciation
for "Zaif," in case anyone

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.820
is wondering, here's is the IPA
for it, here's how it's spelt.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.715
Let's rotate the board.

00:07:23.715 --> 00:07:24.673
This one?

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.210
You're welcome.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.124
To smhjerry, whoa!

00:07:31.124 --> 00:07:32.540
Questions that
shouldn't be asked?

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.690
I think we might just
have to agree to disagree

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.530
on the existance of those.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.113
But as far as the relationship
between science and philosophy,

00:07:38.113 --> 00:07:40.110
I will leave you with
some words, uh, spoken

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.370
by the great Ray Kurzweil.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.470
"It is precisely because
we cannot resolve issues

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.860
of consciousness entirely
through objective measurement

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.972
and analysis that a critical
role exists for philosophy."

00:07:49.972 --> 00:07:51.430
This week's episode
was brought you

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.159
by the noses of these
talented folks, who

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:54.450
were up against the grindstone.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.380
Our Tweet of the Week
comes from Cadell Last,

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.338
two points is towards a
Margaret Wertheim piece

00:07:58.338 --> 00:07:59.810
about the limits of physics.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.390
It's a long one,
but it's a good one.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.740
