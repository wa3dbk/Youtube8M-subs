00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.820
We are at Knott's Soak City.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.700
Soak City is a water park by Knott's Berry Farm.

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:16.249
First we went to the children's area called Gremmie Lagoon.

00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:33.542
Going through a tunnel.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.580
Now for a bigger slide.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.420
Stopping a leakage.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.060
Then we went to the Tidal Wave Bay.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.920
Here comes the big wave.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.720
Then we chilled at the Sunset River.
