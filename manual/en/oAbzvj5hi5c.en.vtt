Global Youth for the Environment Forum
Samsung Engineering's CSR initiative on Environmental Education

00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:12.734
Global youth for the Environment Forum is a CSR initiative of Samsung Engineering 

00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:17.781
which helps great awareness about the environment for children. 

00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:22.911
Children here will get an opportunity to know 
 about the environment and climate change. 

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:24.521
They are future generation. 

00:00:24.514 --> 00:00:30.514
This forum they can listen to lectures by the sophisticated 
 speakers such as professors, Ambassadors and even celebrities.

00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:35.983
I'm very happy to be over here. 

00:00:35.672 --> 00:00:43.672
It gave me a very rare chance to meet other people from all around the 
 world and to meet your Koreans to form a global network of friends. 

00:00:43.653 --> 00:00:51.653
This forum has really given me a lot of information on climate change and it 
 is giving me a lot of knowledge and this really change to me.

00:00:51.784 --> 00:01:02.784
And this forum has been changed me because I have managed to interact many people and manage 
 a lot of ideas which I can take back home so I can change Kenya.

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:08.065
As a matter of fact, KFPUM School is one of 
 the leading and distinguished schools in Saudi Arabia. 

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:15.367
When my students knew about the contest, they worked 
 very hard in order to be winners. 

00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:25.844
There could be 5 winners in my school and they were invited to 
 Samsung to share the responsibility taking leading role regarding our environment

00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:33.461
On behalf of all my students and school, thank you again Samsung Engineering for this 
 great initiative and I wish you all the best of your luck. 

00:01:33.097 --> 00:01:36.097
I became interested in climate change through this project and forum. 

00:01:36.353 --> 00:01:43.350
And when I go back to Saudi Arabia, I'll try to learn more about 
 it and try to include many different ways to stop it. 

00:01:43.674 --> 00:01:46.670
Climate change cannot be stopped but easily slow down. 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.800
What I've learn in the forum that human behavior has been the cause. 

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:55.130
When I go back to Saudi Arabia, I'll try to 
 learn more and try to be better. 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.610
And it will take more than one person to save this. 

00:01:57.408 --> 00:02:00.410
I will take more than one person and a lot of efforts. Thank you.

00:02:01.877 --> 00:02:07.880
I'm here to attend the 2013 Youth global forum 

00:02:07.282 --> 00:02:10.280
with my son who won the speech contest in Saudi Arabia. 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
I'm very happy and proud of him. 

00:02:13.998 --> 00:02:20.000
Also I became to know about Samsung Engineering's CSR program. 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:26.270
I hope to come back again to beautiful Korea to work together with Samsung

00:02:26.903 --> 00:02:36.900
for the benefits of our new generation and to 
 have a chance to improve climate change. 

00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:38.210
Thank you, Samsung 

00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:45.010
Royal Commission for Jubail jointly with Samsung Engineering Saudi Arabia organized

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:51.720
English Speech Contest on environment. Winners were invited to this forum. 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.750
I would like to express and thank Samsung Engineering

00:02:56.142 --> 00:03:01.140
to give us such an opportunity for students in 
 Saudi Arabia to join the global forum. 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.640
Giving back to the community is noble. 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.150
This CSR program makes corporate image better than before.

00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:18.980
I want Samsung Engineering to expand the CSR program in Saudi Arabia 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.690
to give more chance for other students
