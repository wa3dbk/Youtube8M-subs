00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.859
One of my students asked me to build a scale
model of a roller

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.349
coaster by the name: Kingda Ka.

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.270
I had to respect the dimensions of the board
which were 50 x 80 cm

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.050
and since that measure was not to scale I
had the liberty of

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.800
making it similar to the real one.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.000
I marked the position of the posts on the
half inch plywood

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.620
with a compass and a ruler.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.719
Then I drilled half inch holes to receive
dowels which represent posts.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.980
I used miter saw to make cuts very fast and
accurate.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.980
Some of them I cut to 45 degrees and join
them with the glue gun.

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:25.090
Some dowels were less than half inch diameter
but that was no problem since the silicone

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.930
glue later filled that gap.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.649
Then I chose to use pine veneer to form the
track.

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.429
I cut it easily with an exacto knife.
This worked quite good, better than I expected.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.370
I spray painted the veneer green.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.280
And then I glued all the posts down.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.560
For the thinner beams I used BBQ sticks

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.120
joining them with a glue gun to the posts.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.490
I used blue spray paint for the posts and the beams.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.440
Then I glued the veneer to the posts.
On some places I used clothes pin to hold

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.240
the joint temporarily
until the glue sets.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.970
I then cut the horizontal curve and glued
it to place.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.330
I applied wax on the track so the cars can
slide easily.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.970
I painted the floor with acrylic paint.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.200
Then I started to make the cars.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.780
They were not supposed to slide off the track

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.100
so I had to improvise
and made this simple solution.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.840
I connected the cars with a piece of string
and glue.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.680
Finally I painted them and it was all finished.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.020
Let's RIDE! :)

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.040
