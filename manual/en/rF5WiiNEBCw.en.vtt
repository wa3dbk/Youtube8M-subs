Hi, I'm Nita Gill with Vegetable Fruit Carving.com.
In this short video I am going to show you

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.219
how to make some real pretty and super easy
carrot flowers.

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.499
I'm going to show you 3 ways to make them
ending with the fastest easiest way. Now why

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.530
don't I start with the fastest easiest way?
Well, because you might not have the tools

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.030
necessary to make them that way. So I'll show
you three ways so even if you don't have any

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.360
specialized tools, you'll be able to make
these pretty carrot flowers.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.600
For this first method, all you'll need
is a carrot, a pointed paring knife, and an

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.780
ordinary peeler.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.780
First, I'm going to just  lightly peel the outside edges
of the carrot, simply to get off this uneven

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.679
looking skin. So, something like that is just
fine to start with. I'm going to hold my carrot

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:52.440
like this in one hand and with my other hand
I'm going to choke up on a knife. So, I've

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.949
got a finger on each side of the blade - I'm
not touching the sharp portion of the blade,

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.170
just each side.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.710
And then with these two fingers I'm going
to either keep my fingers on the carrot or

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.170
on my fingers, and what this does is
it allows you to have a steady hand as you cut

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.320
So what we're gonna do is - we're going to
carve a groove like this. And then this cut

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.610
angles back towards the first cut I made so
that when the cuts meet, this piece will lift out

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.140
and we are left with a groove in our
carrot like this. So, we're gonna do that

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:37.700
all the way around. We'll do another one here,
cut here, and remove the piece.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.140
 OK, so we'll do that all the way around.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:48.680
Next, all you do is take your knife and make
some slices and you have some pretty carrot flowers.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.320
 Super simple, right? You can use
these in soups or salads.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.570
Now let me show you an easier way.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.320
This time, I'm going to start with a yellow
carrot. And I'm going to use a v cutter tool

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.320
that has a V shaped cutting surface. The whole
tool looks like this.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.700
You simply cut your grooves in the carrot
using the tool, like that. So this is faster

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:25.220
because instead of making 2 slices for each
groove, you're doing it on one action, 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.520
one cut. And you do that all the way around.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.400
You can see that I'm keeping these 2 fingers
on the carrot or on my hand. And that serves

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.640
to steady my hand as I carve. And also, I'm
holding my carrot... 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.020
 I'm not holding my carrot like this, If I held my carrot like this, I'd cut my fingers, so, you want to

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.040
keep your fingers out of the way of your cutting
tool. 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.000
So, now we have our grooves going all  the way around.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.460
Now, we can cut like we did before and our
flower is going to be like this.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.240
Now I'm going to show you an easier way to
make very thin slices.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.680
This is called a mandolin and it allows me
to make very thin slices just be simply running

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.959
the carrot across the surface and the blade
cuts it. So what we end up with are these

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.910
nice, very thin pieces. These thin flower
shapes cut with the mandolin, actually have

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.910
some translucency to them, which makes them
pretty. Depending on your style of mandolin,

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.560
you can also just tilt it up and do it like
this, and you end up with lots of pretty carrot

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.930
flowers very quickly.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.920
The easy way, I'm going to demonstrate with
this purple carrot. And one of the reasons

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.090
that purple carrots are fun for making these
flowers is because they have yellow centers.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.160
So notice that I haven't peeled this yet.
I'm going to peel it with a specialized peeler

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.760
that has a wavy blade. This is what is looks
like. So, this makes it super easy. Instead

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:29.520
of cutting individual grooves, you just peel
and groove the carrot in one step, like this,

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.389
all the way around.

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:39.389
Using the mandolin, you do the same thing
that you did before, and you've got very fast

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.330
and pretty purple carrot flowers with yellow
centers, fast and easy!

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.990
You can make lots of carrot flowers in a very
short time this way. You can also use a food

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.380
processor with a very thin slicing blade.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.270
Now you may notice that these look curled,
making them look a little bit more like real flowers.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.080
How's that done? You simple put them
in cold water for 10 minutes or up to about an

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.050
hour - these have been in for about an hour
- and you can see that they curl up really

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.580
nicely making them look a little more like
real flowers. Pretty aren't they?

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.180
So what can you use your carrot flowers for?
If you are going to use them for soup, you

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.680
may want to keep them a little bit thicker,
slicing them with a knife.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.550
I especially like to use these carrot flowers
in salads because they make the salad so pretty

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.669
and people always oooh and aaaah over them
thinking that they took a long time to create.

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.080
You can make your carrot flowers a day of
two in advance. Just seal them with a little

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.080
bit of water inside plastic bags and store
them in the refrigerator. These, I made 2

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.650
days ago and they're still looking great.
