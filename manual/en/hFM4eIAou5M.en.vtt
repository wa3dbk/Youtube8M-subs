00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.860
Achievements

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.600
I don't remember if we mentioned it, but a few weeks back we auctioned off an episode at extra credits for charity

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.180
Well that day has come

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.320
Thus begins the auctioned episode

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.860
So who won you ask?

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.460
What misterious dark figure from out the shadows has emerged to decide the fate of this weeks episode?

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.980
The winning bid was place by none other than

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.860
Sparrow the cat

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.480
Yes Sparrow cat and game enthusiast send two humans to the Child's play auction to bid on our episode

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.540
And the cat wants to know about achievements

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.620
So today we'll be talking about trophies and achievements at the behest of a cat

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.180
-beep- Achievement unlocked

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.140
But you know what?

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.020
The cat's right

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.480
It's something we gotta talk about

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.540
Achievements fall into 3 categories

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.820
The unavoidable

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.520
The optional

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.460
And the inspiring

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.560
Unavoidable achievements are the ones you get simply for doing what you would've done anyway

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.500
We've all seen them

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.480
You put in the disk, achievement unlocked

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.840
This type of achievement is just the result of lazy design

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.340
There isn't really any excuse for them

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.840
-beep- Achievement unlocked

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.360
It's like giving a kid a golden star just for showing up to school

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.260
It's an arbitrary and meaningless reward for an action that should be inherently rewarding

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.120
A game should be good enough on it's own merit to make a player keep playing

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.120
It shouldn't need any additional incentive

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.620
If you already watched our skinner box episode -beep- achievement unlocked

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.360
You'll probably reconize this meritless award system

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.800
There is really not much that needs to be said about these type of achievements

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.400
The only arguable value they provide is to let you know which games your frieds have beaten

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.800
Which can easily be achieved with the other two types of achievements

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.060
Which brings us to optional achievements

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.700
These are basically mini quests

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.880
These are the sort of things that would've been integrated directly into the game in the past but can now be delivered via the achievement system

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.260
These involve achievements like:

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.660
Get 8 Septillion gold

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.180
Find 12 hidden do dads

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.660
Romance so and so

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.500
There is nothing really wrong with these achievements

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.420
Yea they're still arbitrary, there strictly there to extent play length

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.020
And to give the player things to do without having to create more content

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.520
But they're totally avoidable

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.860
If this is your thing, go nuts

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.140
If not, don't bother

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.340
When used well these can create interesting questing experiance for the player

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.220
And offer the dedicated player challenges too hard to actually intergrate into the  core gaming experiance

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.440
Optional achievements are also a great mechanism to make the player aware of the replay value built into the game

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.060
And hint it what else might be out there

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.400
Overall nothing wrong with this type of achievement

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.740
They are generally geared to the type of player who already loves the game and simply wants a reason to play more of it

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.380
The rest of us can simply ignore them

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.380
The main reason why they are sometimes viewed negatively is that they are often tagged on as an after thought

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.940
And in those cases they tend to be

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.480
Well...

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.440
Boring, forgetable, just all around bad

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.040
But that's the fault for the achievement maker

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.420
Not anything inherently with this type of achievement

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.860
But the best achievements are the ones that are inspiring

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.160
Inspiring achievements are those that suggest an alternate, engaging way to play

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.440
That the designers didn't want to make the main focus of the game

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.400
The most common of these are those pacifist-style achievements

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.720
Achievements that suggest you try to play the entire game without attacking anybody

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.120
But these can also range from vehicular jump challenges in games like GTA

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.660
To all those awesome achievements that get put into the HD remake of Deus Ex

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.640
You know if they were actually making one

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.140
Sorry that was kind of mean

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.760
-beep- Achievement unlocked

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.120
Seriously though these achievements, the ones that get us to reconsider to play how we play

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.520
The ones that get us to think through what the ramifications of the mechanics really are

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.900
And understand just how much we can get out of the rules of the world that had been set up for us

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.060
These are what make me say with certainty that the idea of having a simple, universal system

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.240
For achievements is actually beneficial to games

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.400
And there are other cool ways that achievements can enhance our game experiances too

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.740
Like for narrative purposes

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.140
Take Bioshock for example

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.720
-beep- Achievement unlocked

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.160
Look up the secret achievement called irony some time

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.820
It actually forces you to concider your actions that you're taking in game

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.400
Rather than simply being removed from it and seeing it purely as a part of the mechanics

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.180
It's a small touch but a nice one

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.280
But like with Skinner box techniques in general

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.780
It's easy and tempting for game developers to take the low road

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.680
And provide us with achievements that do nothing but offer us false rewards

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.020
In a vain hope to get us to think better of poor games

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.900
This makes Sparrow cry

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.640
Don't be fooled by such tactics

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.300
Don't play games for the achievements

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.880
Play through the achievements because they improve your games

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.720
-...-

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.380
Wait hang on

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.880
Addendum

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.160
I know some of you have actually made a meta-game out of finding the optimal way to rank up the highest number of achievements and trophies possible

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.200
And that's totally cool

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.200
It's a fun challenge to find it satisfying

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.060
More power to you

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.620
That is all

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.180
-beep- Achievement unlocked

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.220
-...-

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.620
I guess that about wraps it up really

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.460
Eventually we're going to have to come back to this to talk about gamification

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.580
The use of game systems to make real world tasks more engaging

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.280
It's going to become a big part of our lifes in the next 10 to 20 years

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.080
For better or worse

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.220
But for now I think we've done all we can for the fight against bad achievements

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.440
For gaming!

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.460
For Sparrow

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.840
Alright see you next week
