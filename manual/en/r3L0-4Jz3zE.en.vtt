00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.750
If you've ever used the Windows
Computer Management

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.109
Console, then you'll notice that
it has a similar look and

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.600
feel to the more generic
Microsoft Management Console.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.810
That's because the Computer
Management Console is a

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.430
pre-built console that has
a lot of Windows plug-ins

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.460
already pre-designed and
added into one place.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.990
And Microsoft is simply
calling that Computer

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.020
Management.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.310
Windows also has other
management consoles that use

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.110
the same idea of taking the
Microsoft Management Console

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.630
and building a series of
utilities out of it.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.490
Although you can't modify
what's in the Computer

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.870
Management Console, you could
easily load mmc.exe, that's

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.020
the Microsoft Management
Console, and build your own

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.190
console yourself to emulate
some of the things that is

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.520
done inside of Computer
Management.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.820
If you look a little deeper,
you'll notice that Computer

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.320
Management has a lot of other
utilities that are

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.340
embedded within it.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.140
So you can go to the Computer
Management Console and look at

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.390
all of your Windows events.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.680
You can look at user account
information.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.780
You can pull up service
information, where you can

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.550
start and stop services.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.580
There's a lot of other features
inside of Computer

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.290
Management.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.250
Let's have a look at it.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.770
You'll find the Computer
Management Console, from your

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.910
Start menu, choose the
Control Panel.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.170
And inside of your Control
Panel will be an

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.220
Administrative Tools option.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.180
Inside of there, you can find
Computer Management, along

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.440
with all of the other
administrative tools that you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.890
have available to you.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.060
You'll notice that the Computer
Management Console

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.560
has three different panes.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.860
There's a left, a center,
and a right.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.540
Along the left side, you'll
find different functions,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.990
different capabilities that
you can choose from.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.260
The center pane is going to
show you more detail about

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.460
what you have chosen.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.630
And on the far right side will
be a series of actions that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.640
will change depending on
what you have selected.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.850
Let's start with
the left pane.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.200
You'll notice that there is
a centralized Computer

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.420
Management section.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.820
There is a System Tools section
with a number of

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.300
utilities inside of that.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.640
There's a Storage option.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.400
And there's also a selection for
Services and Applications.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.490
And I'm going to expand out
everything so we can see it.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.500
You'll notice that all of these
things are tasks that as

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.570
an administrator you may need
to get to very quickly.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.310
So you can simply come to one
screen, select the utility

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.040
that you need, and then perhaps
choose another utility

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.280
from the same list.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.800
If we start at the top, you'll
notice the System Tools begins

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.090
with Task Scheduler.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.980
Again, this is a separate
utility.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.370
But it's now contained within
the Computer Management

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.260
Console for ease of use.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.730
If you ever wanted to fire off
a utility to run at a certain

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.970
time every night, if you
wanted your disk

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.290
defragmentation to occur at a
certain time every week, this

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.520
would be a great place
to configure that.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.470
The Windows Event Viewer can
also be launched from within

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.380
Computer Management.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.010
You can see all of the
information in the center pane

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.620
and all of your actions
along the right side.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.580
You also have the ability to
look at what folders are

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.070
shared on this particular
computer.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.920
If you're trying to determine
if a particular area of your

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.710
hard drive has been made
available to others, this

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.170
would be the section that you
would go to so you can see all

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.160
of the shares.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.100
The list is here.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.160
That's the default list.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.890
You can see if anyone is
actually connecting to those

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.690
shares and has a session
open at this time.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.450
And you can see what files are
currently open by people who

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.440
may be connecting into
those shares.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.000
That way if you were trying to
determine if you should reboot

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.050
your system or apply certain
patches, you can look to see

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.670
if you might be interrupting
somebody who's actually doing

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.170
work to data in those particular
shared folders.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.820
There's also a section
in here for your

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.350
Local Users and Groups.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.340
If you wanted to add a new user,
delete a user, change a

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.130
user's password, this would
be a great place to do it.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.710
And you can also look at all
of the built-in groups or

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.820
create some new groups
that you can use

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.800
locally on this computer.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.390
The Performance section gives
you the ability to look at how

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.550
your computer is performing
and look at it over a very

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.830
long period of time.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.310
We'll have a completely separate
video on this,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.020
because you can really go into
detail about how your computer

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.150
is performing and perhaps find
ways to make it work a little

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.390
more efficiently.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.670
Your Device Manager is
in here as well.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.470
This is a great place to go to
see how your hardware that's

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.030
connecting to your computer
may be performing.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.480
Is it working properly?

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.110
Is it not?

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.680
Do I need to install
a new driver?

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.410
This would be the place to go.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.060
Those are all of the
system tools.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.600
Let's look at storage.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.650
And storage has one central
place to go, that is the Disk

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.890
Management screen.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.580
So you can see all of the disks
that may be connected to

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.580
this computer.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.030
You can make modifications.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.740
You can format partitions.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.760
You can add and remove
partitions.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.520
It can all be done in this
Disk Management section.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.920
You can start to see now why
this is in the Administrative

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.740
Tools area.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.370
All of these things are not
really what your end users

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.020
would be doing.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.280
But if you ever needed to make
a change, this would be

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.880
exactly where you would go.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.770
The last section is
the Services and

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.180
Applications section.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.010
And of course, from here, you
can modify any services that

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.440
may be running in
the background,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.230
restart them, stop them.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.270
Everything that you need to
control services is right here

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.250
in this menu.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.070
And you also have WMI control.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.680
If you're running Windows 7,
the Windows Management

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.770
Instrumentation service provides
third parties with a

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.870
way to access your computer and
gather more information

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.430
about how this device
is running.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.530
If you're performing day-to-day
administration on

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.600
your computer, you can see the
Computer Management utility

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.850
inside of your Administrative
Tools may be a great place to

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.760
go for a one-stop shop for all
of these different functions.
