00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.900
We are going to do another gel design.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.721
using a tip and an overlay so that is all
ready to go.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.000
With this one what we are going to do

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.300
is make a shape with the gel and then set it for 10 seconds

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.300
so it stays exactly where we have put it.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.300
So into the lamp just for 10 seconds.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.600
Wipe your brush so you get rid of that colour

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.000
and then we are going to move onto the next colour.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.700
So you are going to run that colour alongside
the last one.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Because you have frozen it for 10 seconds,
it shouldn't bleed into it.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.100
I'm just going to put a little bit more on
the base of that

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.400
so it is more of a solid colour.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.900
And again back into the lamp for another 10 seconds.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.400
Ok back out.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.400
I'll move on to glitter now. 
So just picking up my glitter using my clear gel

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.000
and then into my glitter.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.600
And we can also put one at this side of this one.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.400
Back in for 10 seconds.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.900
So I just keep my lamp on a constant setting
so I can just move my client in and out.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.500
And if I was doing a full set I would do 2
or 3 nails at a time.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.500
Take that back out.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.000
Back in with your colours.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Back in for 10 seconds.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.600
Back out again.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.000
Back in for 10 seconds.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.000
So your line should clearly be going from thick up to thin.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.800
And then finally back in with your glitter.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.300
And then that one needs to go in for a full
3 minutes.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.700
We now need to cap this whole nail in your
clear gel.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:25.700
Starting off with a thin layer over the whole
entire nail.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.000
And then your build layer.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.800
Place it on.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.300
Come forward.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.400
Let that build layer settle.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.400
Use the tip of your brush to move it if you want to.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.000
And back into the lamp for 3 minutes.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:36.700
So we can take the sticky residue off the top
now and then this nail is ready for filing.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.400
So you can get rid of the dust.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.100
And then apply your gel top coat.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.800
Place that into the lamp for 2 minutes.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.300
Just a little bit of cuticle oil to finish this nail off.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.300
And that is that gel nail done.
