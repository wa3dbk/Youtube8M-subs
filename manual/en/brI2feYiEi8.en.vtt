00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.180
Hey guys, ChrisFix here, today I am going
to show you how to tell if your tie rods have gone bad

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.940
A bad tie rod can cause uneven tire
wear and if it is really bad, it can even

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.680
disconnect while you are driving, and that
is just a bad situation.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.040
Besides tire wear, bad tie rods can cause a clunky feel when
you first turn your steering wheel.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.580
 It can also squeak when when you use the steering wheel but that can also be a ball joint, so you 
have to go and check it out. 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.500
   If you have any
of these symptoms just jack up the front 
of the car and I will show you how to test it.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.420
With both tires off the ground

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.280
what you are going to  want to do is put your hands at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions on the wheel.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.720
With your hands in those positions, move them back and forth and see if there is any play in the wheel. 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.620
You will feel a clicking or a giving movement

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.900
And that movement could indicate a bad tie rod.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.880
If you think there is some play or you just want to check further, you can take the tire off and inspect the tie rod itself.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.560
There are two parts to your tie rods

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.580
Your inner tie rod,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.820
and your outer tie rod.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.940
Inspect the inner tie rod visually by looking at the boot and seeing if there are any leaks.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.600
I dont see any leaks here... The boot is still intact. 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.980
There are no holes or rips

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.980
So that looks good.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.580
Now for the outer tie rod, you can see here already, 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.560
There is a nice big gash on my tie rod boot.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.160
and this just happens over time. 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.000
The boot cracks and goes bad.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.276
And inside you can see the grittiness. 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.380
And that grittiness is not good. That is sand and road grime that gets kicked up and

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.160
and goes in here... So this is bad.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.280
If you catch a boot that was just recently torn

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.420
sometimes these boots are replaceable.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.640
So you can just take the boot off and put a new one on.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.100
And then you save yourself a lot of money

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.620
You dont have to do anything special, you dont have to get an alignment.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.800
But if the boot has been ripped for a while and you see grit in there

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.360
then you are going to have to replace the whole tie rod end.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.260
If your boot is good, then what you should do

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.680
is, you take the tie rod

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.600
and you try to move it left and right

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.680
move it, in and out

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.280
if there is any unwanted movement

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.220
or it clicks and you can easily move the tie rod from side to side

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:51.426
then it needs to be replaced.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.080
now this is a new tie rod end

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.620
and this is what it should look like. Some tie rod ends

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.080
have a grease fitting

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.260
and that is what you want if you need to purchase a new one

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.680
and if you have a grease fitting

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.600
always grease this every time you do an oil change. It will force

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.820
the old grease out which carries all of the grit and sand.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.500
so this will last a lot longer.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.100
but upon visual inspection, you can see there are no

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.200
tares or gashes on the rubber

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.080
that covers the inner tie rod end.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.640
Also, there is no unwanted movement like I was talking about before.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.920
Obviously this is brand new,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.260
but I need to give you an example to contrast the bad tie rod

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.640
now to test the tie rod even more

00:02:27.093 --> 00:02:28.093
you can take it out

00:02:28.093 --> 00:02:28.926
 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.140
and you can see further that this boot is badly ripped and the grease is contaminated with grit.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.080
The other thing is you can turn this with your hand and it feels gritty and clunky.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.960
Which is not good, you want this to be smooth

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.800
So the outer tie rod is bad.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.760
Now to test the inner tie rod, all you do is move this

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.840
in and out

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.580
and you want to feel for any clicking

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.000
if it clicks then the inner tie rod is bad.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.440
Clicking indicates that the ball joint on the inner tie rod is worn out.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.880
and it is allowing movement which isnt good. You dont want any movement in there!

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.280
This one is completely solid, which is good.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.720
The other test you can do is move the tie rod around like this

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.680
and make sure there is no gritty feeling and no grinding. 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.960
It is fine if the tie rod is easy to move around

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.420
but it is bad if it move way too easily and feels way too loose.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.540
This is relatively easy to move but I still feel some resistance, so that means this is still good.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.000
So the outer tie rod is bad but the inner tie rod is good.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.880
But that is fine because the outer tie rod is fixed easily.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.120
and you can replace this in 10 minutes.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.620
with no special tools

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.140
