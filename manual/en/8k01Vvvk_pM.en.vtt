&gt;&gt; Matt Lieberman: Hey folks, I’m Matt Lieberman. What?! Matt Lieberman?
Food story? Shocker of the century!

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.540
[MUSIC]

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.059
Change. No one likes it, except those jerks
who have achieved “zen”, or “inner peace”,

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.320
like some kind of inner peace zen-ass jerks.
So when I saw the following analysis from

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.590
financial services firm Janney Capital Markets,
I figured I should make ya’ll aware. Change

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.640
is coming!
They made projections about the future of

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.140
fast food and their findings will be shocking
to some. With the exception of the untouchable

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.720
McDominator, burger chains will be pushed
clear out of the top 5 fast food chains in

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.230
the country.
Can you name the top 5 fast food restaurants

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.520
of last year? McDonald’s is obviously at
the top, with reported U.S. sales of 35.9

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.050
billion dollars, followed by Subway, which
reported $12.7 billion in sales. Number 3

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.690
wasn’t even a traditional fast food spot.
It was actually Starbucks, pulling in 11.7

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.000
bills, beating numbers four and five, Wendy’s
and Burger King, which pulled in 8.8 and 8.5

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.850
billion respectively.
Huh. So what can we tell from this data? People

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.890
Are more interested in cold cut combos and
cappuccinos than crispy chicken wraps and

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.560
“extra-long cheeseburgers”. Seriously,
BK? They also are more health conscious than

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.570
they’ve ever been before. McDonalds retains
its dominance largely through the fact that

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.350
it is so ubiquitously dominant. So what’s
going to happen in 2020?

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.040
Well, Janney Capital Markets’ projections
are pretty interesting for a few reasons.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.140
Let’s burn off some calories by jumping
right in! McDonalds retains the top spot,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.480
but Starbucks will become the number two fast
food chain in America, overtaking Subway at

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.090
number three. What happens to Wendy’s and
BK? They’re nowhere to be seen, replaced

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.320
instead by Dunkin Donuts and the deliciously
anti-gay Chick-fil-A. The study also reports

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.130
that fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle
are fast approaching Top 5 status, though

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.540
it’s hard to say when they’ll break through.
The other big news? All five of these restaurants

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.930
are earning about 30% more than their 2013
counterparts. So even though people are more

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.090
health conscious than ever, we’re also going
to be more on-the-go than ever before as well.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.910
Very interesting stuff.
So,  what’s your favorite fast food spot and why?

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.870
What do you order? Let us know down in the comments below. I'm Matt Lieberman, Like the video, 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.810
And hey, subscribe to the channel, why don't you? You know what's wrong people with Starbucks.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.610
And I do this too. Okay, you go there and order a coffee and/or a muffin and you stay there for like six hours 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.290
on your laptop thinking you just own the place. So if you're just one of those people who watches videos

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.010
and doesn't subscribe, maybe it's time that you buy a second muffin. Okay? Click that button. You won't regret

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.990
it. It'll turn from red to grey. 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.320
It'll blend in. Beautiful.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.300
Beautiful.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.240
Bye.

00:02:37.154 --> 00:02:39.154
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye now. Goodbye.
