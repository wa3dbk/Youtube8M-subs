Romantic Grenada with Amanda Statham

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.250
I’m here on the Caribbean island of Grenada,
or the Spice Island as its also known.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.600
Not only
is it one of the prettiest islands in the

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.920
group but its also one of the most romantic
with

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.750
everything from white sand beaches to waving
palm trees and warm waters – and a lot more

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.540
besides…

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:34.500
All of these beautiful backdrops and the friendly,
warm atmosphere set the scene for

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.750
romance.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.890
Not surprising then that Grenada is earning
quite a reputation as a very special

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.220
place for Caribbean weddings.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.550
Local wedding co-ordinator Lucille Sylvester
told me more…

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.532
Lucille: Its really great helping couples
make their dreams come true and its beautiful,

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:52.739
a lot of
people think its paradise

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.870
And what about the practicalities of getting
married here?

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.950
Just three days, you have to be resident on
the island and the next day you can apply

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.130
for your
marriage certificate and in fact after your

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.330
wedding you can receive your wedding certificate
to take

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.330
home with so its really straight forward.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.320
And what about some of the amazing venues
on Grenada?

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.470
Well we’ve got this beautiful waterfall
right here behind me, also the fort which

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.619
has lovely views and
there is a beautiful garden at the top of

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.180
the fort where couples can get married.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.759
Also of course on
yachts as well as oceanfront gardens.

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.700
A lot of couples want to say their vows barefoot,
right be the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.610
ocean, sometime taking a dip in the ocean…
there’s quite a few places on the island

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.929
which are
perfect for a destination wedding

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.500
During my stay, I met several couples who
had opted to tie the knot here.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.709
Kim and Mick
from Stockport chose to get married from Spice

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.750
Island Resort on Grand Anse beach…

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.210
We got married at 4 o clock in the afternoon,
by then things had cooled down a little.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.420
I walked out
from our room onto the beach.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.040
I did have a full wedding dress on which I
thought I would just be too

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.479
hot in but it was just perfect.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.810
I walked out, Mick was waiting for me by the
stones and we walked

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.869
up to the beach and we got married under a
beautiful arch in between 2 palm trees with

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.959
all our
family and friends watching.

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:07.640
We just had a really magical day.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.360
Its been awesome, just awesome.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.180
Really simple to arrange, we didn’t have
to think about anything,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.150
just booked the holiday, come out here and
everything was sorted out for us.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.170
So in terms of getting
married out here, easy, do it.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.010
I also caught up with Matthew and Natasha
from London on the day before their ceremony

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.299
at the Beach House on Pink Gin Beach
We were looking for an outdoor venue, we wanted

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.739
to get married and say our vows with our feet
in

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.450
the sand, somewhere private and secluded.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.800
In Grenada the beaches are public so we couldn’t
guarantee it would be all ours but the restaurant,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.980
The Beach House is open the whole day just
for us.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.359
So you are looking forward to tomorrow
Can’t wait, we’ve got lots of family and

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.780
friends here and everyone is looking forward
to a really

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.780
fantastic day…

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.040
Getting married here means there is no agonising
over the honeymoon will be.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.560
And
Grenada is perfect for a romantic holiday

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.481
of any kind, whether it be your honeymoon,
an

00:03:06.481 --> 00:03:10.230
anniversary celebration or simply to spend
some quality time together…

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.769
Couple at La Luna: Its just pure relaxation,
its absolutely perfect for couples.

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.739
You can just really
switch off and I mean the hardest decision

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.849
of the day is which beach chairs to relax
in and what to

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:25.849
choose from the fantastic menu.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.590
I mean its perfect.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.280
When it comes to choosing a hotel in Grenada,
there’s lots of choice from boutique

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.969
retreats like La Luna, which there’s just
a few cottages around a hillside to grand

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:41.500
resorts like
Spice Island which lies on Grand Anse beach

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.870
where there’s beautiful bedrooms with marble
bathrooms and heart shape Jacuzzis.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.079
And Calabash, a laid back resort which has
been on the

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.870
island for decades with a beautiful spa and
curve of golden sandy beach

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.670
And don’t forget to tell the hotel if you
are here on honeymoon or indeed celebrating

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.890
any
special occasion as they will often throw

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.200
in some extra special touches
Honeymoon couple: They’ve looked after us

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.450
as soon as we arrived.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.459
You say honeymoon and they
are like oh what can I get you.

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.040
And we came back today and they’d put petals
on the bed and there

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.820
was a bottle of champagne, so yes amazing
Back at Pink Gin Beach, Matthew and Natasha’s

00:04:18.820 --> 00:05:01.400
special day had arrived and they were kind
enough to let me witness it…
