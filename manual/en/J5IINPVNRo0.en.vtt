00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.800
You know when a really good movie comes out
and it’s really popular, and you’re fine

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.080
with it just being that one really good, really
popular movie...but then because it’s really

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.830
popular, someone with lots of money decides
there has to be a sequel?

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.000
But then none of the original cast wants anything
to do with it, so it tanks.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.800
And then you’re at the store and you see
there’s actually another sequel that was

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.820
straight to DVD...anyway, the point is things
tend to deteriorate when too many are made.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.300
It works that way with sequels, clones...and
video games.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:08.260
Case in point, Hasbro Family Game Night 4:
The Game Show.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:25.110
I haven’t played one of these since the
we reviewed the third Hasbro Family Game Night.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.710
I’m willing to admit my memory is perhaps
permanently compromised thanks to the brain

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.330
damage caused by head-banging and circle-pitting,
but I think I remember

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.000
the game being not so bad.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.410
Certainly not this bad.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.470
This is like watching someone break your board
game in half.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.140
Hasbro Family Game Night 4 isn’t anything
like the last one.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.020
That game was just a compilation of video
game adaptations of classic Hasbro board games.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.840
I’ve always thought board games are best
played as board games, but whatever.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.950
That game succeeded for what it is.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.360
This game only succeeds as a drink coaster.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.490
You see words like Yahtzee and Scrabble, and
you might get excited.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.280
And that’s fine, because those games rule.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.730
But these aren’t those games.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.920
Family Game Night 4 takes those beloved names
and attaches them to minigames as shallow

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.069
as the end of the gene pool from which the
Kardashians crawled.

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.769
You want to play Scrabble?

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:24.769
Here you go.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:25.769
**** around with these letters.

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:37.360
I lost the rest of the bag.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.650
Family Game Night 4 is literally a collection
of five minigames.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.040
With a total that low, “collection” seems
like the wrong word to describe it.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.010
It’s more like a handful, which is also
an apt word for the amount of minutes this

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.459
game will entertain you.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.870
Not only are these games few, they’re also
mind-numbingly shallow.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.020
I guess this is supposed to be a multiplayer
game, but I have to tell you, there’s not

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.090
a single thing about this game that makes
me think it would be any better with friends.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.160
It’s not like the prior Family Game Night,
which had much more robust games and were

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.980
an excellent time in multiplayer.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:25.400
This stuff...I mean, this is just curling.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.042
The only thing Sorry! about that is the game
itself.

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:34.239
I was actually pleased to see this game on
my to-do list for the week.

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.569
I love Hasbro board games, and I remembered
the last Family Game Night being decent.

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.670
Much to my surprise, this one doesn’t remind
me of the last Family Game Night.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.150
In fact, I guess it’s based on a television
show...a television show I’ve never seen.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.510
It’s funny how cameras, syndication, big
budgets and bigger bowling pins can’t replace

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.900
the fun of a board game.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.340
In this case, neither can a video game.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:19.829
It’s Hasbro Family Game Night 4.
