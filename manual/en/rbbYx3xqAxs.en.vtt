00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:11.280
This video will show you how to install third
brake lights for 99-04 V6 and GT Mustangs.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.590
Step one, unplug the housing connector by
pressing the tab, and pulling the connector

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.420
out.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.679
Step two, remove the two 10mm nuts holding
the brake light assembly to deck lid.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:33.300
Step three, remove brake light assembly by
pulling it straight up, and out.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.760
Step four, with a pair of pliers, remove the
four clips holding the wiring harness to the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.199
assembly.

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:50.539
Once that is done, you can now remove the
sockets from the housing.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:58.379
Step five, install the waterproof gasket onto
the new brake light assembly.

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.160
Step six, remove all bulbs from the harness
except for the trunk light bulb, which is

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:12.980
at the end.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.460
Step seven, plug the LED wires into the corresponding
sockets on the brake light harness.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.610
Step eight, install the sockets into the new
assembly, and tuck in the remainder of the

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:33.729
LED wires.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:41.940
Step nine, install new third brake light assembly
onto vehicle.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.110
Step ten, reinstall the 10mm nuts holding
the assembly to deck lid.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.240
Step eleven, plug in harness.
