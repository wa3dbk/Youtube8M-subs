I'm Lisa Butterworth sometimes known as Kenzi
and I'm a henna artist and the owner of a

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.490
henna supply business, kenzi.com.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.250
Today I'll unleash your inner henna artist
and have you drawing henna designs all over

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.000
your friends and anyone else who will sit
still.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.400
Now I'm gonna teach you how to make henna
paste.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.650
The recipe for henna paste is very simple
but you can make it more complicated if you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.650
want to.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.200
Lets first learn how to make it the simple
way and you can make any variations you want

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.200
after that.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.899
The first ingredient of course is henna and
I just pour the henna into the bowl and than

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.520
I like to add some sugar.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.620
Sugar helps the paste stick to the skin better
and keeps it from drying out to fast and flaking

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.620
off.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.219
So I add about one part sugar for about four
parts henna.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:05.040
So lets put little sugar in there and you
can see there how much that is, and than I

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.560
just use water to mix my paste, some people
use tee, or they use lemon juice.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.100
I like to keep it very simple, like I said,
and just use water.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.180
So start out with just a little bit of water
and mix it up and than add more as you need

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.570
it.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.520
So making henna paste is a lot like how your
grandmother cooks, it's just adding ingredients

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.520
until it looks just right.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.360
So, the measurements that I give you are not
exact, in fact I'm not even giving you any

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.790
measurements you just have to do it until
it looks right.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.340
So, you get it until it's kind of a rough
paste and than just add a little bit more

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:50.560
water as you need to to get it to the consistency
that you want.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.810
It's better to mix your paste a little bit
to thick than to mix it too thin.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.079
It's very hard to make thin paste thicker,
but it is very easy to make thick paste thinner

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.060
just by adding a few more drops of water in.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.509
Even if your paste is already in your bottle
you can add the water right to the bottle

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.111
and than just mix it up with a skewer or something,
or a chopstick, and get the consistency of

00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:12.270
the paste that you want.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.280
So right now I have a pretty thick paste so
I'm gonna add a little bit more water just

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.940
to thin it out a little bit.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:29.060
So, one thing that you need to pay attention
to is something called die release and die

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.130
release happens when the die that is in the
henna plant, in the cells of the plant, becomes

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.200
available and able to stain the skin.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.790
So, that's why we call it die release.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.350
I'm not really sure what's going on when the
die is made available, it may be chemistry,

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.230
it may be elves, I'm really not sure but I
will show you how to tell when you have die

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.840
release.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.590
So here is your fresh paste, just mix of water,
sugar and henna powder, and you see that it's

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:12.120
a pretty bright green still and once you have
die release the paste turns kind of a brownish

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.120
green.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.980
So you can see the difference here, this is
the paste that has achieved die release and

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.500
this is the paste that we're mixing right
now.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.310
So, what I like to do is mix the paste to
just about the consistency that I want, which

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.840
is what I'm doing right now, and than I let
this sit, and every type of henna has it's

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.540
own time period that you need for die release.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.680
Some hennas get die release very quickly,
after a few hours, some you need to leave

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.061
it over night, sometimes two days.

00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:47.710
So you have to experiment with the different
kinds of henna that you try.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:54.570
This, what I'm using now is Moroccan henna
and it tends to achieve die release very quickly,

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.540
so this could be ready in 3 or 4 hours.
