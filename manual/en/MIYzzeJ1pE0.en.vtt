00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.620
Hi, I’m Kerri.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.040
I’m Dave, and this is EW’s TV Recaps for
March 24th.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.290
I’m sorry guys we usually try and be
Upbeat and fun in these recaps.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.440
But we just finished watching The Good Wife
And I’m literally in shock here.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.910
I can barely find the words to wrap my head
Around what just happened.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.800
You guys, Will Gardner is dead.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.060
That was such a shocking twist.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.060
There was this courtroom shoot-out and for
a

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.599
Moment there we thought, “OK, maybe Will’s
just hurt,”

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.150
But when Kalinda and Diane walked into the
ER and stared at his shoe, we just knew it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.150
was bad news.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.450
I have never been so mad at Hunter Parrish
in my life.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.130
And I just still can’t believe it.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.260
They killed Will.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.260
They killed WILL.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Will Gardner.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.850
How is Alicia going to move forward from this.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.850
How is Diane?

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.850
Kalinda?

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.320
Sh*t, how are we going to move forward from
this?

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.989
I feel like I’ve just been punched in the
gut.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.559
Also, when we look back at Will’s actions
throughout the episode

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.370
It makes his death even more emotional.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.821
Like when he told Kalinda that she’s one
of the

00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:52.640
only co-workers that he likes, and his conversation
with Alicia

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:06.470
Which was layered with levels of forgiveness
and affection.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.840
This is definitely a game-changer of an episode
for The Good Wife.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.840
Will’s such an essential character to the
show

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.520
And fueled so much of the show’s action.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.900
And Josh Charles really played him brilliantly.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.980
Will was so complex you loved him at one second
And then loved to hate him at the other.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.610
And if fans are screaming “Why?!”

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.630
They can blame Josh Charles himself who has
Now revealed that he wanted off the show

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.100
And that killing his character was his idea.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.250
But how he and The Good Wife writers kept
This a secret is really what’s impressive

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.250
here.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.310
They’re the “dropping a secret Beyonce
album”

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.410
Of the television world right now.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.320
I for one will be mourning the loss of Will
Gardner for years to come.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.320
I’m confused and angry and I don’t know
what.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.690
And I know this is The Good Wife
I know this is about Alicia and her journey

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.160
And this will only make her storylines more
compelling.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.590
But shit, this is one of the most shocking
TV deaths we’ve seen in years.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.570
And I’m seriously going to talk to my therapist
about it tomorrow

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.570
Which is ridiculous I know, but omg Will!

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.570
You want a hug?

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.570
Yes Will yessss!

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.570
