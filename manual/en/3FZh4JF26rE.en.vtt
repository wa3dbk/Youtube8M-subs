00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
When the teams are gone,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And we're left, 
We're left here all alone,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
When you thought for sure,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You're in

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The Pac 10.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It sucks to be Baylor,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It makes me want to cry.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It sucks to be Baylor,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
All the time.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Our mascot is a bear,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We are green.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
(laughter)

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
(Everybody come on!)
(In your cars!)

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It sucks to be Baylor,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It makes me want to cry.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It makes me want to cry.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
(What does it do Houston?)

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It sucks to be Baylor,
(Sing it with us Liucci!)

00:01:56.000 --> 00:05:56.000
All the time.
(Yeah!)
