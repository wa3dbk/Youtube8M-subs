00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.470
Today well be test fitting the Glacier Cable
snow tire chain, part number PW1034.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.130
Weve got 225 5017 tires on our 2012 Ford Fusion.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.730
Make sure to check the owners manual for your
vehicle before you go to purchase or install

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.150
tire chains.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.610
Our Fusions a front wheel drive vehicle so
well be mounting the tire chains up on the

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.610
front.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.850
Well start over her on the drivers side and
the installation will be the exact same over

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.170
on the passengers side.The first thing we
need to is turn the wheel all the way to the

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.170
side.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.180
Well lay out our chain flat on the ground
to make sure theres no kinks or tangles.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.829
On the one end we have the key hole connector
and on the other end we have a series of stops

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.090
crimped onto the cable.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.010
This is how well attach the chains around
the tire.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.240
We also want to make sure that each cross
piece has the hook facing away from the tire.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.800
Well lay the chain up on top of our tire and
well make sure that its even from the inboard

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.899
side tote outboard side.Well pull the chain
around and stick our first cross piece just

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.100
at the front edge of the tire.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:49.390
Well roll the vehicle forward slowly, about
one half to three quarters 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.550
of a turn.
