00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.720
DR.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.260
LIEBERMAN: I think there's a number of key
elements to good running form.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.549
The first is not to overstride.

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.799
Overstriding is when you stick your leg out
in front of you and you land with your foot

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.789
in front of your knee and really way in front
of your hip.

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.910
A lot of people think they're running hard
when they do that.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.910
You know why?

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.910
Because they are running hard.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.679
Because when you stick your leg out in front
of you, you actually decelerate in the time

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.699
it takes the center of mass of your body to
get over your foot, you're actually losing

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:31.699
energy.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.404
The other thing that happens when you overstride
is that you stick foot out in front of you

00:00:34.404 --> 00:00:35.600
and make your leg stiffer.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.970
And you have what's called an impact peak
and you have this shock wave that ripples

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.340
up your body.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.500
But when you land without an overstride you
don't have that jolt of force and you're much

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.550
less likely to get injured.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.820
It's just a better way to run.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.420
Another key element to running is to land
with a pretty flat foot.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.970
I think that most good runners tend to land
on the ball of their foot.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.120
It just happens naturally.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.450
If you don't stick your leg out in front of
you, you will not land hard on your heel.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.760
You'll land on the ball of your fit or your
mid foot stride, but it's a gentle landing.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.760
Don't lean.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.500
A lot of runners lean forward at the hips.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.060
That's another total evil.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.470
Be vertical from the hips up.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.990
If you can hear your feet, if your feet are
landing really hard.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.360
If you're thumping as we call it in our lab,
it's a sign that you're running poorly.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.600
The thump is the sound of the collision of
your body hitting the ground.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.840
Running should be light and gentle and collision
free so if you're making a lot of noise, you're

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.870
running poorly.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.571
And then finally, the most important thing
if you're learning to run properly and you

00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:43.590
haven't been doing this for a long time, listen
to pain.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.740
Don't overdo it.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.940
Transition really slowly and gradually.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.010
Your body is not designed for this explicitly.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.380
If you transition into learning how to run
properly too fast, you are guaranteed to injure

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.380
yourself.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.990
You have to adapt your body.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.371
Everybody can learn to run this way, or most
people can learn to run this way, but you

00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:01.371
can't do it overnight.

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:01.600
