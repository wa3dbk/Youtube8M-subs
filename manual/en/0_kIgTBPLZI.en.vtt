00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.600
[Joyce Moore]
South Llano is their life blood...it's one

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.009
of the purest rivers, unspoiled rivers, left
in Texas.

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.490
[Gary Garrett] (releasing bass fingerlings)
You can't catch these in an ugly place. They

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.679
live in some of the most beautiful places
in the world, certainly in Texas.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:13.440
[Znobia Wootan - President, South Llano Watershed
Alliance]

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.510
The river can help this little town and it's
a beautiful little town.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.050
[Tom Vandivier - Director, South Llano Watershed
Alliance]

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.600
I think there is more and more recognition
in this state that water is becoming a scarce

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.850
resource.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.650
[Znobia Wootan - President, South Llano Watershed
Alliance]

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.949
The people are coming to the Llano. The word
is out. So you need to be able to educate

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.720
people on the right way to take care of it
so that we can all enjoy it.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.970
((boots walking on dry creek bed))

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.050
[Narration]
The ongoing drought has taken a toll on this

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.300
spring.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.420
[TomVandivier]
This dry wash you see here is the site of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.260
Llano Spring and where it used to flow into
the blue hole in the Llano.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.219
((dog splashes in water))

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.760
[Tom]
Still enough water for the dog anyway.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.760
[Narration]
But on the east bank of the river, the springs

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.579
are still flowing. And the Vandiviers take
that as a good sign of the land management

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.070
practices they've instilled over the years.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.000
[Tom]
Extensive cedar clearing, prescribed burns,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
130 or so header dams, grazing practices...
Even with the severity of the drought that

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.950
we're working with, I'm absolutely sure we're
in better condition than we would have been

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.880
if we hadn't done these stewardship practices.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.280
((computer clicks))

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.799
[Narration]
And that's the message behind the South Llano

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.180
Watershed Alliance. Comprised of landowners,
like the Vandiviers, and stakeholders from

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.619
numerous organizations, the alliance is dedicated
to preserving and enhancing the river and

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.619
adjoining watersheds by encouraging land and
water stewardship through collaboration, education

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:39.409
and community participation.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.689
[Tom Arsuffi - Director, Texas Tech University
Llano River Field Station]

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:46.270
It's a heck of a lot cheaper to keep a watershed
and a river flowing before it goes bad than

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.110
to try and fix it after it deteriorates.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.119
[Narration]
Holding workshops for landowners along the

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.229
Llano and opening a new paddling trail are
two of the major educational tools for the

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:57.479
Alliance.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.729
[Marvin Ivy - Junction Police Chief and SLWA
Member]

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.210
The paddling trail seemed to be a good way
to publicize how long the trip was going to

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.130
take, and what type of equipment was needed.
And also guard the property rights of the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.280
landowners along the river.
Property that's for sale along the river is

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.430
now advertised in the paper as being "on the
paddling trails" like that's a benefit and

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.370
a plus!

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.830
((kayakers))

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.830
[Narration]
Today, a group of experts float the river

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.300
to take note of where the river needs help.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.200
[Gary Garrett - Director of Conservation,
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.890
What holds these banks together is a network
of roots that acts like a basket to hold this

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.430
structure together. And there's just no riparian
forest here. So we need more grasses, more

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.110
trees, more root structure.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.989
[Narration]
And to marvel at the wonders the river has

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:38.310
to offer.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.560

[Jason Singhurst - Botanist, Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department]

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.810
This is Spring Run Whitehead. This plant is
relatively rare and only known from four counties

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.920
in Texas and Coahuila, Mexico. It's basically
the only submerged aquatic plant that looks

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.860
like red leaf lettuce under water.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.260
[Dr. Emily Seldomridge - Research Associate,
Texas Tech University and SLWA Member]

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.500
We're about to go through our studies area.
You'll see little flags up on the banks.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.319
I hope the alliance can have a strong grass
roots initiative in the community. I think

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.849
that they have a great partnership and a great
network with a lot of locals.

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:07.010
I think one of their proudest moments is with
the Oasis Wildfire that we had.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.290
((ominous music - over burned landscape))

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.280
[Narration]
In April 2011, a lightning strike burned nearly

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.060
10,000 acres of riparian and upland habitat
along the Llano River.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.659
[Scott Richardson - Former Director and President
of South Llano Watershed Alliance]

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.690
The concern from this fire was what was going
to happen to this land after it, if it could

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.940
recover.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.209
[Narration]
The answer was a demonstration workshop put

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.209
on by the Alliance to more than 80 landowners
affected by the wildfire. They were shown

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.129
man-made exclosures and natural exclosures
to protect new growth from browsing; cedar

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:44.519
slashed terracing and fiber rows to stop erosion;
even fiber blankets laid down in rows from

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.150
special seed mix developed for scorched land.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.540
[Scott Richardson]
We've lost a lot of soil up here, up to two

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.330
to three inches on these slopes. But what
we are seeing is vegetation coming back from

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.709
the roots and from the seeds. So the good
news of all this is that the land is starting

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:59.230
to recover.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.409
[Marvin Ivy]
We realized that part of our tourism dollars

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.060
here is not just hunting anymore. It's all
of the other things that you can do in a beautiful

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.840
country like this. Paddling and fishing. The
fishing in this river is great. And a lot

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.220
of people come here to catch the Guadalupe
bass.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.970
This is one of the only rivers in Texas where
you can actually see all four species of the

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:17.220
Kingfisher that are native.

[Znobia Wootan - President, South Llano Watershed
Alliance]]

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.460
The boundary of the land where it meets the
river, so much life goes on there. You have

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.810
your nesting birds, you have you're tadpoles,
your baby fish. You also have your big grasses

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.990
filtering runoff from the land.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.910
[TomVandivier]
Good stewardship equals good habitat, which

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.110
equals good water resources. And water resources
are good not only for a piece of land like

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.389
ours, but they're good for everybody in the
state of Texas.

[Znobia Wootan - President, South Llano Watershed
Alliance]]

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:47.680
Getting one neighbor to talk to another neighbor
on how to have a healthy riparian is going

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.729
to be the greatest chance of success because
you're not ever going to be able to reach

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:49.979
every single person in one workshop.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.070
[Joyce Moore - Technical Guidance Biologist,
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.550
They're very unique in that they are the only
one, alliance, of this sort to my knowledge.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.790
[Narration]
And with cooperation, comes hope.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.979
[TomVandivier]
I do believe it will run again. It was a beautiful,

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.729
pristine hill country spring, and was the
pride of this ranch. And we can't help but

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:04.979
believe that it will come back.
