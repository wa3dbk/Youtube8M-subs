00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
The MCC-Blue River Trailblazer Soccer Teams,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.170
took over Van Hook park in Independence for some

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.770
sweltering, preseason conditioning.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.500
Dave Owens&gt;&gt; Blue River soccer team the Trailblazers,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.570
do a two week training camp beginning the first Monday in August.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.140
That training camp goes from seven til noon,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.080
the first couple hours we do fitness....

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.780
so today we're doing a little speed and agility work,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.150
as well as an interval run.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.920
The whole goal obviously is to get the players in as fit of condition as possible.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.360
One of the things is we want to be smart.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.860
One of the reasons go 7-noon is to get before the heat of the day.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.630
Make sure we give them an hour break between the two sessions....

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.660
...so they can get alot of fluids in them.  We take alot of water breaks.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.770
As much as I want to win, it doesn't do anything unless the athletes are safe.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.670
Brad Childers&gt;&gt; As usual, it seems like pre-season hits and the heat index goes to about 110.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.840
So, we're really trying to keep a close eye on the athletes....

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.150
and they're doing unbelieveably well.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.080
The character of these kids and how they push themselves,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.090
is noteable, it's outstanding, and it's different than most.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.660
I'm very very proud of them.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.990
Zane C.&gt;&gt; We have 5 returning players, and they're all solid.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.100
I watched a couple guys play yesterday, and it looks good.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.260
The incoming talent looks real good.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.030
Cecilia P.&gt;&gt; It's really hot today.  It's suppose to be the hottest day.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.740
But, the girls are doing really well, we're all staying positive...

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.670
Pushing each other, got some high expectations, we got some really good recruits...

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.480
The girls are all working really hard and we're hosting regionals, so...

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.950
Hopeing to do as well as the guys did last year, maybe even better maybe.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.180
VO&gt;&gt; And to help obtain their goals, Dean of Students Jon Burke boasted moral

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.020
by joining in the work out.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.120
Cecilia&gt;&gt; Yeah, he's awesome. He's encouraging us while we're running...

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.720
and he sometimes gets ahead of us, but that just makes us

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.190
run faster, catch up with the old guy. (Laugh)

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.130
Jessie&gt;&gt; It's really tough, but...

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.100
it just pushing us even harder. Getting us ready.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.070
Hopefully preparing us better than last year,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.140
and preparing us for Maple Woods, of course

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.840
cause they're one of our enemies. (Laugh)

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.610
VO&gt;&gt; A rivalry, I'm sure all of MCC is looking foward to.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.780
