00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:14.959
In a world where zombie’s have already infected
every facet of pop culture

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.219
comes another zombie movie.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.219
But this time...

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:18.750
it’s got Brad Pitt!

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.700
World War Z.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.380
Get ready for the big-screen adaptation of
the best-selling novel that’s got everything

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.390
you loved about...

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.340
the title.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.340
And nothing else.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.210
A film with so many production problems, people
were genuinely surprised when it wasn’t

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.460
a complete disaster.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.890
Meet Gerry Lane, he’s just your average
everyday

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.960
Super attractive

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.960
Scarf-wearing

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.960
Spanish-speaking

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.960
Airplane-piloting

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.960

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.960

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.960
Armor-crafting

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.960
Arm-chopping

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.960

Stay-at-home Dad.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.160
“All you do is make pancakes in the morning!"

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.239
"Yeah, but I'm really good at it."

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.570
Travel the globe with Brad Pitt and the film’s
screenwriters as they stumble from set-piece

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.780
to set-piece tied together by the flimsiest
evidence ever.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.720
“There was a memo sent from this installation
that had the word zombie in it.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.720
Do you know anything about it?"

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.950
"It was an email, not a memo."

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.950
Come on.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.579
Watch Brad Pitt survive an unsurvivable apocalypse
thanks to a constant stream of life-saving

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.490
coincidences like...

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.930
never hitting traffic in the middle of mass
hysteria,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.060
finding an RV with the keys and a loaded gun
inside,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.619
this friendly mugger showing him where to
find medicine,

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.719
this friendly Mexican family taking him in
no questions asked,

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.930
these fast zombies who slow down as soon as
they’re about to catch him,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.579
this small child head-shotting a zombie on
top of him,

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.289
this plane dropping a ladder down to save
him mid-takeoff,

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.549
this Israeli soldier killing a zombie about
to eat him,

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.039
surviving this car crash,

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.509
surviving this plane crash,

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.609
surviving this spike through his stomach,

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:55.240
and shooting up with a randomly picked virus
that happens to be curable while also serving

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.090
as zombie camouflage.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.209
Wait, is that Matthew Fox?

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:05.499
So get ready for a by-the-numbers action movie
full of PG-13 violence

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:12.880
and none of these awesome things from the
book:

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.320
Man, what a waste of good source material.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.320
Starring

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.400
these zombie movie cliches:

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.980
dead car batteries,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.020
flickering lights,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.070
shakey cam,

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.380
jump scares,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.380
zombies banging on doors,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.350
a kid with asthma,

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.730
accidental noises,

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.670
and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.800
obligatory

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.800
Inceptions

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.740
Bwaas.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.550
Brad Pitt Zombie Movie.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.590
Man, all those reshoots must've cost a fortune.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.590
How'd they pay for that?

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:08.110
Man, that 
really makes me want a Coke.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.110
Thanks for watching!

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:19.600
