00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.790
The brand Bose draws a lot of criticism from

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.170
audio circles for making
overpriced

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.719
and under-performing products and
marketing the heck out of them.

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.170
Well I got a pair of the new Bose SoundTrue

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.100
on-ear portable headphones. What do I think of them? Have I finally sold my soul to the devil?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.590
Well you're watching Lachlan Likes A Thing, and let's find out!

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.400
Hey everyone!

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.349
Welcome to Lachlan Likes A Thing, the show where I take a thing and see

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.560
whether or not I like it.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.460
Now the thing we're looking at in this video is the Bose SoundTrue

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.390
On-Ear portable headphones. Now this
is the first Bose product that I've

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.910
ever owned - well technically it's the
second Bose product I've ever owned because

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.250
the first was the Bose

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.050
SoundTrue around ear headphones wichh
I bought and unboxed on this channel and

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.440
then had to return because I found out
that they weren't sealing properly with the

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.070
pair of glasses that I was wearing

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.559
and I swapped them for  these, these are the Bose on ear versions.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.629
And then I found out that those glasses actually prevented a lot of headphones from

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.920
sealing properly so I had to swap glasses as well, so

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.530
long story short this is the Bose SoundTrue

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.100
On Ear. This is part of Bose's new
SoundTrue lineup of headphones.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.380
It retails for $180 recommended retail

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.570
in the United States and $229

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.770
recommended retail price in Australia
though I got my pair for $200

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.060
at JB Hi-Fi. Anyway let's start with the
design! So as soon as you pick up the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.170
Bose SoundTrue you can tell that this

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.490
is an extremely compact, extremely

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.520
light weight headphone.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.590
It almost feels a little flimsy just
because of how lightweight and flexible

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.409
it really is but at the same time all
the materials chosen

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.670
seem to be high quality plastics so
it's hard to say,

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.119
I would have to really look at long-term
durability from people's kinda

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.770
reports of this headphone. I think that it
should be a pretty well built headphone

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.659
apart from general
light weight does have a decent build to it.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.599
It is also an extremely compact
headphone

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.280
because you can basically fold this up

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.650
into this kind of tiny shape here which
is really remarkable.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.700
The only other headphone that I've seen
that can fold up into

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.849
as small shape is the Koss Porta Pro and
that thing is basically -

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.730
you know -  that basically is a
headphone with drivers attached -

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.209
sorry a headband with drivers attached.
So that's an exxtremely simplistic design so,

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.879
I have kind of commend Bose for making a product which

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.170
is, you know, very very compact and very
very easy to just

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.209
tuck away so if you don't have much room
in your bag

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.040
I suppose this is a big selling point for the SoundTrue.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.239
The other thing about the Bose SoundTrue

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.300
is that it does have a detachable cable

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.349
though it uses a what looks like a

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.379
proprietary connector so you're not going to be able to replace it with any

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.629
aftermarket cables. This is a 4 pin,

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.370
maybe even smaller than 2.5mm, Im not
sure, so you gonna have to go to

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.470
Bose if you ever break the cable. The cable itself has

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.879
a kind of smart phone remote on it and the
actual cable

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.870
is... it's not the greatest in terms of
quality, as you can see it retains a

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.300
fair bit of memory.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.129
It's not particularly supple and it does tangle quite easily.

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.180
On the end of the cable there is

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.819
a 3.5mm four

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.420
pin terminal. The thing about this
connector

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.890
is that it is a straight angle connector
which is really quite

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.470
unfortunate because it is gonna stick
out of your pocket little bit and I

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.390
would have preferred a ninety degree angle

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.489
connector. So that's a bit of an oversight.
So moving on to comfort

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.060
the Bose SoundTrue on-ear is
probably

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.150
the most comfortable on ear headphone

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.799
that I have ever tried and this is both
because of

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.349
its low clamping force and also

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.000
because of its very very lightweight.
So

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.659
its - you're not going to completely forget that it's on your years because it

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.699
actually is sitting right on top of your ears and it's still going to touch your skin

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.540
and not everyone loves on-ear headphones
for that reason but apart from that

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.320
they are headphones that are just very very easy to just

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.490
wear for hours and hours. Because of the
low clamping force

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.949
they don't feel is stable on the head as
I think that they

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.060
could feel. They're certainly not going
to be good for running or anything like that.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.610
They're not gonna fall right ahead if you do some head banging or

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.259
anything like that but they will shift
around a bit so

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.669
they are a little less stable on the head
than something like the

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.640
Sennheiser Amperior.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.840
And also noise isolation on the Bose SoundTrue on-ear

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.600
is just a little bit on the poorer side.
You do find that you have to turn up the

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.220
volume just to get above the average background
noise. 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.540
So how did the Bose SoundTrue on-ears sound?

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.080
Well after listening to this
for a while

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.889
I now understand why opinions on Bose
can be so divided

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.820
because this is a headphone that is

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.990
inoffensive to the point of being
offensive.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.690
What I mean by that is that the SoundTrue
has a really warm

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.750
agreeable sound, it's definitely been
tuned to a specific

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.639
kind of signature. It has a
surprising amount of bass

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.699
for such a small headphone. The mids are
smoothed,

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.169
there's a nice amount of energy to
the vocals

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.550
but where it really runs into trouble is
with the

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.650
treble because the treble is rolled
off

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.100
on the Bose SoundTrue. And its rolled off
in a way that

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.289
it doesn't make it sound congested but
it does mean that

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.800
it is rolled up to the point where it
really is lacking

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.830
in detail in terms of sound. It makes the soundstage

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.900
seem more compressed and more
intimate than it really is so

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.210
as a result its it's going to be a
headphone it's really going to be

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.860
pleasing to people who

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.789
who are - who are sensitive to
sibilance. It's gonna be

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.910
good in terms of signature for noisy environments when you have to turn up the

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.840
volume and

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.050
and you don't hurt your ears from aggressive treble

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.319
but at the same time it really lacks a
degree of detail

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:32.690
when you put it up against things
like the Sennheiser Amperior or

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.009
a number kind of portable on ear
headphones.

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:39.350
So its, its the kind of sound where I
wear it

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.970
and you know if I wasn't comparing it
directly to anything else I could

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.150
quite enjoy it. I actually think it's a
nice enough tuning

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.440
but as soon as I put it up against
anything that's in its kinda price range I

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.400
think 'Oh',

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.979
I'm missing out a lot in terms of

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.190
energy and shimmer and kinda detail and
texture

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.630
in the treble. Looking at it overall I
think the Bose SoundTrue

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.630
doesn't sound bad but it is a bit
disappointing

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.919
for the retail price. If it was
price closer to 100 to 130 dollars I'd

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:16.530
be happy to recommend it because it is a
very comfortable headphone

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.460
It seems decently bill at the same
time.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.870
But right now I just don't think it's
a good buy compared to other options

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.889
like the Sennheiser Amperior and

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:29.150
I'll actually be reviewing the V-Moda XS

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.270
on the channel soon so I suspect
that this headphone

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.389
won't compare favorably with the V-Moda XS

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:40.840
either. But, you know I don't love the

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.900
Bose SoundTrue on-ear but if you think that comfort

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.780
and compactness are you absolute top
priorities

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.560
I think you'll find a lot to like in the
SoundTrue on-ear.
