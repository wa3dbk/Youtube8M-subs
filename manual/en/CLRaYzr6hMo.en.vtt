Hi, my name is Joseph Goodman. I am from Germany.
I am a cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.490
In 2013 I received a letter from Craig Grey.
He described in detail his constant struggle

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.490
with life, relationship, employment opportunities
and his desire for new smile. He�s been

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.939
living with his sick dad in a back of the
storage facility for years. When his father

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.529
had a stroke and needed a 24 hour attention
the life got worse. Hi, my name is Craig Grey.

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.509
I am 42 years old. Always had bad teeth and
it�s been progressively getting worse last

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:36.260
three years. I feel lost. He was not a drug
addict, but one would not believe judging

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.540
him by his looks. I have very few teeth left.
I�ve gone without teeth and being able to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.110
smile for a long time. I am going to see Doctor
Goodman, see what he can do for my teeth.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.300
I could have given him a donation and let
him go his way, but I knew he wouldn�t go

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.690
far with it, so I decided to help him a different
way. This opportunity that Dr. Goodman had

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.079
presented is a fantastic thing. Over all the
health of your teeth has been detracting for

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.259
how long? For many years. He really needed,
since he was very young, an orthodontist to

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.290
straighten out his teeth. His mother would
not take him to the dentist. And when he really

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.670
started to have cavities, then she still wouldn�t
take him. I�m always in pain and it hurts

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:27.810
a lot. The overall appearance starts with
a smile. A beautiful smile can create confidence.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.079
I can�t smile at all because of my teeth.
We�re going to make it happen today. Whatever

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:37.020
we can do for you, we will get it done. Sounds
good. We took your X-rays and here is what

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.109
we have. These are all of your teeth. You
have enough good, healthy bone. These two

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.759
front teeth are ok we can fix them, we can
keep them. This is a root tip. When we remove

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.399
your teeth I will give you local anesthetic,
which means that you will be aware of what�s

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.869
going on, but you will not feel any pain.
There will be no pain. Basically, when you

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.610
will walk out of the office you will have
no more broken teeth, no more infection. This

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.369
is serious business what Dr. Goodman is doing.
It�s a really big case. Ok, let�s get

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.340
started. I restored every single tooth in
his mouth one by one and I decided to give

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.880
him a million dollar smile. My goal was to
help Craig help himself. A new smile would

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:27.240
do so much for me. Give me back that confidence
and rebuild my self esteem. It�s quiet challenging.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.360
The most challenging case we�ve ever had.
Every patient is important to us. We�re

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:47.310
trying to make this experience as pleasant
as possible. This is it. This is the moment

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.500
we are going to reveal your smile. I am, myself,
is very very excited. I did what I could do

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:03.000
and here we are. It all started in a waiting
room. You and your dad. This was you. There

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.780
are so many teeth I had to work on, I mean,
there was so much infection and gum decease.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:21.870
And this is today. What a change. What a change
from the two month ago to here. Thank you!

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:36.040
Of course, I know how important this is for
you. Thank you, Dr. Goodman. I started this

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.681
campaigned to stop his decade journey through
extreme hardship, hunger, desperation, and

00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:51.260
even worse hopelessness. Now I have a chance
and I owe it to Dr. Goodman. One year after

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.930
we restored Craig�s smile my plan did not
work and destiny was not kind to him. Craig

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.740
and his father were evicted. His father became
more ill and now money doesn�t cover medication

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.210
and food. Please help this video go viral.
Let�s make this fundraiser a success for

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.230
Craig.
