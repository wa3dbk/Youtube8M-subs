I'm going to talk about the Yngwie Malmsteen Fender strat guitar.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.160
I always played Ibanez guitars, and still do, but this Malmsteen Fender is awesome!

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.200
This Fender stratocaster, as with all strats, is a work of art.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.020
The scalloped fretboard is very easy to play on, for me. Everyone is different. I love the scalloped fretboard.

00:01:45.118 --> 00:01:49.598
Scalloped fretboards require a very delicate touch when playing.
