Good morning I am Flavio Oreda and I'm working for the Oreda and Partners' s Studio, we are in Cenate Sotto and this is a Villa we built in 2013.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Our client was already informed about the benefits of a wooden structure and after an initial design phase, 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 in collaboration with Marlegno we found an architectural solution for the home's structure.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
from an initial design phase

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.500
new architectural solution

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.000
 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Our Studio has always believed in this type of construction due to the high energy and acoustic performance.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.500
speed and energy performance

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Quality of living

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
in harmony with the environment

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.500
good comfort

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This house is built with natural insulation outside but also inside the structure,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 and allows an excellent thermal insulation.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:02:00.000
The house is also built in order to receive a lot of light, 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
in fact all windows are south facing

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.500
and they allow  good insulation from the heat of the sun during summer months.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.500
attention to details

00:02:50.500 --> 00:03:00.000
At the center of the project were attention to details and use of natural materials.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The customer is very satisfied and enjoy the benefits of a wooden house.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.000
Your satisfaction is Our satisfaction
