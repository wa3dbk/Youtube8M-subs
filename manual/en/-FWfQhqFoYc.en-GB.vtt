00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Do you have a girlfriend? Do you think she'd
be upset?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I think she will, but come here.
We won't tell anyone.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Can I have a hug?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Oh, thank you.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You don't speak English?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Do you like this?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Do you like hugging?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.700
So today has to be my favourite day of the
year. Yes, today is National Hugging Day,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.550
so to celebrate and help spread the love,
I'm going to try to hug as many people as

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.789
possible, but what they don't know is that
I'm secretly trying to break a world record

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.590
of the longest hug ever. Things are going
to get awkward. Let the cuddling commence.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.570
I want a hug for International Hugging Day.
Give me a hug?

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.400
Do you like hugs?
Yeah.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.900
Because they say that hugs make you feel less
stressful.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.500
Mmhmm.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.700
Does this make you feel less stressful?
No.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.300
Fantastic.
How do Americans hug?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.300
Do they cling on for quite a long time?
They pick you up and lift you off your feet.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.300
Is this making you feel more relaxed?
Yeah, even more than that.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.899
Oh really?

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.600
Where are you from?
South Africa.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.000
Oh my God, I love South Africa.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.300
Yourself? Where are you from?
I love safaris.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.019
I feel a connection here, do you? I feel a
bond.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.300
Can I have a group hug? Yay! Guys this is
so great.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.600
Oh, this is nice. You're really warm.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.000
I don't know what you're saying, but I'm sure
it's great.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.300
Are you a model? You're really good looking.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.279
Yeah, I am a model.
You actually are a model?

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.049
This is becoming creepy now.

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.139
I'm going to go with this one. I might go
straight as well.

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:24.369
Is this normal for Londoners?

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.299
Yeah, and usually they last for about 20 seconds
and then we do this and we do a high five

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.000
and then we do this. You don't slap mine.
You slap yours. But you know...

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.400
I was a little confused.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.000
Are you the gingerbread man?
I am.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.400
Oh my God. You smell like ginger.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.009
Um, international hugging day, so I'm trying
to hug as many people as I can. Do you like

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.300
this hug? Oh, thank you. I thought you were
ET, but you're Yoda, aren't you?

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.000
Can I hug you?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.200
Is that a yes?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.500
Aw, this is nice. That's the best hug I've
ever had. Thank you very much.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.200
We've got a connection. A connection. Amor.
Amore!

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.600
Are you happier now that you've had a hug?
Now that I've had a hug, I'm extremely more

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.189
happy than I was before I arrived here.

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.800
I felt a connection there. Did you?
Yeah, I did.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.500
Could be love.
Possibly.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.300
You've got great hair and a great face. How
was that hug out of 10 for you?

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.150
I went to Cardiff for a day, and I loved it.
Do you like my Welsh accent?

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.469
It's alright. It's a bit Nordic.

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.600
National Hugging Day?
Not on TV. Come on, give me some love.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.100
So there we have it. My secret mission is
complete, so I might not have officially broken

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.510
the world record, but the lovely Giuseppe
gave me a whole minute of cuddling. So guys,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.849
I've spread the love. Make sure you do the
same. Happy hugging.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.000
I've always said I wanted to marry an Italian
and live in Italy, so maybe it could happen.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.209
What's your number?
Oh, are you serious? Oh!

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.100
Spread the love! National Hugging Day. Thank
you. Thank you. Bye, gold man.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.099
Spread the love! It's National Hugging Day!
That was really nice.
