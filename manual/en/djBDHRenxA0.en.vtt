00:00:18.806 --> 00:00:21.576
&gt;&gt; Welcome to another installment
of the AMSOIL Information Series.

00:00:21.576 --> 00:00:22.656
I'm Rob Stenberg.

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:23.586
And it's time.

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:25.726
It's that time of the year
to put the boats away.

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:29.316
As you can tell, in this part of the country
we already have a little snow on the ground.

00:00:29.546 --> 00:00:33.296
So you want to make sure that those boats
are put away so they're ready for springtime.

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:34.956
So we decided to go on the road.

00:00:34.956 --> 00:00:39.456
We're going to talk to the experts at RJ
Sport and Cycle in Hermantown, Minnesota,

00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:44.266
to get some tips on making sure that your boat
is well taken care of during the winter months.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.176
Stan, how are you doing today?

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:47.786
&gt;&gt; Hi, Rob.

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:50.216
&gt;&gt; Thanks for allowing us to be here today.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.166
We really appreciate it.

00:00:51.406 --> 00:00:53.116
Stan from RJ Sport and Cycle.

00:00:53.456 --> 00:00:56.916
We're here today to get some great
tips on winterizing our boat.

00:00:57.326 --> 00:00:58.126
Who do we need to talk to?

00:00:58.526 --> 00:01:00.496
&gt;&gt; We're going to go talk to
Jeff, our service manager.

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:01.916
He's been here for 30 years.

00:01:02.336 --> 00:01:03.246
He knows all about it.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.716
Let's go see what he's got to say.

00:01:04.716 --> 00:01:05.626
&gt;&gt; Sounds like he's the expert.

00:01:05.626 --> 00:01:05.946
Let's go.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:06.606
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:08.526
&gt;&gt; Jeff, how are you doing today?

00:01:08.796 --> 00:01:09.166
&gt;&gt; Hi, Rob.

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:10.786
&gt;&gt; Hey. We appreciate you being here today.

00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:15.696
We hear you're the expert, so we want to talk
to you about winterizing our outboard engines.

00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:20.396
So what is the very first thing I need to do
to make sure that we winterize this correctly?

00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:22.566
&gt;&gt; You should do the fuel system first.

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:29.206
Add fuel stabilizer to your gas tank or
add fuel stabilizer the last trip out.

00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:33.736
You need to run it long enough to get it into
the whole motor, so that takes the longest.

00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:35.016
&gt;&gt; You want to get it through that system.

00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:36.186
&gt;&gt; You want to get it through the system.

00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:39.196
&gt;&gt; Well, AMSOIL's got a great product
for that, so we can help folks with that.

00:01:39.476 --> 00:01:43.216
&gt;&gt; Fill your gas tank to keep
moisture out over the winter.

00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:48.766
Once you've done your fuel system, then you need
to -- the next step would be to do the two oils.

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:50.806
You can do the lower unit oil.

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:53.456
The lower unit will have two screws.

00:01:53.726 --> 00:01:56.616
It will have an oil level
screw and an oil drain screw.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:57.606
You take them both out.

00:01:57.606 --> 00:01:59.176
The oil will drain out in a pan.

00:01:59.406 --> 00:02:03.186
You put your oil fill container
in the bottom hole.

00:02:03.276 --> 00:02:06.156
If you have like a pump, you
pump it in till it fills it up,

00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:07.576
and all the air will come out the top.

00:02:07.576 --> 00:02:08.906
Once you get oil out the top --

00:02:09.036 --> 00:02:11.666
&gt;&gt; You want to make sure that
that lower unit is full of oil.

00:02:11.786 --> 00:02:14.446
&gt;&gt; You're getting rid of the moisture,
and you're getting rid of the old oil.

00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:17.206
&gt;&gt; And moisture is not a good
thing, especially all winter.

00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:18.006
It doesn't want to sit.

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:18.436
Okay.

00:02:18.436 --> 00:02:21.466
&gt;&gt; And then replace your
two drain screw washers.

00:02:22.236 --> 00:02:24.636
Put your -- tighten them up.

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:26.646
Your lower unit's full of oil.

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:28.496
&gt;&gt; Okay. And then we move to the engine.

00:02:28.496 --> 00:02:33.626
&gt;&gt; A four-stroke like this one is, you would
change engine oil and oil filter, again,

00:02:33.626 --> 00:02:35.886
to get rid of any moisture,
and you're getting rid

00:02:35.886 --> 00:02:38.666
of old contaminated oil from
the combustion motor.

00:02:38.776 --> 00:02:41.066
&gt;&gt; And you don't want that
sitting in your engine all winter.

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:43.256
You want to get that fresh
stuff in there for protection.

00:02:43.256 --> 00:02:44.746
&gt;&gt; Yup. You want to store it with fresh oil.

00:02:44.856 --> 00:02:50.486
The two-stroke like the one next
door, you would do the lower unit.

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:51.816
You don't have an engine oil.

00:02:53.096 --> 00:02:55.806
So then you would -- you'd
want to fog the motors.

00:02:55.806 --> 00:02:56.456
&gt;&gt; On both of them?

00:02:56.456 --> 00:02:57.336
&gt;&gt; It's called fogging.

00:02:57.336 --> 00:03:00.916
It's an aerosol product that
comes out in a foam.

00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:02.646
&gt;&gt; AMSOIL's got a great product for that.

00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:05.456
&gt;&gt; The two-stroke, being it
doesn't have any engine oil,

00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:09.306
you would fog through the intake system
so it coats the whole inside of the motor

00:03:09.566 --> 00:03:11.096
because there's no engine oil in there.

00:03:11.936 --> 00:03:15.726
Unlike the four-stroke, you could just fog
in the spark plug holes because you're really

00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:19.966
after the cylinders and piston rings because
there's oil on the rest of the motor.

00:03:20.126 --> 00:03:20.436
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:24.216
&gt;&gt; You'd want to grease any fittings.

00:03:24.216 --> 00:03:26.116
A lot of people forget to grease the fittings.

00:03:26.116 --> 00:03:28.236
&gt;&gt; They're easy to overlook.

00:03:28.236 --> 00:03:31.516
&gt;&gt; Yeah. There is water in the steering
components and the tilt components,

00:03:32.656 --> 00:03:35.986
and things we've just talked
about are good yearly maintenance,

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:37.746
too, not only just for storage.

00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:43.946
The fuel stabilizer and running the
motor is probably the most important.

00:03:44.306 --> 00:03:47.356
&gt;&gt; Okay. So I've got the -- I've
got the fuel stabilizer in there,

00:03:47.356 --> 00:03:49.506
lower units' changed, engine oil's changed.

00:03:49.506 --> 00:03:50.476
I've greased my points.

00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:52.346
What else do I need to do from this point?

00:03:52.606 --> 00:03:58.746
&gt;&gt; You would need to drain your live
wells, blow them out, add RV antifreeze.

00:03:58.746 --> 00:04:04.006
Your batteries, you need to charge and
unhook because there's memories in the boat

00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:07.156
that would drain the batteries over
the winter and then they would freeze.

00:04:07.156 --> 00:04:07.496
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:10.316
&gt;&gt; Your trailer, just kind of do a visual.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:17.726
If you see any broken or damaged components
or lights, you should repack wheel bearings

00:04:18.226 --> 00:04:20.306
because you can get water in
there just like the motor.

00:04:21.116 --> 00:04:24.126
You can freeze and end up
with rusty bearings next year.

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:26.226
&gt;&gt; And, when it freezes, it expands.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:28.546
Whether it's in the engine or -- yeah.

00:04:28.816 --> 00:04:29.446
Not a good thing.

00:04:29.516 --> 00:04:31.436
&gt;&gt; Things break.

00:04:31.766 --> 00:04:34.986
We've touched most of the main points
that you need to do for storage.

00:04:34.986 --> 00:04:40.356
You should probably look at your owner's manual
because there may be specifics for your motor.

00:04:40.356 --> 00:04:43.366
&gt;&gt; Sure. So now we've gone
through and we've done all this.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:47.316
Let me ask you one last question: What
happens if I don't do this maintenance?

00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:50.816
What kind of problems could I have?

00:04:50.816 --> 00:04:55.716
&gt;&gt; The biggest problem we have is
ending up with old gas; contaminated,

00:04:55.776 --> 00:04:58.876
plugged-up carburetors; not
starting at the dock.

00:04:59.086 --> 00:05:00.776
&gt;&gt; So you're sitting dead in the water.

00:05:00.876 --> 00:05:02.566
&gt;&gt; Repair bills in the spring.

00:05:02.566 --> 00:05:04.516
&gt;&gt; Okay. We've got enough problems there.

00:05:04.516 --> 00:05:06.006
We want to help people avoid those.

00:05:06.476 --> 00:05:06.956
Hey, Jeff.

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:07.456
Thanks a lot.

00:05:07.456 --> 00:05:08.336
Great information.

00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:09.506
Appreciate you being here.

00:05:09.506 --> 00:05:10.116
&gt;&gt; Thanks for coming.

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:12.966
&gt;&gt; For another AMSOIL Information
Series, I'm Rob Stenberg.

00:05:12.966 --> 00:05:13.816
Thanks for watching.

00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:14.626
We'll see you next time.
