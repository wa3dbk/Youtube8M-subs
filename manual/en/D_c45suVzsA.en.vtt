(upbeat music)

00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:09.042
- Hi, I'm Jerry James
Stone, and you're watching

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.644
Cooking Stoned.

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:12.880
Today's recipe, I'm going to make a

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.915
mango lassi popsicle.

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:16.651
The reason for this is because, well,

00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:18.419
I love mango lassis.

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:19.687
Well, one, I love mangoes.

00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:21.655
Two, I love mango lassis.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:26.059
And three, I love, love, love,
love, southern Indian food,

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:29.263
and I can't help myself but
get a mango lassi or three

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:31.583
when I go out for Indian food.

00:00:31.583 --> 00:00:33.901
And so I really wanted to create that,

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:35.002
but I didn't just want to create

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.970
a mango lassi, because I would, well,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.306
I would drink like buckets of them.

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:41.442
So I decided to make a popsicle to

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:42.909
hopefully slow myself down.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.332
So this mango lassi popsicle is

00:00:46.332 --> 00:00:48.248
just like a traditional lassi.

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.083
It's sort of a little bit different,

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.619
it's not just a plain mango
lassi popsicle, though.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.473
I kind of swirl it in
with some regular yogurt,

00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:58.291
so it kind of has a really
nice texture and look to it.

00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:00.093
I think you're really going to enjoy it.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.528
I know I will.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:04.664
So I have my fresh mango puree here.

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:08.135
This is two mangoes that have been cubed.

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:09.236
And if you don't know how to do that

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:12.973
you can just watch my
how-to video on doing that.

00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:14.875
So these two mangoes have been cubed,

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:16.076
and what I'm going to do now is

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:20.113
I'm going to add a half
cup of Greek yogurt.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:22.149
I'm going to add that to the mix.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.820
And this is just sort of to
create that lassi texture

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.689
and flavor that you're used to.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.627
It has that sort of
sweet/bitter taste to it,

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:35.595
which is just lovely, I love mango lassis.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.834
So we're going to add a
half cup of Greek yogurt.

00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:45.260
Hopefully don't spill it everywhere.

00:01:47.538 --> 00:01:49.777
Just get that extra stuff in there.

00:01:49.777 --> 00:01:50.569
Get it all out!

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.253
We don't want to waste any of it.

00:01:57.684 --> 00:02:00.086
Now I'm just going to whisk this together.

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.259
And now, based on the
popsicle mold that I have,

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.593
this mold holds just a little over

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:08.495
three cups of liquid, total.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.830
So I'm going to add
this to a measuring cup

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.134
that holds at least two cups,

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:18.005
and I'm going to fill the
remaining part of that

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:20.140
measuring cup with simple syrup.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.389
So I'm going to add this,
and I want two cups total

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.346
of this mango and yogurt mixture,

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.583
plus the simple syrup.

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:31.918
Now I'm just going to add
this mango and yogurt mixture

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.978
to my measuring cup so I know exactly

00:02:34.978 --> 00:02:36.991
how much simple syrup to add.

00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:39.112
The reason that you kind
of have to do it this way

00:02:39.112 --> 00:02:41.995
is because you don't know
exactly how much fruit

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.765
you're going to get out of each mango.

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:47.702
And there's no need for
it to be an exact science,

00:02:47.702 --> 00:02:50.972
so you just need to fill the
rest up with the simple syrup.

00:02:50.972 --> 00:02:53.907
So this gave me, let's see here,

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:57.177
I have just a little over a cup.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.046
About a cup and a half here.

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:03.691
So now I'm going to add a
half cup of simple syrup.

00:03:04.614 --> 00:03:07.981
And I'm just going to go ahead
and mix that all together.

00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:17.230
And this is pretty much a
lassi recipe right here.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.233
So what I'm going to do to
sort of make this unique,

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:22.135
and I think also make the
popsicles really beautiful,

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:27.073
is I'm going to make a sweetened
Greek yogurt mixture too.

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:30.143
So I'm going to swirl
this mixture together

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.479
with the Greek yogurt mixture.

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.347
So you're going to have
this kind of lovely,

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:38.852
almost cream-cicle-type popsicle,
as far as the texture goes

00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:41.906
but it's going to taste
like a mango lassi.

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:45.492
It's going to be amazing!

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:50.172
So now we're going to do another
half cup of Greek yogurt.

00:03:51.925 --> 00:03:56.069
Once again getting as much out
of there as you possibly can.

00:03:57.207 --> 00:03:59.378
And then we're just going to add

00:03:59.378 --> 00:04:03.412
another half cup of the simple syrup.

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.522
So that we have a cup total.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:12.700
And just like the mango
mixture, mix that all together.

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:18.558
Now, to thicken this up a
little bit, I'm going to put

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:21.661
both these in the refrigerator
for just about a half hour,

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:23.930
so they're not so runny.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.400
And then when I mix them
in the popsicle mold,

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.836
they'll get all nice and marbled.

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:31.800
Now that the mixture is
chilled, I'm just going to

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.578
fill up the popsicle mold
with alternating pours

00:04:36.578 --> 00:04:41.281
of the mango and yogurt and sugar mixture,

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:45.252
and this plain yogurt and sugar mixture.

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:49.936
So just go ahead and fill
in a little bit at a time.

00:04:51.675 --> 00:04:55.313
And you can do different
amounts in each one.

00:04:55.313 --> 00:04:56.886
The idea here is really
just to like kind of

00:04:56.886 --> 00:04:59.985
create this lovely marbled effect.

00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:02.977
Once again, not spilling it,
like I tend to do, everywhere.

00:05:02.977 --> 00:05:04.637
Surprised that anything even makes it

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.006
into these popsicle molds.

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:08.375
I'm so messy sometimes.

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:13.230
And now I'll just go ahead
and add in the yogurt mixture.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.384
Now, you only have a cup of
this so you're not going to do

00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:18.885
as heavy a pours.

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.954
You just want enough to
kind of like create this

00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:23.189
swirly...

00:05:24.927 --> 00:05:26.393
I can't even think of
a word to describe it.

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:27.661
You just want it to be pretty.

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:29.164
So, like, that's what I'm doing.

00:05:29.164 --> 00:05:31.948
I'm just kind of
alternating between the two

00:05:31.948 --> 00:05:35.385
to create a texture beyond

00:05:35.385 --> 00:05:38.315
just plain orange popsicles.

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:41.337
Not that there's anything wrong
with plain orange popsicles.

00:05:41.337 --> 00:05:43.677
I just wanted to kind
of create that sensation

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.479
of getting a mango lassi.

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.614
It's just a yogurt and mango drink,

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:49.483
so I'm trying to recreate that.

00:05:49.483 --> 00:05:51.418
Now I'll just add in the popsicle sticks.

00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:55.289
This mixture is pretty dense, so usually

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:59.493
I use the lid to the mold
to hold the sticks in place,

00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:01.755
but as you can see that is completely

00:06:01.755 --> 00:06:05.344
not required for these popsicles.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.401
Which is great because I find those lids

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.204
a little annoying at times.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.306
So just go ahead and put
your sticks in there.

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:15.141
You don't want to push
them all the way down.

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:17.744
Just enough to, you know, you don't want

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.480
the popsicle to fall off the stick,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.982
but you also want to
have some grippin' room.

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:25.585
So I don't know why I
said "gripping" like that.

00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:27.621
But grippin' room. You want that.

00:06:27.974 --> 00:06:31.808
(upbeat music)
