00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.430
so what's special about the university
of washington buffalo india program is

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.000
that it is practically reaching out to
business

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.980
you to learn what his changing

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.459
and both in the fields of process and
and technology

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.029
and why that is important is that if you
set curriculum within a year or two to three years

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.240
so much new information in new
things become

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.589
are brought to market.

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.179
and one of the things that graduates of
the University of Washington Bothell MBA

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.129
program who have great confidence and is
knowing what's available what are the

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:34.539
tools or the process where the
methodologies that will make the

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:35.190
relevant

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.410
in a very modern way

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.860
i was pleasantly surprised that within

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.000
six months of my graduation i was
recognized with the promotion

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.450
and since then i've got into more
promotions beyond that and so now i'm at

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.220
senior a check generalist focusing on
our field environment which the course

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.240
the largest group in eddie bauer

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.420
The faculty and

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.740
how they made themselves very approachable and available.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.080
the class was very small

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.150
It is 40 people; the professors knew each of us by name. And they knew what we

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.460
could bring what we've got to the class
and what we could offer.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.430
And they would adjust their

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.220
message in such a way that everybody got it.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.080
The professors were able to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.830
tune in and adjust their message according to the audience. Which was really great and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.610
made it very personal.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.229
There is so much personal interactions in the class; the professors

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:31.829
know

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.609
the students names by the third class
units that that small cohort that allows

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.440
them that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.120
that luxury but it's so

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.060
carefully tailored tidbit clients for
that serving so

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.470
it simply side location it's very
communion to get to the faculty really

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.630
world class that you can ask for better

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.930
and your cohort is amazing.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.400
before I went into the MBA program I
think like a lot of people

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.829
I was

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.400
successful in the sense that i was
making a decent living working

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.700
either in the public or the private
sector i was in the private sector

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.790
but i didn't feel challenge and i was
afraid to take those leaps. And

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.270
the MBA program allowed me to have
the courage, even before I finished it.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.529
To take bigger risks with myself and with my career.

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.949
the program definitely exceeded my
expectations with the results in terms

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.949
of what i was able to do with my career
after i finished

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:30.650
it wasn't more than two months after i
graduated before i had a number of great

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.209
job offers on the table

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.039
And I was very excited about moving on at that point in my career,

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.709
and it worked out perfectly.
