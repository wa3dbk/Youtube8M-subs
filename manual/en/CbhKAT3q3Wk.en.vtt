Hi, Alan Stratton from As Wood Turns dot com.
When my grandchildren come to visit, we like

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.270
to play games. Some of these games include
cards. Their hands are small -- they have

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.520
a hard time holding their cards. In the past,
I've made boards for each of them with a slanted

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.789
slot that they could hold their cards in.
It sits on the table in front of them.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.780
But they still like to hold their cards in
their hands like the big people do. The other

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.420
day I saw in the store a round plastic card
holder. I thought, "Why can't that be made

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.140
out of wood and round." After all, if I can
make it from wood, I don't want plastic.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:01:00.450
So, I designed a card holder that kids can
use to hold their cards. It's a fairly simple

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:09.070
design. It consists of two outer discs that
are tapered in the middle so a card can easily

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:17.159
slid in between them. It has an edge there.
These outer discs are held in place by an

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:26.639
inner hollow cylinder so that they're aligned.
The tension is provided by an elastic band

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:34.979
-- this actually was a girl's hair band. To
keep that in place, there's a very small disc.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.520
In this case, I made them from maple. They
enable the band to be in tension and to hold

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:50.179
the other plates in place.
Then it's fairly easy for a child to insert

00:01:50.179 --> 00:02:02.340
their cards and to be able to play their hand.
So let's make a child's card holder.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.319
I'm starting with 2 segmented rings in walnut
left over from a previous project. This project

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.819
does not require segmented ring construction.
These could have been 2 solid pieces of wood.

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.730
I've put small pieces of double stick tape
between the two pieces and again between them

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.310
and a wood faceplate. I'm rounding them off
together so ensure they are the same diameter.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.610
This seemed to be a reasonable option rather
than measuring both.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.310
These rings are a bit too big so I'm parting
off the outer portion. I'll figure out another

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.860
way to use the scrap ring.
After a little fiddling, I'm boring out the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:48.520
center. The hole is around 1" diameter.
Then, I'll turn a recess in the disc that

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.590
I will use later to mount the disk. This side
will be on the inside.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.430
Whoops, I did not use enough double stick
tape -- the discs just came off the faceplate.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.740
My tape was more on the outer rings. They
will not mount exactly where they were -- but

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.850
they're close.
Next, I'll remove the top disc so I can cut

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.980
a mounting recess in the other disc.
Next, I've mounted one disc on my small jaws

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.640
in an expansion grip. I'll thin down the ring
to be lighter and more graceful. I'll cut

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.310
the face with an ogee process that I've learned
from Jimmy Clewes. I'll mark about half way

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.570
over the curve and cut a cove in the outer
portion. With the cove cut, then I'll mark

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:41.290
it off in thirds and round off the middle
third between the flat and the cove. Voila,

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.120
my ogee.
When complete, I'll sand and finish it with

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.090
a friction polish.
Then on to the second disk. Same process,

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:06.040
thin it down, cut the ogee, sand and finish.
Now for the outer discs, I'm using maple left

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.170
over from another old project. These pieces
have a piece of walnut veneer glued into a

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.180
wave cut. Again, the wave is not necessary.
With double stick tape, I stuck them together

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.470
and predrilled holes Â¾" apart. Then I mounted
them to a faceplate again with double stick

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.610
tape.
Again, I should have used more double stick

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.789
tape. So this time, I used hot melt glue.
Then cut a pleasing profile, sand and finish.

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:42.460
The back side of these discs will be hidden.
And repeat for the other disc, cut the profile,

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:53.389
sand and finish.
The final part is a short hollow cylinder

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.870
that keeps everything in position. I using
a scrap piece of walnut chucked into my long

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.360
nose jaws. I'll reduce the diameter to fit
the holes in the large discs. Then bore out

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:15.050
the center with a forstner bit. Finally, part
off a length to fit inside the two outer discs.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.090
Assembly consisted of putting all the pieces
in place and tying a girls stretchy hair loop

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.250
in a knot. After applying thin CA glue to
the hair loop where I wanted to cut it, I

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.520
cut off the excess. The CA should prevent
fraying.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.460
And, voila we have a card holder for my grandchildren
to use when playing cards. Or my parents may

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.300
want to use one also.
