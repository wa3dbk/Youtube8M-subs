00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.090
Hello boys and girls! This is Aunt Frenita and I have a wonderful story for you.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.480
Called "Young Man, Get Up!"

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.530
Today's memory verse is from Luke 7:16

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.890
It says, "God has come to help His people"

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.990
The message for today's story is: We serve God when we help people who are sad.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.840
Have you ever felt really sad about something?

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.460
So sad that you cried about it?

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.710
Well, that’s how the mother in our story today felt.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.780
Jesus walked from town to town telling people about God and healing the sick.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.090
His disciples followed Him everywhere He went.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.970
Other people wanted to hear and see what Jesus was doing too.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.560
So a large crowd followed Him from place to place.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.920
One day Jesus came upon a town called Nain.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.340
In those days the towns had walls around them with gates to let people in and out.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.810
As Jesus walked toward the town gate, He saw people carrying a coffin.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.080
A young man had died and was to be buried in the cemetery outside of town.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.050
His mother and a large crowd followed.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.410
Jesus could hear the young man’s mother cry and the crowd of crying people too.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.600
The mother was a widow—that means her husband had died.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.130
And now her only son had died too.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.300
Jesus immediately knew why she was sad.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.690
Her husband and her son had died.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.090
And now she was alone.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.050
She had no one to help her.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.390
No one to earn money for food.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.930
No one to help her when she was sick.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.460
And no one to comfort her, to take care of her when she became old.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.880
Jesus felt sorry for this mother, and He wanted to do something to help her.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.590
Quietly He walked over to the woman.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.750
When the people saw Him, everyone stood still.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.490
They stopped crying.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.790
Then they gathered around Jesus and the weeping mother.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.270
What would Jesus do? They wondered.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.270
What could He do?

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.550
Jesus smiled at the woman and gently said, “Don’t cry.”

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.550
Then He touched the coffin.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.880
When the people saw Him do that, they all stared at Him.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.880
What would Jesus do next?

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.880
Then Jesus spoke.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.490
“Young man, I say to you, get up!”

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.110
The people must have been surprised to hear Jesus say that!

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.920
Everyone knew that the young man was dead, and dead people don’t get up.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.910
But when Jesus spoke, the young man sat up and began talking!

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.340
Jesus gave him to his mother.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.300
Was she happy? Of course she was!

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.010
She stopped crying and started praising God!

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.010
The people were amazed!

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.340
They were seeing a miracle!

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.870
Their mouths must have fallen open in surprise!

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.490
“God has come to help His people!” they shouted.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.770
Soon everyone returned to the city, joyful and happy because of Jesus’ love.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.160
God’s care is so wonderful!

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.410
And He asks us to help sad people too.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.260
When we see someone who is sick or scared or lonely,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.190
Jesus wants us to say kind words and listen to them,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.960
to comfort them.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.350
We can love them as Jesus does.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.650
And when we do, we are doing it for Jesus.
