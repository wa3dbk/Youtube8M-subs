00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.450
So everyone wants to make their face look
a little slimmer, and here are some tips on

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.280
how to do that with makeup.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.059
The basic idea is contouring.

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.250
So, my model Maddie already has a little bit
of foundation on.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.750
What I'm going to do is start by highlighting.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.230
So, I took little bit of her foundation and
then a little bit of a white foundation by

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.100
the brand Illamasqua.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.550
It's nice because you can mix it in and it
makes things a little bit lighter, a little

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.550
bit darker.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.240
So I'm going to take a hint of that, a little
bit of her foundation, and mix that right

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.240
up.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.079
And I'm going to start by applying it up the
top of the cheek bone.

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.559
Basically, wherever you highlight, you want
to combat that with contour.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.940
Right now, I'm just kind of highlighting,
and I'm blending it in with my finger.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.940
Especially when we're doing some intense highlighting
contour like this, it's going to look kind

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.850
of crazy when it first goes on, but once it's
blended in, it'll look really natural and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.850
flawless.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:12.420
This is basically where you're going to apply
the highlight, on the tops of the cheeks.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.650
I like to bring it in a little into this area,
too.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.290
Kind of plump this area out.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.860
Sometimes people will get a crease here, so
you can put highlight inside of the crease

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.470
to plump it outwards.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.990
If you don't have the white foundation, you
can use anything that's a little bit lighter

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.229
than your foundation or your current skin
tone.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.509
When I'm doing an intense contour like this,
I don't really like to use anything with shimmer.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.670
So, everything that I'll be using for highlight
and contour is actually matte.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.909
I'm also going to contour on the top of the
nose going up onto the forehead.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:50.909
Bring it up.

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.189
I'm going to do a little bit in this area
right here.

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.450
I'm basically highlighting the highest parts
of the face.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.860
You can also bring it down along the jawbone
here.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.130
And these are the main areas that I like to
highlight, but you can do it in other areas

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.549
based on your face shape.

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.900
Next, we want to go through with contour.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.919
Like I said before, wherever you highlight,
you want to do the opposite area with contour.

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:24.830
Since I said we're using all cream-based or
matte highlight or contour, I'm actually going

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.940
to use my concealer palette by MakeupForever
and use some of the deeper shades as the contour.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.019
Just make sure you blend, because sometimes
creams can be a little bit tricky, but it

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.220
really gives you a nice contour.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.730
And I'll do it really intense first, just
so you can see where it is, but we're going

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.959
to blend it out, so don't' worry; that's not
how I'm going to leave you looking.

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:45.959
Great.

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.169
You can relax your face.

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.360
You don't want to go too far in, so make sure
it's a little bit further out.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.220
We say the two-finger rule.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.160
Now that we know where the jawbone is, I'm
going to blend downwards.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.040
This is basically just making her cheekbones
stand out a little more, giving her more of

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.760
this pop over here.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.230
I even like to concentrate a little bit more
of the color to the outer part and let it

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.230
fade this way.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.840
So now I'm going to bring the bronzer a little
bit down along the jawbone.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.350
Sweep it down like this.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.290
And I'm actually going to continue it down
like this.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.760
It's just really making her jaw pop.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.510
If you have any unwanted skin here, you can
do the same thing, and it just makes it look

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.510
a little firmer.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.060
Here we go.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.180
Always make sure you're blending downwards.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.810
So the next place we're going to contour is
up at the temple here.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.120
I just like to do a little bit there because
it just makes this highlight pop a little

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.310
bit more.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.650
I'm going to blend it into the hairline, continuing
upwards.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.639
Right on the hairline, and blending down into
the forehead.

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.650
There are other options, too.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.730
Like I said, you can use powder.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.340
I'm just choosing to use cream for this type
of contour, but whatever works for your skin

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.310
type and whatever you prefer.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.930
As long as you follow the steps, I think you'll
get the same results.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.261
The last little piece of contour that I'm
going to do, since we highlighted on the top

00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:30.700
of the nose, is that I'm going to actually
contour the side of the nose.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.780
So if you feel like your nose is a little
too wide, this a good tip for you if you want

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.280
to slim it down a little.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.690
It looks a little bit too bold right now,
but we're going to blend it so no worries,

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.570
blending downwards.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:52.030
Maybe this isn't for every day, but definitely
if you're looking for the right look you can

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.750
do this a little less intense for everyday.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.780
And that is how to make your face look thinner
with makeup.
