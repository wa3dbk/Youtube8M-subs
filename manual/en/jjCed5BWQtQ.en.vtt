Today, we're going to be making Teddy Graham Racers.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.480
Hi! Welcome to Rosie's Tea Party Show.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.740
Today, we're going to be making Teddy Graham Racers.

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:20.593
Doesn't this look yummy Declan?

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.200
Yeah. I want to eat one right now.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.100
You'll need Mars bars or Snickers.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.260
Teddy Grahams.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.860
Smarties.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.040
M and M s.

00:00:34.274 --> 00:00:35.714
and chocolate icing.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.280
You'll need to cut the Teddy Grahams below the belly button.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.540
Perfect.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.500
You'll need a dot of icing for the wheels to stick.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.400
Use the Smarties for the wheels cuz they're bigger.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.040
You'll need four.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.020
For the steering wheel, you put the icing on the top.

00:01:05.914 --> 00:01:09.754
The icing is like glue so it'll stick to the chocolate bar.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.600
Snickers has peanuts,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.600
but Mars bars don't.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.280
So just be careful if you have an allergy or something.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.260
These are really easy to make.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.580
You don't need a stove or microwave...

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.960
an oven. Nothing like that.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.520
These are perfect treats for parties.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.420
The best part is... 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.760
no cooking required.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.880
So it's really easy and safe for little kids to make.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.620
The reason why we didn't use a Smartie 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.980
for the steering wheels...

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.820
Is because when we cut them they just cracked.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.560
We use the M and M s because... um...

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:06.275
because they're smaller... and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.280
we didn't have to cut them.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.660
When we cut the Teddy Graham's legs off...

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.180
we can eat them.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.560
Uhhhh!

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.140
Let me have a try.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.980
I can do it.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.460
Uh!

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.440
Ha!

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.700
Uh!

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.960
Awk!

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.440
Your face is red.

00:02:53.614 --> 00:02:55.634
There's an easier way to do this.

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.699
If squeezing icing from a tube is too hard...

00:02:59.673 --> 00:03:02.313
You can use a tub of frosting instead...

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:05.334
and a knife to spread it.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.740
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.000
Only two more left!

[Declan beatboxing]

00:03:18.793 --> 00:03:20.713
These are great for parties...

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.120
kids will love them.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.420
You could even make this as a craft at a party.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.160
Na na na na na na na na na...

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.220
Yaaaaaaaay!

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.240
A spit de da!

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:38.833
They're getting ready for the race!

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.720
Make sure you have lots of Smarties and M and M s.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.380
cuz half of them will get eaten!

00:03:46.588 --> 00:03:49.108
You need lots of Teddy Grahams too.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.840
These are so cute.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.780
And the best part is.... 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.080
eating them!

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.100
Yummy?

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.220
cuz if that's not yummy...

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.260
It's yummy.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.160
Okay.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.520
Mmmmm!

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.360
Rrrrrawl!

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.680
Vroom Vroom Rrrawl!

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.480
Have fun making them! Bye for now!

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.600
Let's race them!

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.680
Vroom! Yeow!

Exactly! .... Exactly.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.560
I just blew your mind.

00:05:21.763 --> 00:05:22.723
That's right.
