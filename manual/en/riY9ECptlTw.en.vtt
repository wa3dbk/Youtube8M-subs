00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:04.810
You can use Apple's Motion program to create
dynamic title effects that can be stored as

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.839
Master Templates for easy use from within
Final Cut Pro.

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:13.450
Click on the text tool and type a title in
the Canvas window.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.650
Navigate over to the inspector window and
click on the text and layout tabs.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.900
Change the alignment to center.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.780
Click on the transform tool to position and
scale your title.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.280
Go ahead and adjust the size and location
of your title directly in the canvas window.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.160
To adjust the color of your title, click on
the style tab.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.940
If you like you can choose from one of the
pre-built gradients.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.329
Activate the timeline window by using Command
7.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.390
At the top of the screen, click on the add
behavior button and choose text animation

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.260
 - sequence text.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.520
Click on the behaviors tab within the inspector
window.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.979
Within the sequence text behavior, add the
parameters that you want to adjust.

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.120
In this case Iâ€™ll add some parameters for
an outline.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.600
I'll add color, blur, and width parameters.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.080
Then I'll make some adjustments.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.930
I'll set a blur value of blur 10 and a width
value of 8.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.310
Then I'll change the color of the outline
to a bright yellow.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.880
Adjust this sequencing parameter to get the
soft outline to travel through the letters.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.900
If you want the soft outline to travel through
more letters you can specify this in the spread

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.200
parameter.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.920
To change the speed of the behavior, adjust
this purple behavior.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.250
Trim the title track out to the number of
seconds you'd like to use for your template.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.180
Okay, that's it! Check it out.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.540
The last step is to save a template.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.940
Choose save as template from the file menu.
If this is your first time creating a motion

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.200
template, you will need to create a new theme.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.530
Then give your template a name.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.380
Apple Motion will then take a few moments
to render the template.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.640
Once that's down you can move right over to
Final Cut Pro.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.750
In Final Cut Pro, you will find your template
in the generators Menu, under master templates.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.599
Selecting your template will place it in the
viewer window.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.540
You can now make changes to your template
by clicking on the controls tab within the

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:57.870
viewer window.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.080
You can now use this template over and over
again to maintain a constant look for your

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.510
show.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.390
Depending on your computer's processing speed
you may need to render the final effect to

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.569
see is play smoothly.

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.080
