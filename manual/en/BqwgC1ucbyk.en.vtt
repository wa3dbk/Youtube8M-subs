00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.710
Today we are going to show you part number
75099 from Draw-Tite.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.890
We are going to install this on a 1996 Chevrolet
pickup 1500 with an 8-foot bed.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.330
All right, the first thing we need to do on
our install here is, we need to remove this

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.079
bolt here, and the hitch will reinstall at
this attachment here and also this hole right

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:20.820
here, and the one back here, also.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.369
This one we will run a 1/2 inch bit through
just to clean it out and dig out some of the

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.249
rust and stuff, but basically it is really
a no-drill application.

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:36.630
We will go ahead and run the drill bit right
through here just to clean it out.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.070
And maybe you will have to do this on yours
or not, but it is always a good idea.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:50.910
And we will go ahead and remove this bolt
and the same thing for the other side.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.020
OK, we will go ahead and install the hardware.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:08.350
The plate and the bolt go right here and another
one goes through this hole right here.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.650
And go ahead and repeat it for the other side.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.479
Next, we can go ahead and install the hitch.

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.510
On this one, it is kind of heavy so it is
always a good idea to have an extra set of

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.820
hands.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:46.530
You might have to push some hardware back
in, so let us take some time out to fix that.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.979
Then go ahead and install the fasteners for
the bolts going toward the front of the vehicle.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:02:03.080
And you definitely want to leave them loose.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:11.981
And we have the holes at the rear of the vehicle
to install the bolts.

00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:14.260
OK, last we can get the bolts at the end of
the frame.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.170
Just go ahead and thread those back in.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.010
You may have to clean it out and loosen the
hitch a little bit to give some wiggle room

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.010
to get those bolts in.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.230
At this point you can go ahead and snug them
down, and then we will give them their final

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:51.250
torque.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:03:44.650
All right, that covers our install of part
number 75099 from Draw-Tite on a 1996 Chevrolet

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.629
pickup 1500 with an 8-foot bed.
