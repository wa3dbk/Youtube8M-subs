00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:14.400
Hey guys I’m here at the Magnum booth at the Olympia 
 weekend with WBFF pro’s Ingrid Romero and Bree Lind.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.200
And of course they are the fitness girls, so girls give 
 me an idea of what you are doing here today

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.400
And some of the people you have met. What is Magnum all about?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.200
I’m here with my sponsor’s Magnum and we’re just 
 here promoting with the supplement company 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.600
And just meeting people, really.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.900
So you are here at the Magnum booth all 
 weekend meeting and greeting people, I love that.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.600
Ingrid what about you? I’ve seen you walking around so, 
 are you taking a breather? What’s happening here? 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.700
I’m just having fun, that’s what I’m doing. I decided this year not 
 to work just to have fun and enjoy the shows 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.400
And that’s what I’m doing. Tonight we are going to a party, 
 we are actually doing a party for fitness girls magazine.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.300
It’s a new fitness, very mainstream magazine and Bree is on its 
 cover this month, so she is really excited about it.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.800
Party? Where is my invitation, why don’t I know about a party?

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.900
You can just walk in. There is my invitation. 
 He's Robert Riches so… He is welcome anywhere!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.500
There is my invitation I love that. Now I saw both 
 of you just a few weeks ago actually, in Canada.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.500
On stage you both looked awesome. What are some 
 tips you know for the winning combinations 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.000
That got you in that stage ready shape? Bree?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.800
Diet, diet, diet and lots of cardio. 3 hours a day of training, probably.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.300
Wait. 3 hours?

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.300
Yes, an hour and a half of cardio 
 and an hour and a half weights.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.300
Not to mention posing practice everyday... So, it’s nice to 
 go back to a bit of a normal routine.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.100
Let me put it out there: you do actually have to work hard at 
 it, because we see all the girls here and on the covers. 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.100
And I’ve seen your cover to and it’s hot. It’s 
 hot and you have to work hard for that.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.400
We work hard 365 days a year. It’s not 
 just pre-show, post-show, it’s all year round.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.900
It’s a lifestyle, yes. It really is, it’s a lifestyle.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.000
I know a lot of guys out there are wanting to get 
 into magazines and onto stage and be a fitness model.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.000
I’m sure you have your fair share of girls contacting you saying 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.100
Give me a couple of tips from both of you 
 to some of the steps these girls can make.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.700
I think it’s networking. You want to make as many 
 contacts as possible, leave an excellent impression on people

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.300
You know, and be a hard worker and never 
 give up. Always keeps following your dream 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.900
Because eventually one day you will get there.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.600
That’s awesome advice. Ingrid, I am going to ask 
 you because I detect your accent there

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.400
You don’t sound like us Americans over here.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.300
Excuse me.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.900
Canadians, Europeans... We have got a cool mix here. How 
 did you make that transition from Spain 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.600
Into here in America? 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.700
I still don’t know, to be honest with you. 
 I have been travelling for 9 years.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.100
I’m originally from Barcelona, Spain. I travelled the world: 
 I lived in London, actually for one year.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.000
I lived in Ireland, Dublin. I lived in Mexico were I had 
 a blast. And finally I found home in the States.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.000
I am very happy to be here and 
 all my dreams are coming true. 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.400
And it’s true, it’s because of the networking, the networking and never giving up.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.000
And because we are not liars. I think that’s rule number 
 one: do not be someone you don’t want to be.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.800
So, just keep it humble ladies.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.300
That’s awesome: work hard, train hard, be consistent, take 
 your supplements and one day you too

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.100
Could be here, either on the cover of Fitness 
 Girls, or-like me-in between two WBFF beauties. 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.200
Catch you later on in the rest of the Olympia weekend.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.000
Bye!
