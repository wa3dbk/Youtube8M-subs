00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:15.119
Hello everybody.

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.119
It's jrobi.

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.910
I wanted to do a quick video on a chess trap
in the King's Gambit Declined and I've touched

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.420
on the King's Gambit before in some of my
other videos, in particularly my Exploring

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.699
Bobby Fischer's video where I looked at his
play as white in King's Gambit accepted lines.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.220
He was a very strong player as white in the
King's Gambit except that in--he won all of

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.450
his matches in those lines except for one.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.330
But in this video I want to focus on black's
position and I want to talk about a possible

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.520
trap that black has at its disposal.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.600
Now, as with all my trap videos, you'll probably
find the most use for these in your blitz

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.080
games.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.310
If you play these traps in standard matches
where you have a lot of time to look at positions

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.280
and your opponent has a lot of time to look
at positions, they're less likely to succeed

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.670
for sure.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.180
But this definitely has some merit in it and
the reason is because generally in blitz matches

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.240
if you're playing under really tight time
controls, people don't take a long time to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.890
look at certain positions and if they're unfamiliar
with the position and it's new to them, they're

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.220
much more likely to make mistakes or even
just take material that you lay out for them

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.530
as a trap.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.530
And in this position here, actually we'll
just go back for those of you who weren't

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.570
familiar with the King's Gambit opening.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.020
The King's Gambit opening goes pawn to E4,
black plays pawn to E5 and then white offers

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.280
up the gambit pawn hoping to peel off one
of black's centre pawns.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.600
Now, in this position, instead of capturing--which
is completely fine to do, by the way.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.659
If you're a black player, you can capture
that pawn and maintain a very nice position

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.200
throughout the whole match if you're careful.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.580
Now, that being said, if your opponent is
a really strong player in the King's Gambit

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.810
accepted lines and you're not, you'll have
to be very careful with your positional play

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.930
going forward because there are some dangers
in the King's Gambit accepted that you can

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.819
get in trouble with as a black player if you're
not familiar with them.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.480
But from here we're not going to take the
pawn actually.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.670
We're going to decline the offer and we're
going to play bishop to C5.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.810
Now, bishop to C5 is going to serve two fundamental
roles for black.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.810
First of all, you're offering up a pawn for
the taking, so bishop to C5 basically you're

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.610
leaving your E5 pawn unprotected.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.810
So if white wants, white can come in and capture
this pawn for free in the current position.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.510
Now, more importantly for black, if white
does come and capture this pawn is that bishop

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.630
to C5 creates a very strong presence along
this diagonal which is going to be key as

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.260
you're going to see as we go down the line
here.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.950
So if white captures the pawn, black has a
brutal attack that it can unleash on the enemy

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.959
king and that's simply queen to H4 delivering
check.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.280
So black will come in and deliver the check
and white only has two choices.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.190
White can push the king to E2, but unfortunately,
after the queen comes to E4, its checkmate.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.650
So what the white player will probably do
in this position is play pawn to G3 at which

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.980
point you can come in now and deliver just
a deadly fork on the king and the rook.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.430
White will block with the queen.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.230
You can come in and take the rook and white's
most probable move in this position is to

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.210
play knight to F3 and that's simply because
white's going to try to capture the queen

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.830
by trapping it in this position.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.410
But unfortunately for white, this bishop here
on C5 is creating a very big problem for white

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.870
and it's basically going to make white incapable
of capturing this queen by trapping it, so

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.489
this bishop here is serving a very important
role in this position.

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.150
So from here now as a black player, all you
need to simply do is develop another piece

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.440
with knight to C6 because you want to maintain
this bishop's presence along this diagonal

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.849
and now you get another piece into the play.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.769
And from here, white's now going to play pawn
to C3, eying up D4 to remove the bishop's

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.300
influence on this diagonal.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.220
And from here you can play a nice little move:
Pawn to D5.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.840
White will most likely capture the pawn here
and even if it doesn't it doesn't really matter

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.340
because what we're trying to do here is we're
just trying to open up access to this diagonal

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.829
to G4 for this bishop because the bishop to
G4 is going to force white to do a queen trade

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.280
in order to take care of the positional problem
that it's going to face.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.380
So from here, after white captures, or even
if it doesn't capture, you can simply move

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.360
the king off to F8 because the king is in
check and now white will try to succeed with

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.610
its plan by blocking this bishop, but it's
too late for white because from here now you

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.110
can simply play bishop to G4.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.830
And white is in a very dangerous position
that basically forces it to do a queen trade.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.300
So from here you can trade the queens off
and now that the queens have been removed

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.640
from the board you can simply come down now
with your bishop and capture on D6 and you're

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.310
going to have a very comfortable game from
this position.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.490
So what I'd like to do now is actually flip
the board over and we're going to take a look

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.680
at the trap lines from the white player's
perspective.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.250
Now if you're playing white and black goes
into these trap lines, the best move in this

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.370
position for white is simply to play knight
to F3.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.910
And after white plays knight to F3, with solid
positional play white should have a fairly

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.180
decent position throughout the match.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.750
And when I paired the computers off against
each other in this position, white did have

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.600
an advantage and then white got into the black
castle position.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.660
But the good news for the black player is
that it took white a long time to do so and

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.639
that's with perfect computer play.

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.650
And even when white got into the castle position
a little bit, the computer actually had the

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.270
white queen peel off to regain the lost pawn
that it has dropped earlier, and so while

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.620
there is some risk for black to lay out the
trapping lines, it doesn't provide a crushing

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.259
advantage for white right away and that's
good news for the black player if you want

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.410
to try the trapping lines in your blitz games.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.600
So I enjoyed going over the video and I hope
you guys find it useful and definitely looking

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.470
forward to your feedback on that, whether
you use it as black or you see a black player

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.330
use it against you and you counter with the
knight to F3.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.330
So take care.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.650
Hope you enjoy the video, and we will see
you next time!
