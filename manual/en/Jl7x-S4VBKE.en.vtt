00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:12.009
They say an eco-friendly house can't be built
in 150 days for $150,000, and I say it can.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.090
I'm Allen Smith, join me as I push the limits
with time, budget and creativity with the

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:40.680
Garden Home Challenge, exclusively on eHow
Home.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.660
As we put the finishing touches on the house,
there are a few things that we need not forget

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.239
-- they're very important.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.570
Things like smoke alarms and carbon monoxide
detectors.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.010
For instance, up here just above this door,
we have a smoke alarm.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.309
This one is actually wired into our system.

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.309
You wanna make sure that you put smoke alarms
in places like kitchens -- that' pretty obvious

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.040
-- but also, bedrooms and hallways.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.890
You wanna make sure that you protect your
investment and your family and friends.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.820
And what you also need to do is check the
alarm once a week just by pushing the little

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.820
button.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.380
Ah -- see, working.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.060
So check it once a week.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.110
As a reminder to change those batteries twice
a year is to do it on daylight savings time.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.360
So those two points of the year will be a
reminder to you to make sure those batteries

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.360
are checked out.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.890
If you're enjoying these updates on the house,
tell a friend about them.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.260
And make sure you subscribe to eHow Home.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:56.159
And make sure you check those smoke alarms.
