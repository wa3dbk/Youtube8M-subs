00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.530
Hi, I'm Caroline Barnes, and
I'm Max Factor's makeup artist.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.700
Now we're going to prep the eyes.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.360
The most important thing before
you put any liquid eyeliner on

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.670
is to prep your eyes.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.140
Because you've got a lot of
natural oil in your eyelids.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.970
So what I'm going to do is use a
little bit of translucent powder.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.450
I'm going to use the
Max Factor Cream Puff.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.590
I'm just going to gently
put a little bit of powder--

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.280
close your eyes for me-- just
over your lid here and underneath.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.720
Now this will absorb all the oil and
prevent any of the lines smudging.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.740
And it gives us a great canvas to
which I'll apply our liquid eyeliner,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.876
very simple.

00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:42.520
After you've used any
foundation and powder,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.480
it's really important to just brush
your brow through to make sure

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.450
that we remove any of that.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.750
And the Max Factor eyebrow brush has got
a great little brush on the end here.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.860
It takes all that away and
really grooms the brow.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.480
We don't want to make
the brow too strong,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.480
because we're going for a
very graphic eye look anyway.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.360
So you want to just keep it
very soft and very groomed.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.734
So I'm not going to use a
color that's the same as yours.

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:05.310
I'm going to use hazel, which
is actually, as you can see,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.150
quite a lot lighter than Kate's brow.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.260
I'm just going to use it on the last
third and just stretch that out there.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.292
So it looks really polished
but not heavy at all.

00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:17.000
Now, if you want to
apply any eye shadow,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.250
now's the time before
you put the eyeliner on.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.960
But we're going to
use just tonal colors.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.980
We don't want to use any
color or anything like that.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.100
So we're just going to enhance
the natural shades and lights

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.440
in your own eye shape as well.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.354
So I'm going to use Almond and Pale
Pebble from the Earth Spirits range.

00:01:32.354 --> 00:01:34.020
I'm going to use the darker color first.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.145
And I'm just going to apply that-- just
close your eyes for me, Kate-- just

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:38.810
into your socket here.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.970
And what this does is just enhance
the natural shape of your eye,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.350
helping your eye to lift.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.910
But this looks very, very secret.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.130
I'm going to you use a little
bit of the highlighter.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.300
Close your eyes just on your lid here.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.610
And this gives a great sheen
to the top of your lid,

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.950
giving your eye a great shape.

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.740
OK, and look towards me.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.210
So that's great.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.350
I think we're ready to begin.
