00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.559
As of 2012 there are more women in the United
States with driver's licenses than men and

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.860
yet according to time use surveys we are 80%
more likely to rides as passengers in cars.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.860
Why men always be driving? [Car cranking].
Let's take a ride and find out. Checking my

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.340
rearview.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.809
One reason that men might drive more than
women is that historically cars have been

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.409
geared towards men. When they first came out
in the early 1900s, women were still very

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.409
much hanging out in there separate sphere
of the home. Cars were seen as something that

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.879
could be a boy's toy. Men love speed and the
love novelty and technology. Cars offered

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.089
all of these things in addition to mobility.
Come on pedestrians. Another reason that some

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.760
people attribute for driving more is car advertising.
Some say that car advertising is explicitly

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.650
geared more towards men, you have the voice-overs,
the sounds of the muscular V6 engine going

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.400
vroom vroom, taglines like hey guys do you
need validation, buy a car. I made that one

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.990
up. We are socialized to consider driving
to be a masculine thing to do. Then there's

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.280
the issue of chivalry, especially for driver's
of say my parents' generation it might not

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.370
have been so much improper for a woman to
drive as impolite for a guy to not drive a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.520
woman around. That's also where you get into
modern day arguments that men being the default

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.270
drivers is merely, well, benevolent sexism.
Hmm. Academia has also weighed in on this

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.030
male desire to drive. One study out of the
University of Minnesota found that men say

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.390
that they actually feel like they are more
in control of their own futures and destinies

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.750
when they're behind the wheel. If a guy ever
told me that he needed to drive in order to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.820
feel more in control of his destiny, I would
say I need to get out of this car in order

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.240
to feel more in control of my own destiny
because you be coocoo. But the number one

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.420
reason that I found for why men tend to drive
more often that really resonated with me even

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.410
though it is mostly anecdotal and observation,
simply that women want men to drive. Not because

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.220
we aren't capable drivers but because hey
you know what that avoids backseat driving,

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.870
sometimes men can be a little pushy and also
frankly, speaking for myself it's a little

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.550
bit of free time. When Professor Boyfriend
and I are driving around town I totally prefer

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.750
him to drive because that means I'm in the
passenger seat, kicking back, relaxing, checking

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.380
my e-mail, my twitter, my instagrams. But
now I want to know what you think, guys do

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.790
you tend to be the drivers if a lady is in
the car and hey, one thing that we have not

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.620
touched on is the fact that all of this research
deals with heterosexual couples. I'm very

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.090
curious to find out whether if you take those
gender norms away, if it just so happens that

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.840
couples tend to have a more dominant driver.
So I guess what I want to know is who's the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.110
chauffeur in your relationship? Leave it in
the comments below and also the whole question

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.790
of who's a better driver, men or women, yeah
I haven't talked about that because that's

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.190
a video for another time y'all. So be safe
on the road and uh, don't YouTube and drive.
