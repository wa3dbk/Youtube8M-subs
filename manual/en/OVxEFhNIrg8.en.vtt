Hi everyone! This is Keith's Toy Box and today we are going to show you the Chuggington Construction

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.099
Mega Bloks Old Puffer Pete.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.620
Old Puffer Pete is available at Amazon and Mega Bloks for $8.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.060
He's completely buildable and he has real working wheels.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.240
He's also part of the buildable Chuggers collection.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.240
He's over eight pieces. Now let's open the box and look inside.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.440
These are the instructions.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.540
Let's take out Old Puffer Pete and put him together.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.980
These are the pieces that make up Old Puffer Pete. They're eight pieces all in all

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.360
and there's Old Puffer Pete

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.280
When you press down on his funnel, his spectacles move and turn around just like in the show.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.300
He has one set of wheels for going down the Chuggington Mega Bloks tracks.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.200
Old Puffer Pete works with this kind of track. Let's try it.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.120
If you have other Buildable chuggers, 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.229
you can connect them all together.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.320
Chuga chuga choo choo

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.220
You can combine them with other Chuggington Construction Mega Bloks play sets for more fun.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:45.360
This is the Chuggington Construction Mega Bloks Roundhouse Racing set.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.240
So that's the Chuggington Construction Mega Bloks Buildable Old Puffer Pete.
