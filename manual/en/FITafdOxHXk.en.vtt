00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.860
It's important to understand 
nitrogen is an element.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.899
Nitrogen atoms have to be put
together the right way

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.280
for them to be useful for us as human beings,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.630
for plants, for other animals, for all
living organisms, including bacteria.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.760
And so the main problem with
nitrogen is that

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.760
even though it's all around us in the
atmosphere, three-quarters of the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.689
atmosphere is made of nitrogen,

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.640
it's very, very difficult to get to,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.340
to get a useful form of nitrogen. While plants need to

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.219
make use of nitrogen by either
extracting it from the soil that they're

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:37.120
growing in

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.120
or one large family of plants, called the legumes,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.829
they allow bacteria to actually get into
their tissues

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.129
into their cells and convert

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.750
nitrogen from the atmosphere, the 
useless kind, into a useful form that can go

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.930
right into the plant.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.460
The finding in this study that we're
publishing

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.510
is that as the bacteria

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.119
enter into the plant cells, the plants
have a special

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.080
transportation process for
delivering molecules to the incoming

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.830
bacterial cells that will help them to

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.320
survive and thrive in their new plant environment.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.200
When I talk about

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.240
this plant tissue that the bacteria are
entering into, that their infiltrating,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.340
what we're really talking about is these
tiny nodules which are visible

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.770
to the naked eye as little
protrusions coming off the root

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.920
of this plant here, and the plant is
actually building this

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.759
nodule tissue for the bacteria, it's
like a big bacterial apartment complex.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.540
This research is really fundamental.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.119
It may be a long way off but by
understanding the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.009
methods that the plant uses to bring the
special nitrogen converting bacteria

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.090
into their tissues,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.360
we could imagine allowing

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.920
other plants that don't have these
molecules to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.299
to adopt this system of taking bacteria
into their roots.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.560
Some of these most important crop
plants, like corn and

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.660
rice and wheat, they can't do this,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.650
and if we could apply the knowledge
we're getting from this legume-based

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.420
system

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.390
to these really important cereal
crops, we could eventually have

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.540
very important crops that would
require a lot less

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.560
man-made fertilizer.
