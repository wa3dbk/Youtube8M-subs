Hey everybody.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.500
This is Moeed and I am a part of Itchy Fingerz.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.980
Itchy Fingerz is an interactive mobile games
and apps studio.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.000
We're a bunch of extremely good looking artists,
designers, programmers and hard-core gamers

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.460

level art and design.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.460
We all love te...

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:43.020
The Next Level Show!

00:00:43.020 --> 00:01:05.189
In this episode,
in the black corner,

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.189
weighing in at 340 grams,
housing a 1.5 gig quad-core processor,

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:07.189
1 gigabytes of RAM,
a 7 inch backlit IPS screen

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:08.189
and with a 9 hours battery life,
the Google Nexus 7!

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.380
*Round 1*
Now this tablet houses the latest 4.1 Android

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.380
OS JellyBean.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.750
And JellyBean's best feature is Project Butter.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.950
Project Butter is the name of smoothness.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.200
This is high level techno-wizardry stuff.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.170
Let's check out the app drawer now.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.659
This is 60 frames per second movement; looks
great on this screen.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.659
Let's check out the task manager.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.450
Oh yes, silky smooth.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.030
This even works on native apps.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.080
Check out Google+.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.770
This is a smooth criminal.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:49.450
*Round 2*
Android is now the grand-daddy of notifications.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.869
Presenting you: expandable notifications.

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.100
All you need to do is give it a 2 finger swipe.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.689
Just like this.

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.689
And BAM!

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.090
The notification expands and shows you more
information.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.220
This stuff is slick man.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.659
Too cool!

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.110
*Round 3*
Next up is Google Now.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.029
Let's fire it up.

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.052
Now this is Google's new baby.

00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:17.169
It’s Google Search on steroids.

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:24.379
*Hey Google, I wanna dine in Sydney*
*The time in Sydney NSW, Australia is 12:23am*

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.590
Okay, what the hell!

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.920
I didn't ask you the time man!

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.700
Okay screw it, let’s check out other stuff.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.139
Okay, this has weather.

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:41.780
It has other information like maps and also
information about sports and everything.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.470
The cool thing about this is that it gives
you automatic notifications.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:54.090
But they still need to work on this.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.150
*Round 4*
Now bringing you widget resizing.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.599
Let's check it out.

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.439
Drag a widget.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.159
And look at all those other widgets move.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.920
And it looks pretty cool too!

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.419
Okay let’s put this one down.

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:18.150
*Wee!*
*Wipee!*

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.519
*Wee!*

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:31.620
*Final Round*
This tablet's deadliest feature is its 200

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.719
dollar price.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.739
I mean 200 freaking dollars!

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.629
That's f...dirt cheap!

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:37.629
Now this is official, man.

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:45.729
This is the second seven-incher I'm giving
my girlfriend for her birthday.

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:50.319
So there you have it, the Google Nexus 7.

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.150
With all these killer features, it just blows
all other 7 inch tablets away.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.549
Hasta lavista, babies!

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.989
Now it’s not an iPad but it’s a new prince
in the tablet kingdom.

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.369
So if you have 200 bucks lying around, don't
give them to charity and do your economy a

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:06.369
favor.

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:07.499
Get this baby instead!

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.349
So thank you for listening and I hope you
guys like the show.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.180
