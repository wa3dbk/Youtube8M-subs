Touch
+ Soft leather upper - premium padded touch
+ Super soft flexibility, esp after break-in time (~4 hours)
+ Able to cushion and kill the ball upon impact easily
# May be too bulky for some
+ Others may love the cushioned sensation

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:51.500
Dribbling
+ Cushioned upper - great dribbling feel
+ Lateral stability preserved due to sturdy upper
+ Traction - acceleration and maneuverability +++
# May be too bulky for some - subjective

00:00:51.500 --> 00:01:02.500
Passing
+ Leather provides flat padded surface
+ Less strength required for faster passes
# A bit harder to pull off more nuanced passes
# Long passes - a bit harder to 'get under' the ball
# But these resolve once boot is broken in

00:01:02.816 --> 00:01:10.800
Trapping the ball
+ Cushioned and soft upper - trapping is a breeze
+ Ball velocity dampened on impact

00:01:23.214 --> 00:01:28.200
Comfort + One of the most comfortable boots on the market currently + Boot moulds to foot for custom and tailored fit

00:01:29.197 --> 00:01:36.100
Comfort + Suede liner allows for minimal slippage + Ultimately: comfortable yet responsive

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.900
Protection + Tons of protection: Thick upper + mesh + no fear diving into tackles + Pesky kicks on heel less bothersome

00:01:52.855 --> 00:02:10.800
Shooting + Packs tons of power + Less strength required for power shots + Very natural shooting experience - custom fit
