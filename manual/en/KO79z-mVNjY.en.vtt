00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.710
Hi, and welcome to the school.
I’m your headmaster, Noah ROKs.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.300
If you don't know, the School of ROK is a
place where we build, play, build and explore

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.329
the fantastically fun construction and 
remote control toy system, Rokenbok.

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:18.049
Today, I want to talk about foundation for the
entire Rokenbok system, Construction.

00:00:18.049 --> 00:00:22.449
See the cool thing about building with Rokenbok. . . 
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.480
Hold-up there, Noah. I’m from the city planning office, and
before you start building anything,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.710
I need to see a your plans.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.740
Plans! But I built with my ROK plans yesterday.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.730
Today I was just going tostart building. . . 
Thems the rules, you can’t just go building all willy nilly without

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.010
plans!

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.130
Well, it’s great that Rokenbok 
always comes with plans,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.430
But, the fact that you can build amazing things without
plans is what makes Rokenbok construction so special.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.300
You see, every single building piece is designed so that
I can experiment and build whatever I want.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.500
Let me show you.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.249
All right.

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:55.960
But make it quick. 
I start with an idea for what I want to build.
Let’s say a warehouse.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.010
And because all of my pieces are 
uniform, and follow the same invisible grid,

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.899
I can easily make what I
imagine come to life.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.630
Whoa! That’s great!! What elase can you build?
Anything you want!

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.530
A train stations, an airport, a factory. . .
Great! Let's get to work.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.540
Hey, why don’t you check out this movie while
the City Planner and I start building.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.470
The following customer movie was created by Kyle from Cleveland Ohio.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.000
Oh, what a wonderful city we built. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.560
Yepp, and we did the whole thing 
just using our imaginations.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.479
Duck and Cover!

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.609
No, it’s okay. It’s just
my friend Mr. Science Guy.

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:12.939
I’ll see you later Mr. City Planner.

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.099
Okay, see you.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.949
Hey Mr. Science Guy!

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.219
Hello Noah. I heard you were talking 
about Rokenbok Construction today,

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:24.659
and I wanted to share something that I discovered.

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:25.739
You see, Rokenbok

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.030
has an invisible grid!

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.799
Mr. Sceince Guy, you know

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.239
Rokenbok is not invisible, right?

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.629
I know that silly boy, but

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.819
What I discovered is that the Rokenbok engineers

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.499
use a secret formula to make it easier
for the children to make their own inventions. 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:51.249
This means that with Rokenbok it’s easier for
children to make their own ideas come to life.

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:57.829
That success leads to more building, and even more learning. 
Wow, that’s amazing Mr. Science Guy.

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.189
I never thought about it that way.

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.419
Ahh... ahh

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.530
Once again, you never cease to amaze.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.009
Thanks, Mr. Science guy.

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:07.210
Ah, you are too kind. 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.689
Well, I hope you had as much fun building 
with Rokenbok as I did today.
