00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.540
A peer-reviewed or scholarly article is one
that is checked over by a group of experts

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.389
before publication. Most scholarly articles
are written in a formal or technical writing

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.789
style, are accompanied by references, and
are published by a university or association.

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.820
Many of the Libraries' databases allow you
to limit a search to peer-reviewed articles.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.110
We'll be using the Academic Search Premier
database, a general-purpose resource which

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.980
you can access from the University Libraries
website.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.180
From the University Libraries website, select
"Databases."

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.990
Select "A" from the alphabetical list.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:54.560
Then, select "Academic Search Premier." If
you're off campus, you may be asked to enter

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.870
your myBama username and password.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:09.890
In Academic Search Premier, enter your search
terms.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:21.049
Select "Scholarly (Peer Reviewed) Journals,"
then "Search."

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.039
The results will include only those articles
from scholarly or peer-reviewed journals.

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.030
There are many other electronic databases
you can use to find scholarly articles; they

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.460
can be found on the Libraries' Databases Page.
When searching, keep an eye out for limiters

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.429
or check boxes that say "scholarly," "academic,"
"peer-reviewed," or "refereed."

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.590
If you're unsure whether or not a journal
is peer-reviewed, you can use a database like

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.259
Ulrich's International Periodicals Directory
to check.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.060
From the University Libraries website, select
"Databases."

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.720
Select "U" from the alphabetical list, then
select "Ulrich's."

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.860
In Ulrich's, select "Title" from the dropdown
menu (choose "exact" if you are sure of the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:22.060
journal title, "keyword" if you're not). Enter
the title of the journal,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.200
then search.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.610
Peer-reviewed journals are sometimes called
"refereed." Find your journal in the results

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.879
list. If the "referee" symbol appears next
to the title, the journal is peer-reviewed.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:46.790
You can also select the journal title to access
additional information about the publication.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.220
You can also refer to an issue of the journal
itself or the publisher's website to help

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.290
determine if it is peer-reviewed. When searching
online, be sure to carefully evaluate the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.409
results.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:03.360
If you need help with finding articles or
using library resources, please ask a librarian.
