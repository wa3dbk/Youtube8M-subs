00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.380
Today on this 2013 Acura RDX were going to
install part number 75692 from Draw Tite.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.059
This is what the hitch looks like when its
installed on the vehicle.

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.309
Next well give you some measurements to help
you out in selecting some accessories, such

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.490
as a ball mount, a bicycle rack or a cargo
carrier.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.790
From the top of the receiver opening down
to the ground will be 14 inches.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.690
From the center of the hitch pin hole to the
edge of the bumper will be about four and

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.420
a half inches.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.260
Now well go ahead and show you how the hitch
is installed.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:37.940
What well do is go ahead and show the mounting
locations for the hitch.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:01:17.630
Youll use the 
threaded holes at the very 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:48.390
end 
of the frame and a round hole going toward

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.390
the front.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:02:07.189
Now there are two holes right next to each
other.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:19.040
The hitch will use the smaller of the two.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:37.450
The larger 
hole 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:57.810
will be the access hole for some hardware.
