00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.580
When a lab explosion killed Alec Holland and
drenched nearby plants with his top-secret

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.300
chemical, the Swamp Thing was born.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.270
Cursed and reborn as Avatar of the Green and
protector of Earth’s plant life, Doctor

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.540
Holland embraced his new role.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.810
But he would expand his charge, protecting
both humans and the environment, often from

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.940
each other.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.480
Swamp Thing is a regenerative Enforcer who
uses Husks to gain greater map awareness,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.620
split push, and set-up ambushes.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.890
His passive is Bio-Regenerative Formula.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.500
If damaged for more than a small percent of
his current health, Swamp Thing will heal

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.149
some of the damage back over time.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.290
Use Vine Leash to shoot a vine that deals
Power Damage and attaches to the first enemy

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.290
hit.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.780
Swamp Thing can have 2 active vines, gaining
Move Speed from each one.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.360
If an enemy is hit with both vines they’re
briefly rooted, which breaks the vine and

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.040
grants Swamp Thing a brief Move Speed buff.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.710
Husk summons a Husk that travels to a target
location and grants vision.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.780
After the Husk reaches its destination, Swamp
Thing can use the skill to channel and teleport

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.399
to the Husk, consuming it.

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.509
Husks are fragile and can be destroyed with
just one basic attack.

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.759
However, if Swamp Thing is channeling, the
Husk gains a shield that blocks two additional

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.289
basic attacks.

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.009
Surveillance Cameras cannot reveal Husks,
which are only revealed when an enemy champion

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.609
is standing nearby.

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.359
Earth Strike summons an earthen fist that
deals Power Damage in an area.

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:39.349
Damaged enemies lose Move Speed for a brief
time.

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:43.950
Any enemy in the center of the strike is briefly
knocked up, while enemies on the edge are

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.500
knocked back.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.719
Any Drones or creatures hit by Earth Strike
are always knocked up.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:50.719
Swamp Thing’s ultimate is Warrior King.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:51.719
Its built-in passive gives him bonus Attack
Speed.

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.869
When triggered, Swamp Thing transforms into
the Warrior King for a time.

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.509
While active, he gains Health, doubles his
Attack Speed bonus, and becomes Immune to

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.340
Slows.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.840
Also, his basic attacks deal additional Power
Damage that splashes to nearby enemies.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.890
Swamp Thing is great at stopping an enemy’s
escape.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.490
You can send a husk where you think the enemy
might flee.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.550
If an enemy runs away, quickly chase them
by teleporting to the husk.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.890
If they continue to run, use Earth Strike
to knock them toward you, followed by Vine

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.340
Leash to slow and root them.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.890
Swamp Thing can also use a husk for an ambush
in-lane.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.710
When an ally pushes an enemy turret, send
a husk into a nearby Stealth Pad and hang

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.710
back.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.350
Wait for the enemy to push your ally back
from the turret.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.390
When this happens, blink to your husk and
use Earth Strike to knock the enemy toward

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.780
your turret, and finish them off.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.570
Swamp Thing’s Consume provides healing and
credits, so using it aggressively is in your

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.370
best interest.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.690
This combined income and sustain make it useful
both in-lane and in the jungle.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.050
As an Enforcer, Swamp Thing scales with Power
Damage and needs Health.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.550
A few good artifacts to increase skill potency
are Cosmic Belt, Book of Eternity, and Cosmic

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.760
Staff.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.930
In particular, Cosmic Staff is great for adding
damage-over-time to enemies hit by your champion’s

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.930
skills.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.290
To counter enemy Attack Damage, try Fragment
of Mogo and Booster Gold’s Power Suit for

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.320
their Health and Attack Armor.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.520
To counter enemy Power Damage, try Entropy
Aegis and Mirror Master’s Prism.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.230
Embody nature’s terrible might as the unstoppable
Swamp Thing.
