00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.040
&gt;&gt;Narrator:
The lagoon contains seven aquatic preserves.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.290
The seven preserves encompass 108,000 acres,
covering 125 miles.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.730
Indian River is a long, shallow lagoonal estuary,
known for its recreational and commercial

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.029
fishing, boating, agriculture and a site for
prime residential development.

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.439
Jeffrey Beal, manager of the four southern
Indian River Lagoon aquatic preserves gave

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.230
us a brief overview of several of the projects
that are being implemented in this preserve

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.230
area.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.860
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey Beal:
The North Fork St. Lucie River is a tributary

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.850
for the Indian River Lagoon and it was dredged
back in the 1920s - just straightened.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.530
So we're looking to restore the oxbows and
the wetlands along that river.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.440
The manner in which it was dredged is they
took the river bottom and piled it up on the

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.760
banks.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.920
So what we've done is we're cutting holes
in that spoil bank, cutting breaches to create

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.970
little tidal creeks, so that water will get
back into that historical swamp.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.820
This is the first oxbow reconnection.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.560
So we have an oxbow that has been isolated
from the main branch of the river for over

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.109
eighty years and we are going to be reconnecting
that.

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.590
If we fully reconnect all of these things
then the river will be functioning as it's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.280
supposed to.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.310
And downstream where the river empties into
the Indian River Lagoon and ultimately into

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.979
the Atlantic Ocean, you'll have better water
quality and therefore better habitat and fisheries

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:24.979
downstream.

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.840
&gt;&gt;Narrator:
The lagoon boundary on the west is the Florida

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.710
mainland and on the east, barrier islands.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.700
Indian River Lagoon is one of the watersheds
in Florida identified as part of the National

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.049
Estuary Program and is one of the richest
and most productive waterbodies for aquatic

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.799
fauna within North America.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:52.329
The Florida Intracoastal Waterway runs the
length of the lagoon.Bird life is dependent

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.639
on the lagoon's tidal flats for feeding and
the protection of colonial nesting sites.

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:01.389
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey Beal:
There are 137 spoil islands in the Indian

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:08.140
River Lagoon that were created when they dredged
the Intracoastal Waterway back in the mid-1900s.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.320
One particular island we've selected to do
a restoration or enhancement project on.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.440
The island is predominately Australian pine
and Brazilian pepper.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.970
It's fringed by mangroves, but we'll be taking
an island that really is not very productive

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.880
in terms of what it's doing for the lagoon
and turn it into what we know is the most

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.540
productive habitats.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.480
We know that mangroves and seagrasses are
the habitat and the primary producers for

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.870
everything in the lagoon.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.860
It can be costly to do these things, but we
know that mangroves and seagrass provide tens

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.890
of thousands of dollars annually to the local
economy in terms of fisheries, and tourism.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.660
So we know it's worth the cost up front and
that it's something that will be providing

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.150
enjoyment and economics to us for years to
come.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.530
&gt;&gt;Narrator:
Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, a

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.660
leader in marine educational programs, has
been conducting research in and around the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.180
Indian River Lagoon since 1973.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.160
Dennis Hanisack, director of marine education,
discusses the importance of the hands-on curriculum

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.270
for young students in our society.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.840
&gt;&gt;Dennis Hanisak:
We have partnerships with Florida Atlantic

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.040
University and also Florida Institute of Technology.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.760
And we've been doing a number of courses under
a program called Semester by the Sea where

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.100
students come here for a semester and take
four or five courses, all in marine sciences.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.900
Whatever you are going to be in life - if
you're going to be a marine scientist, you're

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.010
going to need to have quite a lot of information
about how the marine world works.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.440
Even if you're just going to live in Florida,
I think it really behooves everyone to have

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.670
a basic understanding of the salt water environment
that Florida's totally surrounded by salt

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.750
water; it's a peninsula.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.300
If you live here on the Treasure Coast, you
have the Indian River Lagoon right here and

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.040
nearshore reefs.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.560
So our philosophy is that everyone should
know some very fundamental things about our

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.050
marine resources and the organisms that live
in them.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.240
And also how we, as humans, can impact the
natural systems.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.500
There's lots of opportunities here.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.390
I think that any young scientist could make
a whole career studying the lagoon.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.390
It's a beautiful place.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:23.190
It's a very interesting place.
