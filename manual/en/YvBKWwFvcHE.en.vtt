00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.720
The Rorschach Inkblot test

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.020
In a nutshell, you tell your shrink what kinda crazy *Bleep* You see in these random

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.680
inkblot cards and then they determine whether or not you're suited for a padded room and straight jacket

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.900
Today, we're taking this psycho test and adding a little bit of crazy to our closet

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.100
First up, grab an old white t-shirt and a piece of cardboard large enough to fit inside of it

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.340
Take a knife or an Exacto blade and make a small slit down the middle of the cardboard

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.040
Not all the way through, just enough to allow it to easily bend in half

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.420
Then insert the cardboard inside the shirt and grab some fabric paint

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.060
I'm going with traditional black

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.040
On one half of the shirt drip and drag your paint to your liking. This is the time for you to get creative

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.560
Fold the shirt over in half and press down firmly from top to bottom

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.460
Unfold it and you've got yourself your first print

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.640
Then, either leave it for a few hours to dry or blow dry on high heat for a few minutes in order to

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.540
set it. I did some more paint once it was dry and repeated this process a couple more times until i got

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.300
my desired pattern

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.640
Because this was so easy, I made a couple more, this one turned out awesome.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.380
Corrine says that she sees a Killer Queen Bee with headphones on.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.020
Interesting...

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.240
And I see an evil clown with spider legs

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.500
Hmm

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.360
Let us know what you see in the comments below, 'cause the craziest interpretation will

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.740
win this shirt

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.040
I grabbed an old long sleeved work shirt from Goodwill the other day, $1.99, sweet

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.060
I thought it would be cool to do just the pocket, which is looking kinda rad.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.920
You could also do just the collar and the sleeve cuffs, maybe not all of them together, but you get the idea

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.700
Be creative

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.800
These shirts turned heads the second I stepped out onto the street with em, and they literally

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.580
took me lees than 10 minutes to make

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.040
Not to mention, they make great conversation starters

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.860
Something like, "Wow, that's a really awesome shirt, Where'd you get it?"

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.000
Oh this? I totally made it myself

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.020
What? That's crazy

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.100
