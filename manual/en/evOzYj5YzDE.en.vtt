00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:03.670
let us turn to

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.509
uh...

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.839
the federal reserve and the money that
they give out of the banks

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.400
during as the great calamity of two
thousand they've actually between or

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.799
seven and twenty ten

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.399
in the wake of mind

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.029
nine

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.929
trillion dollars in loans okay

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.689
now those walls were so

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.859
small in terms of the return they were
getting

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.950
sometimes it was as low as point below
seven eight

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.080
basically it's free money

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.190
yeah benefits on this very important
here

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.440
it's not just that hey you get them
alone and then you know you get them

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.860
loan back in there so everything's fine

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.010
no if you give loz in that

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.619
degree with that kind of low interest
rate

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:48.749
you're basically giving away free money
imagine if i give you a trillion dollars

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.220
and i said okay you could then this

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.320
celeb back to the government at three
percent

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.939
right as an example to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:59.739
for treasury bonds any and by the way
three percent of the lowest they ever

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.829
got ok lessons from graeme out on the
first iranians

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.590
you had the free thirty billion dollars
a year would get in here

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.360
do you understand that it's not just
that you're getting a lonely you do

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.369
something else with

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.350
it's a free

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.230
billion dollars that you had any bank
giving him a trillion dollars as an

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.310
example

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.010
and a lot of times is a lot more than he
had more than three percent interest

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.280
rates so or they give it to how do they
give it to let me give you one more

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.990
number

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.690
one point two trillion

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.049
is the maximum amount

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.850
on december fifth two thousand eight

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.329
but the fed had taken a position of
doing it

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:32.899
the loan it did bring it back

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.439
bill or they get it back though but at
one point one point two trillion dollars

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.709
was out the door which is nearly twice
as much money as we spent on par so why

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.290
everybody's fighting and arguing over
tired

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.280
federal reserve affect who cares and and
we don't need to a stinking congress

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.860
would only be a treasury department

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.530
which is take the money which is due to
the max

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.800
and let them a call that tremendous free
money so that we can shore up the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.600
economy

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.720
so which banks got a feeling of this

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.660
by the engineer with three other
decisions but there were some of the

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.869
biggest recipients

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.190
bank of america ninety one point four
billion dollars

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.989
goldman sachs sixty nine billion dollars

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.539
j p morgan chase

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:17.329
sixty eight point six billion dollars
when i'm not going to be done with the

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.999
genius and he didn't need any money so i
need more over sixteen billion dollars

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:25.349
from his citigroup ninety nine point
five billion dollars morgan stanley

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.699
one hundred and seven

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:29.449
billion dollars

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.299
okay so that's the american banks
well-lighted can we knew we had uh...

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.349
say the american economy that's their
logic okay

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.729
well how about the foreign banks

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.220
wind into the formation witness was to
be

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.199
the federal reserve the united states of
america

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.709
what we told you in the past

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.959
not only did we give to many foreign
banks we we need to cut off his back

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.959
but here look at what the hell being the
numbers are for some of the formats

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.809
whether this uh... royal bank of
scotland which is sounds of perry on

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:57.669
american

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.549
than nodded their heads and they're
gonna literally on american down in

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.709
scotland or or up in scotland eighty
four and a half a billion dollars a day

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:05.609
yet

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.659
five credits least group against it

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.650
sixty point eight billion

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.300
don't regret that doesn't sound very
american either

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.709
that's of course german it's sixty six
billion dollars

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.249
so

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:18.299
they have it

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.539
why are we in the printing money

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:25.689
getting it basically for free to foreign
banks that insanely lower rates

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.979
an insanely high amounts

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.239
because

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.909
we don't control the united states of
america anymore

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.629
multinational corporations

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.859
natale banks to

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.240
our government represents door trim bank

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.919
a lot more than a represents the average
american bowler by the way

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.259
what i have a nice

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:47.929
put we have over thirteen million
unemployed here in america over nine

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:49.549
percent unemployment rate

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.680
three million homes for clothes

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.229
where was armed a lot now that's a lot
of people you know what that sounds like

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.089
there's so many people that it might be
too big to fail

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:59.109
but nonetheless

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.379
we were allowed to fail

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.189
we were allowed to go wander we were
allowed to go jobless we didn't get any

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:05.050
of that help

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.009
the big banks no matter where they where
they got the bank

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:11.559
they had to help because they'll want to
run the federal reserve

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:15.499
so this is all a giant joke on the rest
of us

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:19.879
and usse hey you know what people i'd
i'd always reach his what we had to do

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:23.159
it why don't we go we had to give
everything the banks for free

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.270
what do you think there is a was

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.789
top economists and been on the program
many times that make sense

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.330
uh... had this great quote he said

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.729
this is the moment

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.699
when date you were giving them money
away

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.520
this is the moment all of the eggs or on
their backs

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.729
the fed rent to the rescue

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:40.590
ang dot

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.850
nothing in return

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.999
scene that sticky part

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:47.889
brenneke can come and say hey you know
what we had to do it otherwise a whole

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.630
financial systems gonna collapse

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.940
than all the world economies request
okay

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.839
so but if you do about that money you
know what you say

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:59.529
for example no bonuses for you guys
because you destroy the world economy

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.969
and if i do enjoy hundred billion
dollars you're gonna go underinsured

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.429
your own banks

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.130
migs echoes of the bonuses

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.919
so

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.199
uh... the banks when they make the money
back they don't keep it be given to the

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.569
people but they borrowed the money from

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.949
the american people those are a lot of
or two of

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.220
many different conditions

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.219
but they could have attached to this

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.020
the attached

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.719
none of those conditions

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.560
while the congo basin bases woman the
banks would have taken

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.820
all i'm sorry are you holding me hostage
because of your incompetence

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.260
the buyout of turner jane and i know
it's a good newell moves ur

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.009
here's what i got for your day

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.279
were taken money take every single one
of these conditions

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:41.610
including possibly bring in your bank a
later

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.379
because you screwed up the whole world

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.120
pecanins so badly salwar late today

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.560
if you don't take it by thought that
they had press curves and i say

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.240
jenny dining and john mackinac island
one blank line all these guys who won

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.809
the banks

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:56.500
destroyed our world economy

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.810
and then when we were going to rescue
them they said no

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.410
because they wanted to make more money
in bonuses the sellers because they

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.419
wonder rob us blind though i'm gary
oldman dot lighting up to the press

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.370
comes wanting to know you don't want a
two-month

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.610
of course they were going to take the
money there although i wonder if they

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.979
didn't take the money

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.860
this is all a big joke man

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.250
that's the rule is a play on the rest of
us to try to pretend

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.870
that they had

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.800
had to do it they didn't have to give
them all a free money

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.159
we are rob

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:26.330
we've got to work

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.830
we've been hacked

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.080
i'm tell you the reality meant that's
what's going on
