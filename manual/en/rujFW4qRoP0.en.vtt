00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.120
Now, for snakes that don't accept pinkies
right away, I'm going to show you a way trick

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:15.240
on feeding them. What you're going to need
is a volunteer toad. I love reptiles and amphibians

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.230
and I hate killing amphibians, especially
little toads, but your really need one if

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.740
you're going to keep Hognose Snakes. This
toad is dead, I keep it frozen and then when

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.680
I'm done using it, actually I just refreeze
it again. I continually use it, that way I

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.140
don't have to go out and kill more toads.
But, what I do, first of all, is I'll take

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.210
this toad, and I'll use forceps to keep my
scent off of it, I'll hold the pink and take

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.079
this toad and rub its scent all over the pinkie.
See there's a little bit of stuff coming out

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.960
and that's perfect. Again, this pinkie is
scented with the toad. Now, what I can do,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:04.729
too, is get this Eastern Hognose Snake excited
first before I feed her. So what I can do,

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.840
you have to be kind of quick with this, is
put the toad in front of her, let her get

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:20.859
a whiff of the toad. See, she's interested,
she's hungry. She has her mouth open, so she's

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.959
hungry. Now, you get her in this mode, she
wants to eat. Now throw this pink in front

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:31.289
of her that smells like the toad, and then
boom. Once they get into that feeding mode,

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.799
their hungry. You present them with that toad
you just have to be quick, make sure you don't

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.680
give the snake the toad then you're going
to have to find another toad. So, that's the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.249
best way to do it. Keep a toad, keep it frozen,
thaw it out when you need it and then refreeze

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:50.119
it and that toad will last you for a very,
very long time. Then, eventually, the snake

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.159
will just start accepting pinkies and you
won't have to worry about scenting it with

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.100
the toad at all. With adult Hognose Snakes,
you're going to want to feed them every ten

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.039
to fifteen days or so, just about every two
weeks. For these babies, once you switch them

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.489
over to pinks, pinkie mice, again, are fattening
so you're not going to want to feed them as

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.840
much. Generally, I feed them one pinkie about
once a week.
