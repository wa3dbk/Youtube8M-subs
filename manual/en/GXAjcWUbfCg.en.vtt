Hi. I am Chitrotpola Mukherjee, speaking on
behalf of Expert Village and I am from India.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.509
Now I am going to show you the tools that
we normally use for sculptures or any work

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.740
in clay. The tools are actually very simple;
there is nothing complicated about the tools.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:36.430
We have different kinds of tools like these
three pieces that you see are for turning.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.800
Now turning means that when you are working
on a piece of clay, whether it's a plate or

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:53.120
it is a statue or any kind of piece and you
want to carve out or take out some amount

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:01.420
of clay; this is used. And you have little
pieces that have different curvatures so that

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:09.189
it suits more angular. These are more curved;
this one is a little more curved. So for different

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:15.659
purposes, you can use this extremely simple
tool. It is very simple, as you can see. So

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.799
it is not very complicated if you are doing
work in clay. This is one thing I would like

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:31.939
to show you. Then you have the spatulas. You
know, when you want to flatten something,

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:41.210
you want to smooth something; you want to
use these spatulas. These spatulas are used

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:49.939
differently -- broad, not so broad and very
thin ones which you will use for smoothing

00:01:49.939 --> 00:02:01.399
and getting the surface right. You use a bit
of water if necessary. Once it is dried, you

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:10.400
want to clean up the dust, so you clean it
nicely so that it doesn't have any kind of

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.280
surface problems. Thank you.
