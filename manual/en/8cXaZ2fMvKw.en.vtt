Hello! My name is Lindsay on behalf of Expert
Village.com. In this clip, I am going to be

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.710
showing you how to flip the pillow inside
out and sewing the edges. This is the front

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.599
of the pillow so we are going to take it and
turn it inside out like we have before and

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:42.180
you should have where you made the markings
from the first step, laying right on top.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:52.269
Make sure that you have it lined up. Okay.
And then where you made the 1 inch markings

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:59.690
along the edges that is where we are going
to be sewing. You can use the same thread

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.089
that you use for the gimp or you can change
threads. Whatever color thread you use, it

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:13.210
really wonâ€™t be seen because it is going
to be inside the pillow. So you are going

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:28.450
to take your pillow, make sure you got it
lined up and you are going to start sewing

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:57.909
on that line. I am going to use a straight
stitch for this one. When you get to the end,

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:15.640
you are going to leave about a 4 to 5 inch
opening so that you can be able to stuff the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.760
pillow and be able to get your hand in it
too to flip it inside out.
