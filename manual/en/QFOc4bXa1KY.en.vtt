Eyelid Surgery to Tighten Excess Skin?

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:36.940
I am wondering what would be the best treatment,
surgically or otherwise for my upper eyelids?

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.899
I am scared surgery will leave me with a lot
of lid just above my lash line and will make

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.960
my eyes appear more bulging with little volume
in the area below my brow.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.030
Would pixel laser treatments be able to tighten
this excess skin?

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.440
The side view is taken in the morning and
looks a little puffier than it normally does.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.070
Thank you for your question!

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.409
You submitted questions with photos and you've
asked about a pixel laser and about your concern

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.360
about having eyelids surgery to help tighten
up the skin over your eyes.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.530
And one particular concern you have now is
the eye not looking too bulgy.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:26.850
So as a cosmetic ocular facial plastic surgeon,
I deal with this question everyday and it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.100
is important to really understand the limits
the lasers, surgeries and also have a clear

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.619
understanding of outcome that's why you submitted
the question.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.159
But there is a 3 dimensional aspects of this
that we can't address without a physical exam.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.639
So when someone like yourself comes to my
practice, this is what I typically do.

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:58.630
I'll have them sit down and I'll apply a cue
tip and just kind of roll the skin underneath

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:07.110
to show what would the strategic reduction
of excessive skin to change the appearance.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.970
I also noticed there is a little puffiness
in the inner corner of the eye so if you are

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.300
considering just a laser procedure you would
not be able to address that puffiness because

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.810
that puffiness in the inner aspects represents
the inner eyelid fat prolapse so since you

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.960
can't laser off fat from the outside.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:38.360
You will need surgery to reduce the fat so
it's very important to have a clear expectation

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.030
of what you will look like after a procedure.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:51.030
Now people have tried to address upper eyelid
excess skin with laser.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.250
What are we doing when we are applying laser,
we are applying thermal energy heat to try

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:05.360
to get the skin to contract in a way and smoothen
to the point where a lot of that extra skin

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.030
gets tighter.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:16.510
The thing is when you try to apply heat aggressively;
it becomes difficult to predict how much skin

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.840
you'll tighten into what degree so you could
consider try a laser like a CO2 laser.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.580
People have done that and invariably there
is improvement.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.340
The question you have to ask yourself is to
how much improvement would be acceptable to

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.510
you.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.820
So I think a consultation with a qualified
surgeon would be very important.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.870
And looking at yourself with the rolling of
the skin so you could see how much eyelid

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.180
would show.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.710
The reality is you can have a certain range
of skin that can be addressed.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.990
You have to understand, your eyes are prominent
when you close your eyes you have to have

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.240
enough skin to be able close your eyes so
if you're trying to just basically cover a

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.040
round shape, you can't just aggressively take
so much skin that you will have difficulty

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.620
with eye closure.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.230
So there is a range you can be conservative
or slightly more than conservative but you

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.410
can't be too aggressive.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.210
So a lot of times patients like yourself,
I would do a combination if its textural issue

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:30.280
of the skin is part of this I would do a conservative
removal of skin and I would do fractional

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.710
Co2 laser this way we address both and I will
take a little of the fat pocket and give you

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.090
a nice smooth contour.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.380
I think sometimes we need to look at ourselves
from the big picture rather than focusing

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:51.669
on the little details and get a sense what
does your face look like in terms of the appearance

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:58.419
that you project and use that as a measure
instead of just isolating on the eyes alone

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.551
because it's in context when people see you
they looking at the whole picture and when

00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:09.909
your eyes look brighter and more open then
that certainly won't make it too bulgy.

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:16.610
So again meet with the qualified eyes specialist
and learn about your options and get a sense

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:25.319
of what you can expect from a procedure like
upper eyelid surgery conservative and combination

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:31.729
with CO2 laser but I probably would advice
against doing just the laser alone again this

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:38.319
is all based on just the photos and not the
physical exam so I hope that was helpful and

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.319
thank you for your question.
