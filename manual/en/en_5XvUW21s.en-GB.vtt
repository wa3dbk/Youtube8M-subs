This is HotAir

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.299
There are new stars emerging from the British
Airgun Championships at Bisley.

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.640
Berkshire teenager Charlotte Huddart won two
gold medals and a championship silver medal.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.330
She goes to Germany next to compete against
teams from South Africa and Denmark. Meanwhile,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.960
three members of Bideford Target Shooting
Club in Devon came home with medals. Between

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.119
them, Michael Coombs, Clive Magson and Alex
Raymon won four golds, one silver and a bronze

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.620
The organisation representing Scottish solicitors
believes that the new proposed legislation

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.380
on airguns will make them untraceable.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.020
The SNP has introduced its bill requiring
anyone who owns an air pistol or rifle to

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.720
apply for a certificate similar to a shotgun
certificate but without requiring the guns

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.590
to be listed. Campaigners claim the proposals
are draconian and they point out that offences

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:03.300
involving air weapons have fallen by 75% from
683 to 171 by 2013, the lowest since records

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.300
began.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.390
If you want to live long in the USA, donâ€™t
wave around an air pistol.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.100
New video released from a police shooting
in Cleveland, Ohio, shows a patrol car arriving

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.259
on the scene and officers barely hesitating
before fatally shooting a 12-year-old boy

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.700
playing with an airgun. Police in the video
are seen driving across the grass to a pavilion

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.190
and hesitating briefly. As the boy approaches
and seems to be pulling something from his

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.450
waistband, he is shot dead. The City of Cleveland
says that the boy was responsible for his

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.850
own death.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.380
Elsewhere in the USA, a similar incident was
averted when a 16-year-old boy shooting pigeons

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.049
was surrounded by a SWAT team.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.950
The unidentified boy was on a rooftop in Idaho
Falls and, when he saw the police, he acted

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.840
evasively, so they cordoned off the area.
Happily, police determined the teenager was

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.490
not a threat and he will not face charges.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.960
The US state of Michigan is to relax air gun
rules.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.950
It has adopted legislation that will exempt
air-, spring-, and gas-powered guns from Michigan

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.709
firearms laws, in order to match other state
laws.

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.459
And finally, killing squirrels really works.

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.959
Anglesey has become the first area of the
UK to declare itself a grey-squirrel-free

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:17.959
zone.

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.090
A cull of grey squirrels on Anglesey was so
popular that local residents got involved

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.260
in shooting them alongside three full time
members of the European Squirrel Initiative.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.629
The grey cull started 1998 and has been hailed
a huge success.

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.030
