00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.889
A candidate who arrives in Los Pinos with a little help from a television network... sound familiar?

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:27.940
Well, any resemblance to reality is not a mere coincidence, even the forelock

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.509
The appearance of the President on tv shows and programs of "debate" in Televisa have caused comments of all kinds.

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:38.720
Where else can the President be taken for keeping him safe of questions that make him think?

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.790
To a program where hosts have no idea of the issue to discuss and argue that they were not good students

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:52.610
For Years it is well known that our beloved president Enrique Peña Nieto and Emilio Azcarraga´s network, have a good and close relationship,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.740
while on reforms in his favor the other one misinformates in gratitude

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.060
Just remember that in 2012 the British newspaper The Guardian published an

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.619
alleged agreement that existed between Televisa and EPN to position him into the media,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:13.160
the company charged more than 346 million pesos to promote the image of Peña Nieto and discredit Lopez Obrador.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.550
And although the agreement was denied by Televisa, the English media was not the only one in making these statements,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:25.690
Mexican journalists as Genaro Villamil, had already spoken before this alleged alliance between the current president and the television network

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.130
Furthermore Wikileaks leaked diplomatic cables from the  Embassy

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.479
in Mexico where it is revealed that the country had been concerned about the relationship between Televisa-EPN

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.149
one of these cables made by American diplomats, says:

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:49.389
"It is a widely accepted fact, for example, that the monopoly of Televisa supports the governor (Enrique Peña Nieto) and provides him an extraordinary amount of airtime and other types of coverage."

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:54.060
Let's not forget the more than 3 thousand million of pesos that the SAT forgave this network during 2013

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.560
or the LeyTelecom that gives many benefits to continue to operate freely

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.210
Anyway, while Televisa denies these allegations systematically,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.049
in recent days Peña appeared again in its programs, first he was interviewed in the transmission of "hoy"

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.289
a morning show magazine format by Andrea Legarreta and Raul Araiza

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:18.389
Is that the importance that the peñist government gives to Reforms ... shamefully exposing them and simplistic in a program of gossip?

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:28.069
And as if that was not enough, a day after, six journalists met with the president for an interview on the occasion of the 80th Anniversary Fund economic culture.

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:36.689
The alleged interview was a fraud; journalists were complacent and the biggest threat to the president were the eyes of Lily Tellez.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:45.409
During the conversation Peña thoroughly downplayed issues like corruption and dedicated to not to answer questions and give a speech in a Cantinflas style.

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.069
A reality show to make the president look good. Strange, isn´t it? 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:58.499
Being exposed at Televisa has been very profitable for EPN, according to the INEGI 94.9% of Mexican households have access to television,

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:03.059
In other words, almost the entire population receives the signal from the major TV networks.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:13.720
In contrast to this figure, only 30.7% of homes have Internet access, which makes it difficult to alternative media to reach millions of Mexicans.

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:18.829
Now do you understand the importance of sharing and diffusing information not only on social networks?

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.269
We invite you to share this information by spreading it mouth to mouth to generate

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.789
discussion between them without questioning Viewers mounts without government fund and Televisa.

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:30.489
