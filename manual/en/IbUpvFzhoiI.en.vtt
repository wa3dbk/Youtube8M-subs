00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.120
[intro music]

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.739
&gt;&gt; Jon: We know you can't get enough so we're
here to bring you more from Motosport.com.

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.990
&gt;&gt; Jon: I am Jon Boucher and Motosport.com
is at the top of the list.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.380
&gt;&gt; Jon: When it comes to getting our hands
on items that haven't even been released yet.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.400
&gt;&gt; Jon: We have more first look for today
on this Icon Motorsport 2015 line.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.480
&gt;&gt; Jon: This is the Raiden Arakis Over Pants,
Jersey, and Gloves.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.339
&gt;&gt; Jon: Arakis or pants are dual purpose in
nature in single purpose in execution.

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:37.110
&gt;&gt; Jon: The wearability of the motocross Pant
has been retained with a vented nylon fighter

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.860
mess chassis which is complemented by ballistic
nylon paneling and washable leather paneling.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.980
&gt;&gt; Jon: The Arakis also comes with D3o protection
that fits in the 3-position knee pockets and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.260
removable bib that gives you the option to
wear or not wear suspenders.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.510
&gt;&gt; Jon: There's a couple things that an overpant
should definitely have.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.199
&gt;&gt; Jon: Zippers at the bottom of the pants
which will give you easy access to your boots

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.460
and exterior pass through pockets that go
through a liner so you can grab your wallet

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.489
or phone when you need it.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.960
&gt;&gt; Jon: The Arakis is of course has both these
items and has a hook and loop velcro strap

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.670
on the side your waist and a ratchet waist
closure system.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.120
&gt;&gt; Jon: The Arakis Over Pants comes in camo
or the black you see here.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.700
&gt;&gt; Jon: It's available in sizes 28 through
44 and its gonna running about $150 bucks.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.830
&gt;&gt; Jon: Next up is the Arakis Jersey, most
street and touring riders are not used to

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.830
wearing a jersey.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.660
&gt;&gt; Jon: But I pose the question, why not?

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.400
I mean it's the only thing the motocross guys
will wear.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.160
&gt;&gt; Jon: They weight nothing, they wash well
and this Icon Arakis Jersey even looks cool,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.970
especially when you wear with the pair of
gloves.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.690
&gt;&gt; Jon: this is a polysublimated chassis which
they formed into what they call a pro moto

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.690
fit.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.030
&gt;&gt; Jon: It comes in the glory as you see here,
slate blue and tan color.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.030
&gt;&gt; Jon: Is available in size extra small to
triple extra-large it's only gonna run you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.030
about $35 bucks.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.410
&gt;&gt; Jon: Now I mention pairing this jersey
with the Raideb Arakis Gloves.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.280
&gt;&gt; Jon: These were built for split directive
with one solution.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.200
&gt;&gt; Jon: Trail where ability with street toughness.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.160
The traditional Moto X clothes provide feel
at the limit but their palms and materials

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.920
are not suited for the speeds and conditions
of the street.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.130
&gt;&gt; Jon: The Raiden Arakis is the solution.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.229
Feature Icons padded one piece leather palm.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.410
&gt;&gt; Jon: This glove has no seems the stitches
while still providing the necessary reinforcement.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.739
&gt;&gt; Jon: A mesh back handle and their breathability
and D3o knuckle insert is integrated for both

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:18.900
fit and reinforcement.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.230
&gt;&gt; Jon: The daboss neoprene cuff and nylon
webbing pull tabs meaning you'll slip in and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.230
out of this glove with ease.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.959

you see here, or tan, blue and slate colors.
