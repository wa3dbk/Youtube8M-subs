Hi, this is Paul from www.puppetsnstuff.com.
You can find us on the worldwide web at www.puppetsnstuff.com,

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.810
we are now going to continue building our
little moving mouth puppet. The red rubber

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:25.850
earlier you saw you are going to cut a tiny
square out of that red rubber. It is more

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.480
like a rectangular but that is okay. What
I would like to do is let me see, this shape

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:43.730
here is about 2x3. Okay. I am going to cut
my heart type of shape. The tongue could be

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.230
really any shape you want. Some people like
to use circles, some people like to use triangle

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.860
I like to use is a little heart type of shape
like so. Now again, I did not need a pattern

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.559
because I have done this so many times. You
may want to draw out a little hart shape patterns

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.000
that you are comfortable with and then trace
along the edges of the rubber with your magic

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.430
marker and cut that way. But we have a little
tongue there that I am pretty happy with.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:23.750
What we are going to do is take our magic
marker and we are going to make a little line

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:34.369
from the middle to the top. See what we did
there? What we do is we take a hot glue gun

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.250
and we are going to go on the back of that
tongue and just do a little dab of hot glue.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:47.359
You donâ€™t have to overdue it. Hot glue is
amazing thing. It will bond and it will stick.

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:58.369
We are going to put it inside our puppets
mouth like so. Position it the way you want

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:07.780
to your comfort level and now we have a tongue
for our character. Okay. Now when we come

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.879
back we will be filling out his head with
some foam rubber that I showed you earlier.

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.400
We will do that in a bit.
