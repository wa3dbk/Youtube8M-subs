Hi guys,

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.920
Welcome to another edition of What I Ate
Wednesday where I show you all the vegan food

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.710
I ate in a day.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.259
For breakfast, I sliced up this slightly sad
looking mango. I had left it in the fridge

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.779
too long because I just hate getting my hands
sticky. Weird, I know.

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.450
Got to say, it was worth the sticky fingers
in the end. The mango was not overripe, just

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.410
perfect.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.250
But if that seems like a dinky breakfast,
then you'd be correctamundo!

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.230
You know what wouldnt be a dinky breakfast?
This seitan and breaded eggplant english muffin

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.180
sandwich with garlic tahini dressing by becci_ftw
or becci for the win.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.020
Or this breakfast pudding by Koeygreen underscore.
She was inspired by my strawberry breakfast

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.310
pudding recipe which I'll link here but she
used peanut butter instead of strawberry!

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.160
Brilliant idea, my dear. Just brilliant!

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.300
And this idea from Maryann Penney on Facebook
is great too. She took the basic mantou or

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.940
Chinese steamed bun recipe and stuffed fruit.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.270
All of these would be lovely for breakfast.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.750
Sadly, I didn't have those things. But I did
have these Cara cara oranges for 2nd breakfast.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.400
It was such a nice day that I took it to the
balconey and ate them with my dear Charlie

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.320
for company.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.350
After my chilled out second breakfast outside,
I went back inside to work. I felt so busy

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.170
that I didn't stop. In hindsight, I should've
took a break to make my 10 minute kale and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.960
chickpea noodle bowl which gabyshealth and
gitter.1 both did.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.240
But by the time I looked up from my work,
it was pretty much time to start making dinner

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.340
for my friends who recently had a baby so
I'm helping them out by making dinner once

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.880
a week. So for them, I made pasta alfredo
from Colleen Patrick Godreau's 30 day vegan

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.270
challenge which is one of my favourite pasta
dishes. Just super quick and easy.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.570
Also made some garlic kale; you guys have
seen me make this many times before like in

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.619
my Kitchen Nightmares episode. Only this time
I didn't burn anything.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.889
And because I just thought more veggies the
better for a new nursing mom, I made a stirfry

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:16.859
of brocolli, tomatoes and mushroom. I had
meant to add edamame for extra protein but

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.219
I forgot. Oops.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.549
You'd think after making this I'd be good
for dinner.

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:29.790
NOPE. Because what I really had been craving
for like a week? A hotdog. Maybe because it's

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.370
just become suddenly summery here. This one
is a Yves Jumbo Veggie Dog sauteed with garlic

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.879
in a whole wheat bun. Honestly, I wish I had
white buns instead. When you're wanting junk

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.629
food, it's not as satisfying if you health-i-fy
it with whole wheat bread. So really, my craving

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:53.040
was only half fulfilled. Totally going to
get some white buns for my next veggie dog.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.749
And that's it. What are you excited to have
now that it's summer? What kinda stuff are

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:03.650
you going to throw on the grill? Let me know
in the comments below.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.730
Thanks so much for watching. Bye for now!
