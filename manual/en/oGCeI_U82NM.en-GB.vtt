00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.000 position:75%
I became interested in marine biology from about

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.500
the age of seven.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.500 position:89%
Every holiday was getting I-spy books about rock pooling,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.000 position:88%
turning over rocks and learning all the names of things.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500 position:77%
When I first joined BAS before I went South I had

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.500 position:91%
comprehensive training - learning all about the Antarctic,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.000 position:89%
advanced first aid and also dentistry - because obviously

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000 position:92%
you're in a very remote place and it's very hard to get you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
out especially during the Winter.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000 position:84%
At times I'm camping on the island with just one other

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000 position:91%
person so if they get into trouble I'm their first call of

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000 position:92%
help so you get trained in almost everything that you need.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.500 position:84%
I work on South Georgia - we have to get there by ship

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.000 position:69%
from the Falkland Islands and my research is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000 position:84%
predominantly on fur seals, but I work in a team which

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.500 position:61%
also looks at penguins and albatrosses.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000 position:84%
What we're trying to do is build up a picture of these

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.500 position:89%
animals; where they forage at sea and how the populations

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.000 position:83%
are doing - whether they're increasing or decreasing.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.500 position:88%
The lab work we do in South Georgia is pretty basic - we

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.500 position:91%
only have a small laboratory - so I bring a lot of samples

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.000 position:66%
back to Cambridge where I can do much more

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000 position:88%
sophisticated DNA analysis, looking at genetics and also

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000 position:64%
fatty acid analysis using chromatography.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.500 position:81%
Our research feeds into Government policy which then

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.500 position:86%
helps sustainable fisheries in the Antarctic which then

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.000 position:86%
don't damage the predator populations of the Antarctic.
