00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.467
Startup Sprint is where teams

00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:03.233
come together with one idea and

00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:04.600
they spend three days building

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.300
the business plan and that

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.934
product.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:09.266
We're hoping that this type of

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.266
collaboration, imagination,

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.266
innovation, all in one space,

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.433
all together, through

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:15.900
networking, team building and

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.367
mentoring,

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:19.967
will help people think

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:21.100
differently in their day to day

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.166
jobs and create new products

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:25.066
throughout the year.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.233
Sprint's been really active in

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:27.967
this whole entrprenuerial

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:29.967
innovatin conversation for a

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:31.266
number of years now.

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.033
Our goals are really about

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.533
building community, building a

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.033
culture of innovation and

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:37.166
creativity.

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.400
making sure we can empower

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.000
people to know how to take those

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.500
steps.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.667
Knowing where to go and how to

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:43.800
build a team, attract a team,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.567
start to execute and validate,

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:47.000
is this a good idea.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.133
How good of an idea is it?

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.400
And do I have the right people

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.433
to execute on that idea with?

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:53.600
Well Startup Sprint is really

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.266
about just taking action.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.100
So I think that there are so

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.800
many smart people at Sprint, and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.767
there's so many great ideas out

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:02.233
there, I think that if we get a

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:03.433
new product or service, like

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:05.700
that's a bonus, it's really

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.734
about thinking differently, and

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.700
experimenting with new ideas.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.166
It's a cultural change, its to

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.900
get people to think differently

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.633
in their daily jobs.

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:18.233
Get them off campus and out of

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:19.166
their desks and in this great

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.800
space and work with people

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.667
they've never even met before

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:23.433
for three days.

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:24.400
Network, build these

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.734
relationships and then take this

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:26.900
way of thinking back to their 8

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.066
to 5 jobs.

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.233
Spending three days trying to

00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:32.300
put together a complete idea, is

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.300
a monumental challenge, but it's

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.066
a lot of fun.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.500
I really encourage other

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.233
employees to come down and take

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:38.300
the plunge.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.600
It's nerve-wracking, scary, I'm

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.266
still nervous, but I think the

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:44.200
rewards are going to be there.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.400
Frankly a little bit of fear is

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.367
healthy.

00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:47.066
Right?

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.500
You have to challenge yourself

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.200
in order to really grow as a

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.533
person and a professional.

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:54.667
Sometimes we think we're just

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.000
part, or a cog in the wheel.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.467
When you get with other people,

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:01.066
you really begin to understand

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:02.367
what you have to offer.

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:04.700
It's enlightening.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.633
I guess I just hope that, from

00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:07.800
an inspiratin perspective, it

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.567
gives people the freedom to

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:11.934
experiment and then take that

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:13.166
back to their jobs and say, hey

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:14.900
if you have an idea, there is a

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.700
way to just kind of take action

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.967
on that idea and start

00:02:17.967 --> 00:02:19.200
implimenting it.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.367
I would tell employees to just

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:22.600
do it, because it's great fun,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.633
and you meet a lot of new

00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:24.967
people, and it's just a really

00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:25.967
fun time.
