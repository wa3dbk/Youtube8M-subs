00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.780
Racing's definitely important for Mitsubishi Brand with racing WAC Worldwide champonship

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.530
p... to a car. And certaintly slash 2 years

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.839
we are here at Pike's Peak so again we're very
proud of being

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:22.210
a part of the Pike's Peak event and we are looking forward to the race day.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.819
We are here at the Pike's Peak race day shortly after 12 O'clock

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:29.759
We got ten cars to go before we are at facing a
delemma

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.280
There're slight rain on the top and little in the middle section

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.080
We're trying to figure out whether we can go out with slicks

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.750
If we go with slicks to fade risk right now, we can go in light rain

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.910
we grafted warmer is waing for us

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.570
The crews are a little tension right now
just waiting to hear to call

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.240
When we are in the line started rain much
harder

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.000
and we've basically needed to
select an option of rain tires to go out with

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Basically going though 156 turns and we have 156 super series of conseqnece if we get all

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.250
We get first 155

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.710
right to get 166 wrong

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.750
and we still get back at the bottom of the mountain

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.560
a little pieces

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.619
That why it's really nice to have a car

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.360
this is confidence to know at push a good time

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.670
Corner, edge, like this

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.000
halfway off, woop back the linie

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.909
I was looking at... Woo!

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.950
I felt the car started

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.810
this way.  I must hit a little bump

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.010
came back on. Like got alll wheel drive system back on the road.  So I had a good

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.150
two-wheel drive car.  I would ... or not.  Exceptional of one practice

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.240
quickest every single session

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.670
and some of the sessions by

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.190
5 - 6 seconds.  So I really

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.519
figure out to how to drive  My teammate and I  would one

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.119
first and second would be by

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.539
that's not my ...   My .. like this.  Weather changes

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.859
85 degrees down below sun bathing suit and short

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:26.489
When the race is started, put a suit on to help at the top put a snow.. ski back then.  Which is the figures

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.090
It's totally bezzer, right?  I don't know why peple come  ....

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.699
Unfortunately we were able to take the P1

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:38.049
and monster got us end, but I think saturday
and life that you know I don't really

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.459
considering whole week, we had a flowless week

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.899
Today again this is an unfortunate
situation with the weather can fight that.

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:46.120
the divers did a fantastic job

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.870
But the most importantly I think we had a short of a lot of speed. Hopele, we

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.180
could come back and and

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.729
really show we had as far as

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:56.319
the vehicle performance than anything
else.
