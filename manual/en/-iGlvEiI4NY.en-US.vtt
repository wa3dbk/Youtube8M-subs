00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.180
We continue making flat 5-petal flowers.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.500
This time we will make the same flower that was in part 1 of this tutorial but the petals will be smaller.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.860
Make a chain of 5

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.140
and join the chain in the round with a slip stitch.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.500
Round 1: 1 chain stitch up,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:01:01.860
and in the round make 9 single crochet stitches.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:09.580
Finish the first round with a slip stitch through the first chain stitch.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.980
First round is done.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.180
Second round of petals is ahead.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.140
1 chain stitch up

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.060
chain 3 more (to get the high of the petal)

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:39.300
through the same stitch make a treble crochet stitch (yarn over hook 2 times and work the stitch).

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:57.820
through the next stitch work 2 treble crochet stitches.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:10.100
Now treble crochet through the next stitch.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.100
chain 3

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.740
and single crochet through the same stitch.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.500
First petal is ready!

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.460
Let`s continue with the second petal.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:40.660
chain 3 (to get the high of the petal)

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:54.260
through the same stitch make a treble crochet stitches (yarn over hook 2 times and work the stitch).

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:11.580
through the next stitch work 2 treble crochet stitches.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.020
Treble crochet through the next stitch.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.220
chain 3

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:31.620
and single crochet through the same stitch.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.140
Second petal is ready!

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.900
Continue the same till the end of the round. Make 3 more petals.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.140
I am done with 4 petals. We are going to finish the flower together.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.100
Let`s make the last petal.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.740
chain 3

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:08.540
treble crochet through the same stitch.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:24.900
through the next stitch work 2 treble crochet stitches.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.820
Now treble crochet through the next stitch.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:37.300
Next treble crochet stitch we are going to make through the stitch that is already busy with other stitches.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.180
Our chain of 3 coming out of this stitch and also we made the first treble crochet through it.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.660
So now we need to make another treble crochet through.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.820
Continue with 3 chain stitches

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:05.900
And finish the round with a slip stitch through the first chain stitch.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.540
Flower is ready!

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.700
Here is the back side of the flower.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:34.500
In two parts 1 and 2 of tutorial 28 I showed you how to crochet flat little flowers with 5 petals.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:47.420
First flower was with long petals made of double treble crochet stitches. And another, smaller, made of treble crochet stitches.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:57.660
These flowers are simple. Usually they are often used for Guipure Lace. Also you can use these flowers as a decoration.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.860
Thanks for watching.
