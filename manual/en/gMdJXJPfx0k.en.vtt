00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.500
Ahhh!! Damn Pikachu

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.440
Ahh! My Pikachu

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.360
ZUBAT BARBECUE

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.760
Ooee!! I think we have to eat this

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.080
But, Professor

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.500
If they spot us, our Pokemon research career
might be in danger

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.300
Only a stupid would eat such food

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.380
Because, everybody knows that
eating PokÃ©mon isn't allowed

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.920
I know right

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.000
But, do you think that stupids fall down from the sky?

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.260
Ooohh... Fire

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.080
Well, there's only one thing we can do...

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.980
What can we do, Professor?

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.900
Run away in circles

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.800
Ehhh...

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.220
What's going on?

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.120
Ehhhh...

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.360
I can't understand what's going on yet

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.580
Ehhh...

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.200
Who are you?

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.240
Our hero has had a great adventure

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.680
And now he's heading down to the next city

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.400
but who knows what troubles are waiting for...?

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.640
Hey! I always say the same dialogue

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.700
Can I say something new?

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.980
Because, the same line again and again, and again...

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.720
Then, the series is going to lose originality

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.120
No?

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.880
Ok...

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.640
This story will continue....
