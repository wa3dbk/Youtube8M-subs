00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.109
Hey this is Derek Doepker with Excuse Proof
Fitness here in a video on how to get yourself

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.230
motivated to stick
to a healthy diet.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.350
In the previous videos in the series on how
to stick to a diet, I've talked about the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.640
importance of awareness, and
developing the awareness of what you want,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.550
and where you're at right now.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.640
In this video, I'm going to be talking about
how to actually get those feelings, those

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.630
emotions generated inside
yourself about feeling passionate and excited

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.159
about pursuing a healthier lifestyle.

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:35.820
If you really wanted to be motivated to do
something, you have to have a big reason why

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.890
you want that thing.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.030
If you hear stories about people who are really
successful, who made dramatic changes to their

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.830
health, and their
body and their lifestyle, what you'll often

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.030
hear is a very big reason why they got started.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.440
What it might be is someone realized they
might not live much longer if they didn't

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.440
change their ways.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.800
Or even
just the thought of not being around another

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.030
20 years.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.420
Or not being there for their kids if they
died early.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.760
Or someone if they lost their health, they
wouldn't be able to pursue the things they

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.950
were passionate about.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.450
Or perhaps, they've never been able to pursue
the things they were passionate about in their

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.070
life, because their health and their body
was holding them back.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.050
So they made commitment to change.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.570
What you won't often hear is someone who says
"I've made a complete turnaround in my diet

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.130
and I've stuck with it for years and years
and years."

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.190
And you ask them why they do it and they say,
"ahh well I just kind of felt like it."

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.190
That doesn't happen.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.370
There's usually a strong reason that's compelling
them to change.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.659
So what this means is that you have to get
in touch with the reasons that are compelling

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.700
to you to eat healthier and stick with a healthier
diet.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.670
A lot of times when a person considers "why
do I want to eat healthier" they may give

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.090
a common answer like I want to lose weight.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.619
Now that's fine, but that's only the very
surface level reason why.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.979
Then you have to go deeper beyond that and
go "why do I want to lose weight?"

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.900
It might be "I want to look better"

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.600
"Why do I want to look better?"

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.020
And you keep digging deeper and deeper.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.030
Let me give you an example of something that's
not health related.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.450
Let's say someone says "I'd really love to
get this new job."

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.150
"Why do you want the new job?"

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.330
"Because it pays me more money?"

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.250
"Why do you want more money?"

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.870
"I want more money because then I can travel
the world.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.460
That's something I've always wanted to do."

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.560
"Why have you always wanted to travel the
world?"

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.730
"Because I'm interested in learning about
different cultures.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.840
That's something I've always intrigued by
is how different cultures live and their art.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.670
I'd love to just experience all that."

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.670
or whatever.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.220
So I'm kind of making this stuff up but you
see you can keep going deeper and deeper.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.770
Every reason that is given, you ask why you
want that thing?

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.290
So all of a sudden, getting a new job in this
person's mind is associated with freedom to

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.300
travel the world.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.959
It's associated with satisfying a curiosity
they have about different cultures and things.

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.739
The same thing happens with your diet.

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.930
When you start to understand eating healthier,
getting more fit can mean freedom to do things

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.390
you're passionate about in life in other areas
beyond just your health.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.570
So ask yourself "why do I want to eat a healthier
diet."

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.640
"Why do I want to improve my health and make
these changes."

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.160
So come up with one or as many reasons as
you want to, and then whatever reasons you

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.459
give, ask yourself why do I want that.

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.769
Then whatever reasons you give for that, ask
why do I want that next thing.

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.599
And keep digging deeper and deeper until you
come up with reasons why eating healthy, and

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.250
sticking to a healthier diet will just be
something that fills you with passion and

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.250
excitement.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.750
You'll know when you hit these reasons.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.000
And even if you don't come up with really
huge compelling reasons, chances are just

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.050
this practice of thinking about it, thinking
about why you want to make these changes,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.740
will start to generate more feelings of excitement
and motivation.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.599
So if you want to know the reasons why I made
a commitment to make a change when I first

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.909
got started, then I'm going to talk about
this in the next video.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.239
There I'll be giving some specific tips and
some action steps that you can take to uncover

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.560
more reasons why to stick to a healthier diet.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.650
And especially finding reasons that help you
day in and day out constantly remind yourself

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.239
why you want to make these changes.
