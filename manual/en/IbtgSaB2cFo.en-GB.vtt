00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:07.319
You find yourself half way between stops when
the bus whips past. This problem has plagued

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.100
passengers for years but TfL have come up
with a solution and as the voice you'll hear on the London buses

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.270
Waterloo station Waterloo Road

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.449
I'm hear to show you how simple it can be.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.100
You're waiting for your bus?
Yes

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.750
Do you ever want to know if your bus is going
to be late or if it's going to be on time

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.500
or if there are delays...just how long you
have to wait?

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.000
Yeah
English weather!

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.949
You don't want to get wet, you don't want
to get cold, you just want to get to where

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.640
you're going as quick as possible?
...Go home, exactly

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.900
Leave the door
A to B

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.120
Yep..yes
As quick as possible...

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.400
Yes
So anywhere in London you can always find out when you're bus is arriving...

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.050
Oh that's great

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.420
You can plan your bus journey in the same
way as a train by using the live bus arrivals

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.370
tool on the TfL website with live information
on 19,000 bus stops and 700 routes and all

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.629
you need to do is type in your location. What's
more it's free.

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.559
If you use SMS there's a small charge of 12
pence plus your standard text message charge.

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.440
There are over 8 and a half thousand busses
on our network and we then predict when those

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.480
buses will arrive at every one of our bus
stops. That information is then transmitted

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.530
through our text message, our Web service
and to all 2 and a half thousand roadside

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.000
signs and to the growing number of smartphone
apps so is one of the largest networks in the whole world.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.920
I live in Islington so go from Islington to
Waterloo everyday.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.500
So what's your postcode?
Put that in....so it's come up with all the bus stops

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.400
That's just down the road from me as well

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.200
There you go the next bus the 153 is in
3 minutes time

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.000
Excellent
It does work you see we're not making it up!

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.490
And if your social networker, simply follow
@tflbusalerts on Twitter

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.970
Does a cup of tea come with it as well?
No cup of tea but if you've got 5 minutes

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.670
to wait you can get your own cup
I'll use it every day I think

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.250
The word on TfL's bus travel tools is getting
out. It's already been used on nearly 1,000,000

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.500
journeys every day. Why don't you get on board
too?
