00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.580
Hi everybody, joey here again and welcome
back.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.580
So today, I'm going to show you how to build
an aquarium chiller.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.120
some hobbyists live in areas where it might
get very hot in certain months.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.600
Cooling their aquarium water on a constant
basis is something they might need to consider.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.010
In today's video, I'm going to show you how
to build a chiller that you can do at home

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.480
that will not only work well, but look good,
be functional and be cost effective.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.770
I wanted to keep this project under $100 and
be universal for any aquarium.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.200
As with all my videos, I also needed to create
a project that many people would actually

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.710
be able to do.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.620
So simplicity is always key.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.150
Smaller chillers start around $500 for a chiller
rated for aaround 50 gallons.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.810
This project will only cost around $100 for
the same size tank, and use less power.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.980
More so, this project will serve to inspire
you with a simple idea.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.050
So let's get started.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.570
I started off with buying a mini fridge second
hand.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.611
I built the chiller out of one of these as
they are commonly available, cheap, and easy

00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:05.800
to work with and look pretty good.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.220
Since I bought mine second hand, I only paid
$30 for it.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.140
Even new, they are only $100.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.200
You will be able to find many mini fridges
on crags list, kijiji or other similar sites

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.900
for around the same price or even less.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.480
I started by removing everything out of the
fridge.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.770
I removed the grating, and all small doors
inside.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.930
Most mini fridges will have a small "freezer"
inside.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.850
Removing the door from it will allow for more
circulation of the cold air.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.050
DO NOT freezer tray as this is what actually
produces the cold air.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.720
With the fridge now emptied out, I got some
garden hose.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.340
I used garden hose as it is rigid and cheap.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.420
It also has excellent insulation properties
compared to other types of hoses.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.479
You can use whatever you find is cheapest.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.210
BUT you will need a lot of it.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.190
If using garden hose, running some water through
it for a few minutes will insure there is

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.510
no dust or anything else in the hose making
it more safe to use.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.840
I got two 50 foot hoses for $15 total.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.000
I just picked up the cheapest ones I could
find and they were on sale.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.800
You will want to Test fit the hose in the
fridge first, to make sure it fits.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.230
Again, the more hose you have the better.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.650
I would start with at least 100 feet...

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.291
If using garden hose, don't bother unraveling
it.

00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:27.990
It is better just to leave it alone and not
cause any kinks.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.250
Plus, it's already nicely coiled for you.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.120
Now prepare the hose.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.170
Start by cutting off one end of each hose.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.210
Cut off opposite connectors.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.540
We need to still be able to connect the hoses
in the middle.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.180
If you only have one long hose, you can simply
cut off both ends.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.430
Then connect the two hoses in the middle.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.990
Using your spade drill, drill the holes where
you want the hose to enter and exit.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.660
Location doesn't matter as long as you don't
go through the back or top of the fridge.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.630
This will general be harder to work around
and more risk of hitting something you don't

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.880
want to hit!

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.430
The spade should be slightly small then the
diameter of the hose, as this will insure

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.210
a tight fit and allow the hose to form a seal
with the fridge.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.069
Slide the hoses through the holes.

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.880
If you notice it is a loose fit, fill free
to silicone them in place.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.380
You can even use some expanding foam to help
insulate that area.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.849
While not needed, and will drive over all
costs up, the benefits of it are slightly

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.970
better than silicone.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.990
Notice the thermostat is still intact and
the "freezer" is still fully functional.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.459
It is only now ventilated and the colder air
can freely pass through the whole fridge.

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.450
Turn the fridge on, and let it run on its
own for at least 24 hours with the temperature

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.740
set to the coolest temperature...

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.170
This will get the fridge ready for use.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.900
Now before we talk about connecting it to
your aquarium, let's first talk about how

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.750
this works.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.230
Water will be pumped into the fridge through
the hose and back out to the tank.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.269
Water is cooled because of the time it spends
in the fridge.

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.180
The more hose you have in the fridge, the
longer the water will be in contact with the

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.050
cool hose and the cooler the output of the
water will be.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.590
To control temperature, changes must be monitored
over time, until you get the right temperature

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.019
of the tank.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.299
By simply turning down the flow of the pump,
you cool the water.

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.699
Turning it up, warms the water.

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.370
You might also find playing around with the
thermostat useful as well.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.210
This style cooler will be good for tanks up
to 50 gallons.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.599
However, that will also depend on just how
cool you need your water to be.

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.469
This might work on larger setups.

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:39.960
So how do you connect this to your aquarium?

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.439
Well, this is where YOU get creative.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:44.259
Every aquarium is unique.

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.909
You might not want a pump inside your aquarium,
so you decide to plumb the pump "inline" outside

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:55.169
of the tank and simply make a couple of PVC
intake and output for the chiller.

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.289
Maybe you don't mind an extra pump in the
tank and you just run a pump down to the chiller

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.689
and the output hose back up to the tank.

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:12.129
Ultimately, this is easiest and cheapest if
you are running it to a sump.

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.699
This way you only need to use a cheap and
low powered power head or small pump.

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.669
What I also like to do is on the output hose,
I connect a ball valve so I can control the

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:22.830
flow a little easier.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.009
This is basically a must to be able to control
the temperature more precisely.

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.060
The thermostat in the fridge will help with
that as well.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.169
Anyways, I hope you guys enjoyed this project
and it gave you a few ideas to use on your

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.169
own.

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.199
I also want to thank you guys for watching
and we'll see you next time.
