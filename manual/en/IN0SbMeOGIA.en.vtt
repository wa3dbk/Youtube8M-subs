00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.380
 I'm Conor Nixon, I'm a planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.780
and I study the atmospheric composition of the outer planets.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.980
Titan is Saturn's largest moon, it's actually the second-largest moon in the solar system,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.880
and it's the only moon in the solar system that has a large and substantial atmosphere,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.560
and that atmosphere in some respects is really similar to that of the Earth, being composed mainly of nitrogen, but in other respects it's really different.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.900
It has methane as the second-most abundant gas, and that takes the same role as water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.120
It evaporates from the surface, it forms clouds, and then rains down again

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.980
and in fact forms lakes that we see at Titan's north pole, including ethane and propane and all sorts of complex chemicals.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.370
We also see these vast dune fields at the equator, which are not made of silicates as they are on the Earth but actually made of organic substances,

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.060
essentially plastics which have actually sedimented from the atmosphere

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.880
and are being blown around into dune fields the same as we'd see on a desert on the Earth.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.510
Back in 1980 when Voyager 1 flew by Titan and made the first close encounter with that moon,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.280
it discovered many new chemical species in the atmosphere, and a lot of these are what we call hydrocarbons,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.890
which are composed of two types of atom, carbon and hydrogen.  And these are derived from methane after the methane is broken apart by sunlight

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:21.260
it forms into longer and longer chain molecules.  So you can add first two carbons together to make a family of molecules,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.050
and you can also form three carbons together to form a heavier family of molecules.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.020
So it was actually very mysterious that Voyager only discovered the heaviest and the lightest members of the three carbon family,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.610
but it didn't find the middle member of the family, propylene, that was missing.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.600
So NASA has this wonderful flagship spacecraft called Cassini which is currently orbiting Saturn,

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.730
and it's making multiple close flybys of Titan.  Now in visible light, Titan appears quite bland and featureless just like an orange globe,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.580
but Cassini has techniques to peer through that haze, including the Composite Infrared Spectrometer or CIRS,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.900
which can look at the heat coming from the atmosphere and split it apart into its different frequencies,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.660
and this forms a characteristic pattern of peaks, which give the characteristic signatures of different molecules.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.060
And through this we can detect which molecules are in the atmosphere, and we see all the molecules that were previously discovered by Voyager.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.110
But we're also able to look for new molecules, and in fact, buried within the signatures of these more abundant molecular species

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.260
we saw a very small spike which was due to a new species which had not been seen before,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.060
and in fact this was propylene, and we saw it at multiple altitudes in Titan's atmosphere.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.300
When we added all the signal together, we had more than 99% confidence that we were discovering a new molecule.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.630

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.690
So this object I have right here, this is polypropylene.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.730
This is a plastic that we use on the Earth in everyday household objects such as this plastic tub here,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.910
and if we turn it over on the bottom, we find a symbol with the number 5 that says PP, polypropylene.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.880
This is the propylene that we found on Titan, but polymerized, that means that the molecule is formed into long chains,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.080
and when these chains are tangled together it forms a hard, clear plastic that we use in many household objects.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.280
So that was really fun for me to realize that something that we'd discovered in space was in fact something that I was touching every day on the Earth.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.360
So the discovery of propylene on Titan is really exciting.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.310
First of all, it completes this chemical family where we had this missing link dating thirty-two years back to Voyager,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.680
but also, it shows that there's much more there still in Titan's atmosphere to be discovered.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.740
Some people think that Titan is similar to the prebiotic Earth long ago, when the molecules were forming the basis of life.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.580
And we don't know what we're going to find on Titan if we send back further spacecraft with new instruments, more sensitive instruments,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.240
if some of the molecules on Titan could be similar to the basis of life on Earth.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:57.251
