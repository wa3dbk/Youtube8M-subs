&nbsp;      (<i>music</i>)

00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:22.083
&nbsp;      Texting and Driving has become so catastrophic.

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:26.093
&nbsp;      I think it’s more dangerous than drinking and driving

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:31.797
&nbsp;      because you’re looking down, and you, right away in a head on collision.

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.908
&nbsp;      Too much has happened.

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:36.712
&nbsp;      <i>Michelle Kuckelman</i>:  We’re trying to use Werner Herzog’s

00:00:36.712 --> 00:00:39.537
&nbsp;      brilliant film to help the general public

00:00:39.537 --> 00:00:44.232
&nbsp;      understand that Texting and Driving has real dire consequences.

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:48.138
&nbsp;      It’s very, very deep impact of raw emotions

00:00:48.138 --> 00:00:52.918
&nbsp;      of basic fundamental questions about life and death.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:55.827
&nbsp;      Sadly, you know, a documentary like this has to be made so that people

00:00:55.827 --> 00:00:59.357
&nbsp;      can see it so they can get that shock factor so they can stop doing it.

00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:05.685
&nbsp;      (<i>music</i>)

00:01:06.757 --> 00:01:08.892
&nbsp;      <i>Chandler Gerber</i>: "You know, I can text message,

00:01:08.892 --> 00:01:12.747
&nbsp;      I can drive, it’s no big deal, you know.

00:01:12.747 --> 00:01:16.135
&nbsp;      I thought that up until the accident."

00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:21.275
&nbsp;      <i>Valetta</i>: "His legs are gone. X is paralyzed from the diaphragm down."

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:23.348
&nbsp;      <i>Chandler Gerber</i>:  It feels like this whole lat year and half since it happened

00:01:23.348 --> 00:01:25.768
&nbsp;      has been a nightmare that’s more like it.

00:01:25.768 --> 00:01:31.235
&nbsp;      Wish you can wake up and undo what’s been done and we just try to get up

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:35.452
&nbsp;      and we’re thankful for the opportunity to just prevent others

00:01:35.452 --> 00:01:38.015
&nbsp;      from being through what we’ve been through.

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:41.277
&nbsp;      There is no redo button in life, there’s no undo button.

00:01:41.277 --> 00:01:47.547
&nbsp;      And you know, don’t take any unnecessary risks and you know,

00:01:47.547 --> 00:01:49.623
&nbsp;      just stay focused on what you are doing.

00:01:49.623 --> 00:01:52.215
&nbsp;      <i>Michelle Kuckelman</i>:  It’s really about educating people about the consequence.

00:01:52.215 --> 00:01:57.492
&nbsp;      <i>Debbie Drewniak</i>:  I don’t remember anything. It definitely has changed my life a lot.

00:01:57.492 --> 00:02:01.745
&nbsp;      Don’t text and drive. Don’t do it. It’s not worth it.

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:09.148
