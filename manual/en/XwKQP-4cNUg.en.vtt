If you saw the Vice Presidential debate between Paul Ryan and Joe Biden last night you saw a perfect example of why Washington 
 doesn't work, especially why it isn't working now and why liberals and the hypocrites in the Obama administration need to go.

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:28.734
What we saw from the Vice President of the United States last night was about as partisan, rude 
 and disrespectful as one can get. Joe Biden was most certainly not very Vice Presidential last evening.

00:00:34.438 --> 00:00:46.438
While we were watching a debate and expected to see the stark policy differences between two 
 competing ideals, what we instead saw was a Vice President that showed disdain, disrespect, partisanship,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:57.580
belittling and unprofessionalism at a level that some commentators are saying they have 
 never seen in any debate between candidates at this level of government.

00:01:02.047 --> 00:01:14.047
While President Obama has talked repeatedly about reaching across the aisle and having a balanced approach to government to 
 be able to get things done, we saw last night why this administration can't get things done.

00:01:43.178 --> 00:01:49.180
The differences between the two VP choices was like 
 night and day. Paul Ryan was calm, respectful,

00:01:50.163 --> 00:02:01.160
had well though out and factual arguments and even though he was interrupted by both Biden 
 and the moderator Martha Raddatz multiple times he still showed control, maturity and respect.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:18.270
And Joe Biden spent nearly the whole time smirking at Paul Ryan, rolling his eyes like an immature teenager, interrupting 
 and mocking Ryan's and Romney's positions on issues with comments such as, that's just a bunch of stuff.

00:02:23.623 --> 00:02:35.620
Charles Krauthammer called it when he said that if you read the transcript it was an even debate and if you heard it 
 on the radio Biden won, but if you watched the debate on TV, Joe Biden's disrespectful attitude cost him a win.

00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:51.820
I thought Ryan handled himself well as there were a couple of times in the debate 
 where both Martha Raddatz and Biden were asking him questions at the same time.

00:02:55.844 --> 00:03:06.840
When the story about Obama attending Raddatz's wedding in 1991 i thought it was no big deal, heck that 
 was 21 years ago, but wow, did Martha Raddatz let Biden run wild in this debate or what?

00:03:15.274 --> 00:03:27.270
I don't think this debate convinced any Obama supporters to switch sides, but I'll bet more than a few 
 fence sitters will now look at Biden's disrespectful debate performance and Obama's one sided approach to governing

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:32.960
and realize this administration is not what we need for another 4 years.
