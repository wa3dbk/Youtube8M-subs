00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.190
We never paid any heed to the ancient prophecies.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.060
Like fools we clung to the old hatreds

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.210
and fought as we had for generations

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.100
until the day the sky rained fire

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.020
and a new enemy came upon us.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.040
We stand now upon the brink of destruction,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.000
for the Reign of Chaos has come at last.
