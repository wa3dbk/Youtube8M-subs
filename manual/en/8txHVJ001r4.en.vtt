00:00:00.626 --> 00:00:02.435
- Parasympathetic fibers.

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:05.059
The anatomy of the
parasympathetic nervous system

00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:07.477
is more straightforward.

00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:11.018
There's a little bit of review.
Do you remember--okay.

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:15.435
Parasympathetic, what do you
notice about my green fibers?

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.768
Green fibers are coming
from where, my friends?

00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:22.477
They are coming from the brain

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:24.810
and they are coming
from the sacrum.

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:32.643
So, S2 to S4 and cranial nerves.

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:36.226
What?
Cranial nerves who?

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.894
What cranial nerves carry
parasympathetic fibers?

00:00:41.918 --> 00:00:46.810
Three to make
your pupils constrict.

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:50.560
Seven--
oops, seven goes like that.

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:55.101
That's a seven.
Sure, it does.

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:59.226
To make you salivate and cry.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:08.975
Nine to make you salivate
some more, and 10,

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:13.018
holy-to-do-everything-else.
What cranial nerve was 10?

00:01:13.042 --> 00:01:14.852
That was the vagus nerve

00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:19.975
and it comes down
like this and goes everywhere.

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:22.975
The vagus nerve does 75

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:27.643
to 80 percent of all of your
parasympathetic innervation.

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:29.975
It's actually carried
in the vagus nerve,

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:32.852
which is wildly fantastic.

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:36.810
The rest of your cranial
nerves carry some of it,

00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:37.310
and then you've got

00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:40.894
some sacral nerves that are
carrying some of it.

00:01:40.918 --> 00:01:44.894
And what is the anatomy?
What is the spinal cord anatomy?

00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:49.975
It's not this.
And it's not this.

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:57.059
In fact, it'll be this, except
what am I going to cross off?

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:58.685
Who needs this?

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.935
Hum, that's going to be in
the sympathetic nervous system.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.351
We're not even-- it--

00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:10.685
just pretend like that doesn't
exist for parasympathetic.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.894
So if we were going to map this,
map our dark green pathway,

00:02:15.918 --> 00:02:19.852
where is our
pre-ganglionic cell body?

00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:22.727
The same place as all of our
other visceral motor.

00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:26.477
It's in either the lateral
grey horn,

00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:29.435
or, like, the lateral arena.

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.685
I think, technically,
in the sacral spinal cord,

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.185
they don't call it
a lateral grey horn,

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.810
but they do
have a lateral grey area.

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:45.310
And then, of course,
in the cranial nerves

00:02:45.334 --> 00:02:49.768
the visceral motor fibers are
coming out of the brain.

00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:52.435
So, they're not going to have--

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.685
I mean, we're not mapping it
onto the spinal cord at all,

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.226
because it's
coming out of brain.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.101
But in the sacral region,

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:06.685
for the areas that do map, we've
got this parasympathetic fiber

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.810
that comes through just
like everybody else.

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:12.143
It comes through the ventral--

00:03:12.167 --> 00:03:17.975
I mean, the anterior root
through the spinal nerve,

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:22.435
out the anterior ramus,

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.268
and then, remember,
this guy is so long,

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:30.976
and this is my
pre-ganglionic neuron.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.310
And it's still--
let's just depend.

00:03:33.334 --> 00:03:34.975
It actually doesn't
go to the heart.

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.685
It's the vagus nerve
that goes to the heart.

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.560
But we're just going to pretend,

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:41.351
because, you know,
pretending is fun.

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:43.435
And I'll change my color
just slightly.

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.852
We'll make it
a little bit darker.

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:49.393
This is my ganglionic neuron

00:03:49.417 --> 00:03:52.560
with parasympathetic fibers,
the ganglia,

00:03:52.584 --> 00:03:55.560
the ganglionic
neurons are really short.

00:03:55.584 --> 00:04:01.975
They're often embedded in
the wall of the effector itself.

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:05.975
Again, the heart is innervated
by the vagus nerve.

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:09.101
So, we're not going to see this
coming out of the spinal cord,

00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:14.143
but we would see a pre-ganglion
neuron that's really long

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:16.185
coming out of the brainstem,

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.975
where cranial nerve 11 exits
the brain--

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:24.310
I mean, 10, because that's
the vagus nerve.

00:04:24.334 --> 00:04:29.685
Oh, what's true
about my pre-ganglion neuron?

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:33.477
Okay.
I love you guys a lot,

00:04:33.501 --> 00:04:36.894
and I really want to put
the yellow ruffly pants

00:04:36.918 --> 00:04:40.894
on this pre-ganglion neuron,

00:04:40.918 --> 00:04:43.768
but it's really long.

00:04:43.792 --> 00:04:45.975
Really, long.
Look at me.

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:49.852
I'm doing it, anyway.
Go. Okay.

00:04:49.876 --> 00:04:51.975
We have a little bit
of wonkiness in my--

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:54.975
oh, look.
I did it.

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:58.643
It's totally myelinated.

00:04:58.667 --> 00:05:02.185
Is my ganglionic
neuron myelinated? No.

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:07.393
And that's a characteristic
of my visceral motor pathways.

00:05:07.417 --> 00:05:09.975
What else do you need to know?
It's going to calm us down.

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:11.643
We're going to chill out.
We're going to be able

00:05:11.667 --> 00:05:13.894
to make babies,
unless we're sea urchins,

00:05:13.918 --> 00:05:20.935
but sea urchin don't have
spinal cords, so we're cool.

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:21.976
That's it.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.727
Are you happy?
Okay.

00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:27.101
Now we're going to review
all of it together,

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:29.459
and I will be right
back to do that.
