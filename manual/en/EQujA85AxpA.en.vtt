on our first night here, we actually saw this

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.759
great band perform at a local restaurant and
now we have them here today.

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.380
They are The Henningsens and it’s actually
a dad, daughter, and son; we have Brian, Clara,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:01:32.729

a little christmas melody here today.

00:01:32.729 --> 00:02:27.490

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:45.620

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.310
You know, uh, we get to do this as a family
and not a lot of people get to work together

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.330

ourselves to be very blessed.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.739

that are actually in the family’ so uh,

music as well?

AARON: If we could just get William, the 9
year old to play the bass like him, yeno that

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.560
