00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.260
Hello, What´s up? We are in Tulum!!

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.960
The only archaeological  zone next to the sea.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.820
Let´s discover it!!

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.560
Tulum means wall!!

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.720
This zone was created to separate priests  from the rest of the people.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.060
Let´s get in and see how it is.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.320
There is people from all around the world.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.580
Well, we´re walking through the wall.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
A very wide wall.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.640
but it allows us appreciate the beauty of Tulum

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.940
See it by yourselves

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.040
The weather is awesome

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.280
It´s so beautiful in here

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:42.560
This is an example of how they used to live, here is where priests lived,  as I said before, and they lived in fancy temples.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.820
There is no doubt that Tulum is beautiful. An archeological zone surrounded by an extraordinary landscape.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.380
Well, we are in the classic area, where everybody knows the pyramid near to the sea.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:35.000
Right now it is very windy; in fact the beach has a red flag but besides that, it´s ok.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:03:04.920
Please, give yourselves the opportunity to visit Tulum, the view that this place provides is splendid, watch the color of the sea, the sea is a little dirty but it doesn't reduce  the beauty of this place.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.880
Here we have another view of Tulum.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:35.440
I suggest you to arrive early, I arrived around 9:15am,  it's a good time to walk the zone with good weather and moderate people.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.260
It is already 11 O´clock and a lot of people is arriving, witch make it difficult  to explore the archaeological zone.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.940
As I mentioned in the beginning, the are people from all around the world.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.780
As Mexicans we have to give ourselves the opportunity to explore the places that we have in Mexico.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.640
Let's don't miss these  places.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.900
Many countries can't have them.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:41.100
Imagine this archaeological zone in good times, all the buildings.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.040
It´s spectacular, it has an unbeatable magnificence.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.260
Another recommendation!! Don't forget your cap, sunblock or a hat like me.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.940
See the great landscape of Tulum.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.820
It is incredible!! This place is very nice.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.500
Really give yourselves the chance to come and discover these kind of places.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:59.620
You have to live them by yourselves. Your friends and I can tell you something but everyone has a different perception.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.680
Some people may or may not like it.  In my case, I love it.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.000
but come to visit.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.220
Our tour has finished and we will go out through a different wall. This is the other wall.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.720
Ok folks!! This is it for this video, it is a short video but I show you the main places from Tulum.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.920
