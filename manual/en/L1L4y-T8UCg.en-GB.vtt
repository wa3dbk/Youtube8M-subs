00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.400
Jess and James are about to demonstrate a
drill, it is a two man workout drill

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.210
you have got a feeder at the top and we are
going to alternate places

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.530
the idea is we are going to lead in under
the basket, slash arm, lead out,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.640
square up on our inside foot, shot fake and
then drive and do a layup

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.529
the shooter rebounds his own ball and goes
to the top, the person at the top who is the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.300
feeder goes to the wing and they just swap spots.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.920
So we want to go deep under the basket, we
want to make a good shot fake and then an

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.920
aggressive move to the hole, to score on the
layup.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.800
As we cut, we keep our eye on the target,
we are always looking at the ball through-out our cut

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.800
at any stage during a cut we could get the
ball.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.130
So watch the ball as you lead, we are now
left hand layup on the left hand side.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.690
And we are left hand dribble on the left hand
side, so you swap sides, once you do it one

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.130
side you do it the other side.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.260
Each player goes for ten attempts on each
side of the basket.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.350
Once you have done ten layups on each side,
you can then work in pairs and do shooting,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.420
the same drill.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.420
Lead in, slash arm, lead out, square up on
your inside foot, square up and take a shot.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.900
Get your rebound.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.530
Watch the ball as you lead in as well, square
up, shoot.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.060
Rebound.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.159
Slash arm, lead out, square up.

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:09.950
Shot.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.980
So you do ten shots, after you have done your
layups on each side, you do ten shots on  each side
