00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.150
Surfing means the world to me.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.699
I love being outdoors..

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.699
..in the wild.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.260
It is extraordinary..

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.530
..that something like the wind..

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.530
..can carry you.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.650
It is mix of fear, freedom and adventure.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.600
I get a kick out of it when I surf on the waves at full throttle..

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.600
and jumping several meters high.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.079
I think every kite surfer must have wondered..

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.680
what it would be like to go snow kiting.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.299
It is a completely different experience.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.229
It is far below zero.

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:52.099
My hands are freezing the second I take of my gloves.

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.859
I am walking out my lines.

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.779
The wind is extremely strong. Snow flying up.

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:12.719
Occasionally the sun peeks through. The light is wonderful.

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:23.129
I am ready with my snowboard attached.

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.900
It is really going to happen. There you are with your snowboard in the mountains.

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.819
Feeling the force of the wind that pulls the kite,

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.379
hearing the sound of shrilling ice, feeling the freezing wind in your face.

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.609
You are hanging under your kite,

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:02.609
mountains all around you, everything is white.

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.090
Complete solitude..
0:04:08.769,0:04:07.090
..it is a dream.
