00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.040
This time I will use a more Ukrainian way of transportation.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.050
- We are in the bus station, 
and we are going to Khotyn.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:17.020
- I'm looking for our bus, 
but I think I should ask some people.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.240
It is in this kind of situations where the problems 
with language can arise, in special on the countryside.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.050
- Where is our bus?

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.130
- I will ask these people.
Excuse me, do you speak English?

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.090
- Yes.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:40.040
- Can you please tell me, I don't get it, my bus to “Khotyn”?
- Maybe it's this bus.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.040
- This bus?
- Yes.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.180
- It's ours, OK, thank you. Oh, yes, we found it!

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.110
- These small buses, like that, it's very 
popular in Ukraine, and very comfortable...

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:57.100
...you can get from any place you want to another 
place you want, and it's called “minibus marshrutka”.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.210
- Open the window to Europe.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.120
Regardless of the look and feel of the vehicle, in most 
cases the problem are just the roads underneath their wheels.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.050
- I'm very surprised with this roads, and now 
I'm driving in this small minibus...

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.050
...and it's all the time shaking, but 
it's a very good massage for my cellulite.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.240
The road leading to Khotyn crosses the 
only river in Ukraine that rivals Dnipro...

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.090
...and with a kind of similar name, Dniester.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.230
- This is Khotyn, a very small town, with 10,000 
inhabitants, so we are following to the castle...

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.140
...the Khotyn fortress.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.220
A walk full of animals.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.090
- Why are they afraid of me?

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.150
- Horses! Yummy...

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.220
- In Ukraine I tried a sausage with horse 
meat, and now when I see these horses...

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:00.110
...I'm very sorry and very sad about 
them, they are such nice animals, but so tasty.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.080
The rural look of Khotyn represents a kind 
of time travel, that reaches its best expression...

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.070
...when arriving at the highlight of the town.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.060
- And now we are going closer to this fortress, Khotyn 
fortress, with a beautiful view to Dniester river.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.070
- Welcome in Khotyn!

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.150
- So this is the castle Khotyn, the first remains 
of this castle were dated from the 13th century...

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:34.240
...when it was wooden, and after a great fire it was 
destroyed and in the 16th century it was rebuilt...

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
...and now we have this castle like it 
looked like in the 16th century.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.190
- This fortress had 3 big fortification walls, 
one of them we can see right now there...

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.030
...the remains of this wall, so it was very 
difficult to go inside, and most of the times...

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.090
...when some enemy came inside, 
it was because the people couldn't stand...

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.030
...to be inside without water and food.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.050
- There is a legend that this tunnel, connected 
this fortress and another we are going later...

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.180
...called Kamyanets Podilski, and it takes about 
30 kilometres under the river and underground...

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.050
- And another legend says that sometimes
people can see some ghosts here...

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.000
...and can here some strange noises, 
like we can hear it now.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.090
Some of the best views are from 
the narrow windows of the outer walls.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.150
- This is the river Dniester.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.150
To which it is possible to walk down around the castle.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:55.020
- There is a legend connected with this wet spot, 
and it says that there was a daughter of the owner...

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.110
...of the fortress and she fell in love with the son 
of his great enemies, and they loved each other...

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.200
...but it was forbidden, and her father just took them,
and put them inside the wall, and blocked them.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.200
- And that's why the legend says 
that they are crying there.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.080
- This is one of the biggest and widest rivers 
in Ukraine, and the biggest river in Western Ukraine.

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:28.210
- And it flows to Moldova, if I threw this coin, 
my coin will be in Moldova in few weeks...

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:38.000
- Times ago this river was the 
second cleanest river in Europe.
