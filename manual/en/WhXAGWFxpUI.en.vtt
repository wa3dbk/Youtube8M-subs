00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.510
 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.080
Hi everyone,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.230
this is Resogun and it's probably a sleeper hit on the PlayStation 4.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.950
Now essentially this game comes for free
if you're a PlayStation Plus member

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.939
so if you're playing PS4 online you are
already a PlayStation Plus member

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.630
because that's the only way you can play online. If not

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.470
it's around £11-£15 and the game is
just fantastic it is well worth picking up.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.880
 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.090
It has some of the most colourful graphics I
think I've seen in a game

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.750
of this type before, it is a dual stick
shooter and the idea is you've got to save

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.510
the humans

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.530
and the humans are unleashed onto the
world

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.320
by the alien aggressors and you have to get
there in time to kind of rescue them and drop

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.470
them into the green pillars.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.680
Whilst you are doing that you are building up
score points or score multipliers

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.250
the whole time and the idea of this game
really is to set the highest score you possibly can

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.010
on each level

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.100
by completing the boss as well. And the
bosses

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.810
are fiendishly difficult until you work out the kind of rhythm you need to use to

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.339
kill them.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.380
Everything in this game is about agility,
about your reflexes

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.060
about trying to avoid the incoming fire whilst
meting out as much damage as you

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.090
possibly can.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.780
The game gets fast and frantic and
you're going to need those weapon upgrades

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.409
over time.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.830
This isn't a free to play title so everything
that you play in this game

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.850
is there for you to play alone as it
were. So unlock those levels yourself

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.180
use your skill and knowledge to defeat those
bosses and ultimately have a fantastic

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.920
high score

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.750
multiplayer party game with your friends. You know, everyone crowded round swapping that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.860
controller around, trying to beat those high
scores. It is a great fun time and this

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.520
is what gaming is meant to be all about.
Simple concept

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.540
beautifully executed with some of the
best graphics you

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.710
will ever see on any dual stick shooter in my
opinion.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.880
And it's just so well executed with Resogun.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.350
If you're a PlayStation Plus member you're getting this game for free if you've downloaded this month

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.799
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.869
so it's well worth a download to play. If not it's still a game that is worth

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.270
putting your hand in your pocket.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.880
