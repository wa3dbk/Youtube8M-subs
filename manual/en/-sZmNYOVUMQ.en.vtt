00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:16.689
Minigifures.

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:17.820
Set number 71000,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.680
Set number 71000,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.550
Set number 71000,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.240
and is recommended for ages five and up.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.640
and is recommended for ages five and up.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.349
So I guess we can make one of sixteen of the mini-figs but we don't know which one it is.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:28.400
So I guess we can make one of sixteen of the mini-figs but we don't know which one it is.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.400
So we're going to simply to open it up, and let's take a quick peak in here.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.140
Okay. So let's take a look at the guy here. Let's see what we got here.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.960
We got some ... some kind of a shirt,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.930
pants,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.440
smooth tile,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.440
looks like it has some writing on it,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.680
plate.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.430
Well, let's get ready to put her together here.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.400
See which one we probably get. We'll see if we can guess it.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.400
I'm guessing we are looking at

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.080
number five.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.080
Put it together here.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.460
That's a nice hair piece.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.470
That's a nice hair piece.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.470
So it looks like we get

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.930
the Roman Emperor.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.670
We get the scroll here.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.940
This is printed on.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.119
Put that in his hand here.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.919
So that is the Roman Emperor

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.579
for the Series 9 Minifigure series.

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.529
