00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.540
Kathryn Deschenes&gt;&gt; Ten years ago the products
were awful. My mom also has Celiac Disease

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.660
and she always made her own bread and our
local grocery store didn?t carry anything,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.800
so now she can get flours at her local grocery
store and crackers and all those things.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.449
Fadi Aramouni&gt;&gt; The research I?ve been doing
the past few years has been related to using

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:34.981
sorghum grain, food sorghum, as a substitute
for wheat for gluten-free products. Sorghum

00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:41.670
is a grain produced all over the world. In
the United States, Kansas is usually the number

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.879
one producer of sorghum. Now in the U.S.,
it was used mostly as a feed, but with the

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.679
growth in the gluten-free market and the availability
of food sorghum, we have now started seeing

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.940
a lot more sorghum is being used in these
types of formulations.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.210
We started from the bottom up. Basically,
looking at the best variety among six varieties

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.799
that we have growing in Kansas, to look at
what would be the best variety to work in

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:23.280
a simple system like tortilla and we looked
at a variety of physical and sensory properties,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.119
things like how much does it stretch, what
is the rollability of it? How does the public

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.549
and consumers perceive it in terms of taste
and color?

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:41.560
Kathryn Deschenes&gt;&gt; Being the resident Celiac
in the office, sometimes I have a little more

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.110
experience in tasting what gluten-free, people
who eat gluten-free all the time are expecting

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.110
from their food.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.710
Fadi Aramouni&gt;&gt; From that first piece of research,
we realized that there?s a lot more to be

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:01.390
done at the milling stage of this because
it turns out that the particle size during

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.869
milling will affect the properties of the
sorghum flour. Then in terms of nutrition

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:08.869
effect?

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.100
Ashley Pruett&gt;&gt; We discovered that possibly
there could be a specific particle size of

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.460
sorghum flour that will have the best effect
on glycemic index, will have a lower glycemic

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.720
index compared to other grains. Gluten-free
diet is really booming right now so it?s neat

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.980
to kind of be a part of developing the new
products.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.410
Fadi Aramouni&gt;&gt; We always like to take this
knowledge that we create and take it back

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.180
to the farmers so the farmers can benefit
from better use and expanded use of sorghum

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.870
and also all the way to the consumer because
if we?re providing consumers who are Celiac

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.470
patients or who do not consume gluten for
any reason with a good product so they can

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.150
have better eating choices, that would be
really good.
