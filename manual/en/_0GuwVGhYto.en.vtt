00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:26.460
It’s been a helluva ride for the Wii, so
it’s only fitting to kick off the top five...with

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.730
the game that was there from the beginning.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:40.809
After a 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:47.049
development cycle spanning multiple years
and even multiple consoles, Twilight Princess

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:53.749
was finally released in 2006...the first time
ever that a Nintendo console launched with

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:54.869
a Zelda game.

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:56.760
And it wasn’t just any Zelda game.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.000
With the sword mechanics of Wind Waker, the
darkness of Majora’s Mask and the tradition

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.420
of Ocarina, Twilight Princess was like a Hyrule
encyclopedia...a collection of all the things

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.549
that make Zelda so legendary.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:32.509
It had been more than decade since Donkey
Kong had a proper platformer...or was even

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.509
relevant, really.

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.909
But with Donkey Kong Country Returns, the
ape launched back into prominence like he

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.840
was shot out of a barrel.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.010
The culmination of the modern retro movement,
Donkey Kong Country Returns is a platforming

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.219
masterpiece.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:54.619
Even after a long layoff, Kong was still King.

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:04.549
It’s not as isolated as Prime, it’s not
as dark as Echoes...but it plays better than

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:05.549
both.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.810
In fact, few Wii games in general play as
well as Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.560
This game is special for a lot of reasons,
but most importantly, it proved the Wii Remote

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.970
was far more than just a gimmick.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.930
Casting the grapple beam with the nunchuck,
turning handles with a twist and most of all,

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.780
aiming with the pointer...it’s a seamless
control experience.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:42.760
And it makes you think...maybe Nintendo was
right.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.150
It will forever be the grand irony of the
Wii that a system so maligned for being weak

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.650
would eventually host the most gorgeous video
game Nintendo had ever made.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.760
It took Nintendo five years to have a Zelda
built from the ground up for their ground-breaking

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.030
new platform, but when they finally did...it
was unlike anything Wii owners had ever seen.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.480
Skyward Sword’s Monet-inspired graphics
are absolutely stunning, but more importantly,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.459
its use of MotionPlus finally delivered on
the system’s promise.

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:36.379
Skyward Sword is what Nintendo always wanted
Wii to be.

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:42.310
Nearly a quarter century after stomping his
first Koopa, Nintendo’s plumber still had

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.150
the creativity, the relevance and the sheer
magic to change video games.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.099
The Super Mario Galaxies did for the 3D platformer
what Super Mario World did to 2D platformers.

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.010
They not only refined the established gameplay
to perfection, but they also added creative

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.130
new ideas that would turn the genre upside
down and define their console.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.569
There have been some truly exceptional Wii
games, but none are as exceptional in nearly

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.840
every facet of their design as these two.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.410
So for us, if the question is what’s the
best Wii game of all-time, the answer is simple...it’s
