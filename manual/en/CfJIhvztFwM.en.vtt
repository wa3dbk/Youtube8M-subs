Hi I'm Doug McKinlay and you're watching

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.150
Adorama TV.  For this segment we're going to look
at three of my previously published

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.780
pictures.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.379
What I want to do is point out the
technical aspects of each image,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.949
the problems I encountered getting those
images and how I overcame them.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.080
Adorama TV presents stay focused with
Doug McKinlay.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.099
So just before we get started I just
want to point out

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.110
that I am a professional reportage, 
documentary and travel photographer

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.690
and I work alone. No assistants. In that
regard, I hope the following images

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.949
will highlight some of the problems and pitfalls that you
run into,

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.949
as a working Pro.  Recently I was
commissioned by the Sunday Times Travel

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:45.730
Magazine

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.839
to write and shoot a story about the coastal
grizzly bears in the Knight Inlet in

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.110
British Columbia in Canada.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.850
So the first thing I'm thinking about, is
weather

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.110
and lens choice: now this is the largest
trof costal

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.369
temperate rain forest in the world, and as such
it rains a lot. So I've got to keep that in mind when I'm

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.729
looking to keep my camera safe and dry.
It's also very very remote

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.450
so the only way in is by plane or boat.
My personal transportation while out

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.330
there on-the-job

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.369
was a one man river kayak,  so you can already imagine the problems.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.170
A bombing kayak, choppy seas, pouring rain,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.520
leaden skies, and of course grizzly bears.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.030
I'm going to need a pretty high ISO in order to try and get the right shutter speed

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.280
to mitigate the problem of the animals
moving and also on the problem of camera

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.840
shake last time in the kayak.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.540
But I can't determine this until I get into
position so it's anywhere between 1000

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.460
and 1600 depending how the cloud patterns happening.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.659
Am in this case it's giving me around 1/500 second
which is just enough to stop the action

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.670
of the bears on this shoreline and to
stop the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.259
the problem of camera shake in the kayak.

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.259
Now keeping the cameras dry was another
problem. Nor dry bags are a really great

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.729
solution for this, they are nice and deep

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.740
and they are light and easy to carry and there deep enough to
carry

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.880
300mm f2.8 with a 1.4 converter
attached and the camera body.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.310
So even with all these environmental
factors, they can cause you no end of

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.580
grief if you're not careful.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.950
I still managed enough images to produce an
eight-page spread in the magazine.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.250
So this next picture little old now,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.430
It was shot in a refugee camp on the
outskirts of

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.440
Herat city in Western Afghanistan. It was a
tense time and people were starving.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.720
But unlike a magazine where you have a
number of pages to tell a story, for

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.530
newspapers

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.250
you have to get in one maybe two shots.
So doing this can work means traveling

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.610
light. You don't want a big rucksack on your
back, bogging you down when you really

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.330
need to run!

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.160
So my kit here was, two
bodies

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.769
1D's at time...Canon 1D's

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.640
35mm 1.4, a 50mm 1.4

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.760
a 70-200 2.8 and a speedlite. Now I spent
a few days

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.180
touring the camp with an interpreter. It was a
big camp

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.630
A hundred thousand people.  It was very
cold because it was December.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.209
And this horrible wind kept blowing off this
flat plain for miles around.

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.280
But it wasn't until the last day that I was
there that I managed to get his picture.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.680
On the outskirts of the camp there is this
graveyard,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.750
I came across this man who was burying
his three-year-old daughter who had died the day

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.340
before

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.340
due to exposure. Now these are difficult
pictures to take.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.519
No matter how seasoned or harden you are it's
always

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.269
troubling to take these kinds of pictures. But as
a working professional,

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.079
you have to have an unflinching eye and tell the
story anyway.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.389
Now with this man, I talked with him
through my interpreter to make sure it was

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:39.750
okay for me to take this picture.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.760
A very intimate moment of him burying his child.
But what I chose to do here,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.130
was I chose to step back a little bit
with the 70-200 mm

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.620
zoom lens, because I wanted to suck the
background in a little bit as you can see.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.209
The big lenses tend to diminish the dept of field 
a little bit,

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.730
making things look a little closer, what
I wanted to convey with his picture

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.180
was that a it wasn't a one-off, it wasn't one guy
burying his daughter, it was a common thing

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.420
in

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.290
that camp at that time. The people were starving
and dying of exposure.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.560
So the image tells that story, the hard
shadows to me showed

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.630
that was a hard situation that these people
were living in.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.110
I've got to try out a lot of places in
the world and one of the most

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.450
memorable trips I've done in recent
years was to

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.390
Utah in America. Now Utah is a fantastic
place, it's a

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.930
landscape photographer's dream. But my job was to

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.980
focus on on the old movie sets and
movie locations

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.270
of the old western's starring John Wayne and
directed by John Ford.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.570
John Ford was phenomenal at picking the right
locations, so

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.700
I was trying to tell the old-west in
modern terms

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.210
That only meant hanging out with some
cowboys.. yes they still do exist

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.680
I'm no horseman, in fact they scare the life out of me,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.740
but I like to think after a few days
in the saddle

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.030
aching backdside and all, that I at least gained
a city slickers level of competence.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.220
But for this image here I was on foot,

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.930
and now I had to forward this River camera bag held
high

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.390
to try and get these guys coming across, to
get the picture.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.940
Now the problem I had here, was the
lead cowboy

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.130
and his hat. Now again it was that time
of day thing, the Sun was fairly high in

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.780
the sky,

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.580
It was August, we're looking hard, hard light here.
Now I didn't want this guy to be lost in

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.080
shadow

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.120
his face to be gone in some big black
hole so

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.940
I needed to use a flash, a little fill-in
flash in order to get the shot

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.390
and I was using a 24mm lens which
presents it's own problems.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.010
It's a great lens to get all that
background in but if you're not careful

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.760
with it you start to elongate your

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.270
subject's, so it's a little bit of a

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.590
trying to get it right.. pick in a sweet
spot. Now if I had waited

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.080
another couple feet the horse's neck
with a look a lot longer than it is.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.600
If you look closely looks a bit stretched
as it is,  so the 24 mm lens gets me that

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.470
great background, but you've got to be
careful about stretching out your

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.190
subjects.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.260
A little bit a fill flash, the flash
powered down to about

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.920
1/8th of output. It's enough to get my light

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.480
under his hat, light his face up without
making him look like he's got

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.799
too much light on him.

00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:17.379
So by the end of the job I managed to get enough pictures,

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:21.249
to visually tell the story, which the
picture editor and the editor of the

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:22.099
magazine liked!

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:27.319
Managed to get me an eight-page spread.
