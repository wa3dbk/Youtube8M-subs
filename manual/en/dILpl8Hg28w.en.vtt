00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:09.509
Bob: I think that's it Malou. I think we've shown them everything we need to turn it on.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:10.777
Malou: Time for some power. Okay.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:13.189
Bob: It's time for the lights, camera, action.

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:14.244
Malou: Here you go. Bob: All right.

00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:16.449
Malou: Let me help here. Oh, I'm sorry. You don't have to work.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.021
Bob: That's okay. I can help. Taking the power cord. Unwrapping it.

00:00:22.693 --> 00:00:24.069
Malou: All right. Bob: You've got the power brick.

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:25.592
Malou: I'm going to plug this in, okay? Bob: Please do.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.761
Malou: Do I have your permission? Bob: Permission granted. 

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:28.728
Malou: Okay. Here we go.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:33.933
Bob: This is the business end of course. You plug this into a surge protector. Okay?

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:39.447
Here we go. Right into the power brick. Malou: All right.

00:00:39.447 --> 00:00:41.608
Bob: All right. I will turn it around.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.783
Malou: Okay. Bob: Okay.

00:00:43.783 --> 00:00:45.829
Malou: Plugging it in. Bob: Go ahead and plug this in.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.508
Bob: All right. And, she will be pushing the power button. Malou: Let's turn it on.

00:00:52.508 --> 00:00:57.153
Bob: Right here. So now, this is the first time you powered on your IQ800 series.

00:00:57.153 --> 00:01:00.460
We're going to go through the Wizard which is going to teach you guys

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.364
how to setup your computer for the first time.

00:01:02.364 --> 00:01:05.932
Malou: Be patient. It may take a few minutes to get you through the entire process. All right?

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:08.373
Bob: That's right. Malou: Now that we are on the desktop, the touchscreen.

00:01:08.373 --> 00:01:11.114
Malou: Before we do that, can you put the 800 right over here so I can show you something. Bob: Yes.

00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:13.186
Malou: A little comparison. Bob: Uh-oh.

00:01:13.186 --> 00:01:19.479
Malou: All right. So, this one right here is the IQ500. Nice size, even for me right here.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.482
You see I can lift it myself. You with the 800. Look how big that is.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:26.453
Bob: It's nice that we can see the difference right next to each other

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:28.506
because [inaudible] to have that at home or anything like that.

00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:30.732
Malou: See, they're family. Okay? Bob: Yey!

00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:32.192
Malou: All right. Let me put this back down here.

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:36.429
Bob: All right. I've got big brother or big sister, whatever you want to gender your ...

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.497
Malou: Bad mama jama.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.665
Bob: Yeah. Oh, that's right. That's [inaudible] calling it.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:41.862
Malou: Okay, so, Bob, you showed us the little slot up here.

00:01:41.862 --> 00:01:44.603
It's called the HP Pocket Media Drive Bay. Bob: Right.

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:47.106
Malou: All right. So this is the HP Pocket Media Drive. Bob: Okay.

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.750
Malou: It's not included but here's what's cool about this.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.656
Just like any other external hard drive, you would actually connect it through the USB port.

00:01:55.656 --> 00:01:57.213
That's one way that you can actually connect it.

00:01:57.213 --> 00:02:04.213
Or on the IQ800, what's even nicer is that there's a slot back here and you just pop it back in there.

00:02:04.213 --> 00:02:06.619
Fits right on in. And then you're ready to go.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.498
Bob: Oh, there's a light going.

00:02:08.498 --> 00:02:11.197
Malou: Yeah. The nice thing about this though it's an external hard drive

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:14.467
but you can take it out, take it with you maybe if you want.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:19.939
Store media files, videos, pictures. It's nice little extra feature. Okay?

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.642
Bob: All right. So now it's saying it's installing the driver device which is great.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.043
Here it is.

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:25.800
Malou: All right. And so I'm going to show you where you can find that.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.213
You're going to go to ...

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.114
Bob: Start button, right?

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:29.782
Malou: Then we're going to go to My Computer.

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.303
Bob: Okay.

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:32.705
Malou: Right here. Bob: It's says computer, right?

00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:33.086
Malou: Click on that.

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:37.290
There you will see the HP Pocket Media Drive that says G right there.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.224
Bob: Oh.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.927
Malou: So you could store other files like I said on here if you'd like to

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.762
and pop that out any time you want.

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:44.376
Bob: That's right. And also one of the other function is

00:02:44.376 --> 00:02:46.599
because you can record TV with the TV tuner,

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.135
you could put your shows on this Pocket Media Drive.

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:51.704
Malou: All right. So if you want to take that out right now. Bob: Okay.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:55.158
Malou: What you want to do is right click on HP Pocket Media Drive. Bob: All right.

00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:57.176
Malou: And right here it says Safely Remove.

00:02:57.176 --> 00:03:00.346
And you'll notice that it will slowly disappear from right there.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.857
When it does, you know what that means.

00:03:01.857 --> 00:03:02.849
Bob: Can I take it out?

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.185
Malou: Oh, go for it. And guess what you can do with that?

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.621
Bob: Put in my pocket.

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.028
Malou: Okay, just as a reminder,

00:03:10.028 --> 00:03:13.960
it is not included but you can pick one up at hp.com and buy it there online.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.931
Bob: Excellent. Malou: All right. Now, for the other feature that I like is the Ambient Light.

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:20.166
Bob: Okay. Malou: Okay. Let's click out of this right here.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:23.136
Bob: All right. Malou: Then I'm going to launch the HP TouchSmart.

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:25.038
Bob: Software. Malou: The software with the house right here.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:28.308
Malou: So I'm going to touch that right now. Blue ...

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:30.443
Bob: This is the first time we're launching on this computer so it's going to take a second.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:33.713
Malou: So the IQ500 also has an Ambient Light but it's white.

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:38.453
This one, wait till you see this. I'm going to touch Personalize right here.

00:03:38.453 --> 00:03:42.922
The lower right corner. That will take me to the TouchSmart tiles

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:48.261
and from here I'm going to add a tile. I'm looking to add the Ambient Light tile.

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:52.218
It is a program so from there I will touch next.

00:03:52.218 --> 00:03:55.468
Bob: Yes. Malou: I want to choose from a list.

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:59.872
And once you choose from a list you will see a list of all the programs

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:02.842
that are in the All Programs Windows folder from the desktop here.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:06.479
Okay? So we are looking for HP Ambient Light. Do you see it there?

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.547
Bob: I see it right here. HP ...

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:08.940
Malou: Can you touch that for me then? Bob: I'm going to touch it.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.419
Malou: All right. Now it is blue. Now I can touch Ok.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.590
It's a checkmark right there to use programs icon so I will touch Ok.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.527
From there it should show up right here on your TouchSmart tiles. You see it's right there.

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:24.459
Bob: I see it. Malou: So now we're ready to go. So I'm going to touch Ok.

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:25.465
Bob: All right.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:28.280
Malou: From there it launches its software here to lower tile section.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.981
I would like to drag it to the top. To do that, I'm going to touch HP Ambient Light.

00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:37.577
Drag my finger on there. Release.

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:41.681
From there I'd like to launch it so I'm going to touch HP Ambient Light.

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:44.584
Bob: Ooh. Malou: And there you have all the different colors from the Ambient Light.

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:47.320
As you could see right here we could start with pink.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.856
You see the light right here? Under here. Bob: Yes.

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:50.979
Malou: And look it changes colors.

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.804
I got blue, lighter blue, green, yellow, red. It's a nice feature.

00:04:55.804 --> 00:04:57.030
You could see your keyboard right here.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.398
Bob: I love that. So if you have the lights off

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:00.037
but you still see want to see the keyboard when you're typing.

00:05:00.037 --> 00:05:02.500
Malou: Exactly. There's a switch here on the side here and

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.874
that button right there controls the brightness. It also turns the light on and off.

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:11.734
Bob: All right. I love this because look at that. Ooh, my hand's all red.

00:05:11.734 --> 00:05:13.934
Malou: Okay. You want to keep it on red? Bob: Yes. I love red.

00:05:13.934 --> 00:05:16.675
Malou: We'll take us back to the HP TouchSmart application homepage.

00:05:16.675 --> 00:05:20.353
I'm going to touch the X. Or as always you could touch this little house here

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:21.400
in the bottom right-hand corner.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.276
Bob: Awesome. Thank you so much Malou.

00:05:23.276 --> 00:05:26.693
