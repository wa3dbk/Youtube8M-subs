00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.850
Should you get meniscus surgery,
or is there a better option?

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.110
Knee meniscus surgery,
or menisectomy,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.570
is the most common orthopedic
surgery in the United States.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.483
More than 700,000 surgeries
are performed each year

00:00:12.483 --> 00:00:15.010
at a cost of over $4 billion.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.756
These surgeries are
usually performed

00:00:16.756 --> 00:00:18.380
when a patient has
persistent knee pain

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.470
and there is evidence of a
meniscus tear on their MRI.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.500
Most meniscus patients initially
consider surgery expecting

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.200
to repair their torn meniscus.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.270
But a recent study showed that
only four in 100 knee surgeries

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.150
on the meniscus was a repair.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.160
That's because the
meniscus is very difficult

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.510
to repair by sewing pieces
of it back together,

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.905
and much of the meniscus lacks
a sufficient blood supply

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:39.760
to help the repair heal.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.361
So what are the
other 96% getting?

00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:44.860
In this large group of patients,
some or all of the meniscus

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.640
is being surgically
removed, and some patients

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.476
may wake up from their
surgery to the news

00:00:49.476 --> 00:00:51.010
that even more of
their meniscus was

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.660
removed than they had expected.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.130
So what happens when you remove
all or parts of the meniscus?

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.185
Since the meniscus is an
important shock absorber

00:00:58.185 --> 00:01:00.040
for the knee, this
leaves the patient

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.580
with less protection for
the cartilage and bone.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.724
In fact, studies
show that removing up

00:01:04.724 --> 00:01:07.500
to 10% of the meniscus
can increase joint stress

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.270
by about 70%.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.230
And for those with
larger tears requiring

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.719
the removal of 50% of
the meniscus or more,

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.510
these forces within
the knee joint increase

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.760
at a staggering rate.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.360
For this reason,
meniscus surgeries

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.650
may begin a
degenerative cascade,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.110
leading to earlier onset
of knee osteoarthritis

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.140
and an increased likelihood
of knee replacement surgeries.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.090
Right now, you may be
thinking to yourself,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.130
but if it's the most
common orthopedic surgery,

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.920
it must be effective at
solving knee pain, right?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.120
Well, a series of very
high-quality studies

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.090
has questioned how
effective knee meniscus

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.770
surgery is at relieving
long-term knee pain.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.280
Two studies published in the
New England Journal of Medicine

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.330
showed that outcomes from
smaller menisectomies, the most

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.360
common type of cleanup knee
surgeries for meniscus tears,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.919
were no better
than fake surgery.

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:54.210
Another recent large study
published in the New England

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.084
Journal of Medicine
showed that knee meniscus

00:01:56.084 --> 00:01:59.630
tears in middle-aged and older
adults were extremely common

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.110
and are found in both patients
with and without knee pain.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.025
In 2013, another study compared
physical therapy alone to knee

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:08.910
meniscus surgery and
found that surgery

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.160
was no better than physical
therapy at reducing knee pain.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.690
So if you have a torn
meniscus that's causing pain,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.000
what else can you do?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.900
Since there is no
scientific evidence

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.970
that knee meniscus
surgery helps patients,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.570
it seems like
common sense to try

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.380
to avoid this invasive
surgery whenever possible.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.170
Regenexx procedures
have helped people

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.360
like you avoid invasive surgery,
using a precise injection

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.260
of their own stem cells
or blood platelets

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.110
directly into the meniscus
tear to promote healing.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.630
So if you have a meniscus
tear that's slowing you down,

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.050
consider the nation's most
advanced stem cell and blood

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.355
platelet procedures to
help you avoid surgery

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:44.940
and get back to doing
the things you love.
