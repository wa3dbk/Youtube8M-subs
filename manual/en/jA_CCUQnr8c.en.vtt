O.k. on page 45 if you'll open up what do
you see there? You see a picture of... A middle

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.660
school teacher differs a little bit from an
Elementary school teacher; in Elementary the

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.249
kids stay in one particular class room for
most of the day and in middle school the kids

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:22.789
move from class to class somewhat like high
school. As a middle school teacher my job

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.849
is to help these kids show self confidence
and more responsibility in being able to get

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.090
the job accomplished to prepare them for high
school. In our particular school we have a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.050
group of students that start with us in the
7th grade and we call it an advisory class;

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.600
my job is to get to know these students daily
and how I can help them adjust to middle school

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.420
life, and then make the transition to high
school. I meet with them daily; we also do

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.200
fun things like our assemblies with them and
then they go from their day to day schedules

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.880
from different periods where they, they change
classes. A middle school teacher usually shows

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.060
up fairly early; they usually start earlier
than the Elementary schools and maybe a little

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.490
bit later than the high schools, during that
time we teach our academic subjects and then

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.960
during our conference period we have time
to meet and obviously sit down and collaborate

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.900
with the other teachers. And how the students
are doing in their classroom and especially

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.490
in the special education field, this is really
important to see how are students are; are

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.030
functioning in the other classrooms and to
collaborate with these teachers. As a middle

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.360
school special Ed teacher my job is probably
different than a regular middle school teacher

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.490
because my responsibilities include tracking
the special Ed student and making sure they're

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.990
successful in all their outside classes. I
also try to monitor and make sure that their

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.549
IEP goals are focused on and that they are
making progress toward them.
