00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
(jaunty music)

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.980
And welcome everybody, to another edition
of The Crochet Crowd, as well as

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.219
RedHeart.com today. I'm just creating a
slipknot because I'm going to show you

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.470
how to do a Double Crochet Foundation
Chain, or Foundation Double Crochet Chain,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.580
So, what happens...the designers usually
ask you to do these fancy chains

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.279
because it makes a better look. It's
really a lot better, that's why they

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.820
ask for it, so it's not something that's
just a posh thing to do. It's because it's

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.840
the right thing to do.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.220
So, to begin to do this, what you have to
do is that you have to begin with

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.580
one slip knot on your hook so to do this
we're going to chain 3, so 1, 2, and 3.

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:44.019
So, we're going to come back to the very
starting chain, and we are just going to

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.970
make sure we wrap the hook first, before
going into the starting chain, and go in

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.540
and make sure that two strings are on
top of your hook,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.949
just like so. So then we're going to pull
through, and we're going to double

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.519
crochet like you normally would, so pull
through two, and two.

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.760
So here's the trick. You have to make
sure that you're paying attention to

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.140
what strings are which.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.100
So this top one right here is the top
of the stitch, the second piece in is the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.369
middle, and then this is the bottom. So
when we go to do the next one, so we're

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.210
going to wrap,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.820
we want to make sure that we go into the
top one that you had, pull through and

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.310
then pull through two, and two.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.119
Just like so. So, see how it's
looking kind of confusing? It's not

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:25.840
confusing.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.840
It's just your eyes. You just have to
train your eyes not to go for this one

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.280
that looks right beside it,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.399
it's the top one. Just wrap, and going into
the top, like so, and then pull through

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:37.810
two, and two.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.630
So, you see the whole point of this is
that you're ending up with the beautiful

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.130
stitch on the bottom as well as on the
top, so you can turn the stitch over at

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.060
any time or turn this project over
anytime, create the most beautiful

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.719
borders on your projects, and I have to
be honest with you. I think that most

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.109
projects should start off with the
foundation chain after being in crochet

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:00.729
for so many years, that it really does
have a better look and appearance and it

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.130
makes that actually for better starting
chains, as well. So you can see here I'm

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.330
just double crocheting myself instead of
having the chain and coming back and

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.740
creating the same look.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.660
This will also help you for...I'm keeping
stuff and balance, so sometimes

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.200
the starting chain is very obvious and
throws your project out of balance as

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.170
far as the look is concerned,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.450
so it's a great way to determine how to...
to do this very easily. So this is a

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.770
great way...a great idea and something
that you should know. It's great for your

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.070
crochet treasure chest, I
guess you could say.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.370
And here you go so this is the
foundation chain

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.600
all done in double crochet. Until next
time I'm Mikey, behalf of RedHeart.com , as well

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.800
as The Crochet Crowd.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.300
We'll see ya.
