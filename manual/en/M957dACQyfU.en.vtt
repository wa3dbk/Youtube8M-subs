00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.270
we've all seen these pictures in
magazines, on the internet, everywhere

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.809
of people going from a certain physique
either fat or really skinny to a very

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:10.060
muscular physique. Most of the time it’s very
hard to believe that a certain

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.330
supplement or maybe training program can
really make you do the exact same thing

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.380
if you follow the exact program. Now
before I get started, I just want to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.030
make it clear that the pictures that I
showed had nothing to do with his video. 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.310
I want to make it perfectly clear that the
physiques that were altered or were

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.420
transformed

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.490
in those pictures

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.360
may have actually been the result of the
programs advertised. The reason I'm saying

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.510
this is because I simply don't want to
get sued by those people.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.960
Now without further ado, I’m going to show 
You how I went from this physique

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.550
To this physique

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.050
in less than five hours. Now the first
step in this video is to reverse the

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.080
process. That's right we're going to do
the after picture first and the before

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.290
picture after.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.030
So here we go! First thing that we have
to do is go to the gym. Make sure you do

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.860
as many bicep curls, triceps push downs,
and chest presses. Make sure you are

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.320
as vascular humanely possible. Next,
jump into a tanning bed and get as 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.330
tanned up as possible.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.310
you want that vascularity to show
as much as possible. When you’re all done

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.220
with that tanning bed, go straight home and set
up some really good lighting in your

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.120
basement. Now to prove that this video
really is legitimate I'm showing you the

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.700
date on a CNN website when I take the
after picture.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.360
here it is

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.130
Now grab a dumbbell one more time and really
pump it up just so you have that extra

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.540
vascularity before you take your after
picture. Next grab a bottle of PAM.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.750
that's right, that good old cooking
spray and spray the hell out of yourself

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.720
now you’re all shinny. 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.900
Beautiful. Get ready for a your after picture.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.490
there's the after pictures, not so
horrible but we can make that better

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.490
with a little bit of photoshop

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.290
Not a huge difference but still a very
noticeable difference. Now that the after

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.330
picture is done

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.650
we're ready to do the before picture, the
fun part. For the before picture we want

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.920
to put ourselves into a fat blob
mindset. Take two hours off you worked

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.320
hard to do those after pictures just
rest up and then make sure that vascularity 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.980
is disappearing.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.340
Grab some canned Beefaroni. Make sure it's
really high in sodium, we're really trying to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.339
retain that water. Grab a bag of chips and 
down all of them.

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:21.730
get kettle cooked, they got extra oil and salt
on them. Next step, grab yourself a bottle of pop

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.579
A two liter bottle or even more is preferable. 
A diet pop actually works better because

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.130
it has more carbonation, 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.739
therefore making your stomach even
bigger. When you're done with your pop

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.260
grab some chocolate milk

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.060
this shit will bloat the hell out of you after
that diet pop. Believe it or not

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.440
you're ready to go.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.670
once again I’m showing you guys the date

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.459
on the CNN website which actually
shows less than a five hour difference

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.939
between the two shots. You can see I look
fat as hell compared with the other picture 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.769
so without further ado let's take a couple
snapshots

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:56.799
there you have it guys

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.939
check out my before and after picture
now five hours apart

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.069
that's pretty crazy what you can do

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.429
with your body and with a little bit of
photoshop. I just wanted to show you guys

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:10.889
that anything is really possible in this
world nowadays and don't believe everything

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.719
that you see with your eyes. Once again
the transformation pictures that I

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.249
showed you guys earlier have no
reflection really on this video just

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:22.149
showing you guys examples of really
crazy transformations and ya I don’t want 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:26.109
to get sued. Let me know if you liked
the video and don't forget to subscribe

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.869

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:29.859
