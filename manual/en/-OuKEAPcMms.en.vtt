00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.576
Well. this is the channel NLvissers. So this is our first video.

00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:19.378
And today we're going fishing with the fixed pole. Are we just explain the method

00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:28.730
Here we move on a tube on top of this rod tip.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.873
Here's how it's done.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.276
You need the fishing line tight. And then you roll it out.

00:01:04.716 --> 00:01:06.716
Then you get this.

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.821
I put it on the stand.

00:01:44.434 --> 00:01:51.430
Now we go gauge with a bob.

00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:07.270
And then we throw him in the water.

00:02:13.536 --> 00:02:21.880
Well you see that he is on the water, so that's not good. It needs to go a little down.

00:02:39.494 --> 00:02:44.320
Just a little bit more down, there is much junk in the water!

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:58.920
So that the tip is just above the water surface.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.570
It's good now

00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:14.920
Now we are going to put the maggots on the hook. Approximately two maggots, which works very good.

00:03:22.611 --> 00:03:31.730
You get your hook, and you poke the maggot trough it's thick skin.

00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:40.000
Another one.

00:03:41.313 --> 00:03:44.440
So beautiful trough the skin, and nou you can go catch some fish.

00:03:44.437 --> 00:03:53.580
Ok, now we go fishing. I throw him in the water and put it down here.

00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:55.790
And now just wait.

00:03:56.565 --> 00:04:03.400
This is our (fish)food, it's a bit lumpy. But if you have a strainer you should use it.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.740
We've added corn .

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:13.330
And also maggots.

00:04:14.152 --> 00:04:24.480
Mix the (fish)food well, mix it with water. Not too wet nor too dry. If you can squeeze it and it stays in that form it's good to use.

00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:32.360
And than it's alright. With this method you need to throw 2-3 balls every hour.

00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:40.920
Now we're going to throw a ball. Like this . And now wait!

00:04:47.582 --> 00:04:58.390
Well we are now just gone to another place, the other place was not a good place. So now we went somewhere else, and we hope that we can catch some fish!

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:09.620
Here we are now, it's a nice place. (You could show).

00:05:11.418 --> 00:05:12.770
Well that is the place!

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:17.560
We have changed our bait, first we used maggots and now we use bread.

00:05:18.788 --> 00:05:27.030
You pick up the hook like this. Than you make a little ball of your bread, not too big. Then you put it on the hook like this.

00:05:32.995 --> 00:05:37.620
So that the tip is visible. And now you can catch some fish.

00:05:53.704 --> 00:05:57.920
Not a big fish.
-We got one!

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.130
I think it's a European bitterling. Now we just let him swim.

00:06:18.882 --> 00:06:23.060
-Show it!
Well this is the fish.

00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:28.420
Now we free him.

00:06:33.744 --> 00:06:38.340
And there he goes! On to the next fish!

00:06:45.424 --> 00:06:49.650
Not big, but they are always fun to catch!

00:06:49.653 --> 00:06:53.760
We will free him again.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:17.350
-Show it!

00:07:28.797 --> 00:07:31.240
The fourth one.

00:07:45.983 --> 00:07:49.860
We let him free again.
-Good idea!

00:07:55.214 --> 00:07:58.880
And there he goes!

00:08:00.417 --> 00:16:06.700
-And the catch is good today?
Yes we've already caught 5 European Bitterling so it goes well.
