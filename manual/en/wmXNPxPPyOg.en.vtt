Hi, this is Rich Buccola of New York City
and today, on behalf of Expert Village, I'm

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.000
going to show you how to make stuffed jalapeños.
You might want to use a fork with this. What

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.610
we like to do is double dip them. So, we're
going to just dip it in our egg batter. This

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.680
could get a little messy but you know why
I keep a paper towel. Give it a good dipping

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.000
and go right into your bread crumbs. Handle
of the pepper, I leave them on because they

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.850
are fun to, to just get everyone to be able
to pick them up. Get a lot of bread crumbs

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.890
around these guys and as soon as you think
they're good, put them right back in our egg

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.510
batter and double dip them. Just turn them
around and I'll tell you, that handle of the

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.989
pepper does help you out. We're going to give
them a good second coating and we're going

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.199
to just put them right back in. We're just
going to take maybe, out fork, and just go

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:52.140
over them like so, like this. Look at how
nice these are. Just add them right to your

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.945
pan that has the tin foil on it and you're
going to do all of them. Just take it out

00:00:55.945 --> 00:01:01.820
like that. Look, and just put it right down.
Simple as that. I want you to do all of your

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.421
pepper, get them on your pan, we're going
to get ready to bread these up and get them

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:09.500
in out oven. You're going to leave them in
there for about eight to ten minutes until

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.770
they are thoroughly heated and they are ready
to eat. Come on back. We’re making jalapeño

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.160
peppers. Stuffed jalapeño pepper poppers.
Say that ten times fast. Peter Piper couldn't.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.010
I hope you can. Look, you see we have them
nice and breaded. I double dipped them. I

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.670
did have to use one more egg folks and you
might have to do that too. I like them double

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.640
dipped because they are nice and brown that
way. They have a nice bread crumb to them.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.960
We're just going to add them to our oven of
375 and we're going to put them in there and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.490
we're going to leave them there for about
eight to ten minutes. Come back. When we come

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.440
back we're going to have them, going to eat
them up. Nice, nice party stuffer, nice party

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.100
starter, appetizer, great for the Super Bowl.
Jalapeño poppers, stuffed jalapeño poppers,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.130
here on Expert Village. Favorite time, always
on Expert Village, Gracie is down, we're all

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.100
waiting, she knows, I know, you're going to
find out yourselves. They're jalapeño stuffed

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.100
jalapeño poppers, I call them. Look at how
nice. We cooked them for about twelve to fifteen.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.810
Depending on your oven, that's how you are
going to have to know. Let's bring them over

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.920
to our table, going to let them cool a bit
and I'll show you how I serve them. You are

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.670
going to want to serve these while they are
still warm. What I do is, I let them cool

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.231
just for a minute and I take a little fork
and I loosen them up from the pan. What I

00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:32.952
then do is I make a nice bed of cilantro,
and I just take the full pieces of cilantro

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:37.450
and just lay them with the stems in, with
the flowering coming out. What I'll do is

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.760
I'll just get my jalapeños and just put them
on. Look at how beautiful they are like that.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.820
If some of the stems broke off on you, no
worries just pick it up and put them in like

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:52.570
you have them. Just lay them across your bed
of cilantro. That's how I basically put a

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.060
plate, a platter of these out. You may go
out with them; you could definitely layer

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.630
them on top. What you also might want to do
is just take a few pieces of cilantro leaf,

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.180
like so, get your little leaf, and just rip
off little pieces and just go on the top of

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.320
them with the cilantro, like that. My name
is Richard Buccola and on behalf of Expert

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.700
Village, thank you for watching.
