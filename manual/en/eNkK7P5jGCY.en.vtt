00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.500
Hello I’m Dr. David Reath and I’m an ASPS
Member Surgeon.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.129
I’m here with one of my nurses Mandi to
talk to you about drains.

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:15.309
If you’re having breast reconstruction,
you’re going to have at least one drain.

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.500
They’re not the most fun things in the world,
but knowing a little bit more about how they

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.509
work, and how to care for them, is going to
make your recovery easier.

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:30.900
Now the drain comes in three different parts:
this part is actually underneath the skin

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.540
and so you won’t ever see it.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.230
There’s then a tube which connects that
to the bulb.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.850
This bulb collects the fluid that comes out.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.770
The reason we put the drain in is that fluid,
or sometimes small amounts of blood, may develop

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.000
in the areas where you’ve had your surgery,
and removing them is important to make the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.960
healing go smoothly.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.219
So there’s several things you need to know
about the drains.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.230
First is something called stripping the drains.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:06.420
I’m going to have Mandi hold this right
like it’s going into the body.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.010
Sometimes this tube will get a little clogged
up by a small amount of blood, some protein

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.330
and fluid or even a little bit of tissue.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.910
The way you get it unplugged is to squeeze
the drain close to where it goes into the

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.290
body and draw it away from it like this.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.470
It creates suction and then you let go of
this hand and it helps milk whatever is in

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.430
the tube into the drain.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.190
That’s known as stripping the drains.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.560
You’re probably going to want to do it every
time you empty the drains.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.470
It will just make them much more easy to deal
with.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.090
If for some reason the drain gets clogged,
sometimes fluid will come out on the skin

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.580
around the drain.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.271
It’s messy, but it’s not the end of the
world because the drain is there to get rid

00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:51.271
of the fluid.

00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:56.970
The next thing we’re going to show you is
how to empty what comes out of the drain.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.070
And I’m going to turn this over to Mandi.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.250
OK we have put some colored fluid just to
demonstrate exactly how to empty the bulb.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.440
When this is always working appropriately,
it will always have a suction to it when it’s

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.440
inside the body.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.890
What you’re going to want to do is you release
the top, and I always give patients these

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.579
little Dixie cups—it’s got the measurements
on there.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:34.489
Turn this upside down, empty the fluid, keep
track of how much is coming out of the drain,

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:44.329
and then you always want to compress and hold
as you are closing that back up.

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.379
Another thing about the drains is figuring
out how to secure them because you’re not

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.379
always going to walk around holding them.

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.530
And again, Mandi has some very helpful tips.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.999
What I recommend is to use a safety pin and
you can put the pin in this plastic area here

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:05.109
and you can pin the drain onto the bra to
help hold that up.

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:10.849
And then when showering I usually recommend
getting a shoestring and looping around and

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.599
making a little necklace, tying it around
your neck, to keep it elevated while showering.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.599
We hope that this information will make your
recovery easier.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.749
Just remember, the drains will not be in forever,
but knowing how to manage them can make it

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.049
a little easier for you.

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.029
Should you ever have a question though, never
hesitate to call your surgeon.

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:34.330
Their staff wants to hear from you and wants
to help you with your recovery.
