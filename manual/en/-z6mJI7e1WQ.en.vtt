00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.380
Alrighty, so let's go ahead and take a look at Escort's new Passport Max2.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.360
This is basically the, uh, previous Max except now it also has, uh, bluetooth built into the detector.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.400
So, uh, now you don't actually need the Live cable.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.420
You can just pair it directly an Android or an iPhone device

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.280
with the GPS unit itself, err with the detector itself so...

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.880
We've got the detector right up here.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.180
This is the new Passport Max.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.620
You'll see on the label here it now has the bluetooth icon.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.820
(Let's see if I can zoom in a little bit)

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.640
So...

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.380
You'll see it right there and then you can see the Smartcord for it too.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.980
It is not a Live cord.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.200
It's just a standard grade, uh, regular Smartcord.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.900
and uh, we'll go ahead and plug that in and see it in action.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.360
k

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.120
Let's watch it boot up now.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.520
Passport Max 2

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.380
There we go, and now you'll see the bluetooth icon on the left hand side

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.100
meaning that it is now connected to a device.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.220
I currently have it hooked up to my iPhone

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.900
so I'll go ahead and take a look at that.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.140
and I've got it paired here with, uh, Escort Live.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.700
So it's currently paired. You can see, uh, Passport Max 2.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.460
There it is right there.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.360
and it's paired via Escort Live on the iPhone

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.560
and with the new version of Live,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.700
you'll see autorotation works as well.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.200
So pretty handy there.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.720
We can go in and, you know, adjust the different radar settings

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.720
pretty simple

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.260
so we can configure everything now from the detector and get all of our alerts and everything now through Live.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.480
uh so this is an example of just running it here on, uh, the iPhone.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.200
We're gonna go ahead and do, uh, Android here next.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.200
and to do that I do have to unpair it from the iPhone

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.520
and then pair it with, uh, the Android itself so this...

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.440
I'm just gonna

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.940
actually let's turn this off...

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.320
There we go.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.840
mk

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.360
and uh, now we have it, uh, the Passport Max2 hooked up to Escort Live on Android

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.960
So if we take a look here, you'll see it now says Passport Max 2

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.000
and, uh, same detector. We haven't changed anything other than unpaired it from the, uh

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.720
the iPhone and paired it with, uh, the Android and now the Android works as well.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.880
So...

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.120
Pretty nice. You've got one detector for both systems which is, uh, really handy now.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.660
You don't have to buy a Live cord specifically for one or the other

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.260
Great if you're ever changing platforms or just to simplify it.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.980
There's fewer, you know, dongles and devices that you need so...

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.580
Pretty cool. That's the main difference now between the, uh, Passport Max and Passport Max2

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:47.180
It is specifically the, uh, bluetooth integration and cross-platform capabilities for both iOS and Android built in to the new Max

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.580
all on one device! So.. pretty handy!

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.980
Okay, so here's an example of a K band alert here on the, uh, the Max

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.300
You just saw it go away. It should come back here in a second. (K Band Alert) There it is.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.060
So this is just a speed sign up ahead.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.340
As you can see, there it is on, uh, both the Android and, uh, the Max

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.500
and here's an example of uh

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.220
the Max2 running with Escort Live paired to the iPhone

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.060
getting the same K band speed sign alert right here.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.000
So yeah, and then as you can see we can, uh, either report it to the cloud or lock it out manually.
