00:00:02.607 --> 00:00:05.201
Poor Badminton Player's Behaviour

00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:08.754
10. How am I Look?

00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:14.733
when I go to the club badminton

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:19.761
I often see 1 or 2 players

00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:22.830
normally the best one in their club

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.511
or second best in that club

00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:31.397
instead of play from their heart, play sincerely

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:35.847
these top players in that club 

00:00:35.847 --> 00:00:40.631
play to show how good he is

00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:43.292
how good he looks like

00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:44.728
for example

00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:45.819
he is playing

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:49.459
and some other club members are watching

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:54.678
he made good kill

00:00:54.678 --> 00:00:57.889
and then instead of just be ready

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:02.605
after he kills he will look opponent

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:07.488
and he looks the club players who are watching

00:01:07.488 --> 00:01:16.005
and then walk longer, wider slowly to show how beautiful that was

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:23.489
and when he lift instead of he lift like that

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:27.397
he lift, like this

00:01:27.397 --> 00:01:30.748
to make himself beautiful

00:01:30.748 --> 00:01:34.014
when he hits clear, backhand clear

00:01:34.014 --> 00:01:37.305
instead of hitting like that

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:43.062
he want to show how easily he hits, how beautifully he hits

00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:45.045
he hits

00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:46.991
like this

00:01:48.468 --> 00:01:54.931
and when he smashes instead of smash and ready

00:01:54.931 --> 00:02:00.640
he will show off smash and ready

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.276
when he lift forehand no like that

00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:07.678
he will lift like this

00:02:07.678 --> 00:02:08.866
ready

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.763
many times

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:24.112
the best player in the club behave that way

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.708
I have not seen many players in the club

00:02:35.708 --> 00:02:39.556
who is number 1 player in that club

00:02:39.556 --> 00:02:46.045
behave like a beginner and respect all other players

00:02:46.045 --> 00:02:52.609
I have not seen those players in my badminton career

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.945
very very seldom I see them

00:02:57.945 --> 00:03:03.582
90-95% of top best player 

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:08.128
in the club normally behaves like that

00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:15.419
and they disrespect the beginners, the weaker players

00:03:18.193 --> 00:03:22.529
if the club matches start at 10'O clock

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:26.706
the best ones normally comes later

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:33.263
because they are the best ones they should come first and prepare

00:03:33.263 --> 00:03:35.598
everything because they are best ones

00:03:35.598 --> 00:03:39.510
how beautiful that would be 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.585
but in my experience that is completely the other way round

00:03:45.585 --> 00:03:50.364
when a coach is taking the session in the club

00:03:53.588 --> 00:04:00.849
the best ones normally put their head down and looking some where else

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.840
they talk to friends while when the coach is explaining

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.828
because he is good

00:04:11.828 --> 00:04:16.669
because he thinks he is good nothing to learn more

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.924
and behave such way

00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:29.044
that's not the real best player

00:04:29.044 --> 00:04:33.460
real best player will behave like beginner

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.626
real best player will look after the beginners

00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:45.340
and he will set the case of being there early

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.932
of listening to coach more, what ever the order given

00:04:50.932 --> 00:04:53.531
he is the first one to act

00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:56.626
that is real top player

00:04:59.227 --> 00:05:01.415
which player do you have in your club?
