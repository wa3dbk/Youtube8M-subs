&gt;&gt; Shona: Hi, my name is Shona and I'm a
scientist at Procter &amp; Gamble. You may have

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.640
heard of Procter &amp; Gamble before, and if you
haven't you probably would have heard of

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.530
one of our products.
Procter &amp; Gamble make a wide range of household

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.719
goods such as laundry powder, toothpastes,
nappies and makeup.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.670
&gt;&gt; Sarah: Hi, I'm Sarah and I'm also a
scientist at Procter &amp; Gamble and I work in

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.989
the Research and Development area of the company.
Research and Development is understanding

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.800
what the consumer wants and needs and delivering
a product to meet these needs.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.760
Both Shona and I work in the hair colourant
category, working on brands such as nice 'n' easy 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.719
and Perfect 10 for Wella and Clairol.
So why do some people use hair colourant?

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:13.710
Well, some people like to use it for dramatic
effect while others, just like my mum, use

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.090
it to cover their greys.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.000
&gt;&gt; Shona: There are three components in a hair colourant:

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.720
the tint, the colour developer
and the conditioner. When the tint and developer

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.439
are mixed together this initiates the chemistry
reactions. The colour developer contains hydrogen

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.830
peroxide, which lightens the natural colour
of the hair, ready for the new colour to be

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.229
applied. When the hydrogen peroxide is mixed
with the tint the chemistry reactions begin.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.900
The tint contains dye molecules which will
enter the hair creating the final colour.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.170
The other important ingredient in the tint
is the ammonia.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.759
The ammonia will cause the pH of the hair,
which is usually acidic around pH 5, to rise

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.150
to an alkali pH around 10. This causes the
hair to swell, which allows the dye molecules

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.840
to enter and get trapped inside the hair,
giving the hair a bright and permanent colour.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.980
The conditioner contains caring actives, including
silicones, which surround the hair, giving

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.840
it a silky feeling. These silicones are polymers,
which are long-chain molecules.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.849
As you can see, when I first mix the tint
and the developer, the product is colourless.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.450
As the chemistry reactions have occurred the
colour has formed as it would do when the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.510
product was applied to your hair.
&gt;&gt; Sarah: When we have created our final colour,

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.370
to meet the consumer demand, we take this
and test it in our global salons on different

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.629
hair types using real people.
The exciting thing about our jobs is seeing

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.090
the science theory we have learned at school
and university coming to life in products

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.170
used in homes every day.
