00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.619
Now here’s a game with some pedigree.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.381
When I’m talking about NES launch titles,
most hail from the mid-eighties, but Wild

00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:27.730
Gunman goes back.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.540
So far back that it used film projection,
rather than a TV screen, to display the action

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.870
back when it debuted in 74.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.000
That’s serious business.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.230
That original Wild Gunman, later re-created
as a collapsible model that you may have seen

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.190
in the WarioWare series, was designed by none
other than the legendary Gunpei Yokoi, a longtime

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.879
Nintendo visionary and inventor of... well,
the freakin GAME BOY for one.

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.379
So, yeah.

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.379
Pedigree.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.530
Now DRAW.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.210
Wild Gunman’s all about reaction time.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.430
A smarmy wild-west type sidles up onto the
screen, sets down, and some music plays to

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.619
kill the time before the command to fire is
ordered, and then you shoot the joker before

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.799
he shoots you.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.270
Fortunately, through the miracle of User Interface,
you can tell exactly how long he’s going

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.840
to take to fire, as represented by that number
there.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.920
And a second might not seem like all that
long a space of time... but if you’re a

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.909
practiced gamer, that second might as well
be an eternity.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.969
Never having stepped to this challenge before,
I found my average reaction time to be well

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:43.899
under a third of a second, topping out at
a quarter of a second.

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.219
In a rare move for an NES launch title like
this, the command to fire is actually shouted

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.350
at you, using digitized voice.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.709
And digitized voice wasn’t all that great
on the NES, especially if you remember Bases

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:58.869
Loaded or... eeh...

00:01:58.869 --> 00:01:59.869
Ghostbusters.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.840
But if you’re dueling with some stereotypical
cowboy-type, you don’t want a buzzer, or

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.289
a beep, or a tone to tell you when to fire.

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.850
You want to see the glimmer of malice in the
other guy’s eyes, and you want a voice to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.530
say, “FIRE.”

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.230
And in that respect, Wild Gunman shines.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.380
It says FIRE.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.569
The second of the NES-standard three game
modes pits you against two opponents, each

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.050
with their own draw time.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.780
Usually, it’s just a matter of “Pop the
faster guy first” but don’t get too complacent;

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.450
one of those guys might not actually fire,
and it’s not sporting to shoot unprovoked,

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.450
now is it?

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.830
We’ve got LAWS in this state for a reason.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.760
Though it’s not like aiming is that difficult,
either; all you need is to hit the correct

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.420
side of the screen (or, in the case of the
single-shooter theory, anywhere on the screen

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.500
at all).

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.960
But aim comes back into play with the Gang
mode, which rounds out the options by giving

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.960
you a saloon full of hostiles, a set number
of bullets, and the imperative to stay alive.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.830
And even in this mode, a kind of prioritization
applies; the faster outlaws are worth more

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.830
points.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.310
But this mode is much more of a shooting gallery,
as there’s no indicated time to fire.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.440
You just stop foes before they get to fillin’
ya full of lead.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.500
If you do get winged, you have to start that
entire wave over again, too, so it behooves

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.940
you to be fast with your shots and careful
with your aim.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:33.160
And if anyone ever asks you where you learned
to shoot like that, you just tell ‘em: “7-11.”
