Sara Adams: "Hi there! Today I want to take the opportunity to ask you to contribute to my origami project.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:16.540
Now, I am- [sigh] I am very busy but I make time to produce the videos that I hope you all enjoy very much...

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.560
But, because time is so short, I very rarely add subtitles and closed-captions nowadays.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.800
But because YouTube has a new feature, you can help.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.320
Now before I show you how it actually works, I did want to say

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.160
Yes, there is something more in it for you other than just helping out.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.020
Because I, umm, intend to give away prizes, just like in the give-aways.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.140
Umm, books or vouchers or folded models... we'll see, um,

00:00:45.284 --> 00:00:48.444
Just so that you're, perhaps, a bit more motivated

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.440
But also simply because, if you do contribute,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.780
I want to show my thanks.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.860
And you know those prizes would only be open to those people that actually contribute

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.720
And it's really really easy

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.680
So here's how it works.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.060
Lets first start at looking at what it's like if there's no subtitles there at all.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.120
First go to the watch page of a video and then click on the settings icon in the lower right corner.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.980
Go to the subtitles and CC section of it and click "Add subtitles/CC"

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.200
Once the page is loaded, you can then [click] "Add [new] subtitles [or] CC"...

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.680
And start with English if there's nothing else there yet.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.280
Then you get this view where you can add subtitles in English.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.780
You'll play back a section and then type whatever you've heard."

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.740
[video shown on screen]: "In this video, I'm going to show you how to fold..."

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.480
Sara: "Once you start typing, the video is going to pause so that you don't have to take care of that.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.740
And once you have typed what you heard, simply press enter...

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.240
And then you can adjust where to show the subtitle.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.680
And then continue with the next section of the video."

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.400
[video shown on screen]: "... fold a modular origami kusudama called "Coral Star" designed..."

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.880
Sara: "Typing and once you've finished that text, simply pressing enter.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.520
Now sometimes, you'll want to adjust where the video shows those subtitles...

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.000
So perhaps play the video back a little..."

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.860
[video shown on screen]: "fold a modular..."

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.220
Sara: "... then move..."

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.260
[video shown on screen]: "origami kusudama called "Coral Star" de-..."

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.720
Sara: "and perhaps lengthen or shorten, and there you go.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.920
Once you're done with adding all of the subtitles you want for now,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.000
Either the whole video or perhaps just part of it,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.740
Simply click "Submit" and specify whether the whole video is subtitled yet or not.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.240
Click "Submit" one more time, let it load...

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.600
And then you can see, your subtitles were submitted and they're ready for me to review.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.940
Next, let's take a look at what it's like when the English subtitles are done already.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.860
Again click on the settings symbol, and [click] "Add subtitles/CC" as before...

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.160
But this time, it actually looks a little different...

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.000
Simply start typing the [name of the] language that you want to translate for,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.340
And then here you can see the English subtitles, and you only need to add the translations.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.440
So just type what the actual translation is..

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.940
And then tab to the next section and type the translation of that one

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.420
And so on.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.900
Pretty easy, right?

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:23.260
Then click "Submit", specify whether you've completed the subtitles for the whole video, or just part of them...

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.220
And then [click] "Submit" so that again, these can be reviewed.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.640
I hope this small demo helped you, and perhaps took out the scare of what might seem difficult...

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.520
But really, everyone can do and help with.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.160
Finally, if you're wondering "why even subtitles or closed captions?" There's actually various reasons.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:51.480
It might be as simple as that, umm, you have a hard time understanding what I say and it's easier when you can also read it.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.900
But, um, it might also be that you're in an environment where you can only watch the video muted...

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.020
Or you only want to watch it muted...

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:08.020
And you still do want some pointers, not just seeing me, how I fold it, but also what I say along

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:15.920
Of course, and very importantly, you might be hearing impaired and actually don't have another option.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.100
Or you might not understand English all together, and especially then,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.240
The subtitles of other languages are super, super useful.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.900
And those, I- I really can't even do by myself.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.840
I can do English and German, because those are the two languages I'm fluent in,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.800
And any other languages, I need your help with.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.480
So, I'd love it if you helped out, and I'm eager to see how many submissions there will be,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.100
And I'm thankful for every single one of them,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.380
And remember, you don't need to do a whole video, you and others can contribute...

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.000
And isn't that the magic of [the] internet, and do let me know what you think of it,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.940
And do comment, which videos you'd like to see subtitles for first, so that others maybe know where to start.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.000
Or help out with my two currently most viewed videos.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.360
The snowflake video has no subtitles yet, and the box with lid video, subtitles in English and German only.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.820
So if you only want to translate subtitles, that's one to go for.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.900
Or check out my playlist of all tutorials that already have English subtitles.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.860
Or even better, pick your favourite video of mine.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.060
So, I hope to see you around,

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.820
Happy subtitling and, of course as always, happy folding!
