00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:06.500
What's up guys?

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.219
Finally Friday, which means it's time to pick
Loots lastest winner, but you know the drill,

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.309
not till the end.

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.170
First off we're gonna talk about a Forced
Tournament, Path of Exile heading to Steam,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.570
Heroes becomes Titans, and an update on the
GTA Online chaos, naturally.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.700
As BetaDwarf prepares to release their co-op
action RPG Forced onto the world later this

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.870
month, they have announced a special pre-release
tournament for players to participate in.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.659
The tournament will run from October 11th
through the 13th

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:40.769
, and will challenge players to form teams
and compete in the game's endless mode, where

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.969
they will fight various enemies and deal with
deadly constructs to outlast the competition.

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.859
Players will win prizes that include keyboards,
gaming mice, SSDs and more.

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.389
Be sure to check out our article below if
interested

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:59.120
Grinding Gear Games has been hard at work
preparing their action RPG for what seems

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.409
like ages now but the game will finally be
ready to be released to Steam on October 23rd.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.200
Some of the new additions players can expect
with the version 1.0 build include a new prestige

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.861
class called the Scion which requires a higher
skill level than any other class, and new

00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:16.210
zones and shrines.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.060
Check out MMO Attack for more information
on Path of Exile including more news and interviews

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.910
and be sure to check out the game when it
launches on October 23rd.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.530
We released a Top 10 Superhero list earlier
this year in which we controversially put

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.380
City of Heroes as the number one game.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.940
Shockingly, the support for that decision
was overwhelming -- the amount of love the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.700
community still have for that game is crazy
high, which is why it so much makes sense

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.150
that the Missing Worlds Media, volunteer made
spiritual successor of the game got off to

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.830
a huge start on kickstarter.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.520
Set to be developed under the new name City
of Titans, the campaign managed to collect

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.190
$207,000 in just 48 hours, leaving them sitting
very pretty for their current goal of $320,000.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.801
If youre one of the many that felt that city
of heroes met a very untimely demise, make

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:05.890
sure to check out their kickstarter page and
pledge your support.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.390
And finally, I wouldn't be able to call it
a week if I didn't at least mention the ongoing

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.640
Grand Theft Auto Online issues.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.480
Rockstar released a new update today, but
players are still sounding off over one issue

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.970
or another.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.760
Most notably is the widespread problem of
characters mysteriously being wiped between

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.549
online play sessions, something we've even
experienced here in the office while trying

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.260
to stream.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.209
Naturally players are raging pretty hardcore.

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.780
Many speculate it's due to the unreliable
cloud servers storing the characters and should

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.379
be fixed once the servers are stabilized.

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.709
But I think what's most shocking, is that
people are reacting as if they didn't see

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.579
this coming.

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.099
Welcome to a modern, massive online release
people.

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.079
If you don't want issues, try waiting a week.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.390
But if we were all that reasonable, there'd
be nothing to complain about -- and isn't

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.709
that really what the internet is really for??

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.709

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.709
