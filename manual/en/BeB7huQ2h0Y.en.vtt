00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.060
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.130
Hello!.  Iâ€™m Vicente , the leader of the UST_2 project. 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.319
This is the already built UST_1 stellarator 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:40.019
and this is a 3D printed piece for the UST_2 stellarator. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.020
A stellarator is a stunning beautiful device,
similar to this, and to this.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.320
It works similarly to our Sun and I truly believe that

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.300
they will produce energy in a short term.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.249
We are a lot of human beings, and growing,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.849
and we spend and need plenty of energy.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.060
UST_2 is the second step in the path to produce

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.060
clean and cheap energy for all of us. 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.060
In the first step I successfully built the UST_1 stellarator

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.060
this here, with these coils, the vacuum system and all the facility.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.060
Now I propose to build low-cost fusion devices by 3D-printing

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.060
these are three coils 3D-printed for the UST_2 stellarator,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.060
a larger device composed by 84 of these twisted coils

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.060
similar to these ones but more complex and perfect

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.060
but this is not only a useful device

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.060
it is this is also a piece of art

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.060
and it will support the 3D-printing revolution.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.060
In a next step, a larger device will be a fusion reactor

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.060
that will produce millions of watts of power,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.060
clean and inexpensive.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.060
Now I need your help to by the 3D-printed pieces

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.060
and other components.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.060
Please, support the project and spread the word.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.060
Thank you.
