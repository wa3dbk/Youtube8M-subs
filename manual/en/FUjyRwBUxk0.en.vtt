00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.290
Hobby Mom: Welcome to Hobbykids V.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.309
We're going to open up the Volcano Valley
using magic fun dough and playdoh.

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.309
Hobby Kid 1: Yay.

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.320
Hobby Kid 2: Yay.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.930
Hobby Mom: And stickers.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:31.439
This is a bird nest.

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.579
Here's all the pieces that it comes with.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:44.299
Here are the transfers that come with this
set, so you can make all kinds of little characters

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:50.160
and dinosaurs, cavemen, bones, eggs.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:01:37.780
We filled our applicator with water, and now
we're going to make a caveman.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:46.850
Let's use some orange playdoh for our lava.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.850
I'm going to tell you a story about a dinosaur
and another dinosaur and he had a little baby

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.850
egg.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.789
"Guess what, honey?"

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.759
"What, darling?"

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.530
"Our little egg hatched.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.530
He's born."

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.789
"Where is he?"

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.360
"Goo Goo."

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.940
"Goo Goo.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.510
Goo Goo."

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.370
"I forgot to mention that we have twins!"

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.860
"Wh-what?

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.890
Come on kids, let's go play ball."

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.239
They went and got some lava and ice balls
and then played on the volcano.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.390
But they had to be careful, because there
was a scary green dinosaur ready to chomp

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.980
them.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.290
This is what happened to Joe when the dinosaur
got hold of him.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:55.100
"You put the ball on the volcano, and then
you press the button.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.060
"Ouch, you bonked me on head."

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.700
Hobby Kid 2: "I'm doing making off with lava.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.150
Caw, Caw." (sound effect)
(laughter)

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.680
Hobby Kid 1: "This isn't good.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.650
I need to take a birdbath.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.319
Oh no, I don't want to take a birdbath."

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.519
Hobby Kid 2: "Goo Goo.

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.519
Big poo-poo."

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.519
Hobby Mom: "Goo Goo.

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:26.519
Big poo-poo."

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.519
Then you know what happened?

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.650
"OH, oh no.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.400
What did I just step in?

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.400
Ew."

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.790
Hobby Kid 2: "Hee hee hee hee.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.790
Ew."

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.810
Hobby Mom: "Pet, oh Pet, where are you?"

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.520
"Ew."

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:53.150
"Oh, no, please don't.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:05.370
(sound effect) Aw."
