00:00:00.074 --> 00:00:04.168
Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games for the Nintendo Wii and DS

00:00:04.168 --> 00:00:09.056
Mario and Sonic's Olympic Games game if you know what I mean sold like the proverbial hot cakes. 

00:00:09.056 --> 00:00:13.102
Not only did it tap into the spirit of the Olympics but it also brought together two gaming greats 

00:00:13.102 --> 00:00:17.116
as they competed along with their friends and enemies over track and field events. 

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:21.164
Now they’re back competing over snow and ice but does the game get a chilly reception?

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:25.038
Well, the good news is that this game improves on the last one. 

00:00:25.038 --> 00:00:30.046
You’ll notice straight away that all the events are unlocked from the start which is great news in terms of accessibility. 

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:37.048
The controls are also tighter and seem less random but this does mean that sometimes gameplay can be a bit too simplistic.

00:00:37.048 --> 00:00:42.162
Events vary from figure skating and speed skating to ice hockey, curling and of course racing events as you hurtle down slopes 

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:46.130
and tunnels on skis, snowboards or even in bobsleighs. 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.064
Of course, this one’s aimed very much at party play for the casual gamer

00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:53.038
so expect this to appeal more to non-gamers than the hardcore.

00:00:53.038 --> 00:00:57.072
Once again, Sega have tried to implement gestures that fit as closely to the real thing. 

00:00:57.072 --> 00:01:02.140
When curling you 'brush' the stone towards the target just like in the real game 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.026
and when speed skating you thrust your arms to-and-fro to get your speed up. 

00:01:06.026 --> 00:01:10.174
You can even use the Wii balance Board if you have one to distribute your weight left 

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:14.094
and right in the slalom or lie face down on the floor when doing the skeleton. 

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:18.102
You’ll need some space in your lounge to do this and it may prove just a little bit too much effort for your Nan, 

00:01:18.102 --> 00:01:20.156
best she just uses the remote then.

00:01:20.156 --> 00:01:24.016
On a negative note, it’s a shame there isn’t any Wii Motion plus support. 

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:28.192
Sega say it’s because they want the game to appeal to as many Wii owners as possible and that’s fair enough, 

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:32.106
but it would be nice to also support the thousands of gamers who’ve got the peripheral 

00:01:32.106 --> 00:01:35.012
and can only currently use it on a couple of titles.

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:38.080
This game isn’t aimed at the likes of me but I know that families who own a Wii just for party games 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.160
and the like will enjoy this one. 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.128
It’s not my cup of tea but if you’re in the casual games camp then you’ll be pleased to know

00:01:44.128 --> 00:01:47.094
I’m giving it a very good 7 out of 10.

00:01:47.094 --> 00:01:49.182
