00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060
Ximena: Hi.

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.595
Roxanna: We're Rainy Day Dreamers!

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:06.682
Parris:  And we're doing something a little different today for our fun vloggy Friday. We're

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:13.135
doing a Blind Bag challenge. These Simpsons Blind Bags, we're going to do them blindfolded

00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:18.095
and since Ximena doesn't watch the show, doesn't know the characters, Roxanna and I are going

00:00:18.095 --> 00:00:22.622
to be the blindfolded people. She's going to put the little figurines in our hands and we're going

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:26.057
to see who can figure out who's first. Are you ready?

00:00:26.057 --> 00:00:27.426
Roxanna: Yes.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:41.575
Ximena: Okay so basically the rules are you each get about a minute. So I open it, put the

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:45.372
figurines together and then I give it to you both at the same time and you each have a minute.

00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:50.495
One wrong guess and the second guess if you don't get it, then the other person gets a turn, right?

00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:54.963
Parris:  But we don't really take turns but if we don't guess it or we make two wrong guesses

00:00:54.963 --> 00:01:00.627
then our turn is done. You may give us a hint but she may not know. Oh no she doesn't know the

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:04.592
characters. Well, let's see how this turns out. Anyway, these are Fundies Blind Bag things.

00:01:04.592 --> 00:01:09.781
They're about $3.50. You can find them online on the link down below this video. I'll put on my

00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:11.243
blind fold and you take over.

00:01:11.243 --> 00:01:13.211
Ximena: Okay, blindfolds.

00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:17.855
Parris:  Yes making sure I don't see anything there. I'm good. I'll keep my hands away while I

00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:19.913
hear the cutting sounds of scissors.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:27.783
Ximena: Hope I put this together right.

00:01:27.783 --> 00:01:33.236
Parris:  How many piece are there?

00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:37.985
Ximena: One, two, three four, five.

00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:38.994
Parris:  Oh, got a lot.

00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:50.055
Ximena: Okay, I got it.

00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:52.367
Parris:  Now, if you could zoom in.

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:58.967
Ximena: Okay, so here are the two characters form the show. I'm thinking that you guys know

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:03.052
these if you do watch Simpsons, easy.

00:02:03.052 --> 00:02:04.762
Parris:  Put your hand up.

00:02:04.762 --> 00:02:05.670
Roxanna: Oh, right.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.781
Parris:  Make a cup of it so she can drop it in there.

00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:10.184
Ximena: Go.

00:02:10.184 --> 00:02:17.413
Parris:  Okay, it's a person from The Simpsons. Man, I haven't done this- this is harder than I

00:02:17.413 --> 00:02:22.412
thought. It feels like their head and a book are all merged - oh, into one. Oh no I broke it,

00:02:22.412 --> 00:02:28.445
Ximena: It's okay. They come out easy. You cans separate it I guess.

00:02:28.445 --> 00:02:32.014
Parris:  Big, fat back.

00:02:32.014 --> 00:02:33.919
Roxanna: There's a what now?

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.511
Ximena: # [crosstalk 00:02:33] you can take a separate-

00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:40.753
Parris:  Maybe it's Krusty the clown and he's holding a pie. I got it, alright.

00:02:40.753 --> 00:02:42.269
Ximena: You can take your blindfold off.

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.180
Parris:  Oh.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.989
Roxanna: Do you even know this one?

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.554
Parris:  Well, of course. It's easy but the accessories I cannot figure out what they're trying to

00:02:54.554 --> 00:02:56.707
get at with the accessories.

00:02:56.707 --> 00:03:00.180
Roxanna: Me neither. It feels like a chocolate bar or something.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.657
Parris:  Want a clue?

00:03:04.657 --> 00:03:05.843
Roxanna: Sure.

00:03:05.843 --> 00:03:09.177
Parris:  Well, you know there's that guy you always see him at the store, Dr. Hebert is at the

00:03:09.177 --> 00:03:17.007
hospital, Chief Wiggum is always at the police station, this guy is always home.

00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:21.083
Roxanna: Home is it like, Homer?

00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:26.679
Ximena: You got it. But what's he holding?

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:27.771
Roxanna: A TV remote.

00:03:27.771 --> 00:03:29.456
Parris:  Oh, I thought it was an ice cube tray.

00:03:29.456 --> 00:03:30.933
Ximena: I thought it was a calculator.

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:36.322
Parris:   # [00:03:33] works at the nuclear power plant so that's a remote. Oh and a donut, oh a

00:03:36.322 --> 00:03:45.169
donut! Oh, I can't believe we couldn't guess that and then krusty with the pie.

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.140
Ximena: You knocked it out of his hand.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.618
Parris:  Yea, and I couldn't get it back. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from but it felt

00:03:49.618 --> 00:03:52.548
like a pie. That's what gave it away more than the krusty thing.

00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:54.414
Ximena: I'm surprised you didn't get it from the hair.

00:03:54.414 --> 00:03:57.649
Roxanna: I was barely # [00:03:55] Homer a little bit because of the hair.

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:00.777
Parris:  This is cute. They're kind of like, Lego based things.

00:04:00.777 --> 00:04:03.829
Ximena: Yes, they are. See? It's from the Lego Company.

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.740
Parris:  Because the legs go and you can bend the arms.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:15.368
Ximena: It says here. One Lego mini figure, mini- I don't know this.

00:04:15.368 --> 00:04:21.097
Parris:  That's in French. You're just reading it in French. I wonder if these have one of those

00:04:21.097 --> 00:04:26.634
really valuable one they only make a few of. I don't know which character it would be. Did they

00:04:26.634 --> 00:04:30.531
say anything about that? Wow, look at all the extra people. See they do have the mouse and the

00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:39.952
bully. What's his name, Mason, Wilson? Something son. Muxson- I can't remember his name.

00:04:39.952 --> 00:04:42.108
What's his name, the bully?

00:04:42.108 --> 00:04:43.341
Roxanna: Muntson?

00:04:43.341 --> 00:04:47.753
Parris:  I only watch The Simpsons occasionally anymore. It's still on the air which is

00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:50.011
surprising. It's like 30 years, I think.

00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:52.160
Roxanna: Thirty years since they made an episode?

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.201
Parris:  No, no since it started. The Simpsons came out while I was in japan.

00:04:56.201 --> 00:04:57.952
Ximena: Thirty years?

00:04:57.952 --> 00:05:02.546
Parris:  Between- no, it couldn't have been 30, maybe 25 because I left japan in '87, came back

00:05:02.546 --> 00:05:07.156
in '93 and The Simpsons was a big hit and Seinfeld was a big hit and I didn't know anything

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:11.292
about either of them. No interest until I actually started watching them. So what do you think?

00:05:11.292 --> 00:05:13.354
Do you like these little characters?

00:05:13.354 --> 00:05:14.675
Ximena: I do, I do.

00:05:14.675 --> 00:05:19.445
Parris:  Very realistic and we look through these little pictures here. They all have a clue that if

00:05:19.445 --> 00:05:23.723
you play this game at home, should let you know which was which so it was actually fun for us.

00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:24.480
Did you have fun?

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.163
Ximena: Yes.

00:05:25.163 --> 00:05:26.358
Parris:  Did you have fun running it?

00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:27.108
Ximena: Yes.

00:05:27.108 --> 00:05:28.966
Parris:  Sorry, you didn't get to do it, but next time-

00:05:28.966 --> 00:05:29.669
Ximena: I don't mind.

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.415
Parris:  -we'll pick out a character that you know.

00:05:31.415 --> 00:05:32.778
Ximena: My Little Pony? Please, please?

00:05:32.778 --> 00:05:34.466
Parris:  My Little Pony stuff-

00:05:34.466 --> 00:05:35.783
Roxanna: It's a good show.

00:05:35.783 --> 00:05:36.513
Parris:  Maybe we'll do-

00:05:36.513 --> 00:05:38.782
Ximena: I watched the movie like five times.

00:05:38.782 --> 00:05:40.321
Roxanna: Six.

00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:42.985
Parris:  And when did you first start watching My Little Pony?

00:05:42.985 --> 00:05:48.416
Ximena: Just a couple of weeks ago and I watched all four seasons multiple times and two

00:05:48.416 --> 00:05:51.567
movies. They're probably tired of the same things.

00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:54.120
Parris:  Oh, the song over and over and over endlessly.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.303
Roxanna: I know but it's a pretty good song though, it is.

00:05:58.303 --> 00:06:00.885
Ximena: I want to have the same song as my alarm.

00:06:00.885 --> 00:06:03.084
Parris:  Oh okay.

00:06:03.084 --> 00:06:05.346
Roxanna: But who introduced you to it?

00:06:05.346 --> 00:06:10.828
Ximena: My friends probably would've shown me it a couple of days after you.

00:06:10.828 --> 00:06:14.751
Roxanna: Probably, but I did. Me.

00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:20.260
Parris:  So maybe we'll do My Little Pony Blind Bags but I can't tell you because it'd be too

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.633
much of a clue. So you just have to wait and see what we do for that.

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.824
Ximena: # [00:06:20] all the My Little Pony figures.

00:06:25.824 --> 00:06:30.050
Parris:  Go visit mommy and Gracie. At their house, they probably have them. So if on our

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.489
Friday vlog videos, you'd like to see us do more of these blindfolded Blind Bag challenges,

00:06:34.489 --> 00:06:42.367
down below this video, comment hashtag more Blind Bag or hashtag no more Blind Bags. Let us

00:06:42.367 --> 00:06:45.969
know how you feel about it we'll do other stuff as well but if you like these Blind Bag

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:48.293
challenges, we'll definitely do more of them.

00:06:48.293 --> 00:06:54.035
Roxanna: My Little Pony is actually a really amazing show. I really do love it so thank you

00:06:54.035 --> 00:06:59.960
mommy and Gracie. I saw how much you guys liked it, so I thought I'd try an episode and I

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.064
loved it.

00:07:01.064 --> 00:07:01.734
Ximena: Can we?

00:07:01.734 --> 00:07:03.902
Parris:  Hasn't stopped since # [00:07:02]

00:07:03.902 --> 00:07:06.234
Ximena: Can we go to mommy and Gracie's house to get the figurines?

00:07:06.234 --> 00:07:08.001
Parris:  Maybe next time we're in New Jersey, we'll see-

00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:10.107
Ximena: We've been to New Jersey before?

00:07:10.107 --> 00:07:15.571
Parris:  We did, we took the Staten Island ferry and I think it took us briefly to New Jersey

00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:17.302
before it came back around.

00:07:17.302 --> 00:07:19.585
Ximena: I don't think I've ever been on a ferry before.

00:07:19.585 --> 00:07:21.871
Roxanna: Yea, you have, a really tiny one.

00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:23.297
Ximena: When we went out to see the Statue of Liberty.

00:07:23.297 --> 00:07:27.403
Ximena: Oh yea! One time, one time.

00:07:27.403 --> 00:07:31.710
Parris:  I think you've actually been technically in New Jersey then. If you like the video, please
