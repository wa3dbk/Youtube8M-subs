00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.040
There is a new buzz in the world of dentistry
and it's dubbed 'sleep dentistry'.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.110
Today, I'm going to learn more about it from
Melbourne dentist Dr Kristina Cakarovski.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.810
Kristina, how are you?

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.830
I'm well thank you.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.650
Now, tell me what exactly is sleep dentistry?

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.500
Sleep dentistry, or more correctly sedation
dentistry, is a comfortable way of undergoing

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.800
dental treatment while under sedation.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.980
When do patients typically require it?

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.840
A patient might ask for this therapy if they
are particularly anxious about their dental

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.910
treatment.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.791
Whether that anxiety be to do with the smells
and sounds associated with dentistry or a

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:43.640
fear of the oral injections or instruments
involved.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.950
Also, some people have an involuntary gag
reflex when a dentist is working in their

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.960
mouth or they might struggle to hold their
mouth open for long periods.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.140
All of these resistances are overcome with
sedation.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.540
And what form does this sedation take?

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.140
We combine a sedative with a pain relieving
medicine and administer it intravenously.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.180
There are no straws down the patient's throat.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.100
The preparation induces a drowsy and dream
like state.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.210
The patient has no memory of the dental procedure
afterwards.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.410
And is it safe?

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.200
We offer sedation dentistry only to patients
who are medically well, that have already

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.480
been thoroughly checked out beforehand.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.780
At our clinic the preparation is administered
by qualified specialist anesthetists.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.100
These registered specialists have a medical
degree plus a postgraduate qualification in

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.100
anesthetics.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.800
So the same safe guards apply as in a hospital.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.020
At our clinic the patients are monitored the
whole time they are under sedation.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.100
Are there any side effects or after effects?

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.400
Some people experience mild drowsiness for
up to 24 hours after the procedure but this

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.690
is not typical.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.049
As with general anesthetics, the safeguards
we put in place which make side effects very

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.049
rare.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.979
We do recommend that a patient doesn't drive
or use public transport immediately afterwards

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.980
and that they be accompanied home, just as
a precaution.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.980
And what about costs?

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.610
The costs of the sedation dentistry is additional
to the fee for the treatment itself.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.880
You can expect to pay about $600 per hour
of sedation.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.080
There is a minimum of one hour and the charges
are applied in quarter hour increments after

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.150
that.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.640
The good news for patients at our clinic is
that because you are being treated by specialist

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.430
anesthetist you are eligible for a medicare
rebate of about a quarter of the costs.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.560
And given the benefits to people with serious
dental phobias, it sounds like it is money

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.609
well spent.

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.750
It certainly is.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.290
Well thanks for your time today, Kristina.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.459
Truly really appreciate it.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.379
You are very welcome.
