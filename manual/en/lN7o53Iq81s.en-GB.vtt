00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
I'm gonna get the bad news out the way, okay? 'Oh, poor Emma, you got some bad news.' Um…

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.600
I won't be able to upload for the next couple of weeks, because we're getting our kitchen and bathroom refitted,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.100
which means I finally get a shower! In my own house!

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.000
And I've told you this before, but for those of you who don't know, the first time I had a shower was

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on a school trip, when I was thirteen.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.500
Showered in my underwear, 'cause that's what I thought– that's what I thought everyone did.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.000
'No, Emma. No one does that.'

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.200
Said all of my class, when my best friend told them.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.000
She still doesn't let it go.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.500
It's been ten years this year…

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.600
So my life for the next two weeks is just gonna involve early mornings, lots of banging, and lots of drilling.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.600
Which leads me on, very nicely, to this little story, that I felt like telling you today.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.420
Thought we'd sit down and have a little chit-chat.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.420
You know, we don't talk enough. Um…

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.200
This story is entitled,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.200
'My Neighbour Likes to Get Fucked

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.620
at One O'Clock in the Morning

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.700
When I'm Trying to Sleep'.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.000
Didn't give anything away, did it?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.900
Now, this story starts off about six months ago,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.760
when my next-door neighbour who lives that way…

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.760
That… Is useless to you, isn't it?

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.000
My next-door neighbour who lives that way, she is a lovely lass, she is great,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.100
she has a 10-year-old son, and about six months ago, she got a boyfriend.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.000
Great!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.520
For a while, me and my dad thought it was her brother going in the house every so often…

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.020
No!

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.800
Certainly proved us wrong,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.140
we hope. Anyway… [chuckles]

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.920
Now, I know this doesn't give you any context, but basically,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.280
six months ago, this used to be where my bed was.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.500
Okay, so my bed was against this wall.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.980
And this wall here, which you can't see…

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.540
I'm not giving you any context, give me a second.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.860
Basically, there is a wall.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.240
With Miley Cyrus on it.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.900
And that wall is the wall that joins my bedroom with her bedroom.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.240
Now you know!

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.240
So, one night, laying in my bed,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.040
Twitter, Tumblr,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.800
whatever websites that make me sound cool.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.880
I don't fucking know…

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.780
When suddenly, I start hearing this, sort of, muffled banging, like…

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.580
[hits the desk]

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.480
[hits the desk]

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.600
[hits the desk]

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.680
[hits the desk]

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.200
And, at first, like, I thought…

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.780
'Is she knocking on my wall? Am I making noise or something?

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.060
Is she– Is she fucking hammering something?

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.100
1:00 a.m.?'

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.660
No!

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.040
Someone was hammering her!

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.380
Just thought of that joke.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.240
You're welcome.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.120
I don't know that yet, okay?

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.440
So, I just hear this sort of banging for a while, and I think,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.160
'Okay, this is getting on my nerves.'

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.360
Then, I start hearing a little bit of mumbling.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.300
Like…

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.880
[imitating the sound of someone having sex]

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.920
[imitating the sound of someone having sex]

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.240
[imitating the sound of someone having sex]

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.220
[imitating the sound of someone having sex]

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.300
Right, she might not sound like that, I'm sorry I didn't record it!

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.360
I wish I could give you context, I really do!

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.780
Like, she's lived there, like, ten years, and she's been single.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.180
So, I'm just thinking, 'Maybe, she's shouting at her son!

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.420
That would be a perfectly logical explanation!'

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.380
Then, I hear a guy!

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.860
Making the same fucking sounds! Just a little bit deeper,

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.600
obviously.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.640
[deep voice] 'Oh, yeah! Hm! Yeah!'

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.360
Okay, didn't sound like a rapey monkey,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.860
for one.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.820
But you get the idea;

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.060
it was graphic moaning,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.900
and banging,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.200
and, obviously, it is clicked!

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.220
And I'm just sitting there, like,

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.960
'Great!

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.680
I have to listen to my neighbour get fucked!'

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.020
You guys can probably tell, in any other situation,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.060
I would have just [hits the desk multiple times] done it back on the wall,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.740
or, played some fucking George Michael to get her in the mood,

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.240
to let her know that I could hear her.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.040
But I couldn't, because my dad was sleeping in his room, and I didn't want to wake him up.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.260
I just had to sit there for an hour and a half,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.800
listening to her getting her brains fucked out.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.000
[clapping] 'Oh, wow, Emma! That's a great story!'

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.940
Thanks! It's not over!

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.080
[sighs]

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.540
I can't keep up looking happy, I really can't.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.200
She's still with that boyfriend, I would assume, because that's happening still!

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.740
Every couple of weeks!

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.460
Like, he must live real far away!

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.740
Maybe, it's all in my head.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.300
I kinda hope it's not.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.700
The last time I heard her little shenanigans,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.840
was the best time, by far.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.740
I don't rank them, but this is why I wanted to tell you this.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.680
The story is great because of this.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.360
So, it starts off with the usual, kinda, pounding,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.660
and moaning, and grunting, and– and rapey monkey moaning,

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.400
and all that.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.840
This time, about a half an hour in,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.080
I start hearing this…

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.980
[claps]

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.020
[claps]

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.980
[claps]

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.940
[claps]

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.880
[claps] Bear in mind,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.880
my bed is over there now,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.560
she's still over there.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.460
I can still hear her.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.440
I have two theories, right?

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.500
Number one:

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.500
she's suddenly into spanking.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.340
[whispers] Great!

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.900
Number two, [chuckles quietly]

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.200
and this is what I can't stop imagining:

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.520
he's just high-fiving himself, [claps]

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.160
as he's going!

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.860
That's exactly how it sounds. [claps] Like, 'Amazing! What a good penis!' [claps]

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.020
I hang around with Luke too much, don't I?

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.740
Not–! [chuckles] I didn't mean it like that…

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.840
I've found out,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.160
her bed's not against that wall.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.960
It's over the other side!

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.160
She's like a fucking mile away!

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.580
It sounds like a porn film, with shrieking hyenas.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.080
I've heard porn stars be more subtle with their orgasms than her.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.640
Like…

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.900
They're not– they're good!

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.340
Yeah! Orgasms are great!

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.860
Nothing is that good!

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.320
He doesn't have a zucchini for a dick!

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.680
Okay?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.660
He doesn't have a horse penis!

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.480
Assuming that would feel good? I… [sighs]

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.080
Don't know!

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.480
'Uh, you've been going on for minutes now, Emma! What's the big ending?'

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.760
Okay…

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.260
Not her big ending.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.180
Don't wanna think about that.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.260
Basically,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.700
I like to tell my dad

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.060
about things like this,

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.820
and for the last six months, I've come downstairs and gone, 'Yeah, she's been fucking again.'

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.720
And he'll say, 'Oh, how long for this time?'

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.980
And I'll say, like, 'About an hour.'

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.000
That's

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.820
become quite a regular conversation

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.800
between me

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.540
and my dad,

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.220
the internet legend himself.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.240
So, last week, when I last heard her,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.320
went downstairs, told my dad,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.120
now, she's getting her kitchen and bathroom refitted right now,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.120
and my dad's been checking up on her,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.400
making sure she's okay,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.300
and I went in there,

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.160
last week, the morning after,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.160
and said, 'How are you?'

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.300
And she said,

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.420
'Ah, I'm feeling a bit soar, actually, I'm in a bit of pain…'

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.580
My dad turns around and says, 'Yeah,

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.660
Emma said you sounded like you were in a bit of pain last night.'

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.760
Thanks, dad!

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.480
Now she knows that I can hear her have sex!

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.060
Amazing!

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.800
Apparently, she just went,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.200
'Oh…'

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.320
And I haven't heard her since! So…

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.700
Either he hasn't come around…

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.520
Or she got the hint!

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.020
Even though I could never, ever look her in the eye again.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.880
Ugh…

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.220
That's, uh, that's, basically, all I've got for ya,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.840
for a couple of weeks, so, uh…

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.020
Feel free to follow me on Twitter, 'cos I'll be there.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.380
Are your neighbours arseholes, like mine?

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.820
Let me know in the comments below,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.700
so I don't feel so bad about my chappy neighbourhood.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.820
[sigh]

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.380
Bye! [fart noise]
