00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.000
Hi, my name is Stacy Sowa,
and I'm a dietetics

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.040
graduate student here at
Eastern Illinois University.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.097
Today, I'm going to be talking
about the importance of

00:00:19.097 --> 00:00:23.027
vegetables and how to get your
kids to eat more of them.

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:26.057
According to recent research,
children of all ages are not

00:00:26.057 --> 00:00:30.013
getting an adequate amount of
vegetables in their diets.

00:00:30.013 --> 00:00:33.093
Vegetables are the best source
of many important vitamins and

00:00:33.093 --> 00:00:37.033
fortified nutrients that can
help aid in the growth and

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:39.087
development of a child.

00:00:39.087 --> 00:00:42.073
The childhood years are also
a critical time in developing

00:00:42.073 --> 00:00:45.087
a love for healthy foods that
can have a positive impact

00:00:45.087 --> 00:00:48.083
on one's health
later in life.

00:00:48.083 --> 00:00:52.083
When children eat vegetables
on a daily basis it also helps

00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:55.090
to ensure that they're getting
an adequate amount of dietary

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.060
fiber that can be lacking
in children's diets.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.067
I'm now going to show you
some simple ways that

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:04.063
you can improve your child's
vegetable consumption

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:07.000
and improve their
overall health.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.090
My first tip is to add
vegetables to foods your

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.057
children already
like to eat.

00:01:12.057 --> 00:01:16.013
So some good ideas would be
making zucchini, pumpkin,

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:19.000
or shredded carrot muffins
or sweetbreads that

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.010
taste great and your
children won't even know

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.063
they're getting their
vegetables.

00:01:23.063 --> 00:01:27.000
Another idea is to chop up
and mix vegetables into

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.050
things like pasta sauces,
lasagna, ravioli, casseroles,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.007
soups, chili, and
even omelets.

00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:39.013
Another idea would be to slice
up vegetables and put them

00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:43.040
on top of things like pizza or
tacos or add extra vegetables

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.000
to tuna salad, chicken
salad, and pasta salad.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.023
My next tip is to offer
vegetables in a way that

00:01:51.023 --> 00:01:53.053
makes them more
appealing to kids.

00:01:53.053 --> 00:01:56.040
So here I have some light
ranch dip that you could

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.053
serve with raw veggies, or
some peanut butter that

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:03.080
you could spread
on celery sticks.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.053
My last item is Parmesan cheese
that you can sprinkle on top of

00:02:07.053 --> 00:02:11.087
steamed vegetables
to add more flavor.

00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:14.040
Another idea is to
get kids involved in

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.037
the growing of
vegetables.

00:02:16.037 --> 00:02:19.063
Research has shown that when
children see the growth of

00:02:19.063 --> 00:02:24.027
vegetables they're more likely
and interested in trying them.

00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:26.007
So some ideas would be to
start a vegetable garden

00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:28.050
in your own home.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.077
Kids can participate in watering
the crops and then picking them

00:02:32.077 --> 00:02:35.063
and eating them in
the kitchen.

00:02:35.063 --> 00:02:39.057
Another idea if you don't
have access or can't start

00:02:39.057 --> 00:02:42.023
a vegetable garden in your
home would be to visit a

00:02:42.023 --> 00:02:45.077
local farm or a farmers market
where children could still

00:02:45.077 --> 00:02:49.020
see the process of growing
and then pick out the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.063
foods that they'd
like to try.

00:02:51.063 --> 00:02:55.003
Another tip would be to add
fresh vegetables on top of

00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:57.067
foods kids commonly
like to eat.

00:02:57.067 --> 00:03:01.043
For example, you could slice up
a tomato or onion and put it on

00:03:01.043 --> 00:03:05.017
top of things like hamburgers,
grilled chicken sandwiches,

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:09.037
other sandwiches, and
even grilled cheese.

00:03:09.037 --> 00:03:12.090
Another tip I have for you is to
have ready-to-eat vegetables

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.063
accessible to children
as snacks.

00:03:15.063 --> 00:03:19.043
So here I have some sliced
up green pepper and celery

00:03:19.043 --> 00:03:22.020
that are already cleaned and
cut and children can just

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.060
grab them for a snack.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.037
Another idea that many stores
have are these vegetable cups.

00:03:28.037 --> 00:03:31.033
They're kind of like fruit cups
and you can just keep them

00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:33.063
in the fridge and a child
can just open them up and

00:03:33.063 --> 00:03:36.030
enjoy them as a snack.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.000
My next tip would be to get kids
involved in the menu planning

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.020
and preparation of meals.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.043
So easy ways to do this is to
have the child visit the grocery

00:03:46.043 --> 00:03:50.077
store with you and pick out
things that they'd like to eat.

00:03:50.077 --> 00:03:54.053
Then when you get home they can
help you wash the vegetables,

00:03:54.053 --> 00:03:58.077
measure out ingredients and add
them to the bowl, and children

00:03:58.077 --> 00:04:00.083
will be more likely to want
to taste something that

00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:02.060
they have helped
to make.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.093
So a simple idea would be
making salsa.

00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:08.083
This is store-bought salsa but
there's a lot of simple recipes

00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:12.017
you can make at home that are
filled with veggies, and a child

00:04:12.017 --> 00:04:17.013
will be trying something new and
also getting their vegetables.

00:04:17.013 --> 00:04:19.057
Another tip I have for
you is to stock up on

00:04:19.057 --> 00:04:22.000
canned and frozen produce.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.083
Here I have some
canned green beans.

00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:27.053
Those would be really easy to
just pop in the microwave

00:04:27.053 --> 00:04:30.023
and enjoy for dinner
if you're in a hurry.

00:04:30.023 --> 00:04:33.007
This is a steamer
frozen vegetable.

00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:35.047
Again, you can just put it in
the microwave, and these have

00:04:35.047 --> 00:04:40.023
added seasoning, so a
little added flavor.

00:04:40.023 --> 00:04:43.000
My next idea is to buy foods
that already contain a

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.060
full serving of
vegetables.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.043
This, for example,
is vegetable rice.

00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:51.007
A lot of kids enjoy rice, and
they won't even know that

00:04:51.007 --> 00:04:53.077
they're getting some
vegetables in with that.

00:04:53.077 --> 00:04:57.000
Additionally, I have canned
soup that is great for

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.087
the wintertime, and each
serving of soup has a

00:04:59.087 --> 00:05:02.047
serving of vegetables
in them.

00:05:02.047 --> 00:05:05.097
Some drinks I have here are
100% vegetable juice.

00:05:05.097 --> 00:05:08.087
A half can of this is one
serving of vegetables,

00:05:08.087 --> 00:05:10.077
so that's a great option.

00:05:10.077 --> 00:05:13.070
Also, I have this light V8
Fusion which is kind of a

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.033
newer drink, and it has
vegetables and fruits in there,

00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:22.043
so it tastes like fruit juice
but it's actually vegetable

00:05:22.043 --> 00:05:25.070
so that's a great
option, too.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.087
My last tip is to put
out vegetables as

00:05:27.087 --> 00:05:30.010
appetizers for children.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.063
Many children get hungry when
they're watching you prepare

00:05:32.063 --> 00:05:36.057
dinner or helping you to prepare
dinner so, it's a great time

00:05:36.057 --> 00:05:38.060
to offer them vegetables.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.047
So some easy things are, this is
something I bought at the local

00:05:42.047 --> 00:05:45.090
store, and it's baby carrots
with a little ranch dip.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.047
It's easy to open up and it
could be a great appetizer

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:50.043
for your kids.

00:05:50.043 --> 00:05:53.053
Additionally, I have this bag
of broccoli and cauliflower.

00:05:53.053 --> 00:05:56.020
They're already washed and cut,
so it would be really easy

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.050
to just steam quickly or else
just open up, put on a platter

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.010
with a little ranch dip,
and it would be a great

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.000
appetizer for your kids.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.007
So again, according to research,
children's food preferences

00:06:10.007 --> 00:06:13.033
are greatly influenced by
the foods that parents

00:06:13.033 --> 00:06:16.093
choose to feed them, so a
child may need to be exposed

00:06:16.093 --> 00:06:20.010
to a certain food 10 to
15 times before they'll

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.043
actually want to eat it.

00:06:22.043 --> 00:06:25.043
It is important for parents to
continue to offer vegetables

00:06:25.043 --> 00:06:28.090
to their children on a daily
basis to increase the

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.097
consumption of vegetables
in this country and

00:06:31.097 --> 00:06:34.033
improve the health
of our children.

00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:37.000
I hope the information I have
shared with you today will

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.030
help you increase vegetable
consumption in your home.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.080
