[Stephanie] Hi I’m Stephanie from Huppin’s
and this is the D7900 series TV from Samsung.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.529
It’s a very packed and loaded TV. The Samsung
D7900 series has 1080 progressive and both

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.290
2 dimensional and 3 dimensional signal capabilities.
Enjoy stunning 2D 1080 progressive clarity

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:32.020
with real 240Hz refresh rate. When coupled
with a 3D source the D7900 series utilizes

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.950
active shutter glasses. Samsung 3D also offers
a unique feature that allows you to intensify

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.040
your 2D viewing experience by up-converting
it to an immersive 3D. The Samsung D7900 series

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.350
takes TV to the edge with an incredibly slim
bezel that creates a virtually edgeless picture.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.649
The D7900 series is only 1.2-inches deep.
Samsung’s Smart TVs allow you to search

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.560
for movies, TV shows, browse the web, explore
Samsung applications and even chat with friends.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.729
The Smart TV includes a full web browser to
navigate the internet; overall Samsung’s

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.880
Smart TVs allow your digital experiences to
converge on a brilliant HD screen. The Samsung

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.110
D7900 series has micro dimming technology
which provides detailed contrast across the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.479
screen with richer, brighter colors, and whiter
whites and blacker blacks. Additionally the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.170
D7900 series has built-in Wi-Fi and comes
with a full keyboard remote. Overall, I would

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.259
recommend the D7900 series to anyone who desires
performance, design and functionality in a

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.509
stunning package. This is Stephanie from Huppin’s
