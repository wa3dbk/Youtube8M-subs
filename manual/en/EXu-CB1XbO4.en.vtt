00:00:00.553 --> 00:00:03.936
He signed a bill that gave amnesty to undocumented immigrants.

00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:06.950
He grew the size of the federal government and the budget.

00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:08.790
Added a whole new cabinet level agency,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.697
and added tens of thousands of

00:00:10.697 --> 00:00:12.548
government workers to the federal payroll.

00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:14.420
He tripled the deficit.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.978
He bailed out and expanded Social Security

00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:19.039
with a big fat tax increase.

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:22.707
He raised corporate taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars

00:00:22.707 --> 00:00:25.109
He raised taxes on gasoline.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.374
He, in fact, signed into law

00:00:26.374 --> 00:00:28.414
the largest tax increase in history.

00:00:28.414 --> 00:00:30.492
He supported federal handgun controls.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:32.890
He called for a world without nuclear weapons.

00:00:33.608 --> 00:00:34.404
He was...

00:00:34.404 --> 00:00:35.620
Ronald Reagan.

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:37.572
As a conservative saint.

00:00:37.572 --> 00:00:39.301
As the right-wing Rock Star.

00:00:39.468 --> 00:00:42.104
As King of the Republican prom in perpetuity.

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:44.054
As a transformative figure for people

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:45.449
 who call themselves Conservatives,

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.767
the facts of Ronald Reagan's legislative record...

00:00:49.437 --> 00:00:50.609
are awkward.

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:53.477
Ronald Reagan's record has in it a lot of things

00:00:53.477 --> 00:00:56.021
that would get him kicked out of today's Republican Party.

00:00:56.393 --> 00:00:57.720
Which is not to say that President Reagan

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.785
 was a secret liberal

00:00:58.785 --> 00:00:59.625
he was not.

00:00:59.998 --> 00:01:01.032
What he was was...

00:01:01.032 --> 00:01:02.154
complex...

00:01:02.154 --> 00:01:04.071
but accomplished in his own way.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.161
With the passage of financial regulation in Washington today

00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:10.106
President Obama took to the very un-momentous setting

00:01:10.106 --> 00:01:13.137
of "Twitters" as he called it yesterday, to say this:

00:01:14.758 --> 00:01:16.642
"Last night's House-Senate agreement

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:19.125
on Wall Street reform represents

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:20.793
the toughest financial reform since

00:01:20.793 --> 00:01:22.118
the Great Depression."

00:01:22.977 --> 00:01:24.552
Turns out a lot of things that have happened in the

00:01:24.552 --> 00:01:26.315
less than two years of this Administration

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:27.329
are the biggest,

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:28.033
or first

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:30.081
or the most important in generations.

00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:31.745
On the occasion of the Wall Street

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:32.744
 reform announcement today

00:01:32.744 --> 00:01:35.098
Taegan Goddard at CQ Politics wrote:

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:37.209
"Not since FDR has a President done

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:39.782
 so much to transform the country."

00:01:40.388 --> 00:01:42.794
Even before today's historic Wall Street reform agreement

00:01:42.794 --> 00:01:44.849
President Obama, of course, did what politicians

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:47.377
have been trying to do for more than 60 years --

00:01:47.377 --> 00:01:48.827
he passed health reform,

00:01:48.827 --> 00:01:51.635
which for the first time establishes government responsibility

00:01:51.635 --> 00:01:54.273
for the healthcare of American citizens.

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.299
Consider also the stimulus bill

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.830
it didn't just throw a lasso around our

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.933
entire economy and yank it back from the brink

00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:03.656
it also pumped about a hundred billion dollars

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.836
into the crumbling embarrassment of our national

00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:08.282
infrastructure and transportation system.

00:02:08.682 --> 00:02:12.212
It was the largest investment in infrastructure since Ike.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.750
For solving our country's energy problems -

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.223
something Obama has compared to

00:02:16.223 --> 00:02:17.216
man walking on the moon

00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:20.289
it contained about $60 billion dollars in spending

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.097
and tax incentives for renewable and clean energy

00:02:23.097 --> 00:02:25.405
also an historic investment.

00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:27.904
It also included an unheralded but giant

00:02:27.904 --> 00:02:30.168
investment in science and tech

00:02:30.168 --> 00:02:31.896
 amping up the budgets of NASA, 

00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:33.674
the National Science Foundation and

00:02:33.674 --> 00:02:35.766
an experimental energy research agency

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:38.168
 that was created under President George W. Bush

00:02:38.168 --> 00:02:40.600
but never funded until now.

00:02:41.432 --> 00:02:43.566
President Obama also expanded state kids

00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:46.200
health insurance to cover another 4 million kids.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.696
He signed a Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act

00:02:48.696 --> 00:02:50.678
amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act

00:02:50.678 --> 00:02:52.741
for equal pay for equal work.

00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:55.109
He signed a nuclear arms deal with Russia

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.637
that would reduce both country's arsenals

00:02:56.637 --> 00:02:57.573
by a third.

00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:01.551
He created a new global nonproliferation initiative

00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:04.580
to keep nuclear materials out of the hands of terrorists.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.683
He set forth an international way forward

00:03:06.683 --> 00:03:10.084
on that radical left-wing proposition of Ronald Reagan

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:11.860
a world without nuclear weapons.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.796
Then there is the legislative and policy achievements

00:03:14.796 --> 00:03:17.493
but don't just build on previously set precedents

00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:19.100
but set new ones -

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.459
the Hate Crimes Prevention Act

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.423
also known as the Matthew Shepard Act

00:03:22.423 --> 00:03:24.996
it had languished in Congress for years.

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:26.968
The Food and Drug Administration permitted

00:03:26.968 --> 00:03:29.834
for the first time to regulate tobacco.

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:31.954
Better late than never, he dismantled

00:03:31.954 --> 00:03:34.655
the scandal plagued Minerals Management Service,

00:03:34.655 --> 00:03:36.749
broke it into three parts so that the folks who

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.309
collect money from oil leases

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:40.814
aren't the same ones regulating the industry.

00:03:41.145 --> 00:03:43.250
And now will actually investigate the industry

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.088
it was busy schtupping and doing drugs

00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:46.731
with during the last administration.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.316
Obama fired two wartime commanding generals

00:03:49.316 --> 00:03:50.226
in little over a year.

00:03:51.794 --> 00:03:53.153
He overhauled the astonishing

00:03:53.153 --> 00:03:55.463
stupidity of the student loan system

00:03:55.463 --> 00:03:57.116
in which banks were being subsidized

00:03:57.116 --> 00:03:58.988
to give loans that were guaranteed

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:00.326
by the government anyway!

00:04:00.326 --> 00:04:01.794
A license to print money!

00:04:02.124 --> 00:04:03.201
That was ended and the savings

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:04.944
put towards actual aid to students.

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:07.053
He canceled a weapons program that was

00:04:07.053 --> 00:04:09.003
bloated, unnecessary and totally irrelevant

00:04:09.003 --> 00:04:11.277
to either of our current wars --- the F-22.

00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:14.041
Why even mention the cancellation of a single weapon system?

00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:15.868
Because that never happens!

00:04:15.868 --> 00:04:18.116
Weapons systems never get canceled!

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:21.265
The F-22 did which is itself a miracle.

00:04:21.265 --> 00:04:22.482
In each of these achievements

00:04:22.482 --> 00:04:24.352
and in the list of things that he has yet to do:

00:04:24.352 --> 00:04:25.836
Don't Ask Don't Tell

00:04:25.836 --> 00:04:26.963
closing GuantÃ¡namo

00:04:26.963 --> 00:04:27.992
in each of these things,

00:04:27.992 --> 00:04:29.602
there is room for liberal disappointment

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:31.347
I sing a bittersweet lullaby to

00:04:31.347 --> 00:04:33.420
the lost public option when I go to sleep at night

00:04:33.932 --> 00:04:35.854
but presidential legacies are complex

00:04:35.854 --> 00:04:37.799
not even the Reagan administration's legacy

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:39.905
is pure as the conservative driven snow

00:04:40.108 --> 00:04:42.532
but Taegan Goddard at CQ Politics was right today

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.834
about nothing this big happening since FDR.

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:47.240
The list of legislative accomplishments of this President

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.035
in half a term even before energy reform

00:04:50.035 --> 00:04:52.173
which he is probably going to get to is

00:04:52.173 --> 00:04:53.165
-- to quote the vice president --

00:04:53.165 --> 00:04:54.633
"a big freaking deal"

00:04:54.913 --> 00:04:56.535
Love this administration or hate it,

00:04:56.535 --> 00:04:58.175
this President is getting a lot done.

00:04:58.175 --> 00:05:00.185
The last time any President did this much in office?

00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:01.885
Booze was illegal.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.588
If you believe in policy?

00:05:03.588 --> 00:05:05.651
If you believe in a government that addresses problems?

00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:07.115
Cheers to that.

00:05:07.383 --> 00:05:08.157
Goodnight.
