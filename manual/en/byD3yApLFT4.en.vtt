hi welcome to quick and easy cooking

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.060
I'm mrs. vahchef  Ragini Thumma
today I'm going to show you a healthy

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.960
breakfast

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.970
this healthy breakfast pretty much
everybody makes in their house but this

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:32.710
I make it only once in a week to feed my
husband and my son to cut down their

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.910
calories so this is nothing but oats

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.550
so first we'll take some water to cook
the oats

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.280
you all know how to cook oats but still
i'm going to show you once the water

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.740
comes to a boil add the oats

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.980
this takes a minute to cook now the oats
is ready so just switch off the flame

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:05.829
and directly into the serving bowl or
you can serve it in a plate  then milk

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.390
a little bit of honey because i have not
added any sugar

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.590
I feed this to my husband so I don't add
any calories

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.690
once in a while I get to feed my husband
such type of food here

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.370
some dates to give a little bit of
sweetness in between and then

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:35.860
nice banana at last to give a little bit
of crunchiness i add this cornflakes and

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.810
a little bit of a dates on top and the
healthy breakfast for vahchef is all ready

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.000
for vahchef  I top it off with cornflakes
but for my son

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.880
you know kids love chocolate so I put
some chocolate on top of it so that he

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.810
get nice sweetness nice crunchy while
eating the oats

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.060
he love this oats so why don't we
combine all together with some nice

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.420
fruits in it and some dry fruits in it
and feed them they're going to enjoy it

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.040

my husband so see you in another
