On behalf of Expert Village, I'm Terry and
today I'm going to show you how to use a handheld

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:10.830
grinder. Grinders are used for removing excess
material or polishing material or refinishing

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:20.171
material, it can be metal, wood, plaster,
anything that has too much material that you

00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:24.890
need to be removed. Right now I'm going to
start off with a small handheld grinder there

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.400
are different sizes, you can go all the way
up to a half or a quarter horse with the big

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.540
grinders, but for today's application, we're
going to use the smaller handheld grinder.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.180
Here we have what we call a dye grinder or
a finishing grinder you can put different

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.710
sandstones on it or stones or blades to get
in tight intricate areas inside pipe or inside

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.360
tight corners. This grinder here we primarily
use for flat grinding cutting or polishing.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.310
This grinder here is used a lot in the automotive
industry to cut panels, firewalls, you can

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.929
cut fencing, wire, just about anything, it's
air operated. Over here is another air operated

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:16.280
and this one is used in the finishing of materials
as sanding, polishing, you can even cut with

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.899
this one also. Right now this has a angle
on it for a removable sanding pad, so it will

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:31.329
be used also for removing material like a
grinder. Some of the other attachments and

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:38.259
heads this one has a removable pad for polishing,
you can actually bring metal to a mirror-like

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.969
finish with this pad. This is a wheel that
you can acquire for any one of these grinders

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:52.079
use it for cutting pipe, cut sheet metal,
cut nuts and bolts off. Then you have wire

00:01:52.079 --> 00:02:00.439
brushes which can be used to polish up the
metal or remove slag from your weld or remove

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.840
paint, remove rust. Here's another pad that's
really, really abrasive and it's used to polish

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.560
and remove rust too. Most of these usually
go in a stack. You start with your grind,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.540
then you'll go to your polish, then you'll
go to your wire wheel to knockout any rust,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.920
then you'll do a little bit of sanding and
you'll finally polish it off with a polishing

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.940
pad.
