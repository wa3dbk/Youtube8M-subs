00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.790
This episode of Dnews was proudly made possible
the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy - it’s not

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.109
just a sedan, it’s a Subaru.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.010
Sea levels are rising, but which countries
are most at risk?

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.650
We’ve got a detailed report, and the results
might just include you.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.589

Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and there

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.800
has been a lot of talk lately on the subject
of climate change.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.730
Last week, the UN hosted their climate summit
in New York City, to establish a plan for

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.019
reducing carbon emissions.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.041
It’s a hefty topic, with a lot of political
discussions surrounding it - but one of the

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:39.410
discussions you don’t often hear, is how
climate change will actually affect people

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.780
in different countries around the world.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.590
Fortunately, ClimateCentral.org just published
an analysis of exactly that.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.120
It offers a country-by-country estimate of
populations that are most at risk for regular

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.750
flooding, based on a new set of sea-level
data more comprehensive than ever before.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.780
Regular flooding in this case, is defined
by a flood at least once every 3 years.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.880
So who’s at most risk?

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.949
Take a look at this chart from the New York
Times, based on this data.

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.080
Each box represents a coastal country.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.520
The bigger the box, the higher percentage
of that country’s population who will be

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.600
exposed to regular flooding by the year 2100.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.050
If global carbon emissions continue on their
current trend, that amounts to 2.6% of the

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.850
world’s population, or 177 million people.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.939
But there are other options in this chart,
to account for more conservative and liberal

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:25.939
estimates.

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.020
At minimum, even with extremely rigorous cuts
to global emissions and oceans that are far

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.159
less sensitive to climate change than we expect,
1.9% of the population of coastal countries

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.040
would still be affected by flooding.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.060
And at worst, that figure would rise to 3.1%.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.520
If you go by the expected estimate of 177
million, though, 50 million of those people

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.520
live in China.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.860
That’s the most out of any country, and
yet China continues to be the world’s largest

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.520
producer of carbon emissions.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.299
Interestingly, the US - also one of the world’s
largest carbon emitters per capita - only

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.250
ranks #34 on the list, right between India
and Madagascar.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.869
Notice that 8 of the top 10 countries most
at risk are in Asia.

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.760
Yet if you consider the amount of residents,
The Netherlands actually ranks highest, per

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.760
capita.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.950
40% of their population would be at risk from
regular flooding.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.370
But because they possess the world’s most
advanced levee system, their practical risk

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.840
is actually quite low.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.379
Even with all this data, - there’s still
a good chance we’re underestimating the

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.379
risks.

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.160
The US, for example, has much more detailed
elevation data than most other countries,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.819
so when the group used that data to create
their estimates, they actually found their

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.709
projections for the US were much too conservative.

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.180
Assuming other countries had access to similar
data, then the global estimates could increase

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.909
dramatically, from 177 million up to 500 million.

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.629
Of course it’s important to remember that
these are just estimates.

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.660
There’s a lot of uncertainty surrounding
climate change, and its pace can vary from

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.400
decade to decade, especially as governments
start to wisen up - and change their policies

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400
accordingly.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.270

And speaking of wisening up, if you haven’t

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.040
heard yet - our resident tech expert and Subaru
owner Patrick Norton has teamed up with Subaru

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.090
once again, for a series of extreme challenges.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.190
If you head over to revision3.com/subaru,
you can see videos of Patrick running the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.629
all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy through a parking
lot-themed obstacle course, a daring race

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.610
against a remote-controlled car, and much
much more.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.320
Again, that’s revision3.com/subaru.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.459
And in the meantime, let us know in the comments
below - if this latest climate report, is

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.120
something you guys are concerned about.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.440
That’s it for me, but as always - thank
you guys for watching!
