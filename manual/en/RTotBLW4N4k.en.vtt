00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.160
One of the main reasons people paddle in groups
is so that they can support each other on

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.340
the river and help each other if one, one
of them gets into trouble. When you’re rescuing

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.420
another canoeist, there is a number of things
to keep in mind, but the number one thing

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.369
to keep in mind is the priority, who’s most
important and despite what you might think

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.380
initially, the most important person to keep
in mind is yourself. Um, the other canoeist

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.369
is important of course and you want to make
sure you rescue them if you can, but if you’re

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.699
not going to be able to do and keep yourself
above water, then, uh, you need to, you need

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.961
to let it go and let someone do it who can
or let that canoeist do for themselves as

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:40.100
well as they can, uh, until you get to a place
where you can help them. Trying to help somebody

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.610
in a situation where you can’t and where
those, your skill levels aren’t up to it

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.370
can cause more problems and ultimately can
cause much, much great difficultly than staying

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.399
on the sidelines and waiting it out. When
you rescue another canoeist the second priority

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.289
is the other people who are not victims right
now, who are not swimming. You want to make

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.289
sure that they’re okay, so in the case of
a group where you have less experienced paddlers

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:09.189
and more experienced paddlers it’s a good
idea to keep the less experienced paddlers

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.659
in the eddies and safe and not going out and
helping with the rescue unless the rescue

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.179
is in water that’s well within their abilities.
Then the more experienced paddlers can go

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.789
out, deal with the rescue and know that they’re
not going to have two or three other rescues

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:28.569
to perform at the same time. The final priority
is the paddler himself, and the other paddler,

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:33.749
at that point you want to make sure that they’re
okay first. Of course the very, very last

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:38.609
priority of all is the equipment, the boat
and the gear and that doesn’t matter. You

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:41.779
know, even if you’re on a multi-day trip,
you’ve still got to get the person back

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:47.600
before the boat and the gear make any difference
whatsoever. So when you have another paddler

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.359
and he’s in water, maybe difficult to swim
in, there are a couple of options, you can

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.609
get the other paddler on your stern, they
can grab onto your stern grab loop and you

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.289
can uh, help pull them to shore, you can encourage
them to swim and keep them away from your

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.929
boat, it’s important to tell them whether
it’s okay to grab onto your boat or not.

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.170
You certainly don’t want them grabbing onto
your boat in the middle here, where they easily

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.700
flip you, one end or the other is much better.
And if everything is going well you can grip,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.841
you can have the person grab onto your stern
with one hand, with the other hand they can

00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:21.440
hold their boat or their paddle and you can
paddle them on over to shore and that’s

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.060
the idea, that’s the way it works perfectly.
Of course if you have two or three boats to

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.530
help out, one other boat can maybe push their
boat and help bump it over to shore and everything

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.689
works out well. So, work together, make sure
you keep the priorities in mind; yourself,

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:40.810
the other paddlers who are okay, and finally
the swimmer and last of all, the boat and

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:41.189
the gear.
