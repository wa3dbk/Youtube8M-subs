00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.000
Every year thousands of Hoosiers venture onto
the frozen lakes to enjoy winter sports such

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.120
as ice fishing, snowmobiling, cross country
skiing, or hiking.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.150
We want to make sure that everyone returns
home safely.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.539
Here are some tips to keep you safe when venturing
out on the ice.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.220
Before you go out on the ice make sure that
you have a coast guard approved life jacket.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.759
This will not only keep you warm, but also
keep you afloat.

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.400
Make sure that you have some kind of ice rescue
picks.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.270
Make sure that you have warm clothing and
boots, and some kind of ice cleat to keep

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.660
your footing while on the ice.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.100
Know before you go.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.050
If you don't know the thickness of the ice,
don't venture out on to it.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.990
Four inches of good clear ice is recommended
to support the weight of a person.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.760
When you go out on the ice, never venture
out alone, always walk out single file, with

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.760
a buddy.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.850
Make sure that you drill frequent holes to
check ice thickness.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.710
Never venture out onto ice that has moving
or flowing water underneath it and be cautious

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.409
around aerators and geothermal outlets.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.520
Falling through the ice is a life-or-death
emergency.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.729
Remaining calm is the key to rescuing yourself
from the water.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.490
Turn back toward the direction you fell in
- closest to the shore.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.109
Use your ice picks and get a firm grip into
the ice.

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.049
While you pull with your upper body, kick
with your lower body - freeing yourself from

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.299
the water.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.890
Once you are out of the water, do not stand
up immediately.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.630
Pull yourself away from the ice hole until
you get on ice strong enough to support your

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.630
weight.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.890
Hypothermia is a life-threatening emergency
that can set in very rapidly in cold, wet

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.899
conditions.

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.950
So make sure you get out of your wet clothes
immediately.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.499
Have fun and stay safe Indiana, and Know Before
You Go.
