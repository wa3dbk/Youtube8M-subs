00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.320
three decades after a double homicide a
man named jack wendell purcell

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.750
allegedly walked into an iowa police
station and confessed to the crime three

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.059
decades after robber and goldie hunt
bach were found tied up and shot to

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.650
death in their waterloo iowa home were
actually on the air in waterloo iowa

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.140
believe it or not louis no suspects
wherever arrested

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.710
and um... this week one of them named
agenda wendell perspiration uil walked

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.220
into the police station and said

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.679
i basically want to talk to someone
about it

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:35.040
and investigators talked and he
confessed to this murder

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.610
um... he said i will decide whether they
must be he said that he planted as rob

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.750
uh... he planned

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.640
to robin murder robert hunt bach was
eighty five and call the hot pot with

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.150
seventy five at the time

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.520
and he gave details all week and the
person involved in the crime would know

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.130
it was a grizzly homicide involving
blindfold ng in dish towel gagging and a

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.650
number of other things

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.090
imagine you did something like this so
long ago you got away with right which

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.190
by which is no easy task

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.609
you think the guilt would eventually
does get to you

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.399
and really can really make that call
because if you even capable of doing

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.130
this type of premeditated murder are you
really the type of person that would end

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.690
up feeling guilty or you most likely a
psychopath

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.300
yet seems like a strange situation i'd
imagine that someone who does the same

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.570
gets away with a damaging as someone who
does this in the first place

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.580
would never have any evermore server
tilts what do you think of that time

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.420
yet seems pretty hard to believe

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.780
and on the t_v_ catching maybe he became
a born-again christian decide to

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.970
confesses that better maybe he found he
sees it's hard to know really

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.870
now you've been indeed is a number of
crimes you committed petty stuff and it

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.970
would be really be the misdemeanors
really just juvenile stuff

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.680
but after the fact you never felt the
need to go and talk to the police ur

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.470
confessor anything even now ten years
after some of these incidents net

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.020
i didn't kill anyone and i know you
don't do anything close to it i mean

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.070
with the worst really that you've gone
on charged for

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.320
punching someone

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.230
uh...

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.240
uh... a maybe

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.530
exacting a house begging probably eighty
there was an incident actually where i

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.640
think it was cabbage night the night
before halloween or lewis was pulled

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.019
over with several dozen eggs in the car

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.189
and being a police officer ask you what
those are for you just said you were

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.129
making up words yet

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.699
which is completely unbelievable because
everyone knows lewis has dot cereal and

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:25.109
milk it doesn't have almost said that
that that the police i don't have exam

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.799
keypad serenity exactly

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.309
if there is also payback time so didn't
look good

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:32.129
the threat was intended

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.259
