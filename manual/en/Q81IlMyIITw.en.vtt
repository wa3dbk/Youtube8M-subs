00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.200
Alright.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.080
Legato techniques were popularized in the
1980's by Eddie Van Halen.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.490
The basic idea is that you're taking a note
off of the first note you play, you can pick

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.529
a note, and then hammer-on and pull-off and
get a whole flurry of other notes.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.950
Say I'm at the fifth fret.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:38.559
My A natural minor scale is this.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.000
If I ascend I get this.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.500
So, you understand, I'm just ascending and
descending.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:59.199
Now, if I take those first three notes and
instead of picking I hammer-on and pull-off,

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.269
alright, that's the beginning of a legator
pattern.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:16.680
If I continue down the scale 
I don't need to pick the next string because

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.750
my hand is coming and hammering-on.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.800
The hammer-on is the source of the sound.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.150
I can do the same thing on the next string.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.920
Alright.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:43.210
So when it's quick it sounds like that.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.510
Any note I land on I can take that note and
do the same pattern.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:02:01.600
So, here I'm going to do the same pattern
with this B.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.100
A good way to practice these is not necessarily
to start out going across the neck.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.550
Just like we started that lick on one string
and then two strings, try practicing it on

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.100
one string.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:39.330
If I do two strings.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
What if I want to ascend through the scale?

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.110
Ascending is a little trickier, but I can
do it by sliding and picking.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:03:02.600
So, when you ascend you have to pick each
new string.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:14.819
This is pretty advanced stuff.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.860
You might not want to start out with this
if you're new to the guitar.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.390
Make sure you go slow, and try not to do everything
at once.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.830
Try to do one or two strings at a time, and
pace yourself.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.200
Thank you for checking out this lesson on
legato playing.
