00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.920
Jimmy Carter the 39th President of the United
States has become one of the world's most

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.610
prolific and respected humanitarians whose
work through The Carter Center sees him travelling

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.270
the globe fostering peace, fighting disease
and promoting democracy.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:30.060
It was this unwavering belief in peaceful
resolution that cost him his Presidency.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:40.690
Sir, do you feel there were any choices you
would have made differently?

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.549
I think I would have been re-elected easily
if I had been able to rescue our hostages

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:46.340
from the Iranians.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.140
And everybody asks me what would do more,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.500
I would say I would send one more helicopter
because if I had one more helicopter

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.980
we could have brought out not only the 52
hostages,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.050
but also brought out the rescue team,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.050
and when that failed,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.110
then I think that was the main factor that
brought about my failure to be re-elected.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.660
So that's one thing I would change.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.180
I would say 'do something, anything' and he
said and then have them take a hostage out

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.800
one at a time one day and execute them in
front of the world? Y'know he was firm, but

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.250
it was tough. …We knew he would probably
not, probably not, be re-elected, he didn't

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.560
give in. I was proud of him…Peace is very
difficult war is popular in our country.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.640
Even your wife Rosalyn was encouraging you
to take action, was it hard to not take everyone's

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.160
advice around you, even your wife's?

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.910
Yes. well I could've been re-elected if I'd
taken military action against Iran, shown

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.060
that I was strong and resolute and, manly
and so forth.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.670
But, I think if I could have wiped Iran off
the map with the weapons that we had,

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.640
but in the process a lot of innocent people
would have been killed,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.560
probably including the hostages

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.030
and so I stood up against all that

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.280
all that advice,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.379
and then eventually my prayers were answered
and every hostage came home safe and free.

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.650
And so I think I made the right decision in
retrospect, but it was not easy at the time.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.370
I think he was incredibly unfairly judged.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.510
I mean he was ahead of his time when he was
in the White House….

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.920
I think if it hadn't been for the Iran Hostage
situation

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.080
he would have had a second term and I think
most likely would've

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.530
been as well-respected for his time in office
as for his time outside the office.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.750
Do you feel the American people have accepted
that now, that it was the right decision?

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.760
I think increasingly they have as more facts
are known and as people look back on those

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.530
times.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.900
But there's still a strong inclination in
our country to take military action when I

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.130
think it's not necessary.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.959
You left office sir, as you have said, involuntarily,
if you had been re-elected what would you

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.790
have liked to accomplish?

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.230
I don't have any doubt that if I'd had another
term in office I could have implemented very

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.510
firmly the peace agreement that I negotiated
with Israel and its neighbours.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.540
That was never fully implemented.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.570
So now 35, 40 years later we still have Israel
not at peace with its neighbours…

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.060
But my successors were not very interested
in the Mid East peace process, not as deeply

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.210
as I was, and that's one of the things I could
have done differently.
