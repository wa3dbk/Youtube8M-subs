00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.610
over the weekend there was a tragic fire
in brazil at the kiss nightclub in santa

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.769
maria which is a university at city of
about two hundred and sixty thousand

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.370
people now the reason that we're talking
about this i didn't notice at first when

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.109
i was reading the news as they came out
by the updates about the tragic fire

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.730
uh... is that the um... the party where
the fire was held and that the party at

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.080
the nightclub was actually thrown by
several academic departments in the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.730
federal university of santa maria answer
actually dozens and dozens of students

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.769
among the victims of which there were
over two hundred and thirty

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.340
uh... now we have some details on what
happened there inspectors believe the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.480
pic the blaze began as a result of uh...
small pyrotechnic show that the band was

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.989
putting on that unfortunately caught the
phone sound insulating material in the

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.429
uh... the ceiling of the club which
released the putrid hayes they're saying

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:49.980
and that we actually have a quote

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.750
goddess is coming from one of the
investigators on the scene obvious is

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.450
uh... apologize doctor paulo afonso
beltrane says that large amounts of

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.670
toxic smoke quickly filled the room at
least ninety percent died as a result of

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.000
that this fixation that i'm not fire he
said that apparently the people in the

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.570
club were disoriented likely from fifty
bodies in a bathroom apparently i

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.030
thought that that wasn't exit and they
just couldn't see or can you tell where

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.930
they were going on starbucks is
obviously a great tragedy uh... i mean

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.440
these sorts of things don't happen often
i had that were not linked to one of the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.430
news reports about this and they have

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.990
some other historic large of fires

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.410
i don't know exactly how you bounce back
from this is universally

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.920
yet slap in some other details here have
obviously

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.570
as far as the united states do as well
in brazil you have to pay your tab

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.859
before you even sell when everybody was
trying to rush out the door is a lot of

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.590
the bouncers didn't realize

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.270
what was going on didn't realize that
there was a fire inside and so they were

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.250
actually trying to block people from
leaving thinking that they had paid

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.520
their taxes didn't really realize i
think it was really a case of mt

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.780
entities didn't think that at that point
the relax at the fire started i'm an

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.520
alarm john mentioned it was the uh...

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.340
they believe it was the band's
pyrotechnics that started the fire and

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.880
so now the biggest thing some backlash

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.210
and hostile messages on social media and
saying that when they have to pay for

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.580
what happened and so they're kind of a
friend of a retaliation out against the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.799
ban

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.859
i mean who knows what the f that so
they're saying that that one of the

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.840
uh... the members of that actually died
we went back to the end to get his

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.230
accordion which that

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.709
free tragically there

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.399
uh... the rest of the band is alive
because they were obvious to the first

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:27.709
ones to notice the fire now if you're in
a dark possibly smoking nightclub the

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.479
fact that there is additional smoking
might take awhile especially this large

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:34.209
in there's literally thousands of people
i'm but they didn't notice the fire and

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.379
they were able to get out

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.579
i mean you can't necessarily blame them
because apparently they had used the

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:41.939
same pyrotechnics

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.859
without problems another ten years

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.359
is just a combination of their
particular pyrotechnics in the

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.619
particular sound insulating material at
that club

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:51.999
but i have to imagine that

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:56.480
just mentally this is got to be i can't
even imagine how devastating this

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.479
because they know that they did cause it

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.889
and uh... the people in that city

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.439
are not going to be financed akruti al i
mean it's tragic for the band project

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.659
for the univeristy tragic for the city
and i think one interesting thing that

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.169
it brings to mind is at university
student your often in these very crowded

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:16.720
scenarios whether it's a cloud or
concert or university sponsored event

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.800
or something like that and and how do
you really planned for something like

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.560
that i mean you don't like to have to
plan for that you like to think that

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.379
you're next in the gulf fine

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.209
i mean you know maybe that is something
that you should take into mind when you

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.059
enter

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.989
potential like you know any serious
there that could potentially go wrong is

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.169
you know if not the crickets and say you
don't want to live your life paranoid

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:37.809
but

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:40.309
you know you you do need to be aware
that that things can go around

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:43.859
especially when you're in very kind of
places it's hard to get our i was

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.449
airplay over the weekend and after the
play and that we were filing out and it

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.499
was no wasn't even a very big feeder but
it bucharest

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:53.879
forever to get down the stairs that
we're moving uh... un in german and i

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.859
turned to the first i was whether there
was a can you imagine if we needed to

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.919
get out of your question holding back on
your show that fire or if there is a

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.679
shooting or something like that you can
print it out
