BEHIND THE SCENES
#153: HERO'S WELCOME &amp; SUMMER BEACH PARTY

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:15.712
Summer has arrived, so what better way to enjoy it than by heading to the beach.

00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:20.584
Mod Sayln will be here to tell us how we can get involved with this year's summer festivities.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:28.621
But first up celebrations are in order, as next week Gielinor sees the return of V, the Fremennik hero turned god.

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.947
Mod Wilson is here with all the details.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.588
During the new quest, Hero's Welcome, you'll participate in celebration which welcomes V back to Gielinor.

00:00:36.617 --> 00:00:40.895
Following this you'll go on an epic quest where you'll foil the plots and schemes of the Dragonkin.

00:00:40.943 --> 00:00:42.797
This is going to be a very lore heavy quest.

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:48.704
We're going to be introducing a new god and we're going to be allowing you to talk to him about his hopes, his dreams and what he represents.

00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:53.940
We're also going to be delving into the lore of the Dragonkin and showing you what they've been up to in all this time.

00:00:54.014 --> 00:00:58.848
V was a Fremennik seer who discovered the Stone of Jas, touched it and gained a massive boost of power.

00:00:58.887 --> 00:01:05.182
Players will revisit Rellekka. They'll also be able to go with V to an island that hasn't been used since the third age that he knows about.

00:01:05.184 --> 00:01:11.206
They'll also be able to visit the shrine of V and be able to go to many locations used as lairs and bases by the Dragonkin.

00:01:11.214 --> 00:01:15.398
To start the quest you'll need to have completed Lunar Diplomacy as well as mastered Barbarian Skilling.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:20.713
You'll also need 67 Smithing, 60 Divination, 62 Slayer and 67 Mining.

00:01:20.715 --> 00:01:27.375
Once you've got all the requirements to begin this quest, you can start it by speaking to Alfrick the Planner or Freya Lune who will be located by the docks in Rellekka.

00:01:27.377 --> 00:01:30.235
In addition to experience in skills used throughout the quest,

00:01:30.237 --> 00:01:35.561
there's also going to be a repeatable boss fight which will drop one of the most powerful offhand throwing weapons in the game.

00:01:35.563 --> 00:01:41.017
You'll also gain access to spots for mining Bane ore as well as access to more Adamant Dragons.

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:45.037
As a more material reward, you'll also be able to unlock access to a level 75 cape.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.449
Unfortunately I can't go into details of this because that would be a bit of a spoiler.

00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:52.127
The beach event is us bringing summer to RuneScape.

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:58.741
We've turned Lumbridge crater into an awesome beach party where you can take part in loads of beach events and beat an awesome boss.

00:02:00.907 --> 00:02:06.045
So the beach party takes place in one of RuneScape's most iconic locations, which is the Lumbridge crater.

00:02:06.047 --> 00:02:10.555
In fact, Reyna, who is running the beach party, is a survivor from the first world event.

00:02:10.557 --> 00:02:12.790
There's a bunch of activities you can take part in on the beach.

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:17.500
There is sandcastle building, there is strong-arm, there is a coconut-shy,

00:02:17.502 --> 00:02:22.069
and on top of everything, there is a massive crab boss called Clawdia, named by our players,

00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:25.582
and it will come out and terrorize the players every hour on the beach.

00:02:25.584 --> 00:02:31.768
As with the rest of the beach, there aren't any other requirements to fight the boss. Just bring yourself, bring any equipment you have and you'll be able to take part.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.324
Doing events on the beach takes effort and you're going to have to keep cool while you're there.

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:38.806
So whilst you're doing events and killing the boss you'll be able to get ice cream.

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:42.275
This ice cream will reduce your temperature gauge that you have whilst on the beach.

00:02:42.277 --> 00:02:48.159
You'll be able to do this three times every day and reset your time on the beach so you'll be able to make it last even longer.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.398
All the activities on the beach will have a bunch of rewards including the boss and you'll be able to get cosmetics,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.449
pets, emotes, animations, all sorts of overrides.

00:02:57.451 --> 00:03:01.596
And on top of that there are vendors around the beach that you can buy these things for RuneCoins as well.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:09.355
On the beach we've built a stage specifically for us to do J-Mod events so throughout the summer we'll be having loads of different events going on, run by our community team.

00:03:09.357 --> 00:03:12.546
So you should really take part in them and keep an ear out for when they'll be running.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.597
The beach will be available from the 29th of June all the way through to the end of August, so you should really take part as soon as you can.

00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:24.295
Mod Mark is back next week with all of the updates coming to RuneScape in July.
