00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.180
Ah- haha ha ha ha ha.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.620
Aah hah- aheheh--

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.320
DAAAH- Hah- DAAAh- okay ...

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.480
Uuuh...

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.360
Yeah...

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.940
Aw yeah...

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.980
I'm gonna do Mario.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.700
Episode 3's: "Penguins and Bowsers"...

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.180
This is the slide that I was supposed to go down...

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.440
But I didn't...

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.260
And what you gonna do about it- Shortcut! Can you say "butthole"?

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.220
Oh god!

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.260
So, I'm back.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.260
And- uuh.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.700
This isn't gonna work out.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm just letting you all know that, I can't control this guy.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.520
What is he-? No! Ah-aaaaaah.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.940
So close, but yet so far.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.860
But at the same ti- 
Woaaah, baby that's a shortcut right there.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.600
Alright.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.040
Oh my god, I made it.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.840
Aaaah~

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.680
C'mon, you Mario brinkis, c'mon. There we go.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.140
Aw, man. I didn't go past the secret tunnel, though. 
So I gotta get the life-up

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.620
By old-fashioned way, you gotta jump up there yourself.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.660
That's the only way you gonna get it.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.680
Even then you still not gonna get it, 'cause you gonna fall off the thing and then leave and get frustrated.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.060
[imitating star sound effect]
Ba doo-doom. Ba doo-doom. Ba doo--

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.720
Oh- err. C'mon. Hardest part of the game is ...

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.640
... jumping into the star cool.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.640
So I got eight now, we can, uhhh, 
go and kill Bowser over here.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.120
I mean, I hate this guy...

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.340
[sarcastically] Ah, I stepped into his trap. Oh, no.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.720
I don't understand how it's his trap.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.860
'Cause he gives me stars and keys-

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.420
Alright, don't worry guys, I'll make up this ramp. 
You don't gotta worry about that.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.040
Jesus christ!

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.540
Alright, let's just say I got up the ramp.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.540
Extra-life, baby!

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.360
Aw, you know that I'm not gonna 
just walk in there and kill Bowser.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.860
Gotta get the coins. 
'Cause when it comes to Mario I'm a completionist.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.860
Any other game I really don't care, 
even if it has achievements.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.700
I don't give a crap.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.640
But Mario? Completionist, 
'cause Mario is meant to be completed.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.200
And in other games they just kinda throw it in there.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.160
Mario, every single star they put some effort into.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.680
Alright, this is the "jund-est" jump.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.860
Ohh, baby. I know you guys like that.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.800
'Cause I saw that red coin over there.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.860
I had to make two dunder jumps, 
if you know what i'm saying.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.580
Guess I gotta over here and hit the switch, bada-bing.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.940
Let's get it- Jesus christ. Almost died.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.760
Oh back over by these planks- Oh god. Okay...

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.200
Waah- Oh god! Oh my god!

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.860
No game gets your heart racing like Mario 64.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.820
Yeah baby.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.620
[sighing] Alright, one more coin... 
And we can get out of this hell-hole.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.020
Definetively the hardest part of the game so far...

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.200
Oh!

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.140
Although this is nothing on the- 
Rainbow Cruise crap later.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.820
Oh god.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.400
[singing along to soundtrack
Baaaahm-, bah bah bah bah bah baaah.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.840
Nicholas Deary commented, uh: "Good Fun Fact," so, uh-

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.860
I'll give more Fun Facts, like:

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.320
Fun Fact- uuh, Stars! There's 120 of them in the game, but there's only 100 for the tringus~

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.300
Fun Fact.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.740
Fun Fact: Bowser is a gigantic dinosaur.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.780
Ever noticed how fun- I never looked at this..

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.880
When he jumps up, look at this- Look at that! Hahahahh.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.340
HAA HAAH HAH.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.580
AAAAAAAAAAAAARG!

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.420
Notice how I have nine stars, and now I have one key, because I blew up Bowser.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.140
He's definitely gonna be giving me a key.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.660
You mad, Bowser?

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.080
"Grrr! I was a bit careless. This is not as I planned, 
but I still h- Bwa ha ha ha! 
You'll get not more stars from me."

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.620
"I'm not finished with you yet, but here I go, 
I'm turning into a tornado, 
I'm turning into a key and blowing up, here you go."

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.520
[loudly imitating sound effects]
BUH BUBUHDUH DIH DIH BUH DIH
DUHHHHHHH!!

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.700
WOOOOOO!!

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.660
That's what I'm talking about, baby.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.420
Well, you know how it is.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.200
Now you guys are gonna have to tell me, if-

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.800
I don't remember if there's a "100 coins" Star in Bowser's places.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.960
Tell me in the comments.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.700
Or something.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.080
Throw me a fucking bone here, guys.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.840
Trying to get this goddamn penguin now, 
and it's pissing me off.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.480
[penguin crying incessantly]
Waaah. Waaah. Waaah. Waaah.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.060
[crying continues]
Let's go, you piece of shit...

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.360
[crying continues]

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.120
[crying continues]

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.600
Yaaaaaah~!

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.820
Oh, I didn't even get stuck in the snow bank.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.920
There's the big snowman head.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.920
[crying continues]

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:47.280
Alright, this is gonna take keen intellect,
and hardcore gaming skill.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.580
C'mon, baby. Right over, right over Papa Mario.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.260
[crying continues]

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.740
[crying continues]
Fun Fact: This penguin won't SHUT UP.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.960
[crying continues]

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.140
[crying ceases]
There...

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.900
Go on to your mom.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.140
Look, I got your crappy son.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.660
[wolf whistles]

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.940
My work here isn't finished though...

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.300
I told you guys I was a completionist, 
and I'mma complete the job.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.900
[crying renews]
Now let's take this highly identical penguin.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.960
[crying ceases]

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.880
Why don't you just waddle there into the pool, there.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.160
And I'll just take this guy, who was a pain the ass. 
[crying renews] Here we go...

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.480
And I'll just start walking towards the cliff.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.500
[crying ceases]
Fun-Fact: Penguins die when you throw 'em off cliffs.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.320
Let's get outta here, thanks for watching!
