00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.680
My name's Tom Cook, I'm 22,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.640
and I've just completed my final year

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.160
at Bristol Veterinary School
on the course of Veterinary Science.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.400
The programme's split
into pre-clinical,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.600
which is the first three years
based in Bristol,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.720
mostly in the Veterinary Centre here

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.872
at Southwell Street
and with one day a week

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.360
at Langford. There's lots of lectures

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.880
and practicals. There's wet labs

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.720
for anatomy teaching
with lots of specimens

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.400
and a fully comprehensive

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.120
museum of specimens

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.960
that are up to 50 years old

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.720
with all range of species and things

00:00:50.792 --> 00:00:52.472
that I don't even know what they are now!

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.280
There's also access
to big biochemistry labs

00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:01.320
that the rest of the university use.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.600
There's excellent academic backup
in Bristol,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.200
and it's fantastic

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.440
to live in the city as well
for the first three years.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.240
Then, in our final two years,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.720
we move to Langford
to base our studies there,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.520
the School of
Clinical Veterinary Sciences.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.760
We do first-opinion and referral work

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.640
and there's an opportunity

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.040
to have your own cases that
you work through and follow through

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.000
with a clinician.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.680
There's a wide range of things

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.440
you can do on the course,
there's a good opportunity to travel.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.720
I've actually been to New Zealand

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.680
and luckily to Kenya,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.600
where we got involved
with a research project.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.040
We anaesthetised a wild lion

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.160
and took some blood samples
from it, which was unbelievable -

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.440
that we can get to do that
on the course at Bristol.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.320
People live as students in halls,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.880
so you might have one or two vets in
your halls or in your flat or your floor

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.200
and we all come together for teaching.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.560
There's a really good strong ethic
within the Veterinary students.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.560
We've got a great social group.
All the other courses are envious

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.720
of how close we all are together.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.480
I think, coming to the end
of my five years,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.880
I now realise that
there's so much that I've learnt

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.280
that I haven't been taught.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.920
You get taught the basic things -
what bones are in a horse's leg

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.440
and how antibiotics work
and how to anaesthetise a fish

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.200
and then we get
to the end of the time

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.240
and you realise that you're more prepared
than you thought you were

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.320
for first day in practice
or for going into research.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.800
I've really enjoyed my five years

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.160
here at Bristol -
it's so varied and interesting

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.640
and there's so many paths
that it can lead you down.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.640
It's not just learning
how to be a vet,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.360
it's learning how to be a scientist

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.200
and taking you forward

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.040
into many different walks of life.
