00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.580 position:61%
Chief Petty Officer, Jason Walker, USCG
Marine Science Technician:

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.160 position:67%
My name is Chief Jason Walker. I'm with the
U.S. Coast Guard. I'm a marine science

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.800 position:61%
technician by rate.
And my job here was to take care of the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.060 position:70%
operations in Pago Pago Harbor.
We removed all the oil and hazmat, as per the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.800 position:66%
picture, from this area, within this area.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.080 position:67%
Lt. Cmdr. Joe Herrador, United States Coast
Guard: Again we don't know exactly how

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.140 position:77%
many we have but we suspect that there's a
few in there, so it's going to take a few days of

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.690 position:75%
diving evolutions to number one, identify and
send the divers there, and identify the vehicles

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.310 position:72%
and the hazmat that's below the surface of the
water and then develop a plan to try to

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.060 position:72%
recover it.
We've got to stop the oil from bubbling up and

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.530 position:72%
remove the vehicles from under the water.
The further away from the coastline, the floor

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.380 position:80%
bottom sinks even further down, so it makes it
a little tricky to try to dive around these fishing

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.840 position:67%
vessels. These fishing vessels aren't going
away.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.020 position:72%
Shane (Will) Cline: Today we're doing a grid
search for the debris, hazardous material that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.420 position:63%
was washed offshore.
We're fortunate to have some fairly good

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.330 position:69%
visibility 15 to 20 feet. That's a big plus.
Basically what we do is we swim a grid. The

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.860 position:72%
first diver this morning recovered some items
that we found yesterday afternoon and I pretty

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.270 position:59%
much just picked up where he left off.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.470 position:69%
Chief Walker: We had five divers on board
and they went through within the grid system

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.140 position:70%
here, systematically searching and reviewing
each of these grids to make sure that there's

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.750 position:69%
no oil and hazmat on the bottom. We
recovered about five vehicles ranging from a

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.890 position:72%
bus that they use here for local transport all
the way down to a small personal car,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.450
four-door sedan.
