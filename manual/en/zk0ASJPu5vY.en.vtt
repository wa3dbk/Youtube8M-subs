00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:10.710
Hi, I'm Bobby crispy this video is part [of] my guitar lesson series today. I'll show how to play Imagine by John Lennon

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.070
It's all show the verses

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.920
And then I'll show how they're played note for note. This is how I've arranged it for guitar

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.760
So I'll play verse number one first

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.139
Okay for three beats. It's C

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.029
And I'll show that finger-picking at the end of the video first its [see] three beats

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.109
[there's] C major seven for one beat just lift your pointing finger

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.899
And for one measure or four beats [fits] f

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.758
and if you want to throw in the filter, then it's three beats of f

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.769
And [the] little fill is played out the third string second fret

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.430
And run to the third fret fourth and fifth

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:58.260
That's played six times at the beginning then the second verse is play like this

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.809
so for two beats it's f

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.390
two beats to a minor

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.550
two beats it's [D] Minor 7

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.119
And for two beats, [it's] d minor [seven] sea bass

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.939
For beads, it's g the b base like this

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.719
Then four Beats G7 slut right

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.620
Okay, go [over] the end

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.290
you

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.820
Next verse is this I think the bridge yet

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.830
Let's play three times and it's at the end. It's

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.729
Okay, so that's f for two beats

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.640
G for two leads

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.710
C for two beats

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.540
then e 7 4 1 [B]

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.550
then e 7

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.580
and added D at the 2nd string 3rd fret won't be

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.210
so it's

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.290
[let's] played three times

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.290
then it's f

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.139
for two beats G two beats

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.619
and see

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.169
Okay, and the whole thing is played through twice, and that's the song now the finger-picking pattern [I]

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.970
Play it with a [pic] and fingers so [like] this

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:34.439
So play the the notes with your fingers and the baseline top line the pick

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.819
so

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.290
Okay, I hope this lesson has been helpful and thanks for watching
