00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.270
Hi.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.270
I'm the YouTube Deal Guy Matt granite.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.930
Every day I find a different hand-picked deal
none of these are paid products - in my quest

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.570
to save you as much cash as humanly possible.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.930
Every day I find is located right under this
video window and at the end of this video,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.860
I'll show you how to subscribe and get signed
up for my big deals - if you are new.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.290
If you are not new and you're a subscriber,
welcome back, I owe you my career.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.590
Today's surveillance savings are absolutely
phenomenal and I'm sure you don't need some

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.500
other idiot like me on YouTube to tell you
why spotlighting some of the darker areas

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.210
of your property are a great way to cut down
on theft and intrusion but before we get to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.410
this, I just want to mention the last deal
I had - still sort of in stock are these 66%

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.900
off 4 in 1 Bluetooth speakers that charge
your phone, have an FM radio, hands-free and

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.340
a bunch of other features.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.880
I'll show you how to get one of these in a
moment.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.040
This is a huge deal drop.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.399
This deal though has me pretty excited.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.399
Let me tell you why.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.220
The GE Motion Tracking LED security system
is widely considered to be the brightest in

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.660
its class.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.110
Oh wow.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.039
That's bright and it turns on its own.

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.819
Awesome.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.610
How are your eyes?

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.279
I can't see.

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:29.609
Front sensors detect motion up to 40 feet
away with a 240 degree field of view and 5

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:30.609
year warranty.

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:38.869
Look at how the lights did in these tests
lighting up someone almost 30 feet away from

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.490
a home.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.130
The lights which I found today for 66 percent
off are under 50 bucks down from 150.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:54.520
Theyâ€™re water proof and weather proof.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.259
They're never this cheap under $50!

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:04.099
The system has two adjustable motion sensors,
so you can detect motion on different areas

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.329
of your property.

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.729
One pointing one way, one pointing another
way, so that's significant.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.080
There are also 4 LED's which is notable because
most systems usually just have one.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.410
A big point of what makes this so great.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.470
I did see some early not so fantastic reviews
of an earlier version of this system.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.680
I tested four different ones from this batch.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.970
All perform great.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.260
They come with a remote control which is a
great feature and these bulbs are collectively

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.530
the equivalent of a 75 watt LED halogen bulb
so that's awesome.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.060
If you want to grab this, it won't be around
long, the link right under this video window.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.060
If you like what you saw, you like this channel
or the deal, please feel free to give me a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.950
thumbs up, I don't know why I need to keep
showing you the thumbs up - as though you

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.260
need to see it to understand what I'm saying,
I'm sorry about that.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.600
But that's okay, it's very early in the morning
some times when we tape these.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:05.960
