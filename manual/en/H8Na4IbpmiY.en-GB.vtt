00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.619
When the 
Vauxhall ADAM was released in 2012 its customisable
personality thrust it into the limelight.

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.949
But with numerous manufacturers following
in suit with highly customisable derivatives,

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.300
the ADAM needed something new to put it back
on the map. Enter the ADAM ROCKS AIR.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.259
Taking the million-plus combinations of the
standard model and throwing in some plastic

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.150
cladding, a raised suspension and a convertible
roof, the ADAM ROCKS AIR offers more of a

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.449
chunky off-roading vibe. Its folding fabric
roof also brings it in line with its Citroen

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:32.410
C1 Airscape, Fiat 500C and MINI Convertible
competition.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:40.690
Aside to offering something new, the ADAM
ROCKS AIR also allows Vauxhall to rectify

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.230
some of the things that were a little lacklustre
on the standard car, like its engine range.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.199
The new 113bhp 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol
is the clear highlight in the ADAM ROCKS AIR

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.719
when it comes to performance.
Although diminutive, the 1.0-litre is surprisingly

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.690
lively and is good for a zero to 62mph sprint
of just 9.9 seconds, thanks to its turbocharger.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.079
This three-cylinder is definitely one of the
best on the market and comes matched to a

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.130
new, slick six-speed manual gearbox. You won’t
have to work the gearbox much anyway, as there

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.990
is plenty of power to tackle overtaking manoeuvres.
Comparable engines include Ford’s 123bhp

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.150
1.0-litre EcoBoost in the Fiesta, achieving
the same benchmark sprint in 9.4 seconds.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.979
Other engines in the range include a rather
drab 69bhp 1.2-litre petrol and an 86bhp 1.4-litre

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.530
petrol unit.
Although only a slight tweak, the 15mm raised

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.280
suspension in the ADAM ROCKS AIR is capable
of handling speed bumps and pot holes a little

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.740
better than the standard model.
The steering remains incredibly light and

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:40.280
its lack of feedback will limit how much fun
you can have on winding roads. It is great

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.540
however when it comes to navigating city streets
as the light steering will help with difficult

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.560
manoeuvres. There is even a selectable City
Mode which makes the steering even lighter.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.409
But when it comes to fun factor, there are
more engaging rivals.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:51.460
Although the steering is lacklustre on winding
roads, body roll is minimal in the corners

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.340
and there is plenty of grip.
With the addition of the convertible roof,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.860
which can be folded down in just seven seconds
at speeds of up to 80mph, road noise intrusion

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.320
is more prominent than the hard top model,
but not so much to annoy you or your passengers.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.969
The interior comes fitted with a customisable
dashboard inlay and an array of neat styling

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.399
touches, like gloss highlights and colour
inlays on the centre console.

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.980
There is only one trim available, but it comes
well-equipped with everything from DAB radio

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.720
to Bluetooth and air-con to a leather-wrapped
steering wheel.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.690
Optional extras will of course be a big part
of the ADAM’s interior and an upgraded sound

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.840
system, voice activated intelliLink system
and array of dashboard colours are available.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.959
You can also choose from a wide range of mirror
caps, exterior paint jobs and body decals.

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.989
For those feeling patriotic, you can even
have two Union Flag badges slapped on the

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.450
sides.
Although most small city cars and superminis

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.019
struggle with rear passenger and boot space,
the ADAM is particularly poor. You will be

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.840
lucky if you can get comfy when it comes to
head and leg room even if you are sat in the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.120
back on your own.
In terms of boot space, the ADAM offers 170

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.390
litres, that is smaller than the boots of
the Fiat 500C and Citroen DS3 Cabrio. Its

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.480
high loading level is a nuisance as well.
Unfortunately the three-cylinder petrol on-board

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.379
isn’t as efficient as some of its sub 100g
rivals, emitting 119g/km of CO2. It can return

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:00.659
a reasonable 50mpg though.
With its chic edge and convertible roof comes

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:06.459
a slight premium in price tag as the ADAM
ROCKS AIR cost almost £5,000 more than something

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.040
like the Ford Fiesta, and around £1,000 more
than the Fiat 500C. It is also around £3,000

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.140
more than the standard ADAM.
Also, if you overindulge when it comes to

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.930
added extras you are certainly going to feel
a hole in your bank account, so don’t get

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.890
too carried away.
Vauxhall has certainly given the ADAM new

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.019
appeal and appropriate arsenal when it comes
to competing against fashionable, small car

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:27.099
convertibles like the Fiat 500C and MINI Convertible.
It also maintains its distinctive customisable

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.500
personality, which is important as the car
prides itself on it so much. Although its

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.200
bespoke look may hurt you when it comes to
selling it on if you are particularly daring.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.720
The addition of a 1.0-litre three-cylinder
is also a big deal and will appeal to younger

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.159
drivers who are after low emissions but also
something with a bit of oomph.

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.950
A convertible version of Vauxhall’s highly
customisable ADAM city car, rivalling chic

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.049
models like the Fiat 500C and MINI Convertible.
The Vauxhall ADAM, or Opel ADAM, takes its

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.970
name from the company’s founder, Adam Opel.
Pros, Stylish, Great 1.0-litre petrol, Improved

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.090
ride
Cons, Options are pricey, Steering lacks feedback,

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.139
Residuals can be tricky
