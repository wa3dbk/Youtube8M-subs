00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:13.320
Now we are going to thin this part of the
clay. I'm going to make like a, clothing.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.980
Have to thin this a lot. And this is going
to have to also to add, an extra strength

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:34.680
to the, to the structure of this figurine,
that I didn't make an armature, I just tried

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:43.239
to make it easy for me and easy for you too.
Because armature is a pain in the butt later,

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:50.420
because you have to take it off before it
dries. And then probably, there is many chances

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.281
that you or me, we break the figurine, taking
the structure off. Let's see, how this is

00:00:57.281 --> 00:01:46.350
going to go. So
we put this in here.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:02:19.430
This is going to be the feet that we're going
to finish later. Okay, we'll add another piece.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:52.950
Now we're going to adjust this piece of robe.
Okay.
