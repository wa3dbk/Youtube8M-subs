00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:09.850
The high－level talks between two Koreas
are underway at the truce village of Panmunjeom.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.880
Despite this， the South Korean military
continues to be on high－alert in case of

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.440
any provocations.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.160
For more details we connect live to Connie
Kim at the Ministry of National Defense in

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.160
Seoul.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.490
Connie， are there any signs of military
tensions easing on the border？

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.730
Daniel， unfortunately no.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.660
Military tensions remain at the highest level
although high－level inter－Korean talks

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.100
are underway.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.050
Seoul′s defense ministry says the number
of North Korean soldiers in the front－lines

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.370
ready for combat has doubled in two days.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.870
In addition， 50 North Korean submarines，
about 70－percent of its fleet， have left

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.780
base and remain undetected by South Korea′s
radar system.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.160
Seoul′s defense ministry says the rate of
N. Korean submarines vanishing from radar

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.649
is the highest since the Korean War broke
out，.. and may be an attempt to gain the

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.369
upper hand during the high level talks or
preparation for another provocation.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.860
Earlier reports say that military officials
in Seoul are fully aware of North Korea′s

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.860
combat readiness.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.970
Officials say heavy－duty artillery deployed
inside the demilitarized zone on Saturday

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.320
shows that Pyongyang is ready to fire at any
time.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.830
So how exactly is the South Korean military
preparing for any possible provocations from

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.210
North Korea？

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.259
South Korea is on alert for any possible provocations
from North Korea.... especially as it′s

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.040
propaganda campaign continues with all 11
loudspeakers.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.770
South Korean and the U.S. military remain
on the second highest level of their five－level

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.710
WATCHCON threat alert system.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.420
WATCHCON level 2 is issued in the case of
imminent threat from the North.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.500
The allies are utilizing their full arsenal
of reconnaissance satellites， planes and

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:17.640
other military assets.
