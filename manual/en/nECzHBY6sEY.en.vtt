00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.660
Castling is another thing that you do need
to know about in chess and indeed it is very

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:15.059
important to know it and it does occur in
almost every game and castling is basically

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:24.369
moving the king in one move and this is done
in one move, the king is moved in two squares

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:35.020
and the rook is also moved two squares. That
represents one move and that is castling.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.580
Castling can be done either on the king's
side as I just demonstrated. It can also be

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.790
done on the queen's side although it is done
less often on that side. Queen's side castling

00:00:48.790 --> 00:01:03.641
again the king moves two squares and the rook
in this instance moves three squares. That

00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:11.070
is an example of queen's side castling. The
thing where people get confused is that they

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.580
tend to, with queen's side castling, remember
the king starts one square further away, they

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.460
tend to move the king to here, that is incorrect,
the king always is in all castling moves two

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.860
squares. In this instance the rook does move
the three squares. There are certain rules

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.190
about when and where you cannot castle and
basically they are these. You cannot castle

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.631
if you are in check so let's put a black queen
there, the white king is in check and he cannot

00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:52.060
castle. Similarly you cannot castle into check
so let's have the white queen here this time

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:00.670
and again white cannot castle because he would
be castling into check. You also cannot castle

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:09.590
through check. Castling through check would
be this because the white king actually crossed

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.890
the square controlled by the black queen where
he would have been checked and therefore he

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.340
cannot play, he cannot castle. The other move,
the other requirements are that the king must

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.620
not have been moved prior to castling. If
you have moved and you come back to the square

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.900
it is no good, you can't castle nor can you
castle if you have for any reason moved this

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.730
castle, this rook, even if you've gone back
to that square but of course you could do

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.760
this and let me quickly summate with this.
If you had this situation and for whatever

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.510
reason you had moved this rook at some point
but you have not moved your king and you are

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.760
not breaking any of the other rules, you could
still castle on the queen's side.
