Hello, my name is Melissa and on behalf of
Expert Village today I am going to teach you

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.839
how to make the best ever banana muffins.
Now in this clip we're ready to prepare our

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.999
batter for baking. So we've got to put that
batter into our muffin cups. So what I like

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.990
to do, as I mentioned in an earlier clip,
I don't really like to grease my muffin tins

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.390
so I like to use these little baking cups.
So you just want to fill these all up and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.599
you're ready to go. Now what I like to do
of course is when I'm mixing I use a wooden

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.430
spoon, but when I fill my muffin cups I don't
use a wooden spoon I use a metal spoon, a

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.149
big tablespoon. So you don't want to lose
any of the batter at all so what I always

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.309
do is just get as much of the batter off of
the wooden spoon as possible. And then you

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.190
want to make sure that when you're putting
the batter into your muffin cups you want

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.680
a good consistency. So you want to get a nice
dozen muffins, they are all similar in size.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.219
So what I tend to do with the tablespoon is
take a great big tablespoon, big as I can

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.290
without it falling off and put it into the
tin. I usually find two large scoops like

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.680
that should do it and should give you enough
if your bananas were large enough. And you'll

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.650
find that you can do this quite rapidly so
I always start of with two large tablespoons

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.290
of batter to put into the muffin cups. And
then if you have anything left after that

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.150
that's when you can kind of top some off because
maybe your tablespoons were not always exactly

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.070
the same. So start off with that and then
what I also do, so that you don't waste any

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.710
of the batter, get yourself a scoop in here
and you want to just get everything out that

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.020
you possibly can so there is no waste in the
bowl. Another good thing to keep in mind is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.390
that when you are doing this, if this is your
first batch of muffins and maybe you are making

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.390
a couple of dozen, go preheat your oven right
now to 375 so it's ready to go and you're

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.810
ready to put these in the oven. Then what
we're going to do is put these in the oven

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.470
for twenty minutes. You want to make sure
that the tops are nicely browned and in our

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.200
next step we'll show you the finished product.
