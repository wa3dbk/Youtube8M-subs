Hi, this is Laura Turner, and today we're
going to talk about how to write an interesting

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.230
story. Now there are many things I could tell
you about this but I just want to hit a few

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.079
bullet points with this one today. In order
to write an interesting story you have to

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:18.641
have all the components of a great story.
You first have to have interesting characters.

00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:24.390
And in order to make your characters interesting
they must be as specific as possible. You

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.039
could even go so far as to write a detailed
back story of your characters in order to

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.660
make them specific and real to yourself. For
example answering questions about their past

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.489
and things that aren't in the story itself
as your back story. Also in order to make

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.820
characters interesting they also have to have
a specific drive. They have to want something

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.570
and they have to sort of stand up to whatever
obstacle you put in front of them. So make

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.530
sure your characters are strong-willed characters
and characters who are dynamic rather than

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:04.340
just static and sort of reactive. Okay. Second,
you should contain an interesting plot in

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.250
your story. Stories needs to be entertaining,
which means that they need to string us along

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.610
and make us want to know more about what's
going to happen. So you need to make it interesting,

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.680
as far as the plot goes. And a very good way
to do this is to hook us into the story. If

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.150
you're writing a longer novel, you can have
hooks at the ends of your chapters, so for

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:33.659
example, if you think of a hook as a commercial
break on television, you know, some big information

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.190
is revealed at the end of your chapter. And
you're waiting until the next chapter to see

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.329
how it pays off. Maybe even a few pages into
the next chapter to see how it pays off. So

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.170
hook your audience into needing to read until
the next chapter to find out what happens

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.270
to the characters. And also, your plot is
going to stem out of your characters in this

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.560
regard because you're going to want to know
more about the plot because you care about

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.350
the characters. Okay. Next, create an interesting
world or a very specific world. If you're

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.850
writing fantasy you can make your own world
and its own rules, so make sure that the world

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.220
that you're creating is something that is
interesting, something that we want to see

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.400
and to partake in. Next you can actually incorporate
an interesting writing style or a different

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:30.310
writing style, for example, William Faulkner
wrote without punctuation or capitalization

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.190
many times in his novels which made it an
interesting style, interesting to read because

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.050
all the sentences run together but also interesting
to look at and interesting as far as how the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.900
sentences all flowed together. Okay. And then
finally create an interesting theme or symbolism

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.690
in your story. What does the story really
mean? What is the story saying about society?

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:01.280
What are you trying to tell your audience
or your readers by telling them this story?

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.320
And good luck with your interesting story.
