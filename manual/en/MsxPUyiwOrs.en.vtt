00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:03.010
Hello, I’m ROBwithaB

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.839
and this is 101 Ways to Make
Fire.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:07.430
Last time

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.109
we spoke about the properties of wood, the
physical properties that make it suitable

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:13.789
for making friction fires.

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.819
I also showed you

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:17.949
my hand crank drill

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:24.949
and indulged in some gratuitous sexual innuendo with my lady friend Roberta.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.050
(Roberta) Ooooh…

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.409
(Roberta) That’s a big one!

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.030
Today we’re going to find out which woods to
use.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.810
In south Africa there are more than a thousand
species of indigenous trees.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.149
About four hundred

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.870
just in the area where I live

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.179
and that's excluding exotic trees,

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:46.300
garden shrubs,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.760
all of that.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.010
Statistically you’re probably from a completely
different part of the world.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.219
So instead of just

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.460
recommending a whole list of species that
are going to work,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.030
which you’re probably not going to be able to
find in your neck of the woods

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.360
I'm going to talk about the general properties
that you looking for

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.670
in a timber,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.910
which will make it suitable for lighting a friction 
fire.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.740
This...

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.830
is a piece of Pinus Patula.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.360
Yes, I said Pinus. That’s Latin for pine.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.630
Specifically, Mexican Weeping Pine,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.880
which is commonly planted commercially here in south
Africa.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.940
This is an example of something that is NOT going
to work. It is a resinous timber;

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.470
the resin acts as a lubricant,

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.860
and instead of forming an ember the wood
gets polished,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.510
and buffed up and

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.570
it just doesn't work.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.660
It also has an obvious grain which I hope you
can see there.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.340
Generally,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.270
that's not what you want.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.510
You’re looking for wood with a consistent texture.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.020
For the same reason you want to avoid knots
in your wood.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.030
Uhhh... this pine is very knotty

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.120
It is a knotty knotty wood.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.830
What you are looking for is wood that is light,

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.390
strong and fibrous.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.660
This usually comes from a fast growing
plant,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.869
often something growing in disturbed areas

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.319
with a high water table.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.209
Many of these will be primary or secondary
vegetation,

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.939
often called weeds.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:18.869
Okay!!!

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:25.239
Let’s go find some wood!

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.729
Wrong way, it’s that way...

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:35.150
(“Charge of the light Brigade” type music) 
 
0:02:35.150,0:02:39.849
Okay... behind me is an old gravel pit where
they took out fill material to build the road.

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.229
That was probably forty years ago - before my
time

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.549
and we've been

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.399
trying to rehabilitate it in the meantime

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.420
but it's still very much disturbed,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.749
with a lot of alien invasive vegetation,

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:54.279
which is a bad thing,

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:55.749
but today

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:57.869
it makes my job much easier

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.259
because that right there... is what I'm looking
for:

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.249
something called bug weed,

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.399
or colloquially, Wild Tobacco.

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:09.200
I’m going to head down into the donga over here and try
to find some dead wood. 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.400
These things often get killed by passing
veld fires.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.379
Oooh! Slippery!

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:21.900
Ouch...Ooh...Ouch!

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.799
Okay...this is a bad idea!

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.659
All in the name of science.

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.219
Balancing...But I’m about to fall off.

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:32.529
Ooh...

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:34.429
Slippery, when wet!

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:39.650
Remind me whose stupid idea this was.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.289
Aaarghh!

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:48.289
Bloody hell!

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:56.869
Eat your heart out, Bear Grylls.

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.249
(Bird in the background) Purple Crested Loerie

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:02.889
and while I’m here I want to show you something else:

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.479
bracket fungus

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.689
otherwise known as tinder fungus.

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.189
Maybe not THE tinder fungus,

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.099
but this is probably going to work instead
of char cloth,

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.269
so we’re taking that with us.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.299
Home sweet home!

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.940
CHEERS!

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.719
It was a good day’s hunting,

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:24.629
To the victor the spoils!
