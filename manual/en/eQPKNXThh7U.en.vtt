00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.170
Researchers have discovered a way to eliminate
cavity causing bacteria in candy by covering

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.510
it in more bacteria.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.520
And in order to prove that chemical signals
can transfer messages - York University researchers

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.560
used vodka to send the world's first chemical
text message.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.540
Vsauce, Kevin here.... this is Mind Blow.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.960
This Swiss bank safe full of money is available
to be purchased and then moved and rebuilt

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.740
anywhere in the world.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.310
It's the original bank safe from the Schweizer
Volksbank built in the 1912.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:42.079
There are 1619 deposit boxes with original
keys and 8 million pieces of Swiss 5 cent

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.690
coins which is 15 tons of liquid money.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.880
A 75 year old French man was given a revolutionary
heart transplant using a new artificial heart.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.262
The Carmat artificial heart is expected to
operate for as long as five years and hopes

00:00:55.262 --> 00:01:00.460
to give the patient the ability to live a
normal life until a real heart can be donated.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.809
Unlike artificial hearts used in the past
it was developed to fully replicate the self-regulated

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.200
contractions of a real heart by using an intricate
system of sensors and microprocessors that

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.450
monitors the body's internal changes and alters
the blood flow accordingly.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.990
Brothers Simon and Chris Parke are launching
their underwater jet pack.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.600
The arm worn propulsion system uses digital
motors and wireless controls to operate.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.359
Giving people a new way to explore underwater.

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:33.320
POE is an interactive urinal concept that
measures your pee... so yeah.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.719
MetaPro is an augmented reality headset designed
to give you 15 times the screen area of google

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.770
glass in a pair of aviator glasses.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.319
It mirrors devices such as smart phones and
laptops so users have them on the go at the

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:47.889
touch of a hologram.

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:51.759
For now there will be a cord attached to a
small computer you can fit in your pocket

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.399
and they're ready for pre order at $3,000
and plan to ship in July 2014.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.759
The Temperperfect Mug is a smart mug that
allows the user to drink hot beverages at

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.030
the perfect temperature all of the time.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.389
When the liquid inside is too hot the wall
of the mug takes out the excess heat and then

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:12.660
slowly releases it back into the liquid as
it cools keeping it at the ideal drinking

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.660
temperature.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.310
Check out their kickstarter for more.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.280
Engineers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
have created a way to turn algae into bio

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.000
crude oil in less than 60 minutes.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.120
&nbsp;Wet algae is pumped into the front end of
a chemical reactor where the oil is produced

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.280
in under an hour.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.120
The only byproducts are water and material
containing phosphorus, which can then be recycled

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.760
to grow more algae.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.370
After production the oil can be converted
to be used as aviation fuel, gasoline, and

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.370
diesel fuel.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.540
The SCHAFT robot is the winner of the &nbsp;DARPA
robotics Challenge of 2013.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.850
They were given eight tasks to demonstrate
mobility, dexterity, manipulation, perception,

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.460
and operator control and they were created
to simulate acts needed in a natural disaster.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.480
These include operating a vehicle, navigating
difficult terrain, climbing a ladder, clearing

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.350
debris, door manipulation, removing an object
from a wall, manipulating valves, and operating

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.960
a hose.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.680
Researchers have developed a 3D modeling system
for babies with congenital heart conditions.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.240
Since babies are unable to be put into conventional
3D scanners like MRI's doctors have relied

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.600
on echo imaging.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.819
But now within five minutes they're able to
create a 3D image they're able to share and

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.930
use to explain to parents and other health
workers.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.319
Finally "Pleiades" by Japan's Enra combines
projected light, animation choreography and

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.870
music...

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:51.470
I'm going to leave you with an autonomous
robotic dragonfly.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:29.020
And as always - thanks for watching.
