Hi you guys, it's Laura here.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.290
Okay, the other day I showed you how to make
your own raw almond milk with almonds that

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.379
you soak, right and you saw how easy that
was.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.540
That was pretty easy, and it was really really
tasty.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.280
Well today I'm going to show you an even easier
way than that if there could possibly be,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.360
to make your own raw almond milk.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.092
It's called the cheaters way, but it's not
really cheating it's still delicious and its

00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:21.092
so good for you.

00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:22.510
So this is how you do it.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.679
So here's two cups of water.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.170
Then you take raw almond butter.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.890
Just raw almond butter that you can buy from
the store.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.890
This is from Trader Joe's.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.290
You can also buy it from the health food store.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.760
Put in two tablespoons of raw almond butter.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.010
Just like that....could it be any simpler.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.320
You can actually do this in such a pinch.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.860
Always have raw almond butter in your fridge
in case you have to make some almond milk

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.329
on the fly.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.980
Okay and then a little pinch of salt if you
want it.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.629
You don't have to add, just like one turn
of the Himalayan pink salt.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.930
And then two scoops of Stevia if you want
it a little sweeter.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.760
I usually measure one scoop of Stevia per
cup, whether I'm having tea or whatever it

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.970
is, usually one scoop will sweeten it good.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:14.970
That's it!

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.970
Could it be any simpler????

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.120
Put it in your blender or Vitamix and just
take it for a spin!

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.320
So I let that go for about 30 seconds.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.320
That was it.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.460
And there you have it.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.780
Raw almond milk.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.780
It's so good.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.690
You don't have to do any straining or any
draining.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.710
Just do that and you'll be amazed at how good
this is.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.320
It's a little bit creamier, and a little bit
thicker than when you strain it.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.320
It's soooooo good!!!!

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.560
You can play around with the ratios too if
you want to make it a little thinner you could

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.790
add a little more water, if you want it a
little less sweeter, you could add a little

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.890
less sweetener to it.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.530
Just play around with it, you could also add
honey to it if you want, use a little bit

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.740
of honey instead of the Stevia.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.340
So give it a try and let me know what you
think!
