00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.970
Hello! Today we are going to show you how
to break down a whole steamed snow crab and

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:14.159
these are also referred to as a opilios and
the snow crab is just a real nice delicacy

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:20.700
and if you are in an area that can get them
whole, they are a lot of fun to decorate plates

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.179
with and things of that nature and make center
pieces out of. So we've got a nice specimen

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:30.310
here. This being the under side. You get a
little bit better look at what you are usually

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.050
served in restaurants and what usually happens
is you are just given sections and they are

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.699
broken off here and here on each side of the
under flap there. These legs can be broken

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:51.690
with your hands if you like. I've got some
lobster shears here. They got stubby blades

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.281
and they are not real broad but they are firm
enough that you can use them to get in and

00:00:57.281 --> 00:01:04.089
around these guys. They are sturdy enough
to get through that shell quite efficiently.

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.160
What I usually try to do first is come around
each side of the flap on the underneath side

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:21.050
from the back end here and cut apart without
going too deeply similar to the cuts that

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:36.790
you seen in grocery stores and restaurants.
So we've made two cuts going this direction.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:48.070
We'll separate this with our fingers, take
off the under flap there. I am going to just

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.880
kindly gently break those a little bit to
get them separated. As you can see they are

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.350
coming apart pretty easily. That is always
a good sign that the crab itself has been

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.450
steamed fully and chilled down as quickly
as it needs to be when it separates real nice

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:14.430
and easy like that. So there is one section
there. There you go. There's right and left

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.430
half and then here's the under side as well.
Now along with the head and the body we could

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.329
actually boil this again inside a seafood
stock with shrimp shells and things of that

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.041
nature and adds a real nice flavor to the
seafood stock.
