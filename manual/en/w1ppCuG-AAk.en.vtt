00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.010
You're all done.  That wasn't so bad, was it?

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.010
A lot of good men here tonight.  Yes sir.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.010
Don't assume they like anyone better than you.  Don't assume anything.  Appearances can be deceiving.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.010
Let's get together for a drink sometime, catch up.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.010
Ok.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.010
Christine, what is it?  You start off ok, and then you freak out.  

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:11.010
What's going on?  And why are you even here?  You were always a boy magnet.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.010
I was a boy magnet, wasn't I?
Yes.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.010
Yes, can I help you?
Uh.
Oh, of course, sorry.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.010
Hey, you know, I—I—I just, I didn't want to leave without letting you know how much I really enjoyed spending time with you.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:45.010
You know, you've just, you have this thing, you know, it's like a quality, you know, um, a human quality, it's an openness.  It's really, it's lovely.  

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.010
And, I mean it, you're a decent person.  You can't fake that.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.010
What?  What is it?

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.010
Uh, nothing, I just, start laughing when I get nervous, so...

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.010
So, so, so I, I, I make you nervous? That, I like that, that's good

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:18.010
No, please don't, don't stop smiling, I mean your smile is pure gold.  Hey, what're you doing this weekend?  Maybe, um, if you have some time, we can...

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.010
I'm, I'm sorry, did I, did I say something? I—
Christine?

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.010
Are you ok, what's going on?

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.010
Actually we're uh, we're in the middle of a conversation if you don't mind.  

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.010
It's a hell of a conversation that has—
It's not his fault, it's not his fault.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.010
I—I—I—I
I'm not crying, I was fine.
Is there a problem?

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.010
Yeah, this guy's a problem, ok?
Guys, stop, I just needed a moment, ok?
Really?

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:52.010
Sorry, he's like a gnat.  Look, I, I was just trying to tell you that I—I don't know I feel like I can't even talk to you, I feel like I'm like a thirteen year old kid, you know?

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.010
Wow, you smell really, you smell really good, you know, just like—

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.010
Oh, too close.
You're right, sorry, that was, you're right.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.010
Um, look, why don't you give me your number, and I'll call you?

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.010
Yeah, that's probably a better idea, over the phone.  

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.010
Ok.  That's—it's—yeah.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.010
Hey, you ok?  What a freak, huh?  Can we talk, for a minute?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:43.010
You know, I felt a real connection to you, you know?  You're distinctly unique, positive, genuine—ok, I'm going down in flames here.  

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:51.010
Um, look, I, uh, I came here expecting nothing, not a thing and luck has played a cruel joke on me, because you're here.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:04:02.010
Look, I don't believe the stars aligning and we're meant to be, can we just flow, let things be, maybe keep the doors open?  Christine?

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:10.010
Christine, your names already yours only, you know?  Christine.  If there's another woman names Christine she better start thinking about—

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.010
I think that I should probably just get going.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.010
Are you all right?
Oh, I just—

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.010
Sweetie, I think you're hyperventilating.  It's ok.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.010
Hey, listen, just breathe.  Just breathe, sweet thing, calm down.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.010
Get out of the way, are you ok?
Hey!
What'd you do to her?

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.010
Let her—
Did he threaten you?
Leave some room. 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.010
Did you threaten her?  What's wrong with you?
All right, step back please.
What kind of asshole are you?

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.010
You really need to—keep your hands off me.
What?
I'm not—one last time.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.010
What do you want to do?
Fine.
Bring it.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.010
COM's, yeah, back it up, back it up.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:05:02.010
Christine.  Hi.  Um, I haven't been able to stop thinking about you.  Not in like a creepy way, just I don't know, you left an impression.  

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.010
Maybe we could—I guess that's a no.
