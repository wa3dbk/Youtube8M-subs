00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.189
Hello everyone. So the other day we took a look at Battery Saver and a fair few

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.279
people also asked me to have a look at Juice Defender.

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.589
There seems to be a split in the community as to which is the best. I think

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.769
personally both apps are approaching the problem slightly differently.

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.940
With Battery Saver what it's doing is using the deep sleep mode within the phone to effectively turn off

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.129
the vast majority of the phone's power using features

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.780
for a set period of time. then it wakes up then it does its actions and then goes back to sleep again

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.890
With Juice Defender, things are a little bit more granular than that.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.660
What you can actually do, it's not about deep sleep so much as disabling particular features

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.790
so if you're in custom

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.740
and you go into settings you can

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.490
enable or disable the mobile data

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.530
the wifi

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.379
various options for the wifi, how it will actually operate,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.010
how it will actually operate

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.340
wifi is preferred or auto disabled. 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.630
Your location settings, so is it going to use the GPS? When to schedule these various features for

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.130
and how long it will do those options for as well.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.340
A lot of this does feel quite similar
to deep sleep but it doesn't seem to be

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.189
completely across the entire device, it's only

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.869
dealing with things like your location and your wifi

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.110
and mobile data

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.180
which may be much more useful to
people. Obviously if you've got no mobile

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.280
data and no wifi no location, you're practically in
deep sleep anyway

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.530
but this gives  quite a nice amount of granular control over it which are I quite like.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.700
You also have a night mode as well so that obviously at night it just turns this

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.110
stuff off. Really useful.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.759
Apps configurations as well so you can actually set the priority on particular apps by the looks of it so

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.690
if you want an app to be able to wake up

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.210
then you can.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.790
I've been playing with the app for about 24 hours and

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.810
yesterday I certainly found that

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.719
the battery life was good. I wasn't using the device for a huge amount of different things

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.099
so it was more kind of

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.769
just general kind of running the device sitting and sleeping most of the time I'd have thought

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.140
 using these various controls and yes, I would say I did feel like I was getting

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.249
more battery life for

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:19.779
my time as it were.

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:24.589
Hard to put an exact amount on it, I'm going to have to do a bit more testing but certainly

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:25.439
a good app.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.029
I think both these apps are really approaching the issue of saving battery in

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:32.299
slightly different ways.

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.799
Which one is better? I would say use
both and see which one works for you

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.719
and then stick with that one. Obviously, install one,

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:40.929
use it, test it

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:44.849
see what kind of battery life you get and whether  that fits in with your routine and the way you  

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:45.869
actually use your device.

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:49.879
If not try the other one. One of them is
going to be perfect for you.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.230
I'm personally, just because of the way I use my
device. I'm leaning towards Battery Saver.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.700
For me I think that's the better
overall kind approach to dealing with this.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.930
Also with Juice Defender, they
do seem to want to charge you for

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.390
a pro version, although I think there's actually three or four different versions, quickly

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.949
compare features.

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.039
Yes three different versions, an ultimate a plus and a free. 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.209
We're looking at the free version here by the
way so within the plus version there's quite a few

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.079
more options but obviously the ultimate one is the one that gets

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.650
you everything including Bluetooth and GPS control, cpu frequencies etcetera.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.489
For the ultimate one, a lot of those I would have thought would be for roots only, so you'd have to have

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.010
a rooted device

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.440
but certainly the free ones

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.419
some of these I think should work
regardless.

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:33.459
But not a bad application.
