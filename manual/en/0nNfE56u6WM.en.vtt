Honda S90 1969

00:00:07.453 --> 00:00:13.453
first engine running test, noticed some oil leaks at 
 the joint between cyl head and the cylinder

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:20.666
New chain guard is in place but I'm going 
 to paint it white instead of black

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.250
Still need the front shock chrome rings but part 
 has been ordered and on its way

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.500
So lets start the engine and see how it sounds  ^_^

00:00:43.828 --> 00:00:47.828
Should I set the petcock to Reserve ??......since barely 
 no gas inside the gas tank LOL

00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:05.083
Sounds good !! ^_^

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
RooaAARRR.....RooaRRR..... Awesome !!

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:29.167
Headlight works

00:01:35.525 --> 00:01:42.520
Signals all work

00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:54.330
It beeps...
