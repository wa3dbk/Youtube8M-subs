Hello again, I am Guido From Football Tricks Online and today we are going to learn the following trick !

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.440
Okey the first step its to lift the ball up in a straight way, So... put you your dominant foot in top of the ball and the non-dominant right behind the ball

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.440
We need to try and lift the ball straight, it cant go to the sides, forward o inwards

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.360
So you need to practice,this is the most important and hardest point of the trick

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.520
Ok lets try...  there i went kind of straight but went forward a little

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.120
Ok you just got to keep doing this, if you cant do this... you wont be able to perform the trick correctly

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.560
there it went forward

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.920
there it went backwards a little

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.020
Forward

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.240
there it went straight, it went really straight, so now we can move on...

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.720
So lest say the ball bounces...

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.780
When the ball bounces just put your foot sideways 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.120
and pass your leg over the ball and with inertia... 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.400
your pivot foot will automatically twist

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.880
and that will make your heel end up looking at the ball

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.080
Then it comes the second part of the video that is to lift your leg to make the ball go straight in top of you

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.840
The second part of the trick it is NOTto hitting the ball with you heel.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.980
Lets get in position to have a clear view

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.420
When the ball bounces it will go inwards a little and it has to land in your cabs

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.360
Then you just got to lift your leg so...

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.100
The ball will roll down your cabs and gain inertia and when you finish lifting your leg it will go over you

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.020
but do not hit the ball with your heel, what i mean with this is the following

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.040
dont do that

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.720
The ball has to roll down from your cabs like a slide

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.480
It rolls and as you lift your leg it gains inertia and finally goes in top of you

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.240
now we do it all together

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.320
Bounces and we place the foot

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.640
you see?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.760
Ok guys i hope you enjoyed the trick, as you can see its a wonderful trick

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.240
The first step can be kind of hard but with practice you will get it right

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.400
