[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.246 --> 00:00:06.670
-Hey, everyone.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.330
Today we are going
to show you how

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.446
to deal with hair,
but not human hair.

00:00:11.446 --> 00:00:13.320
We're actually going to
deal with puppy hair.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.819
Huh?

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:15.410
Puppy hair.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.200
Yeah, tonight is bath
night for Braidy.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.190
Huh?

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.340
And he's going to
be our movie star.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.650
So we're going to show
how to take care of Braidy

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.620
and what we do when we
bathe him. [CHUCKLES]

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.650
-So first we're going
to turn the water on.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.262
And you want it not
hot, but not cold.

00:00:31.262 --> 00:00:31.970
Just like a baby.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.520
Just like a perfect
medium temperature.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.640
And then you want to take your
little doggie oatmeal soap

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.420
right here that is recommended
by our vet for our dog.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.410
And then we're just
going to put it on him

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.390
and lather him up and--

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.680
-Lather him up,
make him all bubbly.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.180
-Yeah.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.230
Make him all sudsy, and
then just wash him off.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.630
And then that's when you'll turn
the water off and get him out.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.250
So we're going to do that now.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.710
OK, all warm.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.210
-You're OK.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.680
-You're OK.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.660
Aw.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.130
-You are wet.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.500
-Aw, sorry baby.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.480
That's good.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.045
A cute little rat, huh?

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:20.035
-All right.

00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:21.020
All right.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.520
OK.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.965
I'll hold you, and
Brooklyn will wash you.

00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:27.955
-Oh.

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:29.440
Yes.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.925
Good boy.

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:32.905
All done.

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:34.900
All done.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.530
-Aw, look at him.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.312
Oh, look at him.

00:01:39.312 --> 00:01:41.790
-Look at you, cute Braidy.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.521
Come on.

00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:46.610
We'll dry you off.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.610
Look at that face.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.860
Oh, it's like a little baby.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.610
-So the next step is
going to blow dry him

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.750
so that he can be super fluffy.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.710
And you want to make
sure it's not on hot.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.930
You want to turn it on warm
so that it doesn't hurt them.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.295
So we'll start blow drying.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.430
Oh.

00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:25.365
All right.

00:02:25.365 --> 00:02:25.865
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.040
-OK.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.414
Now we're going
to brush him out.

00:02:42.414 --> 00:02:45.280
And my mom got a hairbrush.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.670
And we decided we liked
hairbrushes better,

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.420
because he actually
has hair, not fur.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.981
So the dog ones
don't work as well.

00:02:50.981 --> 00:02:52.980
She just got an extra
one, so we don't use this.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.400
It's just for the dog.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.450
And then just brush him out.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.257
So he looks all nice
and combed out, huh?

00:03:02.257 --> 00:03:04.652
Combed out.

00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:07.047
Brush right there.

00:03:07.047 --> 00:03:08.340
-[CHUCKLES] It's like wavy.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.110
It's so wavy.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.970
Such a fluffy dog.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.975
There we go, Braidy.

00:03:13.975 --> 00:03:15.570
-Oh, there we go.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.784
-Our nice, clean, puppy.

00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:19.350
-He's so snuggly.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.580
-My buddy.
[KISSING NOISES] My buddy.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.150
Thank you for the kiss.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.557
-So one of my dog's favorite
things is his Orapup.

00:03:26.557 --> 00:03:28.640
Now, for those of you that
are familiar with dogs,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.434
you know that teeth
are really important,

00:03:30.434 --> 00:03:32.350
and they get lots of
bacteria on their tongue,

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.330
and so dogs start having
really bad breath.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.750
One great way to fight
it is with an Orapup.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.100
So this is like a
fortified oral health

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.220
gel that's got anti-plaques
and natural bad breath fighting

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.380
enzymes in it.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.685
And this flavor
is beef and bacon.

00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:46.624
So my dog loves it.

00:03:46.624 --> 00:03:49.040
And what you do is you just
stick it on an Orabrush, which

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.430
is basically like a glorified
brush with lots of bristles

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.890
on it, and then instead
of fighting your dog,

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.790
like with a toothbrush,
you just put it down.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.975
And the smell-- look, they
just lick it right off.

00:03:57.975 --> 00:03:59.350
And when they're
licking, they're

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.308
scraping their tongue
across all those bristles

00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:03.350
and scratching off
all that bacteria.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.140
And it also helps
fight the plaque

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.730
on their teeth, which is great.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.152
He obviously loves it.

00:04:08.152 --> 00:04:10.110
It's a great way to do
it without fighting over

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.130
a toothbrush, because
he loves it, obviously.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.150
It's like he doesn't
want me to put it down.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.250
And I have put a link
in the description box

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.560
below if you're interested
in your own Orapup.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.500
You can check it out below, and
I'll show you where to buy one.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.180
Mm.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.270
You can see he loves it.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.270
He hates it when I take
it away, because he just

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.000
will lick it forever.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.626
And then to clean it
off, all you have to do

00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:33.450
is rinse it under the sink.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.962
And it just washes
all the residue off.

00:04:35.962 --> 00:04:36.920
And then it just dries.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.190
You can see, it's all gone.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.100
So it's simple, easy, I love it.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.652
He loves it.

00:04:40.652 --> 00:04:41.860
See, he's still wanting more.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.860
He's like, give me more.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.530
Give me more.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.020
Bacon.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.820
But if you want to
