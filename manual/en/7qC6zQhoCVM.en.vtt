00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.390
UC Davis Medical Center's 'birthing unit'
has long been a place where new life begins.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.459
Now it's part of the first statewide effort
to create a public bank for umbilical cord

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.410
blood and new mom Natalie Hanson knows it
will someday save lives.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.650
My twin sister was diagnosed with juvenile
diabetes when we were eight and I know that

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.890
they use cord blood to try and find cures
for things like diabetes.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.550
Hanson decided to donate her daughter Wren's
umbilical cord blood, which would otherwise

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.110
be disposed of.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.590
It's an ideal source of stem cells -- both
for research and as an alternative to bone

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.370
marrow for patients who need life-saving transplants.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.610
Cord blood is absolutely wonderful for transplant
because it can be stored frozen, unlike bone

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.620
marrow, where a donor needs to be found at
the time when you need that transplant.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.170
Private 'banking' of umbilical cord blood
has long been an option - but an expensive

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.600
one - for new parents who want to bank cord
blood for their own families possible use.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.170
As a result, the public cord blood inventory
is very limited -- both in quantity and diversity.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.990
UC Davis' institute for regenerative cures
was chosen to launch the program that is free

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.939
to parents and creates a reliable source of
cord blood that reflects the population of

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.509
our entire state.

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.590
With California being such a diverse area
with so many mixed races, We're a great state

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.869
for increasing the availability - anyone who
needs cord blood for transplant can find a

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:35.869
match.

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.080
Donating cord blood is quick, easy and poses
no risk to baby or mom.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.229
Collection specialist Karen O'Donnell says
the response from new parents has been overwhelming.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.799
We're totally in agreement with it.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.810
It's just anything that we can do to help.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.450
We're not going to use it ourselves, so why
let it go to waste?

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.429
Thanks to the youngest of donors and their
parents, transplant patients will someday

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.729
soon have a much greater chance of finding
a life-saving match.

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.090
This program has the potential to save thousands
-- maybe millions -- of lives.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.090
In Sacramento, Kristen Simoes, for UC Davis.
