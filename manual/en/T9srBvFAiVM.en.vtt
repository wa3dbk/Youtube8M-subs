00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.667
Today we are going to show you
how to organize apps on your

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:06.633
iPad in iOS 7.

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:09.934
Once you donwload an app in
the App Store, it is generally

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:14.133
placed on the last page
of apps on your iPad.

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:17.433
To navigate through the pages,
swipe to the left or the right

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:20.500
on your iPad.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.967
Once an app is downloaded, you
have the option to move it on

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:27.533
different pages by long
pressing, which would be placing

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.767
your finger on the app and
holding down for approximately

00:00:29.767 --> 00:00:32.967
one second, and then you have
the ability to move the app

00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:34.667
around your screen.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:39.266
You can also move
it to another page.

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:44.567
You also have the ability to
move apps in and out of the dock

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:51.467
at the bottom of your iPad.

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:54.967
Best practice is to keep your
most frequently used apps in

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:58.834
your dock.

00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:03.100
To create a new folder,
long-press on an app and drag it

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.266
on top of another
app and release.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:10.500
This will create a new
folder on your iPad.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.033
The iPad will guess the title
of this folder based on the apps

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:17.433
that you have placed in it.

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:25.934
You also have the ability
to select and edit the text.

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:29.133
Once you are finished editing a
folder, press the home button to

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:34.233
return to normal view.

00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:36.834
In the same way that you can
move apps on your iPad, you can

00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:41.767
also move folders by long
pressing and dragging them to a

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:46.533
different page.

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.500
If you have a lot of apps on
your iPad, another easy way to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.533
find them is by using
the search tool.

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:55.734
Swipe down with one finger
anywhere on your homescreen of

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:58.800
your iPad to bring
up the search tool.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.400
Here you can type in the name of
an app and easily find it that

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.900
way.
