NEARBY.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.370

BREVARD COUNTY.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.110
NOT IN THE OCEAN BUT BELIEVED TO

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.740
BE IN A POND.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.780

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.720

ACRES LARGE AND HE SAYS IT IS

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.060
UNFAIR TO THIS THIS ANIMAL

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.860
BECAUSE THERE IS NO PLACE FOR IT

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.300
TO GO.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.870
THIS IS KNOWN OR MULL IT AND

ALLIGATOR BUT DEFINITELY NOT ANY

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.140
BULL SHARKS.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.810

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.980
OF AGGRESSIVE SHARK IN THIS

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.250
WATER IS NOT OKAY.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.010
ENTER JAMES DEAN, THIS TRAPPER

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.720
TRYING TO CATCH IT.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.220
HE WAS HERE BEFORE FIVE THIS

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.720
MORNING.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.590
HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO GET THIS

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.560
SHARK OUT OF THE WATER?

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.290
HOPEFULLY WHAT OUR INTENTIONS

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.760
ARE IS BAITSING THE LINE WITH

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.060
CUT MULL IT AND CHUMMING THE

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.760
WATER TO GET THE SHARK OVER TO

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.800
THIS AREA AND CATCHING HIM,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.970
TRANSPORTING HIM OVER TO THE

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.800
RIVER AND BACK TO WHERE HE

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.700
SHOULD BE.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.210
JUDGE HOW HARD THAT IS TO DO?

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.840
I NEVER DEALT WITH SOMETHING

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.140
LIKE THIS, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.110
AND TIME CONSUMING.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.020
WE WANT TO GET IT OUT OF HERE.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.650
IT IS IN THE A PUBLIC SAFETY

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.690
ISSUE, AS LONG AS THE MEDIA IS

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.450
PUTTING IT OUT THERE AND PEOPLE

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.390
COULD KEEP THEIR CHILDREN AND

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.390
DOGS AWAY FROM THE WATER.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.190
THIS SHARK WILL IN THE JUMP OUT

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.730
LIKE AN ALLIGATOR DOES.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.500
WE WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.800
IF PARENTS ARE DRYBURYING THAT

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.530

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.500
KIDS ON TOP OF THE DISTRICT AND

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.770
WALK ON TOP AND POSSIBLY FALL

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.140

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.480
THE MOST AGGRESSIVE SHARKS KNOWN

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.080
FOR SOME OF THE MOST SHARK BITES

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.080

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.900
SHARK IS ABOUT FOUR FEET LONG

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.090
