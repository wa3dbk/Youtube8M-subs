00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.119
Hi, I'm Dr. Josh Axe and welcome to my kitchen.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.304
I just got done with my morning run and now
it's time to refuel, and so what I'm going

00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:28.759
to share with you guys this morning is one
of my favorite recipes, which is the coconut

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.140
berry smoothie.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.250
The coconut berry smoothie is great during
all times of the day.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.890
It's great for breakfast, it's great as an
after-workout snack, or it's great even for

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.890
doing dessert.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.649
Again, you can do a berry smoothie, and there's
all different ways to mix this recipe up.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.699
The main ingredients in the coconut berry
smoothie are what I've already said.

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.219
It's coconut milk and berries.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.379
What you need to do is get coconut milk.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.570
You can get that in the Asian or ethnic food
section of any store, and then go out and

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.149
grab some frozen berries.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.670
I typically go with organic berries as much
as possible.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.670
What we're going to start off doing, basically
all you need at home is a blender.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.770
Any kind of blender works for this.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.090
What I'm going to do is go ahead and grab
some coconut milk and that's the first ingredient

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.230
we're going to pour in.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:20.030
So you're simply going to pour coconut milk
into the blender like so.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.530
After that, we've got some frozen strawberries
here and other berries.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.479
We've got blackberries, raspberries, blueberries
and strawberries.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.560
We'll just take the berries here, dump those
in, and that's for starters.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.490
And really, these are the main ingredients.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.950
You could just go ahead and blend this up
the way it is.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.790
I personally like to add in a few more things
to add some flavor.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.009
The next ingredient I'm going to add in is
stevia.

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.840
Stevia is a no-calorie natural sweetener,
so it's not going to have all the side effects

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.229
that sugar will.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.690
It's going to have all the benefits of not
having sugar.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.500
And then the other thing you're going to see
that's great about stevia, again, it's totally

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.510
natural.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.180
It's not going to have the side effects that
aspartame or Splenda will.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.180
It is all natural.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.900
It actually comes from the herb of a flower.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.560
So the next thing I'm going to do is just
open this pack of stevia and just go ahead

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.820
and dump that in right on top of there.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.820
The other things I like to do to add flavor
is I like add in some vanilla extract.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:30.640
So you can take a little bit of vanilla extract
and pour about a 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.209
capful in, and that's it for the vanilla.

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.050
The other thing I love to add is cinnamon.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.940
So we'll just take some cinnamon, and I usually
just go ahead and eyeball it and just add

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.120
in a little bit like that.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.370
Then we are good to go.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.709
Depending on how much you put in here, usually
we go with about a cup to two cups of berries

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.540
and about a third of a can of coconut milk
is typical.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.959
But the other thing you'll often want to do
is add a little bit of water depending on

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.090
the sort of texture you want.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.400
So I'll add in about half a cup of water there.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.600
We'll place this blender here.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600
This is actually a Vitamix.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.989
It's a more powerful blender.

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:29.459
We're going to go ahead and start with the
berry smoothie, start getting it mixed up.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.129
One other variation to the berry smoothie
is adding in some vegetables.

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.920
A lot of times you think, "Well, vegetables
in a berry smoothie?

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.920
How would that work?"

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.930
Well, I'll tell you, the berries cover up
most of the flavor, so if you're a person

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.720
who doesn't get enough vegetables in your
diet, a great thing to do is add some green

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.420
leafy vegetables.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.120
By the way, kids will love this berry smoothie
recipe.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.700
If you have kids at home where you know they're
not getting enough vegetables, this is the

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.500
best place to sneak in some extra vegetables
in the smoothie.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.440
So what you're going to do, one of my favorite
foods to add in is kale.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.329
Kale is actually one of the most nutrient-dense
foods on the planet.

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.200
It's full of phytonutrients, antioxidants,
magnesium, calcium, and it's actually one

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.900
of the highest forms of calcium available
today.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.049
So what you're going to do, take the berry
smoothie, a similar thing, at the end you're

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.860
basically going to take some kale, add it
right in there, and go ahead and we'll start

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.940
blending again.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.920
The final step is drinking the berry smoothie.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.070
This is just something you can throw in a
cup.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.310
You can drink it at home or if you are on
the go, throw it in a cup and bring it in

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.130
the car on your way to work, soccer practice,
wherever it is you're going.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.340
So again, the final step, we're just taking
off the lid here, taking the berry smoothie,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.660
pouring it here into the cup.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:59.020
All right, and you have a great-tasting smoothie
with berries, coconut, cinnamon, vanilla,

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.930
stevia and, in this variation, kale.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.469
Tastes great.
