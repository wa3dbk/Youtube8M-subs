00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.640
hello everyone this is by resigning

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.890
I'm back to my home

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.369
days

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:12.259
and this time I'm playing a match with CNN

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.209
yes we're both plans that are that there aren't
there

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.259
is %uh

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.660
pretty good player

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.269
you know that this is scoring the and then
probably see if you kill someone

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.249
as for me on don't do so well

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:29.060
I've done quite a bit

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.519
like this that's coming up

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.679
they should have a minimum standard

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.520
of course because it has come and go

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.670
happens quite a bit in this game

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.730
the that's okay

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.539
%uh I have he's not actually put out a video
in a little while

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.770
it's only because I mean actually said

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.290
and I am still sick or now

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.620
yes

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.040
the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.990
how did that hair I'm pretty sure of it

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.619
the and so far as to death

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.080
no killed

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.160
yeah this is only going to be a huge lake
people

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.950
that's all that'll be

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.180
yeah I think you know

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.810
and I go on mir try to look for someone

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.640
this bill will

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.290
ooh has shattered

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.760
Gary

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.760
unless they do not have the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.150
and since you're in now

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.229
a figure most analysts

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.560
they say sure the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.990
you don't want to kill him

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.899
you get on that story chosen a row

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.799
so far I'm doing all right

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.430
that's the way the day

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.880
there is a bad guy

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.850
yeah

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.210
try to shoot someone goes on before you still
want to know

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.810
no surprise

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.110
get more and loan

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.130
and see that that guy out there

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.799
number

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.540
I never go for the shots from the outside
in

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.540
yes I'm dying the way it is

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.139
and I remember stars in angie

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:20.099
so there's really a very very fair but there
and they have not being money

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.809
running on the economy she still mind

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:29.909
it died out there are no words you don't have
cars

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.759
that's right and wrong on the kill and die
instead I should have said that but I didn't

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:37.629
and I did it

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.899
she is this sense of what issues hit from
the side

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:42.840
it'll

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.839
tell me

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:47.119
what am I doing wrong in its match

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:51.649
well I think I've gotten so much

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:54.540

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.329

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.599
try and apply a little smile please

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.150
you know after being shot from the sun from
behind

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.799
and there's some people just don't have the
answers

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.819
especially man

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.189

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:33.870
two and a half times ours the usual

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.849
