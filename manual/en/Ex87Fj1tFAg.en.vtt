JORGE BENLLOCH: Okay. Now, for example we
have like an easy and fast shape that of course

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.680
can be a cat or can be another kind of thing,
but we are going to make it happen, a cat.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:21.970
Now, we are going to make like a head with
a neck and everything else that we are going

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:33.890
to put it in here, maybe we put like a neck
there. The cats, they have this kind of a

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:50.909
special shape that I love. Like distinct,
like a noble thing. They look at you with

00:00:50.909 --> 00:01:07.400
superiority. And in fact, in many ways they
are superior. They are fantastic animals and

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:18.690
I love cats. And the Egyptians, they love
the cats too. In the British Museum, you can

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.970
see the mummies of the house cats and the
master dies and he's mummified, they mummify

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:45.650
their cat too to have company after death.
That was cool. And the cat in the antiquity

00:01:45.650 --> 00:02:04.789
had a very useful work. They keep the rodents
away from the grain that they had a big problem

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:12.930
then with the rodents. Actually, in Africa,
they have the same kind of problem too. I

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:25.930
mean, the grain, it's ruined half by the rodents
and half by the mold. They old Egyptians,

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:35.930
they had a better organization. They had better
places, the better warehouse, and better cats.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.170
And that's two.
