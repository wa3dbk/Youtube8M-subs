Alright, alright, alright! Welcome back to Book Sync Battles!

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.060
Where audiobooks are the weapon of choice and two contestants battle it out

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.060
in a winner-take-all slugfest between
the sounds of your favorite narrators.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.680
And now for our main event, Cindy versus
Trevor!

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.620
And our first lyrical Leviathan is, let me hear for Cindy!

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.440
Boo! Haha.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.760
I'm really happy to be here... so um yeah.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.500
'Revenge!' he snorted, and the light of his eyes
lit the hall from floor to ceiling like

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.660
scarlet lightning. 'Revenge! The King under
the Mountain is dead and where are his

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:11.720
kin that dare seek revenge? My armor is like
ten fold shields, my teeth are swords, my

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:21.170
claws spears, the shock of my tail a
thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.260
breath: death!'

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.880
Woah! She went there and back again! Trevor, can you answer to that?

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.140
Sure can. Short Stuff. 
[laughs]

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.140
Watch this.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.440
Jane, be still, don't struggle so, like a
wild frantic bird that is rending its

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:56.000
own plumage in its desperation. I am no
bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.539
human being with an independent will,
which I now exert to leave you. You play a

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.860
farce, which I merely laugh at.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.480
[Cheering]
Dang!

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.040
I did not see that coming!

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.440
Such grace! Such elegance! Cindy. You're move!

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.940
Wrong! Your ears you keep so that every
shriek of every child at seeing your

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.430
hideousness will be yours to cherish.
That is what to the pain means. It means

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.560
that I leave you to live in anguish, in
humiliation, in freakish misery until you

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.260
can stand it no more. So there you have
it, pig. And I say this now -- live or die --

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.140
it's up to you. Drop your sword.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.400
You can't fight the crowd. That's all the time we have for
today, but remember - check out the audiobooks at

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.760
the library and you might be next for Book Sync Battles! Peace!
