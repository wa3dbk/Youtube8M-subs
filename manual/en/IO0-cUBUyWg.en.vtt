00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.700
Define the order in which multiple filters are applied

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:11.220
When we combine multiple filters in a single query, we need to define the order in which they will execute to ensure that the query returns the correct data.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:23.000
In this example, we will add, group, and prioritize multiple filters to return values for stores in California in 2004 and 2005, or values for stores in Texas for 2006.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.880
The query already has filters to limit the results to stores from California for 2004 and 2005.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.280
We will add the filters to restrict the results to stores in Texas in 2006.      

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.280
Now we will manually enter the year for the filter.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.520
Next, we will add the filter for State and select the appropriate value from the list of values. 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.600
With the filters in their current state, the query will not return any values because

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.800
no single record will be from both California and Texas, and from both 2004 or 2005 and 2006.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.800
To return the correct values, we need to group the first two and last two filters, and then change the logical operator that combines the two groups.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.520
We can group filters by dragging and dropping one on to the other.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.240
We can also drag and drop to re-order filters.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.840
Note that the first two filters are now a nested group.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.320
We will repeat for the second set of filters.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.280
Finally, we will change the logical operator and run the query to see the results

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.920
Note that the results are for either California in 2004 and 2005, or for Texas in 2006.
