00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
If I have one quality

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.940
it's never making a single spelling mistake

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:03.980
False!

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.780
People who write well, who don't make spelling mistakes

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.860
they really like shaming you by reading and correcting what you've written

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.400
"vegtables", you missed an "e" in "VegEtables"

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.660
er...soup...

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.180
you... you wrote "souppppp" with 5 'P's !

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.880
Thank God for keyboards

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.620
every time I make a mistake, I use the same excuse

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.900
No, I think it's just a typo

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.360
I can't use this excuse when I write by hand

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.040
No, it's just a penning mistake

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.620
Ok, so it's fine making fun of people who make spelling mistakes, it's fair game

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.340
EXCEPT in one case where it's absolutely forbidden

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.000
Oh wow, it's full of mistakes, you can't even write man!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.200
Yeah, but I have dyslexia

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.880
Sorry, I didn't mean that. I respect you and your family.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.200
I'm dyslexic

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.740
Honestly, I've heard that so many times it feels like everyone's dyslexic

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.140
Slow down with the dyslexia thing

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.060
It seems like if you're dyslexic, you can use it anytime you need a free pass

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.640
You can't even lift the bookcase

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.020
Hey, I'm dyslexic, 'k?

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.060
What's weird, it's that the word "dyslexia" which describes a disability linked to spelling

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.180
is itself the hardest word in the world to spell!

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.420
Peeps with dyslexia probably never managed to spell their disability once

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.680
on the other hand AIDS is much easier, I mean...

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.580
Ok I make mistakes myself but on difficult words

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.860
however, I'd just like to mention a mistake that we see all the time

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.560
the guys who spell "wats up?"

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.780
Guys, just learn it once. It's not hard it's with "what's"

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.460
That's it, then you know it for life. Then you're good, you don't have to learn it again.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.080
It's like texting

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.100
There are people who write like they text, but not just when they text: all the time.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.080
Common, imagine if everyone did that! In a few years, it would be a mess!

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.280
The French President, Francois Hollande

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.460
assuming his presidential function this morning by telling the press

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.800
"All is Gr8"

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.400
Ok, so maybe this sentence will be legend one day

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.460
or maybe not, probably just a really lame legend.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.820
When I manage to finally memorize the spelling of a word

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.820
it's not because I read it in a book

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.620
It's always thanks to really bad mnemonics

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.280
Err.. Does 'Welcome" take an E at the end?

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.440
Sure

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.640
Ah! I see Monsieur is well read!

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.120
Not at all, I just have a mat with "Welcome"on it

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.340
I see.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.000
Hey, just in case...

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.160
You wouldn't have a mat with "Consequently" on it at home?

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.400
No? Ok.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.080
So if I make spelling mistakes and I don't have dyslexia, what's up with me?

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.900
Well, it just means you're dumb.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.560
Ah, perfect.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.020
