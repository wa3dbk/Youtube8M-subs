Hey guys, this is DMC here with HSBC
for the Hong Kong Sevens

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.799
for a little bit of magic away from the pitch.

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:20.280
Let's play.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.280
We are in Pottinger Street, myself and Gav.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:45.000
We're about to head into this fancy dress shop
and make sure we get the right kit for Saturday

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.119
because Saturday is all about fancy dress
and you've got to get in the spirit.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.000
They're cool.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.600
- So we've be talking about this.
- Hi there!

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.679
If you wave like this.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.359
Wait, OK.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.839
No way! No Way!

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.560
Here we are in Graham Street,
well known for fruit and veg.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:10.759
We are going to walk up with Drummond

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:14.320
and just see what the locals think
of some of his magic tricks.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:23.839
Grab a card.

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:26.359
Remember the card.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.160
And can you please show it to the camera.

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.679
Place it back inside,
wherever you like.

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:39.719
- You ready?
- I'm ready, I'm watching you very carefully.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.199
What's going on?

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.239
- Nothing?
- There is nothing there.

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.399
Let's go...

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.919
- Please no!
- She doesn't believe it either.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.320
- You have got to be kidding me!
- No! No!

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.399
It's George's card.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.640
- You want me to take it?
- Have a look inside.

00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:28.799
Do I reveal to everyone?

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.759
- This man!
- That was very impressive.

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.080
Come up here. That's sensational!

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.679
Respect of the highest order.

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:42.640
- Half each.
- Thank you very much.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.719
That was unbelievable, unbelievable!
