Being You
Changing The world

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.680
The Book
By Dr Dain Heer

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.080
Hi folks!
My name is Dr. Dain Heer.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.200
I'd like to invite you to read a very
special book that I've written, called:

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.520
"Being You, Changing the World".

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.220
When I wrote this,
what I wanted to do was

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.300
I wanted to give people the
tools that they would need,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.600
in one book,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.660
to start changing
the aspects of their lives

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.040
they've been looking to change
and hadn't yet been able to.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.900
What happened for me is 14 years ago,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.440
I was at a place were I was gonna kill myself,
if things didn't change.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.840
I'd taken every seminar known to
man woman and child, that I can find.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.460
Still, I didn't have the changes
I was looking for my life.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.100
All I really wanted
was to wake up happy

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.780
and to not struggle emotionally,
not struggle financially.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.960
I wasn't asking for much and yet
nothing that I did created that result.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.980
I came along to Access Consciousness

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.020
and the result that I've been
looking for and everything else

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.420
actually started occurring,
faster than ever thought they could.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.700
Fast forward to 14 years later,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.300
I'm a co creator
of Access Consciousness,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.040
helping bring different tools to the world,
different tools to people,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.360
that they can use to
actually start change in their lives.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.780
That's what I put in this book.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.880
One of the ideas,
one of the concepts in this book,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.240
a real simple one I'll share with you.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.800
Is the idea that 98% of your thoughts,
your feelings and your emotions

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.500
don't actually belong to you.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.080
A real simple tool for releasing them,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.920
in fact, if you do this
one tool for three days.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.220
At the end of three days,
you have the capacity to walk around

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.260
like your a walking,
talking meditation.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.420
With no thoughts in your head,
except yours,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.840
no matter how many people are around,

00:01:33.848 --> 00:01:36.220
no matter what city you're in,
no matter where you live.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.883
Can you imagine,
if you just took that one tool

00:01:38.883 --> 00:01:41.840
and emptied out 98% of the
crap that's been in your head?

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.320
This is just one,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.320
out of many many many
tools that are in there.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.220
It's designed actually to give you
the awareness that you can choose,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.300
what it is you like to choose,
as your life and your world.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.700
It's actually the space
that we choose things from,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.220
that creates what occurs,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.100
that creates what shows up and
creates how we feel about our lives.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.740
What this book does,
is give you the tools

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.700
to start creating change and also
the space of possibilities to do so.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.840
But it's not just tools, it's also the
inspiration to know that you can do it.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.340
Because like I said I didn't
know that I could do it,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.980
until it started using this
and seeing my life change.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.080
It's based on the work that I've done,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.540
with thousands of people around
the world over the last 14 years.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.366
I wanted to put it all in one book,

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:25.520
so that you truly could
have the peace of being you

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.800
and realize that when you do that,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.580
when you actually have a sense
of ease and a sense of peace.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.840
The people that are closest
to you will start to notice,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.520
and they'll realize that
it's actually okay to be them.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.120
See most of us have been judging
ourselves our entire lives for

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.360
everything we choose,
for everything we are.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.000
Especially the seekers of the world

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.080
are the ones who's been
in judgement of themselves.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.247
When you start being you
and having a sense of peace

00:02:46.247 --> 00:02:48.780
and a sense of ease and
coming out a judgement of you.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.940
The closest people to you start
noticing and those that desire it,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.820
start knowing they can have it too.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.900
They affect the people around them,
who affect the people around them,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.700
who affect the people around them.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.400
That's where the part about
changing the world comes in.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.500
What I'd like to see is a
world where we can all be us.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.640
We can be everything we are,
all of the greatness of us.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.920
Embrace everything about us
and not have to cut any of it off.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.420
So, consider this your invitation

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.320
to a possibility for finding out
what it is actually like to be you.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.580
Not having to make you wrong anymore

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.460
and seeing what you can contribute

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.940
to creating a greater
possibility on this planet.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.120
Just by being you.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.920
What if you truly being you is the gift,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.800
the change and the
possibility this world requires?

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.780
Thanks for listening,
I hope you enjoy the book.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.320

in person someday, Bye!
