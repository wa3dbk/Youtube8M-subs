00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.310
Waterworld is one of my favorite movies…
okay to be fair I haven’t seen it since

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.400
I was like ten.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.860
But besides Kevin Costner with gills, what
would that kind of a world look like?

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.590
What happens when all the ice melts?

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.369
Hi everyone Julia here for Dnews

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.660
Lots of headlines warn about melting ice.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.280
It’s like a doomsday fanatics fantasy.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.420
I mean, did you see Day After Tomorrow?

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.070
But calm down Hollywood, how bad will it be
if the ice melts?

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.869
Well, most of it’s not good.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.070
Weather might look a little different around
the world.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.790
As more of the sun’s energy gets absorbed
into the oceans, it could change the way air

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.550
moves around in the atmosphere in the arctic
and could even change the position of the

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.580
jet stream.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.121
One study published in the journal Environmental
Research Letters found that if the Arctic

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:46.970
sea ice melts, England will get a little rainier.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.820
And a study published in the journal Nature
suggests that the Northern jet stream will

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.610
shift southward, bringing cold polar air,
making winters colder and snowier in North

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.610
America.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.180
We could lose wildlife too.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.830
And as the ice melts at a rate of more than
86,000 square kilometers per year, wildlife

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.650
is losing critical habitat.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.100
Lots of arctic species like whales, walrus
and seals depend on the ice for protection

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.170
and hunting.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.960
Some are already changing their feeding and
migration patterns.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.150
Okay, I know what you really want to hear
about.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.370
How will all this melting sink our cities?

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.410
When talking about ice melting, it’s important
to make a distinction.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.670
Ice caps, like the Arctic ice cap already
sits on top of the water, so if even it melts,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.560
while still sucking, wouldn’t contribute
to sea level rise.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.110
But if you’re worried about a future water
world, you should be worried about ice sheets

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.110
melting.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.430
Ice sheets sit on top of land and form when
snow that falls during the winter doesn’t

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.880
melt, and with enough time and enough snow,
these layers stack up and form a big thick

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.880
sheet.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.420
The two main ice sheets are the Greenland
and Antarctic Ice Sheets, which together contain

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.790
more than 99 percent of the freshwater ice
on Earth.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.740
In the Antarctic, a large ice shelf that’s
existed for 12,000 years is on the brink of

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.740
collapse.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.680
Another study published in the journal Science
found that over the past 20 years, Antarctica's

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.500
floating ice shelves shrank 18%.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.680
And this melting is speeding up.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.470
New research from Princeton University shows
that it’s melting faster than we thought.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.289
Researchers found that in Antarctica, ice
melting increased by 6 billion tons per year

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.680
each year during the 11-year period the researchers
examined.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.730
Scientists believe that if these ice sheets
melt, sea levels will rise, devastating coastal

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.000
cities around the globe.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.940
According to a study published in the journal
Climate Dynamics, if all the ice in the Greenland

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.350
Ice Sheet melts, global sea level would rise
by about 24 feet.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.600
If all of Antarctica melts, sea levels would
rise by 200 feet!

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.090
The entire Eastern Seaboard of the US would
be underwater, and Florida would vanish.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.360
That’s a worst case, extreme scenario.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.120
But we should still be concerned about this
trend.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.980
These icy regions heat up faster than the
rest of the world.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.380
To get a sense of how the Earth is warming,
it’s important to keep an eye on the icy

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.380
parts of the world.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.319
If the ice is melting…like a canary in a
coalmine, it could signal a global warming

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.319
trend.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.420
And speaking of, a recent study published
in the journal Nature Climate Change found

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.240
that it’s a positive feedback loop.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.090
As the ice melts, climate change will get
worse.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.790
The ice acts as a giant reflector.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.370
Bouncing sunlight back into space.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.750
But as the ice melts, more of the sun’s
energy will be absorbed rather than reflecting,

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.410
heating up the Earth more, which in turn will
melt more ice..

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.150
It’s a vicious cycle.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.900
And one country in particular is hoping that
the world acts on this problem soon.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:32.959
Check out this video from our sister channel
Seeker, on how the Maldives is dealing with

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.820
rising sea levels.
