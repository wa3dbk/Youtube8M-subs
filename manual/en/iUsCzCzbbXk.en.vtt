00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:28.119
I've played, like, two good movie games in
the last decade.

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.169
I've already played two this year.

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.689
There's South Park: The Stick Of Truth, and
there's this.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.329
The LEGO Movie Video Game.

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.680
Hey, maybe this is the turn of the tide.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.649
Maybe movie games are gonna start being awesome.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.260
I mean, that would be awesome.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.780
'Cause this one's awesome.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:58.449
Not sure why I keep saying awesome, but...it
feels awesome.

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.519
So I actually reviewed this game on the PlayStation
3 about a month ago.

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.770
But since then, I've actually seen the movie.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.240
And I've got to tell you...just a great movie.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.720
Actually, I was gonna say awesome, but...that
joke's over.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.990
And coming back to it after seeing the movie,
I'm even more impressed with the game.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.490
I mean, this is how you do a game based on
a movie.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.229
It captures the vibe, it tells the story,
and it does it really well.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:30.350
In fact, it's kind of crazy how well it tells
the story.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.020
Playing this game really feels like you're
playing through the movie.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.940
It goes scene by scene, turning major moments
from the film into playable levels in the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.940
game.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.940
And they picked the right scenes, too.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.700
Emmet's long fall into the abyss, the big
escape in the Old West...you get to play them,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.700
in the game.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.060
And since it's all tied together with actual
video from the movie, it really brings the

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.450
whole experience together.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:08.259
The LEGO Movie Video Game is just thatâ€”the
movie, as a game.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:18.780
Of course, it starts with the presentation.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.280
The game looks beautiful, and it does a great
job recreating locations from the film.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.870
And again, you're getting a lot of video and
music from the movie.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.660
So much so that...it sort of changes the game's
tone.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.110
I mean, most LEGO games use cut scenes to
inject that LEGO humor into the given series.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.310
We've seen it in everything from Harry Potter
to Star Wars.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.550
That quirky charm that comes from the LEGO
games.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.910
But this one doesn't have it.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.280
As a movie game, it's not reimagining characters
as LEGO.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.370
The movie already is LEGO.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.620
So again, it does feel a bit different from
most of the LEGO games.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.840
While it may differ in tone, it's very familiar
in terms of gameplay.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.510
This is another classically LEGO video game.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.420
You beat up enemies, you collect studs, you
make new things from LEGO bricks.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.090
Occasionally, you solve a puzzle.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.040
I mean, it's mostly the same simple gameplay
we've come to expect from the LEGO games.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.799
But where it sets itself apart...is its focus.

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:18.790
Where some lean toward combat, this one's
more focused...on LEGO.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:33.560
See, in The LEGO Movie Video Game...virtually
everything on the screen is made from LEGO

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.560
bricks.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.190
It's not like the other games, where it's
only certain objects made from LEGO.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.150
In this one, everything's LEGO.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.090
And a lot of it can be destroyed.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.640
So perhaps more than any of the previous LEGO
games, this one feels like a truly LEGO game.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.150
There are bricks and studs all over the place,
and you're constantly building new things.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.040
And one of the central gameplay elements are
these crazy super builds.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.440
Some characters can actually highlight a bunch
of objects, and then tear them apart and throw

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.330
the pieces into a huge LEGO whirlwind.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.000
And these whirlwinds create crazy new LEGO
stuff.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.909
Obviously another area where the game mimics
the film, but it also plays into the emphasis

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:10.909
on creation.

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:16.040
I mean, playing this kind of LEGO game after...some
of the Marvel games, for example...it's obviously

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.480
got the same gameplay elements, but it's about
the proportion of those elements.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.030
Of course, on the other hand...it's also a
much smaller game than, say, LEGO Marvel Super

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.030
Heroes.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.720
Although each world has its own little hub
level, it's nowhere near the size of the open

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.030
world parts of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes or
LEGO City: Undercover.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.430
It's a more linear, more streamlined game.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.690
But at the same time, there's still a lot
of content.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.670
Tons of characters to unlock, and swap between...freaking
Batman.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.040
And of course, you can always go back and
replay levels with new characters, which is

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.920
awesome.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.930
And there's that word again.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.930
Awesome.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.350
It's something movie games rarely are.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.590
But this one bucks the trend.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.850
I had an awesome time playing the PS3 version,
and I had just as much fun replaying it on

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.110
the Xbox 360.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.830
Sure, all the same complaints you might have
about the LEGO games will still apply here.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.600
The tedium, the simplicity, the technical
issues...but for what is primarily a kids

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.760
game, let alone a movie game...everything
is awesome.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.700
In The LEGO Movie Video Game.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:28.910
It's like if GoldenEye had more Duplo.
