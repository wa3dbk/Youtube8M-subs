Greetings everybody, this is slicedlime

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.720
and welcome back to another command block invention

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.500
So, in the Reddit comments for my last video about advanced furnaces and custom smelting recipes

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.020
somebody joked about it would be nice if you
could smelt coal into diamonds

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.270
and somebody else suggested that maybe you
could compress coal into diamonds

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.119
by taking a coal block and putting TNT around
it

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.340
and then making them blow up at exactly the
same time

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.850
A really cool suggestion by Drgn_nut

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.439
So let's try that

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.020
Hey, there we go

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.579
So, this is an obsidian box with just redstone
running underneath it

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.469
to a torch that goes up into the block where
we put the torch inside the contraption.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.800
and this obsidian box is simply here because

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.250
this is what happens if you blow that amount
of TNT up otherwise

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.250
So they have to blow up at once... we could....

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.920
So if I put these down

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.460
then light them individually

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.540
you can see that we just blew up the coal
block

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.170
We didn't get any diamond

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.590
See, not only do you not get a diamond

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.310
but the TNT actually gets pushed off by the
shockwave from the first ones

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.979
So they have to be set to explode on the very
same tick

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.719
But if I do that, I will always get a single
diamond from a coal block

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.579
which is pretty nice

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.880
And again, thanks to Drgn_nut on Reddit for
the idea

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.920
Very cool

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.200
So as you can see it's a very small system

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.039
I can throw in a download link for this if
somebody is interested

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.510
All it does is identify four PrimedTnt entities
around a coal block

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.170
that are all about to go off on the same tick

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.670
So I'll toss in a small download to this system

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.590
And again, cool discussions on Reddit

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.650
Thank you for watching and I will see you
next time
