00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.740
With a unique kickstand, beautiful screen,
and battery life for days, The 13” Lenovo

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.370
Yoga Tablet 2 with Windows is a fantastic
device.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.610
But with spotty Keyboard performance, and
less than stellar sound output, it isn't perfect.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.950
In this Bearded review, we will find out if
this 2-in-1 Yoga is the right fit for you.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:35.100
So don’t just do something, sit there!

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.760
But first….

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:52.040
Undeniably, the Yoga tablet 2 is a beautifully
crafted device.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.670
Attention to detail and quality materials
make this stand out head and shoulders above

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.940
the rest.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.390
With a 13.3” QHD (2560X1440) IPS Display,
this is great for enjoying movies, games,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.780
or just reading text.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.950
Seriously, i haven’t enjoyed media on a
mobile device this much----ever.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.029
The wide viewing angle combine with the vivid
display to bring a watching experience you

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:18.159
can share with other around you.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.959
Around the device you have the typical connectors
and buttons.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:27.781
On the sides are the volume control, power
button, audio jack HDMI and Micro-USB with

00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:35.209
OTG capabilities, meaning you can plug in
your normal usb devices to this tablet with

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:37.139
a simple adapter.

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:41.170
On the back you find the marquee feature of
the Yoga series, the Kickstand.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.919
more on that in a bit.

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:44.840
But after pressing the kickstand release.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.099
underneath the kickstand is the Micro SD card
reader capable of accepting SD Cards up to

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:52.099
64GB.

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:59.710
Inside is an Intel Atom z3745 with 4 cores
up to 1.86 GHz and 4GB Ram, Wifi (No LTE)

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.030
and Bluetooth.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.000
All this with a 12,800mAh Battery, JBL speakers
and Front facing camera.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.720
And something that truly makes this Tablet
special, it is running FULL Windows 8.1.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.370
So all your expected full productivity suite
of apps and programs work just like a regular

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.840
Windows laptop/Desktop.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.160
There are no concessions with Win 8.1 here,
so this will act just like you would expect

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.040
from a Windows device.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.950
Printing, connections over network, file sharing,
desktop mode, and more are available.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.110
Plus the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 is portable.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.110
Well…

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.110
Kinda

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.530
Let’s go ahead and talk about the Elephant
in the room.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.980
This thing is HUGE!

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.160
13 inches equates to a VERY large portable
device.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.280
Coming in almost 3 times the size of my 8
inch tablet, and weighing over 2 pounds without

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.810
the keyboard, this is difficult to carry around
like a tablet.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.390
Thankfully the chamber on the bottom of the
device has most of the bulk, so holding this

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.820
in portrait mode with one hand isn’t fatiguing
as the center of gravity is in your hand.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.980
But do expect this to set in your lap better
than holding it up.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.800
But that kickstand does help!

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.090
The Kickstand is the standout feature on all
yoga tablets, and it is superb.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.010
With the Kickstand you can Stand the tablet
almost straight up, perfect for tight spots.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.381
this is also great for setting up like a laptop,
or just watching movies/TV on your desk, or

00:03:30.381 --> 00:03:31.560
for video chats.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.360
Flip the tablet around and the kickstand gives
you the perfect angle for typing on the tablet,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.590
browsing the web,or playing games.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.700
Then, in a fantastically fun way to use this
device, you also have the ability to open

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.970
the kickstand all the way and hang the tablet
from a hook or nail.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.080
This is ideal for group watching a movie,
or even hanging it in your kitchen and catch

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.209
up on your favourite shows while preparing
dinner, or keep your recipe close by on a

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.060
screen you can see from anywhere in the kitchen.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.060
Or both!

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.060
With Windows Split-Screen multitasking, you
can see your recipe on one side, and you shows

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.060
on the other.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.820
Battery Life on the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 is
superb!

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.200
Under my stress test, (Streaming movies, playing
games, using multiple tabs in chrome, uploading

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.870
files, and sharing on the socials) I got well
over 8 hours of non stop use, with enough

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.160
juice left to keep using it for youtube and
socials through the evening, and didn’t

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.560
have to charge until the next day.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.940
Typical use of normal gaming sessions and
YouTube marathons with average social media

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.719
consumption saw enough battery power to last
for DAYS.

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:38.190
The included Bluetooth keyboard, on the other
hand, saw different results.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.990
Spotty at best, the bluetooth keyboard was
my biggest disappointment.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.529
When it worked, it worked great.

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:47.919
But with constant Bluetooth disconnects, and
a battery life of around 2 hours, this is

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.409
a big blemish on a device with such high quality
otherwise.

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.139
Productivity is easy on the Yoga 2, and the
Keyboard helps maintain office speeds for

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.110
typing, and navigating through Windows, and
when connected and powered, the keyboard was

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.379
up to any task i threw at it.

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:08.120
From typing as fast as i can, to using the
multi touch trackpad to zip through menus

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.300
and selection, the keyboard gave me glimpses
of what it could be.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.639
But sadly, knowing i had to conserve battery,
i found myself using the keyboard less and

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.211
just typing on the device itself most of the
time.

00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:21.211
And disconnecting in the middle of typing,
and having to turn it off, on, and wait for

00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:22.211
connect was just frustrating.

00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:23.211
But it does make a great screen protector.

00:05:23.211 --> 00:05:24.211
Other issues were far less experience-breaking.

00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:30.370
The JBL speakers on the Yoga Tablet, while
adequate, are simply that...adequate.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.520
They do the job fine, and volume levels were
great.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.219
I could hear everything clearly, but these
aren’t the speakers you have been waiting

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:37.270
for all your life.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.590
They are good, not great.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.449
And other than simple issues like auto rotate
needed a reboot to kick in from time to time,

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.599
and a lack of apps in the Windows Store, there
aren’t a lot of things to complain about

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.139
here.

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:56.580
The 13” Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 with Windows
is available for $599.99 and is a great device

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.580
to use.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.310
It makes windows fun!

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.639
The Intel Atom Processor might not be the
best, but it kept up with everything i threw

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:05.020
at it during my stress test.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.490
It would lose a few frames of video occasionally,
and would hesitate occasionally during extreme

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:17.210
stress tests, but never completely hung, or
crashed ever, and that was streaming movies,

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.810
uploading files, and playing games at the
same time!

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.180
For any real-world use this kept up, and did
so easily.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.940
It never felt like a trimmed down experience
or that any sacrifices were made by Lenovo.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.090
Simply put, this is a fantastic device.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.229
A beautiful display, stellar battery life,
unique yet functional kickstand, and quality

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:44.240
materials make the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 with
windows a great device.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.900
SOme bluetooth keybard issues, and other minor
issues prevent this from being perfect, but

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.889
this is still a very enjoyable device with
a lot of high points.At almost the size of

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:57.240
a 15” Macbook pro, it is HUGE!

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.819
You decide whether that is a good thing or
not, and it does make it difficult to pick

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:02.830
up and use as a handheld.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.150
But there is nothing like watching media on
this thing.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:17.430
After using this for about a month, i am left
with one main thought…

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:30.909
I WANT ONE!
