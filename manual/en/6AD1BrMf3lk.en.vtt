John Belll, III
VA Home Loan Guaranty Service:

00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:16.417
MPRs are Minimum Property
Requirements. They are the legal

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:21.250
requirement that VA has to make
sure that when a Veteran and

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.375
their family move into a home,
that that home is safe, sound,

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:29.000
and sanitary. Those requirements
range anywhere from peeling

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.833
paint to holes in the wall to
exposed electrical outlets.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:38.125
They just ensure that the
property is quality and sound

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.833
and you don't have to have those
worries when you move into

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:43.833
a VA home.

00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:48.416
&gt;&gt;Text:  Why does VA require home appraisals?

00:00:48.417 --> 00:00:51.833
VA cares about Veterans. And VA
not only wants the Veteran to

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:55.500
have a quality loan product, but
as well as a quality home when

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.750
they move in. And to try to take
those worries off a Veteran so

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.500
that they can worry about
spending time with their family,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.833
instead of worrying about
whether or not, you know, the

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:10.833
faucet's going to explode on
them or other things.

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:16.291
&gt;&gt;Text: How is the VA home loan product different?

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:19.833
The VA loan process should not
differ at all from the other

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:25.667
loan products. An appraiser
still does the appraisal,

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:29.292
a review is still completed of
that appraisal to ensure its

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:33.708
accuracy. At this point in time,
there are very little

00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:38.167
differences between the
timeliness of any other loan

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:42.292
product in VA. I will say that
the average close times right

00:01:42.292 --> 00:01:46.417
now are between 20 and 30
business days. And if you take

00:01:46.417 --> 00:01:49.000
into account the appraisal
process, the appraisal process

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
is anywhere between 12 and 14
business days.

00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:57.791
&gt;&gt;Text: Why choose a VA home loan?

00:01:57.792 --> 00:02:02.000
I've personally used the VA loan
three times in my life and, to

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.958
be honest, I'm about to use it
again. It has continually saved

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.625
me money. It's afforded me
options for my family that I

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:12.750
would not otherwise had in the
marketplace. It is the only

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.708
no-down-payment loan out there.
And not only is it the only

00:02:16.708 --> 00:02:20.583
no-down-payment loan, the fees
and the charges for a VA loan

00:02:20.583 --> 00:02:26.375
are considerably less than our
counterparts. And we have looked

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:29.625
at statistics that show that
VA loans save Veterans money.

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:31.625
So why wouldn't you?

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:39.625
