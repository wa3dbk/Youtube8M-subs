Hi, this is Karen Grete from Scandinavian
Today. I'm going to make brown gravy for

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.400
my hamburgers, for my Danish Hakkebøf, and
this is the way we usually make brown

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.190
gravy. I have here the pan where
I cooked the Danish Hakkebøf.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:24.800
I'm pouring in the potato water on the
pan. And also, I have a bouillon cube in

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:34.100
some water, and also in potato water. I'm
going to add that to the pan as well.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:42.670
I'm going to let it boil up. I'm going
to thicken the gravy with flour,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:51.680
which I have stirred into some cold water.
Of course, I want to make sure I don't get

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.960
any lumps in the flour. I used
two tablespoons of flour. Okay.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.380
And let me tell you, too, for the
Hakkebøf, I also like to add some onions

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:13.280
in the gravy. It gives it a nice flavor.
As well as a little bit of sugar.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:22.357
My mom always did that. It's bubbling now.
I'm adding the flour mixture to make the

00:01:22.357 --> 00:01:29.480
gravy. I keep stirring it until I see the
right consistency. And you can see it's

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.886
already getting thicker. And make
sure you don't get it lumpy.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.644
Now it's just about
right to the way I like it.

00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:07.122
Okay, let's see. Yeah, this is seems
to be just nice. Perfect. I will let it cook

00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:13.353
for another minute and then I'm
ready to serve my Hakkebøf.

00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:22.522
And here we have the finished gravy,
which I'm going to use for my Hakkebøf.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.399
