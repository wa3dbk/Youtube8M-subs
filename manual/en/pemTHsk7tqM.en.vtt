00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:04.800
tom coburn

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.490
he's uh... one of the senator from
oklahoma

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.460
uh... he was in the house before he was
in senate and he is famous for putting

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.549
together

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.149
uh... slideshow presentations on
s_t_d_'s

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.210
sexually transmitted diseases

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.859
these are usually disastrous

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.119
he will put up slides of disease
genitalia

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.810
now he does his dues for congress he
does it for the young in terms

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.060
so this is work it's super creepy

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.800
so he'll pull an all day turns for
congress and the like or i have a look

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.690
at noon

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.730
and the kids have to go in there through
this thing right any try to make sure

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.530
that they

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.840
he discourages them from having sex at
least while there were you in congress

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.660
you know given the number of republican
congressmen and senators who have had

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.450
sex with interns there

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.570
maybe it makes sense they may be just
reading other bowling party uh... so

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.270
they can weather next and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.260
uh... or certainly a lot of herbalism
head on their interns and sent them racy

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.230
text messages as mark foley did what do
you do and i got my pants around my

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.800
ankles have afsane so i guess co boris
looking out for now i think this year

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.440
he's gonna do it again soon doing since
ninety seven

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.080
it wasn't sure wilbur was staffer
whatever problem here

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.170
his they get the kids pizza

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.430
sounds nice

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.409
uh... and is about a hundred and fifty
to three hundred of them

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.980
abut it turns out that there is a
warning

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.799
that the senate ethics committee has

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.910
that says that if you're gonna get a
firm enough cite source

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.280
and they're gonna pay for it well that
violate semantics so they're not sure

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.810
thing for the slideshow together as
coburn must do and have a piece of the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.009
same time

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.780
so i a few thoughts on this first

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.300
i'm glad that they have sd strict ethics
codes in the senate

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.860
this is not the place where we really
ought to be looking out for stuff

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.150
birthday those guys are pocketing so
much money in a other ways legal and

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.520
illegal

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.770
this pizza party that they would you let
it go

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.400
i don't know how you do that but i think
that basic committee meets and says

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.599
titanic has been doing this for a while
is a little money

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.429
but it doesn't mean any harm by is not
going to her doesn't domino sends an you

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:19.639
know couples

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.659
but you know pots however much it takes
a few hundred review three hundred and i

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.900
don't know this thomas could be any
right

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.000
so level one let him go

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.789
bottom dot let me the visa number two

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.309
who wants to eat pizza during our
presentation

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:38.010
dot out naked around like here it is a
greenpeace

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.870
like that so he shows that supports the
solution yet but you know what he's up

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.790
like that

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.559
and then decides that the running and
playing mister

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:48.930
who was it that would be simple

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.110
that goes into the lake

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.480
there is a little bit

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.729

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:57.849

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.139
wetlands prior it's

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.269

colbern is a guy that obama reaches out

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.619

for

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:12.160
because that is called burn as muddy as
the years

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.919
