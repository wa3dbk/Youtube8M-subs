00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:26.869
Hello, I'm Shahram Forutan

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.830
I'm a World Champion in Powerlifting

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.041
and I'll talk about Benchpress Shirts now.

00:00:35.993 --> 00:00:40.319
A Benchpress Shirt will give you more tension

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:43.444
and prevent muscle tores.

00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:46.785
You can find shirts with 1 or multiple layers.

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:49.228
Here I've got some shirts with 1 layer

00:00:49.228 --> 00:00:51.575
by John Inzer.

00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:57.566
That one right here has 2 layers

00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.767
which is allowed in the WPC federation for example.

00:01:02.557 --> 00:01:06.650
I also have one which is made to measure just for me

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.993
with velcro.

00:01:08.098 --> 00:01:11.871
It's like a straitjacket

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:15.130
which you can use for benchpress.

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:21.095
If you actually use a benchpress shirt

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:27.798
then you also have to wear a jersey in a competition.

00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:32.054
It's often not allowed without jersey.

00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:34.838
That is something you have to know.

00:01:34.838 --> 00:01:39.786
Whether benchpress or the other two exercises...

00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:43.130
...as a beginner in Powerlifting you should start

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.683
with a simple and soft 1 layered shirt

00:01:44.683 --> 00:01:45.683
so you get used to it

00:01:45.683 --> 00:01:48.817
because it's very weird to wear it.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:53.169
After time you can slowly get stronger shirts.

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:57.754
There are very strong shirts which I don't have here right now...

00:01:58.726 --> 00:02:02.103
...even I can't wear them properly.

00:02:02.103 --> 00:02:06.444
Such a shirt helps you at the zero point.

00:02:06.444 --> 00:02:09.134
The zero point is right here.

00:02:09.134 --> 00:02:11.493
You will have massive tension at this point.

00:02:11.493 --> 00:02:13.230
Finding your exact zero point is important

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.208
because every shirt has a different cut.

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:19.467
For example shirts can be cut straight.

00:02:19.467 --> 00:02:25.335
So called "F6 Shirts" have different cuts.

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:31.807
It goes down so the barbell touches your lower chest.

00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:34.060
With the other it touches the mid area.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.654
If you find your personal zero point you'll have massive tension.

00:02:39.654 --> 00:02:44.886
With a 1-layered shirt you can increase your benchpress by up to 10 kilograms

00:02:44.886 --> 00:02:52.796
After pressing you will have cuts under your arms and bruises.

00:02:52.796 --> 00:03:00.213
You can use baby powder

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:05.698
or plastic bags to put the shirt on smoothly.

00:03:05.698 --> 00:03:11.665
But in competitions you must remove the plastic bags afterwards.

00:03:13.278 --> 00:03:16.523
Almost everything I said will be the same for the other two exercises.

00:03:16.523 --> 00:03:23.007
So if you go down using a shirt there will be massive tension at the zero point

00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:26.335
from where you can hold the tension easier and scream/push it out.

00:03:26.335 --> 00:03:29.641
Again for benchpress: you go down,

00:03:29.641 --> 00:03:31.794
you feel the tension, don't let go.

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:36.648
When the barbell touches your chest you push it out.

00:03:36.648 --> 00:03:41.124
You will feel a high explosiveness on your push.

00:03:41.506 --> 00:03:44.687
