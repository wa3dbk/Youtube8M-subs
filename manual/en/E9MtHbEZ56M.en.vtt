00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.050
I have the boost with seven or eight pedals
on my board and it still sounds like I'm just

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.780
plugging in and going.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.710
The buffer in this is great, tone-wise there
is no difference.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.010
You can actually plug the volume pedal straight
into the boost without having to plug the

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.850
volume pedal into any of your other overdrives
or anything, so it just takes completely out

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.280
of the loop and still works just like a regular
volume pedal.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.410
It's almost like when you click it on, it's
just like you just walked back and turned

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:45.789
up your amp a little bit, and that's really
what a boost should do.
