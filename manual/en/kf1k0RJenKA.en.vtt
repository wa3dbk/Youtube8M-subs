Hi there! I’m Fran Freedman of Morning Starr
Animal Sanctuary, and I’m here to tell you

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:13.740
about litter pans and litter training on behalf
of expertvillage.com. Ferrets definitely require

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.090
special litter. We have here an example of
pine pellets. You can get some called Good

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.640
News, they’re green and they’re old newspaper.
They can not use cat littler, which was used

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.660
years ago, as it is toxic to them, especially
the ones with the scents in them. It also

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.950
can cause upper respiratory disease from the
dust. This is pretty much dust free. When

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:49.649
it gets wet it just dissolves down to a fine
kind of…almost like a saw dust. It’s easy

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.540
to clean out and empty, smells nice piney
when you’re finished doing the litters.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.930
Litter pans, this is the usual litter pan
size for a ferret. Depending on the cage,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.549
as you can see here, there is corner litters,
this one here. The corner litters have little

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.299
notches on the back so that when you put them
in they hook on. Ferrets do not like things

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.760
against the wall. Even these ones, I usually
drill two holes and put a twist tie and keeps

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:31.360
it against the wall. There is also this one
which is called a high back litter. These

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.700
are great because ferrets tend to go in, back
up, and lift their butts and on a shorter

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:46.360
litter pans, they tend to go over. Just so
you know, ferrets are never 100% litter trained.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.350
You can try with repetition, by when they
wake up putting them into the litter pan and

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.560
just keep putting them back there until they
go in there, and that will help with litter

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.869
training but there is always mistakes. This
cage here has 4 litter boxes and they still

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.240
manage to find a spot that they like to go
better than where I put the litter boxes.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.529
You can even make your own litter boxes out
of Tupperware containers and cut out the sides.

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:19.799
When we have an elderly ferret, we like to
use ones like this that are shorter so that

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.059
it’s easy for them to get into.
