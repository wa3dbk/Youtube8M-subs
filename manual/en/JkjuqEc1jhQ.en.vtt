00:00:17.794 --> 00:00:20.613
When we first landed in the
Solomon Islands the sharper

00:00:20.613 --> 00:00:22.730
the [? hateness ?] probably the
thing that caught us off

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.170
guard the most.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.630
And just finding our fate the
first few days was quite

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.130
interesting.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.030
We were pretty unsure.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.753
The base was a lot bigger
than we thought it was.

00:00:30.753 --> 00:00:34.510
And just trying to figure out
what we're going to do here

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.430
and get the job started.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.445
Everyone was really
keen to get going.

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:38.730
I think we all were nervous.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.770
We were definitely excited but
fairly nervous as to what the

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.573
challenge was to bring.

00:00:43.573 --> 00:00:46.090
But at the whole way through,
we stuck together.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.555
You've got your mate
right there.

00:00:48.555 --> 00:00:51.325
And yeah, I've never
felt lost at all.

00:00:51.325 --> 00:00:55.380
The haunting hour is a lot
different than Australia.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.060
Very hard.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.370
We stepped off the plane and
thought, yep, we're definitely

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.930
out here in this area
of the world.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.000
It seems to be very friendly
out there.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.840
We were going in deployment
overseas.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.270
There's usually a

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.830
pre-deployment training period.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.420
The prep pressure we
had prior to coming

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.790
here was really good.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.740
We spent some time in Adelaide
and the Maroubra Beach

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.770
training ground.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.800
And from there, we went and did
some more climate-specific

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.020
training in Canungra, Queensland
and the staff we

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.833
had and with the training we
have before he came here

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:27.220
definitely prepared us well to
come and do our job properly.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.550
Pretty much as soon as we get
into country, we are fit and

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.720
ready to go.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.130
But I do give us a small
hands-on to the climate since

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.955
we're here.

00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:38.170
Well, the regional assistance
mission in Solomon Islands

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.120
first deployed here
in July of 2003

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.890
consisting of some 14 countries.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.175
They came here because of
troubles between rival gangs

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:52.940
and ethnic groups that were here
in the Solomon Islands.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.720
And very quickly, they were able
to remove the key threats

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.740
to the people of the Solomon
Islands, a large number of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.150
weapons and then proceeded to
create their conditions so

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.520
that the Solomon Island's
government could reconstitute

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.850
itself and then create a secure
space for it's people.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.510
Our role here is to deter any
unstabilising forces and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.320
basically give independence
back to the Solomon Island

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.680
government.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.934
We work alongside the PPF, the
Participating Police Forces,

00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:28.140
as well as the Royal Solomon
Islands Police Force.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.040
I'm a vehicle mechanic working
on Unimog six-wheel drive,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.220
four-wheel drive land rovers.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.042
And our job with the
guys on the ground

00:02:42.042 --> 00:02:43.430
is extremely important.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.510
As we say, we've got a fully
petered out six-wheel drive

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.443
vehicle with all their tool
boxes and everything they need

00:02:49.443 --> 00:02:51.370
to do repair.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.340
Infantry, if they have a problem
out in the field with

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.663
their vehicles, we'll go out as
a forward repair team, fix

00:02:57.663 --> 00:03:02.175
it on sight, and then escort
them back or they keep going

00:03:02.175 --> 00:03:03.169
with their duties.

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.540
Combat medical attendant's role
is primarily focused on

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.020
providing pre-hospital
care to soldiers.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.532
Our job is to provide emergency
care to soldiers,

00:03:12.532 --> 00:03:15.281
and we also provide our medical
administration and

00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:16.531
primary health care.

00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:22.730
My role within the army is I'm
a communications systems

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.670
operator, and that entails
robust, secure, and flexible

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.850
communications between the
commander and his troops

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.460
wherever they are
in the field.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.800
I'm part of the radio
detachment of the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.170
headquarters, and it's our job
to see that the commanding

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.560
officer has communication with
his troops wherever they be.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.170
I'm in infantry.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.920
Infantry soldiers are typically
are known as the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.130
guys with the rifle on their
shoulder because I'm a hard

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.380
readiness reserve member.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.292
I have so far been here in
the Falkland Islands

00:03:57.292 --> 00:03:57.710
definitely the best.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.270
I'm really proud to
be over here and

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.150
representing my country.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.840
I feel very honoured to be able
to come over here and

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.500
know that what we're doing helps
another country, one of

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.370
our neighbours, the
Solomon Islands.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.865
It's a really good feeling to
know that we're making a

00:04:08.865 --> 00:04:10.750
difference over here.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.450
The highlight for me in the
Solomon Islands has been

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.950
actually doing the job and
seeing it all come together

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.240
and I'm really enjoying it.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.709
And I know there's still
so much more to learn.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.780
I think that that's actually
knowing that you're doing it

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.350
for real, but not only that, you
can actually look at the

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.360
community and see that what
you're doing is actually

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.610
beneficial.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.350
If we're out in the
jungle, it's hot.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.820
It's sweaty.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.280
We're up and down mountains
and it's not easy.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.070
It's not an easy job, and if
you're physically tired, then

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.530
you're going to let
yourself down.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.850
You're going to let
your mates down.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.970
And so we're not going to be
able to get the job done.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.633
If we have a high level of
fitness, it means we're going

00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:51.490
to get the task done and return
and make everything

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.590
successful.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.410
It's tough.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.346
It's not easy, but the
rewards are there.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.080
I was really surprised because
the living conditions are

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.190
really good.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.010
You've got that personal
little bit of space.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.450
You've got your own identity
in the area that you come

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.085
from, but you're still close
enough to your mates that you

00:05:10.085 --> 00:05:13.660
can yell at, or chuck me
something, or yeah.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.320
So it was really good.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.520
I felt very comfortable
the whole time.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.490
We're living in rooms of
four at the moment.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.500
Obviously, we're in an
environment where we're not

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.405
expecting to be in the
same level of luxury

00:05:24.405 --> 00:05:25.730
as we have at home.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.990
It's almost like a tropical
resort at times.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.480
There's a swimming pool and the
food is fantastic, and gym

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.460
facilities are really good.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.710
We've got a pool table,
table tennis.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.830
You've got the running chant,
and that's all.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.890
If you want to get out and
about, if you want to hide

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.790
back in your room and watch TV,
watch movies, or email,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.310
Facebook, you've got all that
opportunity as well.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.560
We're pretty well
looked after.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.740
We've got welfare in here,
internet access.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.310
You can sort of send an email
off, use the welfare phones,

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.240
ring home in the evenings, say
good night, keep in touch, so

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.940
that makes it a lot easier.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.317
That's really unlimited
availability.

00:06:03.317 --> 00:06:06.576
So whenever we're required or
whenever we have a desire to

00:06:06.576 --> 00:06:08.087
get in touch with people
at home, we have

00:06:08.087 --> 00:06:09.337
access to the resources.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.050
Technically, while we're
here, we're on the job

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.210
seven days a week.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.380
And when possible, they find
time for us to have our

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.640
periods of activities.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.620
So Sundays is usually a day off
depending if you're on a

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.330
task or not.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.555
And Saturdays is usually
a half day.

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:31.470
But that's pretty flexible.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.860
We get the occasional chance to
go out and experience the

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.910
community and the culture here,
and we've been given a

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.390
pretty good opportunity
to get out and see a

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.640
few different things.
