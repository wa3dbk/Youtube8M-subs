00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:34.835
How 'bout you leave the kid to me and go fight Terra?

00:00:36.063 --> 00:00:40.183
After all, Terra's an enemy of the Masters, am I right?

00:00:43.684 --> 00:00:45.324
Who are you?

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:54.309
Pretty lucky for me you two came all the way out here.

00:00:54.378 --> 00:01:00.938
All that's left is to finish you off right before his eyes, and Terra'll fall to the darkness.

00:01:01.386 --> 00:01:04.626
Mission accomplished, dude.

00:01:04.688 --> 00:01:06.408
Shut up!

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:11.775
So even brats can wield a keyblade, huh?

00:01:12.046 --> 00:01:15.606
Nice glare you got there.

00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:22.283
The bond that connects our hearts is not so weak as to break under your tactics!

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.940
There's no way Terra will fall to the darkness!

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:36.202
Aqua!

00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:58.455
Man, I gotta say...keyblade bearers are tough!

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.489
Just means I made the right choice.

00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:09.325
Well, I guess that's all the stalling he needs.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:12.624
What?

00:02:15.723 --> 00:02:17.203
Ven!

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:24.056
Aqua!

00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:58.563
Stop!

00:03:07.132 --> 00:03:09.812
Good job.

00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:17.815
Now my body will be destroyed...

00:03:17.893 --> 00:03:20.973
and I will fuse with you.

00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:26.015
It's time to create the X-blade!

00:03:32.184 --> 00:03:34.864
You're the one controlling the Unversed?

00:03:37.432 --> 00:03:44.432
These are the creatures which grew from the negative feelings created when we separated from each other.

00:03:45.226 --> 00:03:51.706
They're immature beings, and, in a way, they're a part of my own feelings.

00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:55.285
I thought if I scattered them around the worlds...

00:03:55.324 --> 00:04:00.644
...you'd each go on your own little journey, and everything went according to plan.

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:07.455
As a bonus, you all even got stronger as you defeated the Unversed.

00:04:07.556 --> 00:04:15.196
And the sentiments of those that were defeated, once again returned to me.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.130
Thanks to you, everything progressed real nicely.
