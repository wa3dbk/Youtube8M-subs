00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.330
The Prophet Daniel was shown things that would
occur in the last days.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:15.080
One of those things was the "DAILY" being
taken away from people.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.720
The Abomination that makes Desolate was set
up in that place, and people NO LONGER had

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.319
the "DAILY".

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:34.670
Jesus ALSO spoke of the Abomination that makes
desolate, and when YOU see it TO RUN to FLEE

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.309
to the mountains.

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:44.679
People have their daily relationship with
Jesus snatched away from them, and MOST of

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.390
them don't even realize it because they do
not care.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.370
They would rather have a FORM of godliness;
"an abomination" set up in that place.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.640
They do NOT flee from wickedness
because they enjoy the FORM of godliness,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.660
they enjoy the abomination that makes their
OWN lives desolate.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.790
The "Daily" is the daily walk with the Lord
Jesus!

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.270
And obedience to HIM!

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.360
THE Lord JESUS brings life and those who listen
to HIM

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.000
and OBEY HIM THEY will see that life and they
will see that WAY that leads to life, but

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.110
those who put the FORM of godliness and set
THAT up

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.380
as an abomination, THEY will ONLY have their
bible to lead them, they will only have their

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.380
so called "pastor" and "wise counsel" to lead
them.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.310
And when their pastor fails to lead them,
and their bible fails to lead them, they will

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.430
have absolutely NO salvation
because the bible NEVER brought salvation

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.030
and a pastor NEVER brought salvation.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.240
JESUS CHRIST BRINGS SALVATION!

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.140
And those who listen to HIM OBEY HIM and they
go to HIM and THEY find true life!

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.480
Life is NOT found in anything else other than
JESUS CHRIST.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.790
Do NOT set up an abomination and make your
life desolate or the lives of others desolate,

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.450
but RUN TO JESUS because HE is the Way
the Truth and the Life!

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.640
Do you TRULY have the DAILY relationship with
Jesus?

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.880
Are you on your knees in prayer listening
to HIM?

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.680
Do you have the guidance of the Holy Spirit?

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.170
Don't be like these people who have the FORM
of godliness,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.820
but who deny the power of the Holy Spirit,
who have an abomination set up in their churches.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.960
Who make the bible and idol and who make other
people their strength but do NOT rely on the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.400
power of the Holy Spirit.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.689
May the grace of Jesus be with you.
