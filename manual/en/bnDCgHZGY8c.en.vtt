00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.630
Hi, I'm Les Whitley, here today to talk to
you about how you can get a total body workout

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.670
with using something as simple as pair of
dumbbells and a Swiss ball. This could be

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.279
done in your gym or at your home with minimal
equipment and maximal effort. Let's move the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.431
Swiss ball to the side for now and begin with
dumbbells. In total body exercise is you want

00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:25.000
to emphasize using the large muscle groups
first. Beginning with something such as a

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.160
body weight or a resisted squat. The squat
again with dumbbells, place it shoulder level,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.320
good body position, maintain a nice tight
posture, initiating the movement by beginning

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.019
at the hips, lowering body down and all the
way up. In a total body exercise and activity,

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.260
you want to emphasize good control of the
movement, through full range of motion, and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.569
again the squat, in using resistance you're
not only working muscles of the legs, but

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:58.899
muscles of the core as well. In a lower body
exercise, it's good especially full body to

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:06.050
move to an upper body exercise. The seated
press is one good way to start that off. With

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:15.480
exercises such as, the seated chest press,
begin with dumbbells controlled to the side,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.800
rolling your body back, keeping a good, nice
stable neutral position, press the dumbbells

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:34.310
up, back down under control to avoid bouncing
on the ball. When done, roll back up on the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:42.410
ball and replace the weights. The ball's great
because it adds a degree of difficulty, forcing

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.550
you to stabilize and use those muscles of
the core while training the muscle group listed.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.520
For example, using muscle of the chest, shoulders
and arms in the pressing motion, we're using

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.170
muscles of the core and lower body to stabilize
while on this unstable bouncy surface. Full

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.920
body exercises such as a squat or an upper
body press engage all the muscles of the body

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.159
adding an additional degree of difficulty
using a Swiss ball makes it complete and total.
