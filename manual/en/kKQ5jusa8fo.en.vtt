Hey Guys!

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.589
Today I'm going to be sharing my thoughts,
opinions, and feels on Red Queen by Victoria

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.589
Aveyard.

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:12.300
Can we take a moment to just appreciate how
beautiful this cover is?

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.850
Because it's stunning, it is so beautiful,
and it's shiny!

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.590
Gotta love those shiny covers!

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.700
If you don't know what Red Queen is about,
it's about a society where you're separated

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.700
by your blood type.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.100
You've got the silvers, who are the elite.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.100
They run the world.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.110
WHO RUN DA WORLD?

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.110
SILVERS!

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.990
And then you've got the reds who are basically
the dirt on the ground that the silvers walk

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.470
on, like they are basically nobodies.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.960
They're average, they don't have any special
abilities &amp; all the silvers have these crazy

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.250
fascinating abilities.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.200
We follow a girl named Mare, who just down
right despises the silvers and then one day

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.300
she finds herself working alongside them.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.200
One day she unlocks a power inside herself
that she didn't realize she has.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.719
Which is something that's unheard of, because
Mare is a red and she's not supposed to have

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:54.910
any sort of abilities.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.210
Madness ensues and the silvers are left to
do some major damage control.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.530
So that's what Red Queen's all about, now
let's talk about the writing!

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.319
I really liked Victoria Aveyard's writing
style, specifically I want to talk about the

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:09.759
action sequences, because those were some
of the best action written scenes that I've

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.240
seen in a long time.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.590
Sometimes I just get really confused during
action scenes, because there's just so much

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.259
going on and it's just a lot to take in, but
Victoria Aveyard did a really great job just

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.070
making it so easy to understand and follow
and also make it super exciting and thrilling.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.640
While I did really like this world and found
it a bit fascinating, I still feel like it's

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.920
kind of a bit underdeveloped.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.039
There's a few things that I just don't quite
understand yet and things that I wish would

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.689
have been more fleshed out throughout the
book.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.950
For example, in this book there's a war that's
taking place and you don't really know that

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.999
much about the war.

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:41.009
We don't really get much background as to
why this war is taking place.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.200
The plot was exciting, I will say though that
it was a bit slower paced at the beginning,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.609
it took me around 200 pages to really get
sucked in, but once I hit that 200 page mark,

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.730
it was so exciting and thrilling and interesting
and I just wanted to keep reading, because

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.130
so much was happening.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.329
So many plot twists so many turns, that it
just made for such an exciting reading experience.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.810
And we have such a great cast of characters,
I feel like this book was really driven by

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.979
the characters, which is something that I'm
a major fan of, when you've got good characters,

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.010
I'm gonna like your book, because I love when
characters are just awesome and there's so

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.680
many awesome characters in this book.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.540
We've got Mare who is a very unique character,
I really like the way she held herself and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.010
how she handled different situations.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.530
I think we often see these characters who
try to hold it together when they're going

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.920
through trials and tribulations, and I felt
like Mare's character was willing to face

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.011
her emotions head on when something was going
wrong she wasn't afraid to feel and it was

00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:35.860
just really nice to see her be vulnerable
and to just let herself feel the feels, ya

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.860
know I'm sayin?

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.870
I also love the princes, we've got maven and
cal obviously they're very twisted characters,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.710
because they think that what's going on with
this society is okay when it's totally not

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.710
okay.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.820
But I still really liked them, they were great
characters.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.790
And I really liked Julian and Lucas and there's
just so many great characters, in this book.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.750
Even amazing villains, like the villains are
villains are villains that you love to hate.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.230
So those are my thoughts, opinions, and feels
on Red Queen by Victoria Aveyard you guys

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.650
should let me know down below if you're going
to pick up this book, I'm actually going to

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.790
be jumping into a little spoiler section here
now, because I have a few things that I want

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.570
to talk about, so without further ado, let's
talk spoilers.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.460
There's only a few things that I wanna talk
about, the first one is the freaking Maven

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.460
betrayal.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.560
I did not see that coming at all, that was
one of the things where I was like, wait wait

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.760
stop what what what are you doing?

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.760
STOP IT.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.850
NOOO NOO NO THAT'S NOT HOW THINGS WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE, but AHHH I probably should have seen

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.490
it coming though, like this is one of the
plot twists that I probably should have been

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.650
like okay so Maven's actually going to betray
her, like I should have seen that coming,

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.680
because what character just so easily turns
there backs on their parents and is like OH

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.780
YEAH I'M GOING AGAINST MY PARENTS!

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.260
SCREW THIS SOCIETY THAT I'VE BEEN RAISED IN!

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.090
Like no.. there's no way, so I should've seen
that coming, but I didn't and it pissed me

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.580
off, because I liked Maven.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.500
He really built up this trust, not only with
Mare, but with me, like I trusted Maven and

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.540
then he just went and turned his back on me
and he's like SCREW YOU and I'm over here

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.660
like WHAT THE HECK MAN?

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.490
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE OUR FRIEND.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.490
but now you turn your back on us and ahhh
just such an evil character.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.960
Another thing that I want to talk about is
a character death that I'm not okay with and

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.631
I'm sitting here sad about it and that is
Lucas.

00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:16.810
Why did Lucas have to die?

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.840
WHY DID HE HAVE TO DIE?

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.560
To me Lucas is like Cinna from the Hunger
Games, like they're on the same level for

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:29.259
me and so when he just died I just was like
WHYYYY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO MY FEELS VICTORIA?

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.259
WHY DID YOU KILL HIM?

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.270
WHY?

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.280
WHY?

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.289
WHY?

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:39.810
And the last thing I wanna talk about is shade,
I knew he wasn't dead, I knew he wasn't dead!

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.499
I picked up on that sucker.

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:45.129
I never trust a character death, when we the
readers don't see the death happen.

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.029
If we don't see it, it didn't happen.

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:51.590
So those are just a few of the things that
I wanted to talk about, because HOLY CRAP

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.039
this book, the plot twists.. so many plot
twists that I just did not see coming.

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.330
Some of them I probably should have seen coming,
but I just didn't.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.499
You guys should let me know down below if
you have read this book, if there was anything

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:05.849
you saw coming, if there was anything that
was just like WHAT?!

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.699
THE CRAP? because that was me a majority of
this book.

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.229
I was just like WHAAAAT?

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.229
WHAAT?

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:12.229
WHAAAAT?

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.830
So yes, let me know down below!

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.279
&amp; I will see you guys soon with a new video!

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:19.400
LATER!

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.389
If you don't know what Red Queen is alksdfjlaksjf
So that's what Red Queen is all about I just

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.809
hit myself in the eyebrow hey hey hey hey
feel the feels!
