&gt;&gt; YOU WOULD BE FORGIVEN FOR
THINKING-- BUT THE GLASSES

00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:48.275
ACTUALLY CONTAIN BLOOD.

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:54.982
&gt;&gt; MOST BLOOD HAS COPPERY IRON
TASTE TO IT.

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:59.052

FOOTAGE OF BLACK PEOPLE ANYWHERE

YOU WILL NEVER FIND IT.

00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:05.158
YOU CAN GOOGLE FOREVER.
