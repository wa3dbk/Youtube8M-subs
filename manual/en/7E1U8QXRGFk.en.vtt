00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.640
On behalf of expertvillage.com, my name is
Dean Forrest with Sedona Coffee Roasters.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.830
I am here to tell you about roasting coffee.
Okay first thing you are going to want to

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:18.120
do when making a latte, is pack your shot
and I've got the grinder right here and you

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.580
are going to want to grind enough for each
shot to get the best flavor out of it. This

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.320
is the part where you pack it down. You want
to make sure to do it nice and firm but if

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.910
you go too firm, but nothing is going to be
able to pour through there. You want to make

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.510
sure it is firm but not too firm. I put that
in the machine and that screws in there and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.149
we are done with that for the moment and here
I've got my milk already measured out and

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.210
the temperature probe already in there and
what I am going to do is put the tip of the

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.739
wand all the way down to the bottom of the
steam cup and I am going to turn it on just

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.210
a little bit to get it started. I get that
rolling around in there and I pull the wand

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.240
up to the top and keep it about a centimeter
underneath. Right here is where we are introducing

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.630
the air into the milk mixture and right about
when it gets to a hundred is where I am going

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:24.670
to dip the wand all the way in the bottom
and turn it up full blast. This gets it rolling

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.540
around in there and the air is circulating.
Now it is about to get up to a 140 degrees

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.950
and that is the average temperature. I am
just going to close it off there and pull

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.450
it out.l I am going to immediately wipe this
milk off of my steam wand with a clean rag

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:47.750
so that it doesn't dry on there and mess up
the next latte I am going to make. Pour the

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.920
milk out of the wand. Now I am going to pour
the shots. Some people can do it right as

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.210
they are getting done with their milk. That
is a good way when you are in a rush to get

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.969
things done. Now these shots you are going
to want to make sure you use them before about

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.090
12 or 13 seconds go by because that is when
they start to go bad and get a little bitter

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.230
tasting. So you want it either in your customer's
hand or you are going to want to merge them

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.690
with milk by that time. Pour it in the bottom
of the cup here and this is the fun part.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.290
Make sure the air is nice and swished around
in here. If there is too much foam on the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.180
top I am going to want to use a spoon but
I think I did pretty well getting it mixed

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.930
in there. I am going to pour where the Espresso
meets the cup. All the way up to the top.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.299
You've not a nice little swirl going on and
that is a latte.
