Access your music in the cloud, type efficiently
with only one hand, and some of that exciting

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.120
news I’ve been promising you.... I’m Cali
Lewis. Welcome to GeekBeat.TV!

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.160
Access your music in the cloud, type efficiently
with only one hand, and in app purchasing

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:25.710
for Android.... I’m Cali Lewis. Welcome
to GeekBeat.TV!

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.030
Netflix

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.080
Amazon has been on fire lately!! Yesterday
they announced something that we’ve been

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.199
waiting on Apple to release with iTunes. The
ability to store your music in the cloud.

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:43.239
Meaning it’s not tied to a single computer,
or only accessible from your iPod. Now, with

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.610
any of your music...NOT only Amazon MP3s...you
can upload to the cloud and access any time,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.680
any where. Except iOS devices at the moment...
Blogger Andy Martin is testing and will keep

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.239
you up to date [L3]. You get 5GB of storage
free, but if you buy an entire MP3 album,

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.310
they’ll increase that to 20GB free for the
first year. If you keep the 20GB storage plan,

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.520
it’ll be $20/year, and of course there are
larger plans. It’s not just MP3s, by the

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.220
way - you can keep files and movies too.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.409
After much anticipation and chatter about
the need for it, Google announced it’s launching

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.000
Android in-app purchasing. Some apps in the
Apple App Store are paid, but some are free

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.430
with an option for an in-app upgrade. Basically
you download it for nothing, get some content,

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.790
and if you want more - bonuses, you can upgrade
FROM the app itself. That’s how my app works

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.409
(if you don’t have it - geekbeat.tv/caliapp).
This hasn’t been possible with Android apps

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.509
- it’s either a free app or a paid one.
But as of now, some apps are now available

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.700
with this new capability. This is great news
for developers, but also for consumers who

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.700
want the choice.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.549
If you guys aren’t familiar with Kickstarter,
it’s a site where people with ideas ask

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.909
for help in making their dream a reality.
The community pitches in when they find a

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.830
good, worthwhile project. A couple of these
ideas have come my way lately. One is the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.030
iChair. It’s extremely simple, but very
nicely implemented. The iChair is an iPad

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.960
case that includes two kickstands for standing
your iPad up, either in landscape mode or

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.750
portrait mode, and you can choose how far
back it leans. The kickstands are flush with

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.910
the case, so you don’t even realize they’re
there until you need them. And the material...

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.560
it’s soft, especially the inside! When I
handle it, I get the feeling the people behind

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.280
this put a lot of care into making it. If
you’d like to get behind the project, geekbeat.tv/ichair

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.280
will get you there.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.530
As you know, I’ve been a little Netflix
obsessed lately. But I don’t think I’m

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.810
the only one. The service has gone nuts with
subscriptions and it’s on every set top

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.040
box you can imagine! If you haven’t joined
the 20 million of us, do it already! This

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.830
is one thing you don’t have to be ashamed
about in terms of following the crowd. Because

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.370
you can watch what you want, when you want
it with their streaming service. Or, have

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.810
DVDs sent to your mailbox. The turn around
is super quick! No late fees or due dates!

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.560
Get a free trial by going to netflix.com/geekbeat
- make sure you use that URL so they know

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.560
I sent you!

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.810
The other Kickstarter project is more of a
futuristic project. The Keyglove is a glove

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:42.269
with inputs built in that gives you the entire
keyboard at your fingertips. Literally...

00:03:42.269 --> 00:04:03.310
It’s not a 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.669
totally new idea, but they’re combining
some efforts that seem to make it more of

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:11.799
a complete idea. And they’re keeping it
open source. This combined with natural user

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.669
interface gestures, like the Kinect, could
prove to be VERY interesting. geekbeat.tv/keyglove

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.870
will get you to the project if you’d like
to support them.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.889
I’ve been promising you some exciting news
from all of us on the Livid Lobster team.

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.759
I can finally tell you. You know CES, the
biggest gadget show of the year. Well, the

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:36.050
company who puts it on is called the CEA.
They also put on a mid year event in New York

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.259
called the CEA Line Shows. Think of it as
a mini CES. This is a trade only event, BUT

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.180
we’ve partnered with them this year. Geek
Beat will be their official streaming partner

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.419
- we’re going to be streaming live on Geek
Beat LIVE for two straight full days so that

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.360
YOU guys can actually participate and see
what’s happening. This is a first, and we’re

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.039
looking forward to giving you the sneak peak
into what exhibitors are showing off and the

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.800
exciting news coming out of the event. It’s
happening June 22nd and 23rd, and we’ll

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.330
be fleshing out all the details on the geekbeat.tv
website. But just know that you’ll be able

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.479
to watch live all day, both days from live.geekbeat.tv,
the same place where we stream Geek Beat LIVE

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.360
every single Friday at 4pm Eastern.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:34.909
Thanks for watching and spreading the word,
everyone! I’m Cali Lewis. Bye!
