00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.020
Hi, I am Jared back with another simple
science demonstration on

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.210
the whole idea that warm air rises, cold
air sinks. And it is true for water. And the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.380
cool thing about this is, it is kid
friendly,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.809
kid tested, mother approved, nobody is
going to get hurt. We have hot water, cold

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.300
water- we do not want kids dipping their
hands in there coming out with

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.260
third-degree burns.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.320
We want a safe way for kids to really
look at what is happening,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.750
analyze it, think about it again and
again and again.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.679
That is what science is. So we have a 
very, very simple setup here.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.300
You can see I have a jar of water, it is
hot, hence the red.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.620
I have a jar of cold water, it is cold hence
the blue, and all we are going to do is

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.020
put the food coloring in. Take the lid
off.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.950
You do not have to be conservative here,
you just squirt it in.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.730
You want it to be a nice dark, deep red.
Watch how quickly that red actually

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.809
disperses

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.710
and just totally fans out in all of
the water.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.890
It is not taking long, and compare that
with the blue because it is actually

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.559
interesting scientifically what is
happening. Squirt some blue in past the

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:04.189
ice.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.439
You can see the blue sort of stays
together.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.540
It is not spreading out as quickly as the
red.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.590
That is actually part of the process of
what is happening here.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.400
The molecules here, the water
molecules are heated so they are moving

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.070
quickly, they are moving, moving, moving,

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.250
and it is
actually helping to stir up that water. You

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.159
cannot see it,

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.180
sort of an invisible stir. Here, it is not
moving so quickly. You can see it is not

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.340
really spreading out there, so I am going to speed it up with my straw,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.439
stir it up there. Stir this one up here,

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.920
make sure it is good and ready. Now what I want to do,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.939
is create a column

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.329
of separation between the two colors to
see what happens.

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.360
And it is a real simple principle. And we have
all done this with soda,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.259
stick the straw in your soda, put your thumb
over top and pull it out and the soda stays

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.110
in the straw.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.729
Well that is a different scientific
concept so we are focusing here on just one

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.420
simple concept. So I am going to start with the
hot water first,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.020
dip it in, put my thumb on top and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.799
ta-da! it is staying in there. Now here is
the magic.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.020
It is not magic, it is science. I am going to move it over,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.510
put my straw deeper into the blue, let
my thumb off,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.140
put my thumb back on, and trap the water
inside. It sounds so complicated, but it is

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.610
not.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.069
Here we go; deeper, off,

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.420
cap, and I have a beautiful

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.629
column and the red and blue are not mixing. I have the hot water on the top, the cold

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:31.750
water on the bottom,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.629
and it is not mixing, Why? Warm air rises,
cold air sinks.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.599
That warm water is a whole lot lighter and
less dense than the blue and it is not

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.410
separating!  I can look at it.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.170
I am a kid and I am not getting burned, beautiful! Now if I leave this sit

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.590
long enough, the temperatures will even
out and they will start to mix.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.940
You can see it is sort of starting to happen
right in the middle.  It is cool!

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.519
What if we reverse it? That is where you
see the science happen.

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.440
So I am going to start with the cold and
then go into the hot. Have the kids think

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.580
about what is going to happen.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.629
Have them predict, have them make a
hypothesis and test it.

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.739
If they mess up, so what? You dump it out, 
it is cool. I have my blue,

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.940
now I am going to go a little deeper, take my
thumb off.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.099
What happened almost instantaneously?

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.360
They are mixing, you can see the red
actually rising in the blue,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.459
and they are mixing. Why?  Warm air rises,
cold air sinks. Warm water rises, cold

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.319
water sinks.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.459
Such a simple concept that kids can play
with

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.010
and learn about at the same time.That is science.
I am Jared, thanks for watching.
