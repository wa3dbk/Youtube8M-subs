00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
Barbi

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.360
Tell me

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.540
Why do you say that you feel weird?

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.960
Oh, doctor. Doctor...

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.640
What happens...

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.100
What happens...

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.440
What do you feel?

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.000
What happens is that...

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.040
Is that... It's very difficult to say because I...

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.960
Tell me what you're hiding, Barbi!

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.200
Tell me!

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.640
Tell me!

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.240
I am...

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.660
A Barbi with superpowers.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.600
I can fly!

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.740
♫Flying music and sounds effect♫

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.400
I have super strenght!

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.240
Bitch! You stold my boyfriend!

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.800
I didn't steal your boyfriend. I don't even know you.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.880
Bitch! How do you say that to me?!

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.860
How did you steal him from me?

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.860
I didn't steal him.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.960
You are such a bitch!

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.740
Bitch! You stold my boyfriend.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.440
I'll take your head!

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.800
And really high snobbism.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.000
Hello, Barbi girlfriends!

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.120
I mean, girl. You dress terribly.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.860
hahahaha. You dress terribly.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.200
*Cries*

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.720
My love,...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Today I went to the psychologist.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.240
And I told him about my superpowers.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.800
But he didn't believe me! He told me that I was crazy!

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.160
Oh, my dear. It's just that sometimes it's very difficult to believe.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.280
I don't believe in it sometimes.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.240
Oh my God!

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.360
How can you not believe in me?

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.760
I know!

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.600
You're cheating on me with someone else. Right?!

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.520
You're cheating on me, you asshole!

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.320
No, no. Of course not, my dear.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.840
I wouldn't ever cheat on you.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.920
I'm only saying that you're overreacting.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.880
Oh, my love, but I need you to trust in me.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Because you dress very sexy!

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.980
I know that, my dear.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.940
I know that I dress very sexy.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.520
But trust me!

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.920
Trust me!

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.520
Please.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.800
Hug me!

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.880
Here I go.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.960
Oh, a hug.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.920
A hug.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.680
Thank you for trust in me.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.480
But...

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.480
So...

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.440
You don't cheat on me, right?

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.880
No, I don't cheat on you.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.120
Oh, thank God.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.680
I going to open the fridge...

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.920
To see what's for dinner.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.240
Uhhhmm let's see what there is.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
These hands nowadays!

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.440
I cannot take anything from the fridge.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.840
Ow, things drop from me.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.920
Ow, I fell down.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.680
I cannot grab the cup. How frustrating!

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.800
I don't know what happens but...

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.920
I feel that... that Ken is cheating on me.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.480
Ow. Poop doesn't come put!

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.000
I know.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.240
I know that I have to trust him, but...

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.560
Ow! It doesn't come out!

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.000
But at the same time I feel that he's cheating on me.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.760
With some other girl!

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.480
This poop doesn't come out!

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.640
I don't know but I feel that I have diarrhea or something.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.560
But it doesn't come out, it just doesn't.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.840
What is that camara doing in my bathroom?

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.200
Get out! Get out! How gross!

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.400
I'm ashamed!

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.640
I'm going to cry, I'm going to cry.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.920
I have to flush it.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.720
Gurl,...

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.480
What?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I'm little bit annoyed, you know?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.240
Because...

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.440
We always have to clean and iron...

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.960
Barbi's clothes.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.120
And also doing the dishes.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.520
Plates and all of that.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.520
It is really annoying, girlfriend.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.840
You know? A little bit frustrating.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.520
Ow! The iron is always falling.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.000
Well, we have to do it because she is Barbi.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.160
Duh.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.500
Ow, gurl, but for real...

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.700
I'm going to have to press it with my foot.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.880
Well...

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.360
But it is really annoying, you know?

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.320
And she is always yelling at us and...

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.440
She does mean things to us...

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.560
Just because she's Barbi.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.720
But you know...

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.640
She's popular...

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.800
And she's the best... and she's our lider.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
Right. She's popular.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.960
And we are also very popular.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.880
Right, girlfriend?

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.720
Yeah! The popular ones!

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.840
How beautiful I am.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
How how how how how how beautiful I am.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.960
Oh, so beautiful. Very nice.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.080
Look at me, look at me.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.280
I'm going to brush my teeth with my toothbrush♫

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.360
Ow, girlfriend!

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.960
For real...

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.520
There are a lot of clothes that we're left to wash and iron!

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.520
Look at everything that we're left!

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.600
Right! You are totally right. We have some much clothes left.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.040
And Barbi is already coming over.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.920
If we don't have her clothes ready for her, she's going to be mad at us!

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.160
We're left so much clothes!

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.920
Ow, you have a piece of clothe hanged on you hair, Barbi.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.640
Ow, I'll take this one.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.400
We must continue!

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.840
Come on, girlfriend!

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.560
Hello!

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.480
I'm Barbi!

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.400
I'm already home, girlfriends!

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.280
Hello, Barbi...

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.400
What happened here? Look at all of the clothes that are left!

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.200
How is it possible that so much clothes are left?!

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.680
How is it possible?!

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.240
How is it possible?!

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.240
How is it possible?!

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.740
How is it possible that so much clothes are left?!

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.240
How?!

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.880
How is it possible?! Tell me!

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.200
You know what?

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.240
I'm angry.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.560
Why do you always tell us to wash your clothes...?

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.960
To wash your dirty clothes?

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.080
To iron it?

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.280
To do you dishes and to do everything.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.400
That's not what a friend does.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.440
Ungrateful! Is that how you pay me?

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.760
You're ungrateful!

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.280
Selfish! After I gave you from my popularity!

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.080
I made you!

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.800
Thanks to me you're someone!

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.520
You wouldn't be anybody otherwise!

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.800
You know what?

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.400
♫Sounds of punches and aggressions♫

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.400
So now what? You are also going to reveal yourself?

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.160
You are also going to be ungrateful?

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.480
What are you going to do?

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.800
I'm going to do the dishes.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.440
Do the dishes! Do the dishes!
