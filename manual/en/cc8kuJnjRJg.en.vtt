Hello, and welcome to STUDDYS!

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.990
In this video we will answer a question asked
by Madeeha from Egypt.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.430
Madeeha says: I would love to study medicine
in Canada, but I still need to find some funding

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.460
to cover the tuition!

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.190
So how can I obtain a graduate scholarship
or fellowship to do so?

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.450
Well Madeeha, here at STUDDYS we are all about
helping international students wanting to

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.980
study in Canada quickly and easily find scholarships,
fellowships and other sources of funding to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.960
attend the best Canadian Universities!

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.820
So, lets get started!

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.190
The first thing you want to do, Madeeha, is
to visit studdys.com.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.019
There you will find what we like to call "buckets"of
funding . Very briefly these are:

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.019
1.

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.019
Fellowships
2.

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:48.019
Scholarships
3.

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.019
Programs with funding; and
4.

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.670
Open research positions
Depending on what would suit you the best,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.589
you can find more specific information about
all these funding options on Studdys.com.

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.219
In this video, however, we will show you how
to get to the SCHOLASHIPS for your specific

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.730
field of study.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.400
So, once you are on STUDDYS' homepage, you
can go to the top of the page and click on

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.280
the SCHOLARSHIPS tab.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:19.380
It will take you to this page, where you will
see a search box.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.630
Here you can search a specific scholarship
by name at the top, or you can go by field

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.700
of study, for example, in your case it will
be "Biological &amp; Medical Sciences".

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.619
You can then narrow down your search by entering
the specialty field and then the degree type

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.329
as some scholarships are available only to
Masters programs whereas others are only for

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.610
PhD.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.600
Once that is done, you can choose in which
Canadian province and/or University you would

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.299
prefer to study.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.370
If you don't have a preference, just leave
these two fields "as is", as this will give

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.399
you a wider range of available scholarships
to choose from in the search results.

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.630
Once you are finished, click on SEARCH.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.260
Et Voila - This is where the magic happens:
A page will be displayed, showing the results

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.220
of all the scholarships in the "Biological
&amp; Medical Science" field of study.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.300
The name of the scholarship is displayed,
and on the left you can see the amounts offered.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.910
As you can see here, there is a $12 000 scholarship
available.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.600
If you click here, on the name of the scholarship
you are interested in, you will be taken to

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.800
the Description page.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.100
Since this information is only available to
our Members, I do recommend you register here,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.470
as it is quick and totally free!

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.920
The page will show you the details of the
scholarship you are interested in and you

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.310
can have a look at the requirements, and also
see the contact details and application procedure.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.170
You will also be able to see whether international
students are eligible.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.700
As you will see, many of these scholarships
are open to international students and/or

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.560
even better -- are specifically for international
students!

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.960
So keep looking -- we know you will find that
little Gem!

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.520
So, we hope this helps, Madeeha!

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.900
. . . . And, don't forget to register, as
it will enable you to receive some other cool

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.870

your scholarship search!

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.060
