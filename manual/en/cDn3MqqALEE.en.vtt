00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:06.627
Harris: I DON'T KNOW WHERE
OR HOW I CAN GIVE SPOILERS

00:00:06.627 --> 00:00:09.165
WITHOUT THE TASER
COMING OUT AGAIN.

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:11.000
SO...

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.033
SO, NEIL AND CRAIG HAVE SEEN

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.363
WHAT DIDN'T WORK
IN PREVIOUS ITERATIONS.

00:00:18.363 --> 00:00:20.330
THEY'RE CONFIDENT
IN WHAT DOES WORK,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.198
AND THEY KNOW WHY,

00:00:22.198 --> 00:00:24.297
SO THEY REALLY WANT THINGS THAT
CAN ONLY HAPPEN ON THE SHOW,

00:00:24.297 --> 00:00:26.231
THAT YOU HAVE TO WATCH
THE SHOW TO SEE,

00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:28.561
WHICH IS A GREAT SANDBOX
TO PLAY IN.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.594
IF ANYTHING, I FEEL LIKE IT'S
YOUR JOB TO BE OUT THERE A LOT,

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:33.627
LIKE A DINNER PARTY.

00:00:33.627 --> 00:00:35.759
YOU WANT TO KEEP SAYING,
"HI. WELCOME BACK."

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:41.000
THE HOST IS THE PUPPET MASTER
WITH AN EAR TO WHAT'S GOING ON

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.561
WHEN YOU'RE NOT ONSTAGE
TO BEING ONSTAGE

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:43.594
TO CALMING PEOPLE DOWN

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:44.759
TO COMMENTING ON THINGS

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:46.396
TO WORKING HARD
BUT NOT TOO HARD.

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:49.066
YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE IN THE ROOM,

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.000
AND YOU WANT THEM
TO FEEL COMFORTABLE

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.165
AFTER THE CRAZY GAUNTLET
OF THE RED CARPET.

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:56.627
SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM FEEL
LIKE IT'S ALL GONNA BE GOOD.

00:00:56.627 --> 00:00:58.627
THEN YOU ALSO HAVE TO MAKE
THE PEOPLE AT HOME FEEL

00:00:58.627 --> 00:01:00.198
LIKE IT'S ALL
GONNA BE GOOD, TOO.

00:01:00.198 --> 00:01:02.561
Hope: PERHAPS YOU PEOPLE
WATCHING DON'T REALIZE

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:04.759
THE AIR OF TENSION
IN THIS THEATER TONIGHT.

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.330
Harris: I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME
LOOKING AT THE PAST YEARS' SHOWS

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.033
AND WHAT THEY ACCOMPLISHED,

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:11.528
AND THEN FROM THAT I'M TRYING
TO SEE WHAT'S LEFT.

00:01:11.528 --> 00:01:13.066
SO, WITH THAT IN MY MIND,

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.099
I HAD TO HIRE ON A TEAM
OF WRITERS,

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:18.066
AND WE COME UP WITH AN IDEA THAT
WE THINK IS UNIQUE TO FILMS,

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.693
BUT IS ALSO COOL TO WATCH LIVE,

00:01:19.693 --> 00:01:23.396
BUT WILL ALSO BE, ON ANOTHER
LEVEL, COOL TO WATCH AT HOME.

00:01:23.396 --> 00:01:26.066
SO I'M TRYING TO THINK
OF TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:30.396
Crystal: THERE WERE 330 FEATURE
FILMS IN THAT 5-MINUTE MONTAGE,

00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:32.231
AND WHAT'S AMAZING IS,
ACCORDING TO PARAMOUNT,

00:01:32.231 --> 00:01:33.561
NOT ONE HAS YET
TO GO INTO PROFIT.

00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:35.033
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:37.759
Harris: IT'S A SHOCKINGLY
LONG PROCESS

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.627
OF WRITING A SINGLE JOKE,

00:01:39.627 --> 00:01:42.033
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO SAY IT
AND IT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:45.297
AND YOU CHANGE ONE VERB OR YOU
CHANGE ONE PARENTHETICAL

00:01:45.297 --> 00:01:47.660
AND SEE IF IT'S BETTER
WITH A BIGGER SETUP,

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.099
ALL FOR AN "I SHOWED MY WIENER
IN 'GONE GIRL'" JOKE.

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:53.297
I'M ALSO GETTING
CONSTANT E-MAILS

00:01:53.297 --> 00:01:55.231
WITH LOTS OF PITCHES FOR JOKES.

00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:58.066
SO THERE WILL BE A PAGE
AND A HALF OF "BIRDMAN" JOKES.

00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:59.396
THE WRITERS NOW KIND OF GET

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:01.429
WHERE MY MIND IS
ABOUT CERTAIN JOKES.

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.561
I GOT TO FEEL LIKE IT'S MY SHOW

00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:05.660
AND THAT WHAT I HAVE TO EXECUTE

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.264
IS GONNA FALL ON ME
REGARDLESS OF WHO WROTE IT.

00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:12.000
PREPARING TO HOST
TAKES A LOT MORE LEAD TIME

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.693
THAN I THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK.

00:02:13.693 --> 00:02:15.429
IT'S SUCH A GIGANTIC SHOW.

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:18.561
THE MOST FUN PART ABOUT
PREPARING TO HOST THE OSCARS

00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:20.528
HAS TO BE THE ACCESS.

00:02:20.528 --> 00:02:23.396
AND SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING
"YES" TO BEING A PART OF IT,

00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:25.429
IN WHATEVER CONTEXT YOU NEED.

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:27.528
WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA BE USING
PEOPLE IN INTERESTING WAYS.

00:02:27.528 --> 00:02:29.396
THERE'S GONNA BE
A MUSICAL NUMBER

00:02:29.396 --> 00:02:30.660
AT SOME POINT IN THE SHOW.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.462
I'M A MAGICIAN,

00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:34.363
SO I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF THERE WAS A HINT OF MAGIC.

00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:36.528
I FEAR I'VE SAID TOO MUCH.
