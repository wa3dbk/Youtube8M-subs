00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.420
Ok, I have marked off my beading intervals.
My spacing that I want to put my loops on.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:13.820
I am going to secure the ribbon strip to the
table so that I can work with that a little

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.590
easily. I have my needle threaded and knotted.
And, I am going to come up through the back

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:28.660
of the ribbon right on the edge like that
so that we do not see the knot. Now, our pattern

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:37.530
is going to be, we will start with a bugle
bead. And, I have five clear beads. Five clear

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.030
seed beads. Three, four, five. You just place
the needle into the center of a bead. It is

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.649
good to have the beads in one layer so that
you can see the centers. I have five, oops,

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.539
I picked up a gold one by mistake. So, I am
going to put two more clear ones on there.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:05.930
So, I have five clear beads. Looking at my
pattern, I have one white bead, one larger

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:15.460
silver bead, then this nice light clear bead.
And then, you want to reverse the order and

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:23.700
we have another silver bead here, a white
bead, and five more clear beads. One, two,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.000
three, and you can see how you just kind of
stick your needle into the center and then

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.810
push up the bead with your finger. And then,
grab the rest of it with your other finger.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:44.130
One, two, three, four, and one more. And,
pull that down. Now, that is going to, the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.679
seed beads are going to make the loop and
we are going to return through the bugle bead

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:56.920
like this. And, you always want to pull your
thread slowly and carefully so that do not

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:07.110
have a knot. Ok? And then, you secure, that
is our first loop. And then, we will secure

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:17.010
that with a little bit of a half hitch knot
here. Make a loop and go through the loop

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.980
and kind of pull that secure but not too tight
because you do not want your loop to be stiff.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.810
You want it to be, you know, you want it to
drop nicely.
