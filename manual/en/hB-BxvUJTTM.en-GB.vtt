00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.850
alright now in this video we will study the
gaba receptor

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:21.080
now gaba receptor is of two types
first is the gaba a and gaba b receptor

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.910
gaba a is a type of ionotropic receptor and
gaba b is a type of metabotropic receptor

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.780
or g protien coupled receptor
but in this video we will only focus on the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:41.289
gaba a receptor akright
now first of lets see the structure of the

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.840
gaba a receptor
i will try to make two views

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.870
the first is the front view and second is
the top view of the receptor

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.239
coming to the front view
now the gaba a receptor is a type of pentameric

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:06.480
it consiss of five subunits which are arranged
partly extracellularly and partly intracellularly

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.900
and the five subunits are
two alpha subunits

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.509
two beta subunits and one gama unit arranged
around a central pore

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.200
now lets look at the receptor from the top
view

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.750
consists of the central chloride pore
and two drug binding sites

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.340
mainly it consists of three drug binding sites
but for the purpose of illustration i have

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.909
just drawn two
the first is the benzodiazipne binding site

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:54.000
and second is the gaba binding site

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.890
ok now two alpha subunits two beta subunits
and one gama subunit

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.049
now between the aplha and the beta subunit
is the gaba binding site

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.170
same as here on the front view and same on
the top view and between the the alpha and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.690
the gama subunit is the benzodiazipine binding
site or the bzd allostearic site

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.380
now the next important thing i would discuss
is the mechanism of action of this gaba receptor

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.470
now the basic step involved in the activation
of the gaba receptor is binding of a ligand

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.980
or drug to the gaba site or the benzodiazipine
binding site.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.990
now due to this binding the central chloride
pore opens up and causes influx of chloride

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:50.150
ions which further causes inhibition of neuron
by creating a state of hyperpolarisation in

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.830
the neuron
now lets look at the some of the drugs which

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.230
act on the gaba receptor
first of all i would like to discuss the gama

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:10.660
amino buyric acid or the gaba.now this drug
or it is a basically an endogenous agonist

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.140
of the gaba receptor
it is released at various sites in the cns

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:27.280
and it acts on the gaba site and causes the
same sequence of events we have just discussed

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:37.980
now the second class of drugs that we will
discuss are grouped under as positive allostearic

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.060
modulators
now these drugs bind to the benzodiazipine

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:56.090
bindind site and cause the same chain of events
now in this category first of all we have

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:03.590
the benzodiazipnes
the diazepam clonezepam these just act on

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.730
the benzodiazipine binding site they are the
positive allostearic modulators

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.120
now second class of drugs are the barbiturates
the thiopental

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:24.280
and the third class of important drugs are
the muscle relaxants like thiocolchicaside

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.229
also alcohol acts on this site
and then we have some anaesthtic drugs like

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:39.360
propofol and etomidate
there are some other drugs but they are not

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.349
that important as these classes
third important category of drugs are negative

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:52.199
allostearic modulators
now there are a whole bunch of drugs which

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:58.139
act as negative allostearic modulators but
the one i would like you to remember is flumezanil

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.910
now this very important drug
it blocks the benzodiazipine binding site

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.960
or you can say that it is a negative allostearic
modulator of the benzodiazipine binding site

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.110
now this drug is given in benzo benzodiazipine
overdose

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:22.069
and also it is given in the reversal of anaesthesia
now lets look at the affects of activation

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.330
of the gaba recptor
now the various drugs which act on this receptor

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.020
produce numerous affects some of which are
anxiolysis

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:39.499
anticonvulsant affect
the sedative affect

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:43.710
partial amnesia
and muscle relaxation

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.810
so this was a short review of the gaba receptors
functions and structure

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.880
