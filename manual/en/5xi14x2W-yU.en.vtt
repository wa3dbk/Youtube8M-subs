00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.000
This video shows how to fix your HP printer

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.629
when it stops feeding pages from the ADF during printing

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:10.200
and a Paper Jam in the ADF error message

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.500
displays on the printer's control panel or on your computer.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
First, turn the printer off and on again.
This will sometimes fix the issue.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.300
Press the Power button to turn the printer off.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.890
Once the printer is off, wait 60 seconds.
It is important to wait the full 60 seconds

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.320
to allow the print mechanism to reset.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.360
Then, press the Power button to turn the printer back on.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.360
Wait for the printer to turn on and stop making noise.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.090
If the printer ejects any paper and the control
panel no longer displays an error message,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.309
there is no need to continue troubleshooting.

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.270
If the printer does not eject any paper and
the control panel still displays an error

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.239
message, continue to the next step.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.070
In this step, you will remove any foreign
materials and clear any jams from the ADF.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.000
Do not remove jammed paper at this time.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Remove any loose paper from the ADF tray.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.000
Press the Power button to turn off the printer.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.800
Turn to the back.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.400
Disconnect the power cord.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.000
If present, remove the USB cable from the printer.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.820
Then, disconnect the other end of the power
cord from its power source.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.000
Return to the front of the printer.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.630
Lift the top cover of the ADF.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.300
Check the ADF for jammed paper. 
If you see any paper, remove it by pulling evenly with

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.500
both hands to avoid tearing.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.770
Check the rollers and wheels for torn pieces
of paper that might remain inside the printer.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.429
Use a flashlight to thoroughly search the
ADF area to find all small scraps of paper.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.300
If any torn pieces of paper remain inside the printer,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.200
more paper jams are likely to occur.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.040
Locate the tab on the front edge of the ADF.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.600
Lift this tab to raise the ADF mechanism.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.000
Check the area for paper. If you see any jammed paper,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.750
remove it by pulling gently and evenly to avoid tearing.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.120
Use a flashlight to thoroughly check the rollers
and wheels for torn pieces of paper.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.599
Lower the ADF mechanism.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.180
Close the ADF cover.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.040
Make sure to close the ADF cover tightly.
A false error message might occur if the ADF

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.690
cover is not securely closed.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.610
Next, lift the scanner lid to search
the underside of the ADF for any jams.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.700
Check the area for paper. If you see any jammed paper,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.330
remove it by pulling gently and evenly to avoid tearing.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.620
Use a flashlight to thoroughly check the
rollers and wheels for torn pieces of paper.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.800
Close the scanner lid.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.300
Turn to the back.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.700
Reconnect the power cord.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.920
Reconnect the power cord to its power source.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.750
Return to the front.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.900
If the printer does not automatically turn on,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.650
press the Power button to turn on the printer.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.620
Reload one sheet of paper from the original
task, print side up in the ADF tray.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.700
Slide the paper width guides inward until
they stop at the edge of the paper.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.519
Do not push the guides in so tightly that they start to bend the paper.

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.830
On the printer's control panel, press OK
to continue with the original task.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.200
If the printer does not automatically continue
with the original task,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.500
go on to the next step.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.390
Sometimes the problem can be fixed by resetting the printer.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.620
The printer must be on for this step to work.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.300
Turn to the back.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.470
Disconnect the power cord from the printer.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.650
Then, disconnect the other end of the power
cord from its power source.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.690
Wait 15 seconds. It is important to wait the
full 15 seconds for this type of reset.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.410
Reconnect the power cord to its power source.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.090
Then, reconnect the other end of the power
cord into the printer.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.380
Return to the front.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.720
If the printer does not turn on automatically,
press the Power button to turn on the printer.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.990
Now, try making a copy using the ADF to see
if the issue is resolved.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.410
Raise the output tray.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.990
Align a stack of paper by tapping it on a flat surface.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.050
Load paper into the input tray until it stops.
Slide the paper width guides inward until

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.889
they stop at the edge of the paper.

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.270
Do not push the guides in so tightly that
they start to bend the paper.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.820
Lower the output tray.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.770
Load one sheet of paper from the original
task print side up in the ADF tray.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.669
Slide the paper width guides inward until
they stop at the edge of the paper.

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.880
Do not push the guides in so tightly that
they start to bend the paper.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.880
On the printers control panel,tap the copy icon. 
Then select the Black or Color option.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.139
The printer prints a copy of the page. 
If the printer does not copy the original document,

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.970
go on to the next step.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.840
If you've tried everything described in
this video and you still have a problem,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.370
your printer likely needs some type of service.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.500
Your options for service will vary depending on

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.280
how long you've owned it and what country you live in.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.569
Contact HP to find out what support 
options are available for your printer.

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:11.000
