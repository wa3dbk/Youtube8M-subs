(low hip hop music)

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.340
- This is a one-word taste test

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.034
where you will describe
the taste of this shot

00:00:10.034 --> 00:00:15.034
using one word or a short
phrase unrelated to food.

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.357
No appley, peachy, spicy, cinnamony, okay.

00:00:18.357 --> 00:00:20.354
None of this like it
tastes like chicken, okay.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.026
None of that kind of thing.

00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:24.447
Taste.

00:00:25.694 --> 00:00:27.273
Savor that taste.

00:00:27.273 --> 00:00:28.806
Think of what it relates to.

00:00:28.806 --> 00:00:30.768
Think of your childhood.

00:00:30.768 --> 00:00:32.729
One word.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.437
- Puppies.

00:00:34.437 --> 00:00:35.806
- [Skky] It tastes like a puppy?

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:36.608
- Yeah.

00:00:36.608 --> 00:00:39.347
- Okay, I mean, that's kind of food

00:00:39.347 --> 00:00:41.222
depending on where you're from, okay,

00:00:41.222 --> 00:00:42.166
but since you live in the west--

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.039
- I didn't say it.

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:43.825
- We can give it a pass.

00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:44.991
- I didn't say it.
- Okay.

00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:46.182
It tastes like puppies?

00:00:46.182 --> 00:00:46.711
- Puppies.

00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:48.289
- What do you mean,
like it's a cute taste?

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.797
- It has a bark but it's still lovable.

00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:55.417
I like it, so I like puppies.

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:57.032
I'm going to go with puppies.

00:00:57.032 --> 00:00:59.737
- [Skky] Taste.

00:01:01.768 --> 00:01:03.440
Savor that taste, savor that taste.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.717
Feel it in your bones.

00:01:04.717 --> 00:01:06.041
Feel it in your soul.

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:07.326
One word.

00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:09.923
- Toothpaste.

00:01:11.107 --> 00:01:13.136
Like not the kind that adults use.

00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:14.336
- [Skky] What, kid toothpaste?

00:01:14.336 --> 00:01:15.950
- Kind of, Yeah, kid's use.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.064
- [Skky] They have special toothpaste?

00:01:17.064 --> 00:01:18.388
- Kid toothpaste.

00:01:18.388 --> 00:01:20.304
Yeah, they got like
fancy flavors so that--

00:01:20.304 --> 00:01:21.645
- I don't have any kids.
- Kids will brush their teeth.

00:01:21.645 --> 00:01:22.811
- Do you see any kids in here?

00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:24.675
- No, but it doesn't
mean you don't have any.

00:01:24.675 --> 00:01:27.123
- [Skky] Taste.

00:01:29.093 --> 00:01:30.784
Feel it, feel it in your soul.

00:01:30.784 --> 00:01:32.143
Think, think.

00:01:32.143 --> 00:01:33.211
Think very carefully.

00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:35.661
One word.

00:01:37.476 --> 00:01:39.831
(low hip hop music)

00:01:41.524 --> 00:01:43.417
- Sea Turtle.

00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:46.018
- [Skky] What the?

00:01:46.018 --> 00:01:47.515
- A sea turtle.

00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:48.792
- It tastes like a sea turtle?

00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:51.755
- Uh-huh.

00:01:51.755 --> 00:01:53.576
- How?

00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:57.983
- Because it reminds me going to Cancun

00:01:58.814 --> 00:02:02.318
and when I go snorkeling,
there is lots of sea turtles

00:02:02.318 --> 00:02:05.092
and fish in the water.

00:02:05.092 --> 00:02:06.671
- So this tastes like Cancun, really?

00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:07.693
- It tastes like Cancun.

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:09.446
I should have said Cancun,
but sea turtle popped

00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:10.978
into my head because of the color,

00:02:10.978 --> 00:02:15.761
it just fucked with my
brain, so sea turtle.

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:17.123
- [Skky] Taste.

00:02:19.302 --> 00:02:20.672
You and your baby taste.

00:02:20.672 --> 00:02:21.566
Savor it, savor it.

00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:23.113
Okay, okay.

00:02:24.282 --> 00:02:25.255
Go ahead.

00:02:25.255 --> 00:02:26.584
- Crystal Meth.

00:02:26.584 --> 00:02:29.277
(loud laughing)

00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:34.054
- Why would you call this crystal meth?

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:38.105
- It made me remember, it
reminds me of those good times

00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:41.500
when I'm watching Breaking
Bad with my friends, like,

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.500
you know, companionship,
enjoying crystal meth stories.

00:02:49.317 --> 00:02:52.265
- That makes absolutely
no sense, but whatever.

00:02:52.265 --> 00:02:53.856
Taste.

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:57.594
One word.

00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:59.301
- A clear ocean.

00:02:59.301 --> 00:03:00.249
- [Skky] A clear ocean?

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:00.872
- Yeah.

00:03:00.872 --> 00:03:02.156
- [Skky] It tastes like a clear ocean?

00:03:02.156 --> 00:03:03.398
- It tastes like a clear ocean.

00:03:03.398 --> 00:03:04.293
- [Skky] Like smooth?

00:03:04.293 --> 00:03:07.102
- Like smooth, well, I mean this is blue

00:03:07.102 --> 00:03:09.923
but blue like transparent,
you can see it and it's nice,

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:13.580
and if you swallow it, you
don't feel that bad about it.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.645
- [Skky] Well, it's salt,
so it'd kill you, okay.

00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:17.699
- Well, yeah, but you don't feel that bad

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:21.020
because it's not dirty like
the beach in Huntington.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.518
- [Skky] So you drank the
water at Huntington Beach?

00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:24.910
- No, I'm just saying
that if like you fall

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.464
and you accidentally drink
water, you feel gross.

00:03:27.464 --> 00:03:29.472
You're like eew, I drank dirty water.

00:03:29.472 --> 00:03:31.388
- [Skky] True, but like if
you drank out of a clean ocean

00:03:31.388 --> 00:03:33.354
then it's nutritious?
- It's cool.

00:03:33.354 --> 00:03:35.157
- [Skky] Sure.

00:03:36.142 --> 00:03:38.398
Wow. Okay, great.

00:03:38.398 --> 00:03:39.852
Taste.

00:03:41.776 --> 00:03:43.185
That's a big ass taste.

00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:45.292
Okay, savor that taste, savor that taste.

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:48.190
All right, one word.

00:03:51.714 --> 00:03:53.676
- College.

00:03:53.676 --> 00:03:55.081
- [Skky] It tastes like college?

00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:56.230
- It tastes like college.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.094
- [Skky] What does that mean?

00:03:57.094 --> 00:03:58.422
- It reminds me of college days.

00:03:58.422 --> 00:03:59.798
- What, a jungle juice?

00:03:59.798 --> 00:04:01.106
- It just reminds me
of my days in college,

00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:03.126
like drinking blue drinks

00:04:03.126 --> 00:04:05.074
that you didn't know what
the hell was in there,

00:04:05.074 --> 00:04:07.549
and yeah, this reminds me of college.

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.006
- College, it got--
- ASU.

00:04:10.006 --> 00:04:12.719
- Okay, but is it that good or bad?

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.149
- So you told me not to like--

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:16.156
- No, I'm just saying
was college good or bad?

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:17.562
- Oh, college was a blast.

00:04:17.562 --> 00:04:19.141
- Okay, so the drink's good?

00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:19.577
- Yes.

00:04:19.577 --> 00:04:21.632
- [Skky] What do you think it is?

00:04:21.632 --> 00:04:24.716
- Blue raspberry something something.

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:26.902
- [Skky] Kinky Blue.

00:04:26.902 --> 00:04:29.132
- Kinky Blue.

00:04:29.132 --> 00:04:30.375
I don't know how kinky it is.

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:33.448
It tastes like a dentist's office, but

00:04:33.448 --> 00:04:35.121
maybe that gets you off, I don't know.

00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:37.385
It's an oral fixation.

00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:41.216
- It's like that hypnosis
but in the blue version.

00:04:41.216 --> 00:04:42.668
- [Skky] It's like what?

00:04:42.668 --> 00:04:43.956
- Blue Hypnosis.

00:04:43.956 --> 00:04:46.638
- [Skky] Okay, anyway, it's Kinky Blue.

00:04:46.638 --> 00:04:51.638
- Kinky, methamphetamine, it
kind of looks like kinky meth.

00:04:52.013 --> 00:04:53.592
It's kind of related, come on.

00:04:53.592 --> 00:04:55.089
- [Skky] Okay, all right, fine.

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:56.703
It's Kinky Blue.

00:04:56.703 --> 00:04:59.350
- No wonder I feel so kinky.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.485
- [Skky] Are you kinky?

00:05:00.485 --> 00:05:01.174
- Uh-huh.

00:05:01.174 --> 00:05:02.221
- [Skky] Yeah, I know, I can see that.

00:05:02.221 --> 00:05:05.112
You've got kinky written all over you.

00:05:05.112 --> 00:05:06.837
They should make you their spokesperson.

00:05:06.837 --> 00:05:07.366
- They really should.

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:10.871
I would be like hi, guys, buy some Kinky,

00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:14.064
it will make you kinky.

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:15.760
- [Skky] Really creative advertising.
