00:00:06.698 --> 00:00:08.288
- Hi, I'm Jerry James Stone

00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:10.082
and you're watching, Cooking Stoned.

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:13.614
On today's episode, we're
gonna make a tomato sauce.

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:15.456
We're gonna make a
homemade tomato sauce.

00:00:15.456 --> 00:00:17.408
The thing about a tomato
sauce is this,

00:00:17.408 --> 00:00:19.162
tomato sauce is not just

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.377
tomatoes that have been sauced.

00:00:20.377 --> 00:00:22.483
It's not just about having

00:00:22.483 --> 00:00:24.473
tomatoes in this sort of format.

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:26.503
It's actually about creating a sauce

00:00:26.503 --> 00:00:28.742
that really highlights the tomato.

00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:33.511
It's not quite a spaghetti
sauce, it's simple.

00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:35.744
There's a little bit of herbs
and there is a trick to

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:36.842
highlighting those tomatoes.

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:38.086
That's what we're gonna do.

00:00:38.086 --> 00:00:41.253
We're gonna start by mincing our onion.

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:47.325
Pull the peel.

00:00:48.288 --> 00:00:50.957
Let's go ahead and chop it up.

00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:55.066
We're gonna chop up our celery.

00:00:55.544 --> 00:00:58.733
I mentioned that tomato sauce is all about

00:00:59.238 --> 00:01:01.876
highlighting the tomatoes, so,

00:01:03.187 --> 00:01:06.007
some people use carrot,
I use celery because

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:08.780
celery adds a salt component
to the sauce,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.280
but carrots add salt and sugar.

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:15.175
You can do it with carrots,
but that would be wrong,

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.032
and we don't want that, right?

00:01:17.032 --> 00:01:18.421
We're just gonna mince this up here,

00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:20.676
as nicely as we possibly can.

00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:22.837
The onion and the celery,

00:01:22.837 --> 00:01:24.662
we're gonna go ahead and sweat those

00:01:24.662 --> 00:01:26.261
in the pan for a little bit.

00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:30.075
To begin with, we're gonna
add a fourth cup of olive oil,

00:01:30.383 --> 00:01:32.477
and warm that over a

00:01:32.477 --> 00:01:34.879
medium-low heat.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:38.637
Then, we're gonna sweat
the onions and the celery.

00:01:38.676 --> 00:01:41.562
The onions and the celery are
in there, and the olive oil.

00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:44.410
Heat is medium-low, we're
gonna add a pinch of salt.

00:01:46.178 --> 00:01:49.798
We're just gonna cook these
over a medium-lowish heat,

00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:51.992
and sweat them.

00:01:51.992 --> 00:01:55.578
The key here is you don't
want them to

00:01:55.578 --> 00:01:56.878
golden or anything like that.

00:01:56.878 --> 00:02:00.236
You just want to bring out the
moisture and cook them down.

00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:03.558
This should take about
10 to 15 minutes,

00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:04.688
if you do it properly.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.073
Like I said, a really low heat
is what you want here.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.038
These are cooking down nicely, so,

00:02:10.038 --> 00:02:13.542
as one might expect with
the term sweating is,

00:02:13.605 --> 00:02:14.977
you're just pulling all
the moisture out,

00:02:14.977 --> 00:02:17.348
so you can see they become
really, really wet.

00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:18.840
They look sweaty.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.208
We're just gonna keep cookin'
this down, cookin' this down,

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:23.433
This is just to intensify the flavor.

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:26.720
You wanna get that bite
from the onion

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.962
and that salt from the celery.

00:02:29.768 --> 00:02:30.954
This has been about,

00:02:30.954 --> 00:02:32.140
just about eight minutes right now,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.587
so I still have about
double the time to go.

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:35.561
Now that those are cooked down,

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:38.860
we're gonna add in our
four cloves of garlic.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.463
Let's go ahead and get that in there.

00:02:42.094 --> 00:02:43.750
Love the smell of garlic.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.339
Never go wrong with that.

00:02:46.152 --> 00:02:48.092
We're just gonna cook that

00:02:48.092 --> 00:02:49.550
just for about a minute on its own.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.184
We're gonna add in our salt, our sugar,

00:02:53.184 --> 00:02:57.091
and a splash of white balsamic vinegar.

00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:59.488
That's just to bring up the acidity

00:02:59.488 --> 00:03:01.359
on this dish because,

00:03:03.028 --> 00:03:06.129
like I said, we wanna just highlight

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.783
the tomatoes, that's the key,
is to highlight their flavor.

00:03:08.783 --> 00:03:10.203
We're not tryin' to
alter them like you would

00:03:10.203 --> 00:03:10.924
with a spaghetti sauce,

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:14.384
where you use a lot of herbs
to take it to the next level.

00:03:14.384 --> 00:03:18.054
We're just tryin' to showcase
why we freakin' love tomatoes.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.959
Just add the salt and sugar
in there, and the vinegar.

00:03:22.558 --> 00:03:24.462
I'm gonna turn up the heat a little bit.

00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:29.047
You wanna cook this down more,
but you do not want

00:03:29.047 --> 00:03:31.346
the ingredients to brown,
that's really important.

00:03:31.346 --> 00:03:33.826
Just cook it for a
few more minutes, like this.

00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:35.809
I forgot to mention what
we're gonna do in this step,

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:37.024
when we turn up the heat is,

00:03:37.024 --> 00:03:40.107
we're tryin' to cook down
any of the remaining liquids.

00:03:40.107 --> 00:03:43.539
We spent that time sweating
the onion and the celery,

00:03:44.031 --> 00:03:46.439
and now we're just tryin'
to remove that liquid.

00:03:46.798 --> 00:03:48.876
You want the heat up high
enough to do that, but,

00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:50.921
like I said, you do not
want it to brown.

00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:51.971
That's lookin' pretty good there.

00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:53.828
You can see everything's
really starting to cook down.

00:03:53.828 --> 00:03:57.274
We're gonna add a tablespoon
of tomato paste.

00:03:58.173 --> 00:04:00.387
We're just gonna mix that
around a bit,

00:04:00.387 --> 00:04:01.923
getting everything coated

00:04:01.923 --> 00:04:04.118
in this nice, lovely tomato paste.

00:04:08.496 --> 00:04:10.553
It's starting to smell really
good, you can just

00:04:10.553 --> 00:04:11.795
smell all those vegetables.

00:04:11.795 --> 00:04:14.566
When we add the tomatoes, this
is gonna be really lovely.

00:04:14.732 --> 00:04:17.944
We're gonna add in our San
Marzano tomatoes, carefully.

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:19.869
You know how it is.

00:04:21.225 --> 00:04:23.834
They can, seriously, power
cars with tomato sauce.

00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:26.305
The slightest bump,

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.792
or momentum, and the stuff

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:31.016
can seriously splatter across the room.

00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:34.175
The reason we're using
San Marzano tomatoes,

00:04:34.175 --> 00:04:35.579
this is actually the key ingredient

00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:37.222
to making a good sauce.

00:04:37.222 --> 00:04:40.685
San Marzano tomatoes are actually what

00:04:40.791 --> 00:04:43.278
Roma tomatoes are based on, but

00:04:43.278 --> 00:04:44.967
San Marzano tomatoes,

00:04:44.967 --> 00:04:47.408
they have a thicker flesh,
they have less seeds,

00:04:47.408 --> 00:04:49.535
and they have a more intense flavor.

00:04:49.535 --> 00:04:50.668
They're really what you wanna use

00:04:50.668 --> 00:04:51.696
when you're making a sauce.

00:04:51.696 --> 00:04:54.271
Any other tomato is
just not acceptable.

00:04:54.955 --> 00:04:56.891
We're gonna add this in,
I had two cans of whole

00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:58.591
San Marzano tomatoes.

00:04:58.591 --> 00:05:00.066
I just crushed them with my hand.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.645
You can crush them with anything, but,

00:05:01.645 --> 00:05:03.721
really, your hand is the best tool.

00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:06.915
Now, we're just going to
bring this to a simmer.

00:05:06.915 --> 00:05:09.648
We're going to, then, turn it down

00:05:09.648 --> 00:05:12.507
and let it cook for about an hour.

00:05:12.507 --> 00:05:13.810
You want it to be about an hour,

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.738
and probably a little bit more.

00:05:15.738 --> 00:05:18.000
You want the consistency
of breakfast cereal.

00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:19.749
This just has to thicken up.

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:21.135
It's cookin' down quite nicely here.

00:05:21.135 --> 00:05:23.088
We have about a half hour left.

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:26.207
I'm gonna go ahead and
add in our fresh thyme.

00:05:27.925 --> 00:05:29.067
Add this in towards the end.

00:05:29.067 --> 00:05:31.983
This is just to really
brighten up the sauce.

00:05:31.983 --> 00:05:33.559
We're not tryin' to overly flavor it,

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:35.282
it's really, once again,

00:05:35.282 --> 00:05:38.179
as I've said, just to
complement the tomato.

00:05:39.224 --> 00:05:40.672
Just continue to let that cook

00:05:40.672 --> 00:05:42.284
for about another 30 minutes.

00:05:42.284 --> 00:05:45.540
It's smelling so good,
let's take a little taste.
