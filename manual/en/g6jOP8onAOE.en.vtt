00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:02.169
 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:03.009
 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:04.700
 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.390
 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.730
Hi. It's Mr. Andersen and this
is chemistry essentials video 13 which is

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.090
on solids and liquids. And we have solids
and liquids right here. Water in a both liquid

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.640
and a solid phase. And so when we're looking
at solids and liquids, it's almost easier

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.619
to compare them. So we're going to use a Venn
diagram. So we've got solids and liquids.

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.359
How are they alike? Well they're both made
of matter. They both have a specific molar

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.370
volume. In other words, they're close enough
where their molar volumes are going to be

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.440
about the same. And they're all going to be
made of particles. So is all matter. But what's

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.549
different between liquids and solids is the
intermolecular forces are going to be slightly

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:45.930
different between a solid and a liquid. And
so if we look at solids they're going to be

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.309
highly ordered. And what that means is that
their atoms are going to be locked into a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.409
specific matrix. They can vibrate. In fact
they have to vibrate over time. But as a result

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.150
they really are two different types. Amorphous
and crystalline solids. If we're looking at

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.650
liquids, they're more disordered. And they
can show what's called translation where they

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.670
can move around each other. And as a result,
they're going to take the shape of whatever

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.640
container they're in. And then there are going
to be properties based on these intermolecular

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.890
forces, like surface tension, viscosity, and
volume and mixing that we talk about with

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.300
liquids that we don't have to talk about when
we're talking about solids. And so how do

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.560
we look at these two and how they move from
one into another? Well, we can look at a heating

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.850
curve. Or if you just turn that around, a
cooling curve. And it's going to show us this

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.340
transition between the two. And so if we're
looking at phases of matter, it's first best

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.580
to come up with some kind of a representation
of what they look like. And so we're going

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.350
to use a simulation here from phet at colorado.edu.
And so what we've got here is a bunch of water

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.600
in a solid phase. And so you can see that
they're locked in position. And as we move

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.460
it to liquid, now they can translate. They
can move around each other. Now this is not

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.280
a great model of a liquid. It should kind
of flow down to the bottom. But at least we're

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.540
seeing what's going on at the particle phase.
And then as we look at a gas, as we increase

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.810
the energy again, now they're moving all over
the place. And we'll talk about gases in the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.530
next video. And so what we're going to do
is we're going to take some of that energy

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.670
away. We're going to take some of that heat
away. And as we cool it down you can see hear

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.200
that we're measuring this in kelvin. As we
cool it down it turns into a liquid. And now

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.590
it's into a solid. You can see even at a solid
phase those still, we're seeing vibrations

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.690
within there. But as we approach absolute
zero, all molecular motion is eventually going

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.420
to come to a stop when we reach that point.
Okay. So when we're looking at solids, solids

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.700
are going to have a specific matrix. In other
words all of the atom's molecules are going

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.920
to be put together in a specific shape. If
it's amorphous, there's not going to be a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.800
repeating pattern to this. And so this is
amorphous right here. So you can see it's

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.040
made up of silicon and oxygen. But they're
going to be put together in all different

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.500
shapes. And as a result we get what's called
amorphous quartz. Or sometimes we call this

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.810
glassy quartz. And so it's going to be really
brittle. Really easy to break. And so some

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.340
solids like rubber, for example, is going
to be an amorphous solid. It doesn't mean

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.420
that it's not a solid, it's just not going
to be as organized. And if we look at crystalline

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.270
structure, like that in this crystalline quartz,
it's going to be the same atoms you can see.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.880
But they're arranged in a repeating pattern.
And now we get these beautiful crystals right

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.750
here. It's going to be harder. So a diamond
for example is going to be something that

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.709
would be in a crystalline solid. As we move
into liquids what they can show is something

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.300
called translation. So that means that, let's
say we have these water molecules right here.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.920
They're not locked in those positions. In
other words they can translate about each

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.709
other. And as a result, liquids are going
to take the shape of their container. Now

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.770
depending on the forces between those water
molecules, we're going to have different properties.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.069
One of the first ones is going to be viscosity.
Viscosity is how easily a liquid is able to

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.239
flow. And so right here we've got a picture
of pitch. Pitch is going to have really high

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.269
viscosity. That means it really is going to
flow at a real slow rate. It's still going

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.080
to take the shape of the container you can
see down here. And so something that would

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.290
have, for example, a real low viscosity might
be water. It's going to easily flow. Alcohol

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.370
might be one that has a low viscosity. Another
property is going to be surface tension. Surface

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.370
tension is going to be based on the intermolecular
forces in a liquid. And so these different

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.299
molecules are going to be attracted to one
another. And they're also going to be attracted

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.580
to one another at the surface. And so surface
tension is going to be almost this layer of

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.879
chemical attraction over the surface of a
liquid. And so a water strider like this is

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:32.319
able to float on top of that surface tension.
If we were to break the surface tension, one

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:36.099
way to do that would be to add something like
soap. It's going to break those intermolecular

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.620
forces, and trust me, that water strider is
going to quickly sink to the bottom of the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.159
lake. And then the last thing is called the
volume of mixing. And this is best easily

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:49.360
understood if we use a demonstration. This
is one that I use in my class. Imagine I were

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.800
to take some pure water, so we have distilled
water. And I were to put it in a graduated

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.650
cylinder. And I were to be real precise and
measure out exactly 250 milliliters of water.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.039
I were then to take some ethyl alcohol, so
ethanol. And I were to measure out exactly

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.409
250 milliliters of that as well. So let's
say I'm very precise. I have 250 milliliters

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.990
of each, what do you think is going to happen
if we combine those two amounts together in

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.919
another graduated cylinder? Well, when you
do this, if you have a large enough amount,

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.580
you're not going to get 500 milliliters. And
so that's weird. It seems like it disappeared.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.930
But really what's going on is the water and
the alcohol are able to fit within each other.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.479
There's going to be room within there. And
so that's based on those intermolecular forces

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.460
as well. If we were to combine water and water
we would get 500 milliliters. But because

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.469
we have less attraction in those alcohol molecules,
the water molecules can kind of get in there.

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:44.490
And so how do we look at then transition from
solid to liquid and back again? We use something

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.360
called a heating curve. And so what we have
down here is heat. So we're adding heat in

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.189
this direction. And then we've got the temperature
on the side. And the heating curve I'm going

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:55.860
to show you is the heating curve for water.
And so if we look at the heating curve for

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.869
water, it's going to look something like that.
And so what happens below zero degrees celsius.

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:05.289
Well that's going to be a solid. It's going
to be ice. What happens as we go above it?

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.800
It's going to turn into water. And then above
100 degrees celsius it's going to turn into

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.319
vapor. But why is it a flat line here? It
seems like we're just losing energy. In other

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:20.249
words we're adding energy the whole way across.
Why isn't the temperature increasing here?

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:25.629
Well what's happening is as we add energy
to ice, as we reach that point what we have

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:30.419
right here is both ice and water. So we see
a transition from a solid to a liquid. And

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:37.099
so that energy is going into that molecular
motion of that solid becoming a liquid. Likewise,

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:40.990
where is the energy going here? It's going
into the energy of those vapor molecules as

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.219
they jump off. And so as you heat water it's
going to increase to around 100 degrees celsius

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:51.129
depending on your elevation. But at that point
it eventually jumps into a vapor. And so we

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:55.830
could look at a heating curve to see the transition
between both solid and liquid. And then our

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.699
next video, which is going to be on gases,
if we flip this thing around then we've got

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:04.490
just a cooling curve. And then, did you learn
this? That we can use a particulate model,

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.210
so we use that phet model to explain the difference
between solid and liquid? Remember that big

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:15.800
point is when we move to a liquid they show
translation. They can move around each other.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.800
And I hope that was helpful.
