00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.160
Hi guys. This tutorial is gonna be
on the five strand braid.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.480
So I've previously done
four strand braids,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.200
but I'm stepping this one up a notch
and doing a five strand.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.560
It's so pretty.
It's a bit complicated.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.160
So I would suggest going back

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.400
and watching my four strand braid videos
before just to practice

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.040
getting the hang of those
before you maybe move onto this one,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.240
but it's really, really pretty
and really interesting,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.800
and it creates a really thick braid.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.480
All you're gonna need
for this really

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.640
is a hairbrush
to brush through the hair.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.200
I'm using my tangle teaser today
and then just a small hair elastic

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.200
just to tie off the braid.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.880
And then you might want to have
some bobby pins on hand,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.240
just in case, like I always say,
if you have any layers or bits of hair

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.400
that stick out a bit
you can just pin them back into place

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.000
nice and easy
with some bobby pins.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.560
So first of all,
I'm just gonna use my tangle teaser

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.200
just to smooth out all the hair.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.560
And then I'm gonna do
this five strand braid on the side.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.360
So I'm just gonna sweep
all the hair over to my right hand side.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.120
The first thing we want to do
is to split the hair into five

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.040
which can be a little bit tricky.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.360
So you can do
this kind of different ways.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.560
You could split into two
and then four

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.600
and then try and get a fifth section,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.440
but I'm just gonna split it
kind of as equally as I can.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.280
So that can be one section...

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.920
two...

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.200
it's difficult to try and keep them
separate as well.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.400
If you have anyone on hand like a mom
or a sister or a brother,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.360
um, you could ask them
to help you do this,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.160
{\an5}'cause this is actually--
I find this is the trickiest bit

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.720
{\an5}is just getting all the sections
ready,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.480
{\an8}but I think this will do.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.000
{\an5}So if I just split this one
into two. even.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.920
So I've got two sections here,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.240
and you'll have
this section in the middle...

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.560
and then I'm gonna have
these two in this hand.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.640
Now you've got your five
sections,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.800
the braid is actually
quite straightforward.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.400
When I've seen this before

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.680
I was like, oh, that's gonna be
so complicated to do,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.440
but it's actually quite a simple pattern
to follow.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.480
So I'm gonna start with this section

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.920
which is the innermost section
kind of nearest my face,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.280
and I'm gonna pass that
over the section next to it...

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.360
and then under that middle section.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.360
And now I'm gonna hold that
section that was in the middle,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.800
now is in that hand,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.640
and that has become
the new middle section

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.480
which I'm just gonna leave
down the middle.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.680
And now I'm gonna take
the outermost section,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.120
so this one here,
and pass it over that section

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.320
and under the middle section,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.760
and that is gonna become
the new middle section.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.280
So now I'm gonna pick up
that in that hand...

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.840
and then you're gonna start
from this side again,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.800
so the section closet to your face
is gonna go over the next section...

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.040
and then under the middle.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.400
The hardest bit of this braid
is like when you're starting off

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.040
to get it all kind of in position.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.480
And then once the braid's
been started a bit,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.000
it gets a little bit easier,
so now that middle section is there.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.600
And then we're gonna take this
top section at the back,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.400
pass it over the section
next to it,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.920
and under the middle section...

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.560
like so.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.840
And then we're gonna go back,
so the section closest to your face

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.720
over the next section.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.080
And then under the middle.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.760
So then...

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.800
section at the back
over and under the middle...

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.880
and over and under--so you just got to
remember

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.000
over and under the middle really
from each side.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.800
And as you can see, now it's starting
to take shape a little bit more

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.440
so it's getting
a little bit easier for me.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.160
And as you can see,
my layers at the front, my fringe

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.600
is kind of coming out a bit,
but I'm gonna sort that out later,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.040
so don't worry about that.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.080
So then this back section over...

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.560
and under the middle.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.240
This is such a pretty hairstyle to do.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.520
You can see already just how
thick it's making the braid.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.440
If you have--I think this
would be difficult to do

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.200
if you do have shorter hair.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.280
So I would suggest clipping in
your hair extensions first of all

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.440
just to give you the length
that you kind of need

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.760
for this kind of braid.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.160
And then once you get to the end
of your hair

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.800
and you feel like you can't braid
any more,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.840
you just want to take the small
hair elastic

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.640
and just tie off the braid.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.800
And now I'm just gonna sort out
my fringe.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.440
So I'm gonna take bobby pins
that I said would be handy earlier,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.400
and I'm just gonna pin this back

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.800
and then I'm just going through
and kind of pull on the braid

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.960
just so you can see
the really pretty pattern a bit easily.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.280
There you have it guys.
