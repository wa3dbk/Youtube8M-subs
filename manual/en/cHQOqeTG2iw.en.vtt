So how does one create it really awesome and
effective bearded dragon setup? Hi, this is

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.580
Abigail Kessler, Co-Founder of Raising Reptiles. In
this video, I'm going to show you how to create

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.849
an awesome bearded dragon setup. Now I'm going
to keep this video under 3 minutes which is

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.590
a monumental challenge for me. As I love talking
about why you do certain things and I'm also a

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.290
bit of a perfectionist. Hey challenge accepted.
So without further ado, let's get started.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.840
Now today I'm going to be setting up a used
large wide exo terra enclosure. This enclosures

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.840
are 36 inches long, 18 tall, and 18 deep.
They are excellent minimum size tanks for

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.160
a single bearded dragon. Inside I'm using
exo terra 40 gallon sand mat and we recommend

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.760
this substrate or regular slate tile. The
one disadvantage of slate tile has is that

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.710
it makes the tank very heavy, however both
are fantastic. So when I first set up a tank,

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.320
I like to map out how it will look. And this
is essentially just a mind map. Whenever you're

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.360
creating something you wanna make sure that
you have the basic elements down pat. So I

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.760
know where my lighting is going to go and
I know which side I'm going to have the heat

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.870
on. Where I am going to have my water dishes
etc. For this setup I'm going to have my basking

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.490
spot over here and all of my food and water
dishes this way and once you have the core

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.490
elements in place then you can decorate it
however you want. As you can see I added a

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.330
water dish to the enclosure. We do not recommend
adding these dishes to any enclosure that

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.200
isn't extremely well ventilated. The exo terra
enclosures have completely screen tops as

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.720
well as frontal ventilation so it's fine and
humidity isn't going to exceed&nbsp; '30-'40 percent.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.180
However in some plastic cages or even wooden
ones, at times, it will exceed that. And so,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.159
if there is going to be any risk, just leave
the water dish out and give your Dragon regular

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.159
soakings and moisture filled vegetables. So,
as you can see this is a fairly simple set

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.870
up. We have the core elements down. We have
the basking spot, something for him to climb

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.329
on, with proper water dishes and we have a
solid cool and a warm end. We also have a

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:33.540
place that he can hide under here. Another
option that you could do is to take this which

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.139
is just a cave and put it on the end. That
is more of a bulky style and if the dragon

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:47.139
is insecure then forget about style and give
it more places for it to hide. And obviously

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.249
there are so many different things you can
do. You can get pieces of Grapewine and have

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:59.200
a vertical climbing space. Or, you know, just
make your own background, your own ledges.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.169
There are magnetic worm dishes that you can
stick on to the sides. Tons of different ways

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:08.879
to build the set up. But these are the basics
right now and a bearded dragon would be extremely

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.260
happy in this type of arrangement. And so
now let's move on to the lighting.&nbsp;Back here

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.129
I just have a mini deep down with 100 Watt
basking light in it. You will determine the

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.540
proper basking light wattage by where the
basking spot is in relationship to that light

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.689
and what temperatures you’re actually getting.
Secondly the UVB light. We highly recommend

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:32.849
zoo med’s T5 output. Stick a 10.0 tube in
there and you will be good to go. Fluorescent

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.849
tubes are one of the best forms of lightings
on the market. Fantastic for bearded dragons.
