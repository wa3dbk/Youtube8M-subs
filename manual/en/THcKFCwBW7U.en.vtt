Hi I’m Kat and this week I’ve hit the streets to bring you some fast fashion tips that will instantly update your wardrobe.

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:30.500
Now being stylish isn’t always about wearing top to toe trends, what’s more important is actually how wear it

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:44.500
So, I’m going to show you some simple changes that can really transform any outfit

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:52.500
I brought the Matalan fashion booth along to help me, so let’s find some people to work my magic on

00:00:55.001 --> 00:01:03.500
Excuse me, hi my names Kat; I’m doing some style refresh tips today and I wondered if you would fancy having a bit of a makeover? 

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:04.500
What do you reckon?

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:06.500
Yea definitely / perfect bring it on:

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:08.500
Is that alright? Brilliant come this way

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:19.500
Ok so, we’re going to go for a loose sweater, now I’ve chosen stripes because they’re always going to look cool; they just look really easy and chic. 

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:24.500
And then we’re going to go for some studded pumps because they’ve got a bit of a fashion feel but they’re still flat so you can still run around after the boys!

00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:30.500
Now if you can pop into the booth and pop this on for me I think you’d look great in a little bit of colour.

00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:33.500
I’d like you to try on a blazer and some pumps

00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:34.500
Yea looks good

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:38.500
I’m going to put you in this seasons Aztec pyjama pants

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:43.500
Now I’ve gone for a blouse that’s got a great crop of colour, its not going to be revealing

00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:47.500
Do you want to step in and have a try and I’ll look after the boys, there you go darling

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:52.500
Danny, are you ready?

00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:53.500
I’m ready!

00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:56.500
Yea you look amazing in pink, do you want to have a look in the mirror

00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:57.500
Yes

00:01:58.501 --> 00:01:59.500
No, I do like the top a lot

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:04.500
See, I like the boots and having the jeans rolled up a bit, I think that a little more flattering because obviously they’re an ankle length

00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:13.500
I chose Danny because she’s obviously already got a great casual style. She said that she lives in Spain, so I’ve chosen a sleeveless shirt which is in a beautiful colour, 

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:19.500
so when she’s here she can layer it up with something that’s going to be a little bit warmer and when she over there she can still look really cool.

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:24.500
Great, what do you think?

00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:25.500
Very nice! 

00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:32.500
It has a bit of that French feel, and it’s got a bit of the neon spots coming through, which is also great for autumn winter and its go a bit of colour.

00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:37.500
Let’s take you to the mirror…

00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:40.500
Oh wow, I really like the colour

00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:41.500
Oh great do you?

00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:42.500
Yea, I’ve never tried this colour on before

00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:51.500
Capped sleeves so you’re not showing too much flesh in the office, the patterns really cute, and the court shoes, just to give you 
a little bit of height and make you feel a little bit more sophisticated 

00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:55.500
These are really comfortable, I’ve never actually found some heels for work, I’m always in flats!

00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:58.500
Now the thing I always think with work wear is that you don’t always have to do wear white and black. 

00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:03.500
Why not just inject a great top of colour to liven up your work wear wardrobe? 

00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:08.500
Id finish off with some really great cuts to make your outfit a little bit more sophisticated, but still really easy to wear

00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:14.500
Yay, what do you think?

00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.500
Yea lovely

00:03:15.501 --> 00:03:16.500
What do you think kids?

00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:17.500
Thumbs up!

00:03:18.501 --> 00:03:19.500
It’s a great shape on you

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.500
Kid: Yea, it’s nice

00:03:25.501 --> 00:03:29.500
Kat: Ah wow look at you, would you ever wear such eye catching pants?

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.500
Heather: No, I would never have picked any of this out!

00:03:31.501 --> 00:03:32.500
Kat: Really?

00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:33.500
Heather: No

00:03:33.501 --> 00:03:35.500
Heather: oh wow, I like it; I like the trousers!

00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:36.500
Kat: Do you?!

00:03:36.501 --> 00:03:37.500
Heather: Yea and the hat!

00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:45.500
Most people would probably team those pants with something black, but you can really, really take a colour. I think the hat really suits you; it brings the whole look together.

00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:53.500
So Heather is already wearing a really great green shirt, and lots of girls these day stick to their uniform of skinny jeans and  boots,

00:03:53.501 --> 00:04:01.500
which of course look great, but I don’t think there should be any excuse for not being a little more fashion forward with a few key injections into your wardrobe, 

00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:10.500
the hat is a brilliant one as its always going to polish up an outfit, and of course you need to be a little bit confident to wear it, but once you get used to it I’m sure you’re going to see it as a winner!

00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:20.500
So if I was to tell you that the top and the shoes were both from Matalan, would you be surprised?

00:04:21.501 --> 00:04:22.500
Yeah

00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:23.500
Yeah definitely

00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:24.500
I wouldn’t believe that, no!

00:04:24.501 --> 00:04:25.500
They feel really good quality

00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:26.500
Oh, is it in Matalan now?!

00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:27.500
Yea!

00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:28.500
Oh really??

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:29.500
It’s in store today!

00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:30.500
Ill pop over and buy it then!

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:41.500
Kat: So next time you’re thinking of grabbing that trusty old favourite remember my top tips and consider your options it could take you from conventional to catwalk!
