00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.299
The Scuderi Engine has the same number of
pistons as a conventional engine

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.719
that is a four cylinder engine will
remain a four cylinder engine, it will

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.810
just have two sets of paired cylinders
instead of four individual cylinders

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.159
in order for us to perfect the split cycle 
design

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:28.029
we had to go against conventional
thinking and figure out how to fire

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.929
after top dead center,

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.810
and in fact this is one of our major
breakthroughs

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.640
and it is one of the biggest features in our
patent portfolio.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.700
Flame speed or combustion rate

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.870
has been known for decades to be a
powerful multiplier of engine performance.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.710
In our engine it's actually more
critical because it allows us to fire

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.130
after top dead center.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.360
One of the main features of our engine
is the massive turbulence that is

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.500
created

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.470
in our combustion process by the
high-pressure air

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.320
this allows us to have a very rapid
flame speed

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.820
in fact so fast that it's literally two
times faster than anything previously

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.250
obtained.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.540
With the configuration of the Scuderi
engine were able to do things that are

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.250
either very difficult to do in a
conventional engine

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.270
or require additional equipment.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.860
For example a Miller effect which allows you
to extract more energy out of the

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.280
expanding gases, is easily accomplished in
our engine

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.050
simply by increasing the stroke of our
combustion cylinder

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.010
the Scuderi engine

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.300
has a dedicated compression cylinder and a
separate dedicated combustion cylinder.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.280
This is a significant advantage in air
hybrid applications because it means

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.510
that the compression cylinders

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.870
compression ratio is not limited by the
combustion process.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.270
because the Scuderi engine

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.990
has high turbulence going into the
combustion process

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.940
it has very rapid atomization of fuel/air
mixture

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.180
allowing for a more complete combustion
process and a much cleaner burn

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.330
as a result we can obtain compression
ratios in excess of 100 to 1

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.520
which means

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.650
that we can pump air too much higher
pressures

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.209
far more efficiently than any air hybrid
system utilizing a conventional engine.

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.669
Hybrids are a great idea,

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:16.629
anytime you can recapture and store energy
that is normally lost, your going to realize

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:17.829
major gains,

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.250
however electric hybrids require two
separate systems

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.289
using complex components and controls, and as 
a result they're very expensive.

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.119
Electric hybrids are limited to
recovering

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.029
energy off the braking of the vehicle.

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:33.929
The Scuderi engine however

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.159
can additionally recover energy off of

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.839
engine exhaust,

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.709
which means it can be used on stationery
applications.

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.039
Were able to do this because we store
energy as compressed air

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.170
no other hybrid system is able
to do this.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.469
A turbo charger is a high pressure
blower that forces air into an engine

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.039
enabling the engine to produce more power

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:57.150
commonly referred to as boosting

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.959
however boosting increases both pressure
and temperature

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.089
if the temperature gets too high

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.869
the fuel will prematurely detonate or knock

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:09.569
this limits the amount of boost a
conventional engine can achieve to

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.879
about 1.5 bar

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.079
in the Scuderi split cycle engine

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.289
the crossover passage provides an
opportunity to cool the intake air after

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:19.709
it is compressed

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.359
this makes our engine very resistant to
knock

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.749
and can therefore be boosted to pressures in
excess of 2.5 bar, the result

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:31.139
is a gasoline engine with a power output of
almost 70% higher

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.099
than that of a convention gasoline
engine

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.469
we are the perfect air hybrid because we
do not have to switch the mode of operation

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:42.819
are engine already uses compressed air
in its combustion process

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.369
this gives you the ability to do things
outside the engine

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:51.419
such as operate tools or blow up tires, this
is a huge benefit for industrial and

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.569
military applications

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.009
the Scuderi engine has an enormous impact
on the emissions of Diesel engines

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.769
because our combustion process of firing after
top dead center

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.339
simultaneously produces both higher
average temperatures

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:07.269
and lower peak temperatures

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.189
both soot and NOx emissions are
dramatically reduced

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:15.169
this has become a major benefit to
today's Diesel engines especially in

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:20.079
lite of the tighter emission standards
being imposed on Diesel engines

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.999
companies are currently investing heavily
in trying to accomplish things like

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:26.520
super charging, Miller effect

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.930
and a cost-effective hybrid system

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.210
all of these things

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.890
are intrinsic in the design of the Scuderi engine
