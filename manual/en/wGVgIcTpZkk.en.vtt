00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:07.940
\f0\fs28 \cf0 Hi. It's Mr. Andersen and in
this podcast I'm going to talk about life.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.539
I'm actually going to talk about a lot about
life. Because this is the first in a series

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.440
of podcasts I'll call life on earth where
I'm going to talk about the diversity of life

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.940
on our planet. In this one we're going to
talk about the general characteristics of

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.750
life and the three domains of life. But in
each of the subsequent podcasts we'll talk

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.580
about viruses and fungi and plants and animals
and vertebrates and invertebrates. And so

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.320
let's get started. And so let's start with
the history of life on our planet. So if the

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.010
earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago,
life pretty much shows up when the crust starts

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.250
to cool. So life actually could exist then
it does. First life on our planet is single

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.940
cell. These are some of the most ancient fossils
on our planet. These are actually stromatolites.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.880
And these would be some modern day stromatolites.
Remember life on our planet, first life, had

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:01.260
to be underneath the ocean because there was
so much UV radiation. Until we had an atmosphere

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.150
life had to be underneath the water. But basically
it's single cell, prokaryotic life. We have

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.320
photosynthesis show up. And so oxygen starts
to accumulate. Then eukaryotic life, multicellular

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.030
life, like 1 billion years ago. And then all
the things we think of as life. Like animals,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.130
plants, dinosaurs, flowers, those things show
up fairly recently in the evolutionary history

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.030
of life on our planet. And so there are some
characteristics that all life shares. In other

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.170
words if you don't have all seven of these,
then you're not alive. And so first one is

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.890
homeostasis. Basically you can maintain a
stable internal environment. And we do that

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.660
through the use of mostly negative feedback
loops. You have to be organized. We go all

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.870
the way from atoms and molecules all the way
up to the level of biosphere when we're talking

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.250
about biology. But there's organization. Most
life, in fact all life, is built on cells.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.640
Next you have to have metabolism. That's the
sum of all chemical reactions you have inside

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.931
that allows you to harness the energy or the
free energy available to live. You have to

00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:07.229
get bigger, grow, develop. You have to be
able to evolve or adapt over time. You have

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.329
to be able to respond to your environment.
And then you have to be able to reproduce.

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:16.319
Either sexually or asexually. And so if we
were to play the quick alive or not alive

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:27.099
game, is bamboo alive? Yes. Is a panda bear
alive? Yes. Is lightning alive? No. Is a stomach

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.959
alive? No. It's not. It's part of a living
thing, so it's not able to adapt or reproduce

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.901
on its own. It's just part of a living thing.
And so when we're talking about life, we're

00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:42.470
not generally talking about viruses. We call
these things non-cellular replicators. And

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.639
so they're not classified as life. Now can
they evolve and change over time? For sure.

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:53.109
But they do that, here's some bacteriophages
injecting their DNA into a bacteria. They

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:58.219
do that by using other cells to do the hard
work. Or to do the growth from them. And so

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:05.249
when we look at life we classify life into
one of three domains. And so this right here

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:11.159
would be the last universal common ancestor.
So that would be LUCA right here. In other

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.719
words this right here would be the ancestor
that is shared by all life on our planet.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.989
And so basically it's broken down into three
domains. We've got bacteria. So something

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:27.239
like e. coli. We're going to have archaea
bacteria. That's going to be ancient bacteria.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.719
Things that would live like in the hot pots
of Yellowstone Park. And then we have eukaryotic

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:36.840
life. An example of that would be animals,
fungi and plants. And so why do we classify

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.639
life into these three domains? Because we
really started doing that, you know, just

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:47.140
in the last 30 years did we come up with this.
And so basically let's look at a venn diagram.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.650
This is a venn diagram right here. This would
be the eukaryotic cells right here. This would

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.430
be the bacteria cells in here. And this would
be the archaea bacteria in here. And so first

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.060
let's talk about what's in the middle. What's
some characteristics that are shared by all

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.780
life on our planet? Well, like we said they're
made up of cells. They've got some kind of

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.670
genetic material. So they have DNA and they
use RNA to do their work. What else do they

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.389
have? They're going to have a membrane around
the outside. A cell membrane or a plasma membrane.

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.639
What else do they have? They're going to have
ribosomes because they have to actually make

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.009
a living. So they're going to have to actually
use this DNA to make proteins. And then they're

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:32.330
going to have some kind of a cytosol or cytoplasm.
So all life on our planet shares all of this.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.360
But they don't share all the characteristics.
So if we were to look at this, what is something

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.759
eukaryotic life have, up here, that bacteria
and archaea bacteria don't? Well they're going

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.361
to have a nucleus. That's where the name comes
from. What else are they going to have? They're

00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:53.050
going to have organelles. Now are all of these
multicellular? Not necessarily up here. But

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.180
they're definitely going to have a nucleus
and organelles. If we look down here at bacteria,

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.680
what's something that bacteria have that neither
of the other two have? Well just one thing

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.340
to quickly get started, they have what's called
peptidoglycan. So they have a chemical in

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.801
a bacteria, so if this is a bacteria, they'll
have their DNA right here in a circle. They're

00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:14.960
basically going to have a chemical that makes
up the cell wall around the outside. And that's

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.620
made up of a chemical called peptidoglycan.
Luckily they have peptidoglycan because we

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.650
can use antibiotics to actually kill them.
If we look over here at archaea bacteria,

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.470
we classify them with the bacteria in a group
called monerans for a long period of time.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.820
But basically we realized that they don't
have peptidoglycan. And they've got differences

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.480
that make them their own domain. And so one
thing that you probably are familiar with

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.919
is that archaea bacteria live in incredibly
harsh environments. But you probably didn't

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.580
know is that they have the characteristic
that makes them much different. So if we were

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:56.659
to look at their membranes. This is going
to be a phospholipid. So if this is a phospholipid

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:04.479
in a typical eukaryotic cell. So like this.
Remember our membrane is made up of a phospholipid

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.420
bilayer. So it's going to be a number of these
repeated over and over and over again. If

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.080
you were to look at it in a eukaryotic or
bacterial cell it's going to look just like

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.860
that. But if we were to look at it in, let's
find a different color, in an archaea bacteria,

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.800
their's looks way different. So they're going
to have not only these hydrocarbon tails,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.719
but they're going to have branched hydrocarbon
tails. So they're going to branch off like

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:30.349
that. And they also sometimes will form, so
if this is the other side, they'll actually

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:37.039
attach on either side like that and they'll
form just a monolayer. So it's going to be

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:41.030
attached all the way across. And so this is
going to be a characteristic that just archaea

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:46.069
have. Why do they have a membrane that looks
like that? Well if they live in a harsh environment,

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:49.710
that allows their membrane to kind of stay
attached together when the temperature gets

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.729
really high or the pH changes radically. And
so basically what scientists did is they looked

00:06:54.729 --> 00:07:01.139
at all the characteristics of archaea, bacteria
and eukaryea and they found that there's a

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:07.319
whole heck of a lot more in this area, things
that are shared by eukaryotes and archaea

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:13.819
and not shared by bacteria and archaea. And
so we ended up classifying us more related

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:19.520
to archaea bacteria then them. And so that's
basically our three domains. But now we're

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.319
going to kind of work into more detail in
each of these different groups. And we're

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:26.770
going to spend a lot of time in the eukaryotes
because that's what we are. And so that's

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.909
the first start. That's life. And I hope that's
helpful.}
