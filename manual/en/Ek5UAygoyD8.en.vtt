Hi! Welcome to Feminist Fridays, a series
where we explore the social, the political

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.590
and the media from a feminist and an intersectional
perspective....and use a lot of f-words.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:09.760
[beep]

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.200
Today I kind of want to address an issue involving
intersectionality on this channel. Obviously

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.410
not every video I've made is perfect, I would
say none of them are perfect in that regard

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.350
but it's something that every week I'm excited
to make a script for and super pumped to talk

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.660
about a new subject.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.780
However because I am making videos based off
of whims and what I'm excited about that week

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.600
it doesn't always make for the most consistent
video topics. And I've noticed that even though

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.130
I've talked about race in a couple videos
I haven't really focused on it in the way

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.899
that it deserves to be focused on. Also I
realize by not focusing on race I kind of

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.360
become part of the problem.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.899
Third wave feminism kind of prides itself
on being intersectional in ways that previous

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.030
waves haven't so much been--but it's also
really easy to fall into the trap of white

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.000
feminism. Which, disclaimer, is not feminism
practiced by white people but a type of feminism

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.580
that really only focuses on the needs of straight,
white, cis, able-bodied women.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.650
Anyway, my point being that I have a lot of
video topics planned to address these issues

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.100
of not talking about race and racial identity
and racism as much as I should be...because

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.500
apparently even women of color can fall into
the trap of white feminism. Anyway, I thought

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.640
a good way to start this off would be to talk
about my own racial identity and my experience

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.090
as a mixed-race Asian-American.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.990
Long story short, my dad is Japanese and my
mom is just...hella white. My mom was born

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.070
in the United States and she's just a whole
hodge-podge of Scottish and French and English

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.920
and whatever. Like many other white Americans
she doesn't have a real sense of her own cultural

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.299
heritage which just sort of happens a lot
here. My dad is a little bit tricker...he's

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.639
an immigrant; he immigrated here in his 20's
from Brazil. Brazil has the largest population

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:16.019
of Japanese people outside of Japan but it
does make my own cultural understanding a

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.239
little bit blurred.

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.389
I don't really have a good sense of my Japanese
heritage because culturally my dad is Brazilian

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:28.209
and he grew up eating Brazilian food and speaking
Portuguese. So I don't really have any sense

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.579
of Japanese culture, other than the fact that
my dad owns a Japanese restaurant so my only

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:39.239
real connection to that is through food. Growing
up being mixed race, I think, is confusing

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.919
for most people.

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:46.900
The overwhelming question that a lot of multi-racial
people find themselves asking is, "What the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.099
fuck am I?" I don't really feel white but
I also don't really feel Japanese either.

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:58.699
I spent a lot of my childhood and adolescence
kind of trying to pass. Not to play up any

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:04.019
of my Japanese side, not to, like, watch anything
or wear anything that's too stereotypically

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.760
Japanese. I stayed away from anime probably
for that main reason.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.430
One thing I did notice is that there was a
lot of othering. This kind of where racism

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.659
and sexism kind of intersects. In my younger
teenage years I ended up valuing myself a

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.589
lot on my appearance and whether or not boys
thought I was cute which, for any girls watching

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:28.969
this, is not a healthy thing to base your
self esteem on. But we live in a culture where

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:34.139
women are value on their appearance so it
was one of those things I ended up internalizing.

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.599
One concern that I had a lot was: is this
guy going to be attracted to me? Is he into

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.620
Asian girls? White girl is kind of the default
and I always felt like I was in the category

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.669
of "other".

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:51.559
I also got a lot of racist "compliments" growing
up and even in the last couple years...things

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:56.799
that I didn't realize were racist and found
flattering at the time and I look back on

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.779
now and I'm just so grossed out by. I dated
a white guy a little bit in my freshman and

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:08.779
sophomore year of high school and there were...a
lot of racist comments but the one that sticks

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.579
out to me the most was, "You're the reason
I have an Asian fetish."

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.599
Which I didn't realize that an entire race
of people was considered a fetish, so, thank

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.519
you for that.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.669
Another comment that I got a couple times
was, "I'm not normally into Asian girls but--"

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.930
followed by "I think you're pretty," or "cute"
or "I want to make out with you," or something.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.500
Which is like, what? Thank you for ranking
me above all other Asian women and deeming

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.349
me worthy of your affection. I feel so honored.

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.689
Obviously those were not the only comments
I've ever received but those are the ones

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:51.169
I still think about and am shocked by. The
function of that always seemed a reminder

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:57.400
that I'm not of the white ideal and, you know,
I'm in this whole other category and I'm just

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.020
so lucky white guys are even paying attention
to me. That's something I think that happens

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.050
to a lot of women of color--it's just this
exotification of anyone who isn't white and

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.949
it's just so gross.

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:14.939
Anyway that is just part of my racial experience.
Um, I could talk for a really long time but

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:19.000
I'm not going to do that because this might
already be kind of a long video. So yeah,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.530
if you want to leave a comment letting me
know about your own racial identity and your

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.449
experiences with race cause I'd really like
to hear from you guys. And maybe you've gone

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.080
through a similar experience. I don't know
your life.
