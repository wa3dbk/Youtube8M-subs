00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:01.869
[woman volunteer] do you know about House
Bill 194?

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.060
[Greg] right now at this time we unfortunately

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.240
are facing a challenge to one of the
fundamental rights that we have living

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.629
in a democracy House Bill one ninety four
has past which severely restricts one's

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.860
ability to vote and ability to take recourse
it their vote was not counted

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.390
[woman volunteer] so you haven't heard of
it huh?

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.420
[Michael] House Bill 194 will hurt Ohio because
it will

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.349
limit the ability of people to get into
the ballot box

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.689
specifically lessening the amount of
time that you can vote prior to election day

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.480
requiring forms of i_d_ that a lot of
less privileged people don't have the

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.970
resources to obtain. prohibiting the
truth to be told the certain voters

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.500
about where they should be voting

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.550
scary stuff like that

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.230
[Richard] people like my parents were around
ninety years old

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.080
are going to be feeling like they're
under more pressure to do things just

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.540
right they'll have less time to votes and
i know that

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.920
they need to do not like these efforts

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.460
at all. [Albert] voting is a right

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.820
not a privelege

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.780
and our democracy is harmed

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.600
whenever the right to

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.750
vote iss taken away

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.150
regardless of your

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.030
political persuasion it will just limit

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.220
the ability of

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.900
people to vote and that's the one great place
of

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.390
totally equality --one-person one-vote. so
i think that our founding fathers would

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.330
cringe if they thought

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.780
about what one ninety four is all about.
[Reida] this is non-partisan this is

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.850
affecting everybody

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.030
[Jane] the purpose should be

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.930
for all of us, Democrat and Republican, getting
the electorate

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.110
to vote

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.240
[Greg] luckily in Ohio citizens have what
sometimes known as a citizen veto

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.229
they actually have an opportunity
to have their voices heard after bill

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.470
was signed into law so in ohio we have
ninety days

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.260
from the date the law goes into affect to
collect a certain

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.370
number of signatures from across the state

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.380
which will actually stop the law from going
into effect until it's voted on in the next

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.280
general election by the people
we have to get this on that ballot

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.530
so that we can vote on it ourselves

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.920
there is a high need

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.280
for people to circulate a petition. [Kimberly]
Without

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.909
the volunteers it really doesn't

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:06.909
happen

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.569
[woman volunteer] excuse me are you registered
to vote? [Albert] you can't be bashful [woman

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.029
volunteer] we have to get the signatures right
now

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:13.650
[Michael] get involved get on the internet
learn about

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.510
one ninety four and talk about it with

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.260
your neighbors and your friends and
your co-workers

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.299
and by gosh, sign the petition
so it can at least get on the ballot

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.299
at the right time

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.819
[woman volunteer] appreciate it

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.139
[petition signer] thank you
[woman volunteer] spread the word

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:28.389
[Greg] by all Ohioans

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.190
working together --sign the petition and circulate
the petitions

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.659
we're going to be able to collect the needed
signatures to stop this law from

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:35.689
going into effect

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:41.010
you can go to BarackObama dot com and
look for a signing event in your area

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.319
but the need to start now is great

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.739
we really must start collecting signatures
right now
