00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.950
the reason that the carriers lock this down
obviously

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.010
it presents from doing something like that 
what would happen if the dial

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.219
disappeared

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.269
it is pretty flexible at the coner here

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.320
then I could do a record of

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.619
this TV program

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.619
that is actually kinda cool

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.730
hello everyone Michael here with the
daily note 2 youtube channel

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.590
i want to show you some differences that
you wouldn't notice

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.040
if you had different carrier over the other
or you had a phone from

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.450
a different country

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.770
so here are

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.230
a couple of things for example

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.060
Robert F told me he tried to
change his icons on the bottom

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.320
but it was not able to. it is because the
carriers like to lock this down

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.370
that would really be a tragic for me 
cuz I really don't use

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.140
this message app
because

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.869
people pretty much have stopped using it
in Korea in favor of

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.810
app called Kakao talk
it is pretty much the exact samething as

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.580
WhatsApp Messenger

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.290
messaging in Korea has
always been cheap

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.540
2 cents to send out 
and it is free to receive

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.520
but instead they would rather use free
messaging app and pretty much the whole country

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.470
has jumped up on that
the reason that the carriers

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.130
lock this down obviously

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.200
it presents from doing something like that 
what would happen if the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.700
dial disappeared

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.409
all you would have to do is
just add it back in from your apps

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.920
and there you go.. I guess they wanted to 
stop answering those customer

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.530
service phone call

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.020
i really have a hard time believing that 
they were getting all

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.710
that many of them

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.270
they're probably
smartphone expert

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.850
arm's length away from you

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.390
any given time
but who knows?

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.610
other things i want to move to
is that

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.119
it was pointed out yesterday that 
I did show some charging pins

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:16.479
on wireless charging pin on the samsung 
galaxy note 2.. these are for that

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.629
if you want some more information on that
just check out yesterday's video but

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.149
actually not all carriers have them

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:26.299
specifically Sprint and verizon

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.749
have decided not to go with the wireless
charging pins for some reason maybe

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:34.699
because they have a CDMA antenna
that they need for

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.749
they need
somehow that conflicted.. i'm not sure

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:40.289
but

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:44.039
so the next thing I wanna to show you obviously
is TV antenna

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:48.319
the TV antenna if i had to guess it is

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.700
some kind of stainless steel and

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.200
and it's pretty flexible at the coner here

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.099
it's also very durable

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.699
but i actually never use it because
i always have a something to stream

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:07.559
but if you want to see it an action 
I do want to show it in detail

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:09.909
it is kinda cool

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:16.169
say that
it does work with multi-tasking

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:20.369
and somehow they thought 
putting the phone dialer

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:23.129
and the messaging app on top of TV

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.029
would make sense do so i don't know 
why they put it there but it's there

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.719
see if you could notice but
when the TV is on

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:36.539
it's doing some scharping on the entire screen 
so even my internet browser on the

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.219
bottom is affected a little bit

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:44.189
the screen is extra sharpened 
so you could see like wide edges

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.129
around the text 
it is kinda annoying

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.059
but it's there

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:53.359
there are some cool features
like screen shot I

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:54.459
capture

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.249
screen

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.130
and then I could do a record of

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.429
the TV program

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:03.979
that is actually kinda cool or
you feel like to sleep

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:07.009
fall a sleep to TV

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:09.429
you could definitely do this

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:11.439
you could probably see the sharpening

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.299
on the text as well because of this app

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.159
some other settings here that 
i might interest you

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.729
that's what it feels like to have

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.440
TV antenna sticking out of your 
galaxy note 2 and

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.659
I don't think you're missing much

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:36.039
you have a call recording feature

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.519
and

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.740
not all carriers most carriers
especially in the US don't include

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.209
this feature
so if you approach that corner

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:49.199
you have to approach it from the outside in

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.770
you could see I get 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.139
that changed and then i could

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.900
re-size the note

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.810
just like a computer
