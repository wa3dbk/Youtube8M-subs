00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:06.050
thomas was having such a great day on
the island of sodor

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.519
it was  percy's birthday and he had no
clue what to get him

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.479
they were best friends but it's been
such a long time over a year

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:17.800
would he get him new buffers

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.559
would he get him flowers
what should it be so he thought and thought

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:26.070
thomas has known

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.810
percy for many years

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.099
but he thought

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.770
i think it's time to get some advice

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.470
and so he asked his friend stanley

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.660
stanley

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.970
what do you think i should get

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.330
percy for his birthday

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.650
well said stanley

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.890
that's a very tough subject

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.390
you and percy have been friends for so long

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.280
could you tell me what he likes

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.070
well said thomas

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.700
I know percy likes

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.650
the mail

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.890
okay

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.860
he likes the mail that's a good start

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.230
but what does that mean stanley

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.190
well

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.770
maybe

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.830
we could get him a new

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.940
flag

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.150
hey that's a great idea stanley
a new flag

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.999
you're a great friend and a useful engine
why thank you so much

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:30.630
that means a lot thomas

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.970
and off thomas chuffed

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.420
thomas was off

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.800
he knew that he would have to hurry if
he would to get what percy needed

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.009
but where would thomas find a

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.570
flag

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.980
at such a late time in the day

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.470
thomas knew exactly where to look

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.470
but he had to go over the shake shake
bridge first oh no

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.640
it's falling apart thomas knew that

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.070
there was a flag on top of the old rock
quarry but as soon as thomas arrived at

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.380
the old rock quarry

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.989
something happened

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.039
ouch my head

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.909
oh my goodness

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.389
i'm so sorry thomas

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:26.189
is there anything i can do to make up
for putting that rock on your head

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.459
said the foreman
well actually there is

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.930

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.329
and i need to give him a present

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.099
could i have the flag on top of
the rock mill

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.539
that would make percy very happy
of course thomas

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.529

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.840
to get this to percy

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.229
percy was having a super special
birthday and didn't think it could get

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:17.489
any better

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.149
that was until percy's best friend thomas
showed up

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:25.549
i've got a surprise for you percy

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:26.739

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.719
said percy

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.539
thomas replied

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:32.329
i've got a special flag

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.389

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.379

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.779
he was so happy

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:43.589
and they both chuffed

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:44.489
off

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.699
happily together
