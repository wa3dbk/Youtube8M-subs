00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:02.403
"When you come on to
Galveston it's kind of like"

00:00:02.471 --> 00:00:03.771
"you just start relaxing."

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:05.840
"And I think the people from
Houston, that's the main"

00:00:05.908 --> 00:00:07.508
"attraction of Galveston."

00:00:07.576 --> 00:00:09.360
Galveston Island today

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.013
is a popular place to
get away from it all.

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:15.050
"In an hour's time you can be
just from concrete"

00:00:15.118 --> 00:00:16.450
"to total nature."

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:21.521
[waves, seagulls]

00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:24.315
All that nature makes it
easy to forget

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:27.428
that Galveston was once
Texas' busiest city.

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:29.861
"It was the biggest
port in Texas."

00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:31.933
[steamship horn]

00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:33.801
"Galveston before the 
1900 storm"

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.365
"probably would have been
Houston."

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:40.075
Unfortunately, nature had a
different plan for Galveston.

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:42.110
[thunder, storm]

00:00:42.178 --> 00:00:45.080
Leveled by the worst hurricane
in U.S. history,

00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:47.035
Galveston never fully recovered

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:49.916
as a large port or major center 
of commerce.

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:52.953
But that is precisely why
people visit today.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:57.510
"The main attraction now
for Galveston is the beach."

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:00.161
"There's the Strand
historic distirct."

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.530
"A lot of people go down to the
historic district."

00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:06.701
"There's the county museum,
 a lot of historic homes,"

00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:08.636
"There's a lot of history in 
Galveston"

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:10.936
"and people do come for that."

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:14.541
However, for that 
peaceful island getaway,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.546
Galveston Island State Park
is the place to explore.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.551
"It's the only natural area
left on the island"

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.055
"that spans from the Gulf of
Mexico to Galveston Bay."

00:01:27.123 --> 00:01:30.383
While most folks are drawn
to the Gulf shoreline,

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:33.961
more and more are discovering
the park's quieter side.

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:35.730
"Most of the people that
come to camp,"

00:01:35.798 --> 00:01:38.065
"they want the campsite
that's closest to the beach."

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.301
"But then we do have
some campers"

00:01:40.373 --> 00:01:42.503
"that are here for the birds
and the fishing."

00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:44.903
"And they stay on the bay
side of the park."

00:01:45.373 --> 00:01:49.576
"He's to the right now of 
where the egrets were."

00:01:49.653 --> 00:01:52.446
"They fly with their head
up just a little bit..."

00:01:52.598 --> 00:01:55.483
Until recently this rich 
wildlife habitat

00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:58.185
was endangered by erosion.

00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:01.488
"There started to be some
subsidence."

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.425
"And they started realizing that
we were losing"

00:02:03.493 --> 00:02:06.293
"most of the marsh area on
the bay."

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.763
After an extensive restoration
project, however,

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:12.066
the marsh is
healthy again.

00:02:12.135 --> 00:02:14.068
"The marsh is restoring itself."

00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:16.136
"We've had seagrass 
come in"

00:02:16.206 --> 00:02:19.941
"that was practically non-
existent in this area of the bay

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.876
"and it's now back."

00:02:21.945 --> 00:02:24.210
[tanker horn]

00:02:25.015 --> 00:02:28.090
"It's a hard balance between
nature and the economy."

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.551
"Galveston struggles with that."

00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:33.555
But spend a little time
on Galveston Island

00:02:33.623 --> 00:02:35.450
and it becomes clear.

00:02:35.518 --> 00:02:37.716
In spite of some stormy history,

00:02:37.785 --> 00:02:39.930
nature is the economy here.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.696
"Without the wetlands, without
the nursery area,"

00:02:42.773 --> 00:02:45.500
"there wouldn't be any fishing
or shrimping in Galveston."

00:02:45.568 --> 00:02:48.336
"So it's very important that we
keep this area"

00:02:48.405 --> 00:02:50.938
"maintained as it is, natural."

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:53.508
"This is home for me."

00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:55.976
"What keeps me here is what's
right back behind me"

00:02:56.045 --> 00:02:56.911
"is the beach."

00:02:56.981 --> 00:02:58.313
"I don't think there's anything
better than to"

00:02:58.383 --> 00:03:00.315
"start your day off with
watching the sun rise"

00:03:00.383 --> 00:03:02.548
"up over the Gulf of Mexico."

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:05.116
"I can't find a better way to
start a day."

00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:10.325
