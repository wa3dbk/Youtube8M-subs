00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.590
Dwayne 'Swoop' Simpson: Hey B. What?

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.150
Eric 'Broadway' Jones: AS.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.150
Dwayne: You know what man?

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.150
Eric: What's up?

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.050
Dwayne: You konw, I think that you and I will
be a great combination right.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.210
You know like a one, two punch, alright.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.660
Now, I think with your jump shot, right.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.490
I can just figure out ways I can get you open
so you knock down the shots and score 90 points

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.490
a game.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.490
Eric: 90 points a game?

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.490
Why not?

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.490
So you want to learn how to get a screen.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.490
Dwayne: Yeah, yeah for you.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.829
Eric: You are going to screen for me?

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.960
Dwayne: Yeah so you can get open and get some
shots up.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.960
Eric: Oh.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.030
Dwayne: I'm a good team player I don't really
care about scoring.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.030
Eric: This is a selfless act.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.600
Dwayne: I'm a selfless type of guy man.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.600
Eric: You know what?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.600
Dwayne: That's what screens are about.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.379
Eric: Let's bring in some experts..

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.379
Dwayne: Really?

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.739
Eric: at showing people on how to get open.

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:48.739
Dwayne: Oh, okay.

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.080
Eric: We got the king, King Arthur, and DP.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.080
Dwayne: Wow.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.489
Eric: That guy can set a screen.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.489
Dwayne: Okay.

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:55.489
That sounds good

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.659
Eric: So what we're going to do is we'll put
you on the defensive end.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:00:59.659
Dwayne: Okay.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:00.659
Eric: I'll be on the offense end..

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:01.659
Dwayne: Uh huh.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:02.720
Eric: and DP will set a screen on you.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.720
Dwayne: Okay.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.159
Eric: We'll move over to the court and show
the people at home how to set a proper screen.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.159
Alright, Swoop.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.159
Dwayne: What's up?

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.720
Eric: We're going to break it down.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.720
Dwayne: Okay.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.340
Eric: This is how you set a good screen.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.149
First of all DP is going to be the screener.

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.149
Dwayne: Okay.

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.759
Eric: And then Arther is going to be the one
getting screened.

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:20.759
Dwayne: Oh okay.

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:21.810
Eric: So now, this is what's going to happen.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.659
BP is going to let king Arthur know that he's
coming to set a screen by putting his hand

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:27.920
up in the air.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.520
So that gives him the signal that he's going
to set a screen.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.520
Dwayne: Okay.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.100
Eric: King Arthur, What he has to do is he
has to make sure that he gets himself open

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.240
and then waits for DP to come and set a screen.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.240
Dwayne: Nice.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.240
Nice.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.689
Eric: So everybody's got a job.

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.219
So, First DP's going to give him the signal.

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.899
He's coming to set a screen Arthur sets his
man up.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.159
DP holds his position.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.380
Arther rubs off shoulder to shoulder.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.100
He's open.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.709
Notice the action that happened down here.

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:02.049
If you come back down here king Arther, King
Arther put his what we call putting his head

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.569
in the rim because he's right under the rim.

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.240
BP gives the signal, stay there.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.360
BP stays very still so he doesn't commit a
foul.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.470
He get's a wide base, protects himself and
then King Arther is able to run his man if

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.790
a guy's trailing him, running behind him.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.840
He's going to rub shoulder to shoulder right
here.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.879
And cuts this space off so this guy can't
get around the screen.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.280
Dwayne: You're telling me that this is going
work to get you open.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.280
Eric: Absolutely.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.569
Dwayne: I gotta see..

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:35.909
Hey, man.

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.180
Eric: Let's bring in 540

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.880
Dwayne: Let's play some defense 540 to see
if they can get this guy open down here.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.829
Cause I'm a great defensive player too.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.640
Eric: Yeah and you can do whatever you want
after he sets the screen.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.120
Dwayne: Okay.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.560
What in the world has happened?

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.670
Eric: You just got screened.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.090
Dwayne: Man, that's legal?

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.130
Eric: Yeah that's legal.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.130
Dwayne: Ah, let's do it, okay.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.250
Eric: You want to try it again?

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.980
Dwayne: I got something for that one.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.190
I got something for that one.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.190
Here you go.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.900
Eric: See, you can do whatever you want off
of the screen.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.239
Go get 'em.

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.260
DP: Use me, use me, use me, use me

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.300
Eric: You never know whose going to be open
off of that screen.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.350
Dwayne: Makes sense.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.379
Alright, well thanks a lot man.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.810
I guess that's the proper way to how you learn
how to screen, huh?

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.860
Eric: Hey that's what it's all about.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.579
First you have a couple of people that are
involved in the screen.

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.620
You have the screener and you have the person
getting screened.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.620
First you want to give the signal or whatever
your signal is for going to set a screen.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.180
Then you have the guy who has to set his man
up.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.750
In this case ducking his head in the rim and
making sure he rubs off shoulder to shoulder.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.050
He protects himself and he gets wide open
and then you have a bunch of options and you

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.050
play basketball.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.069
Dwayne: Sound's good

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.730
Eric: Setting a good screen.
