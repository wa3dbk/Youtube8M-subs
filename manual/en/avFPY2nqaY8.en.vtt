Hi, my name is Nicole and today we’re going
to be going over the basics of wire wrapping

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.080
and making jewelry, and I right now I just
want to show you how to make a simple pair

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:18.180
of earrings out of carnelian beads. So, first
you need a headpin and basically you just

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.890
find a bead. You want to try to find beads
that match up so your earrings won’t be

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:34.210
lopsided. You just place the bead onto the
headpin, and it’ll stay there because the

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:44.170
headpin will hold it on. Okay, so you want
to take your chain nose pliers and hold those

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:59.760
in one hand and make your perfect loop. Pull
the wire around. And you can make the loop

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.140
as big as you like- I prefer for it to be
pretty small. Then you want to take your ear

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:31.590
wire, connect it to your loop, and then you’ll
need your flat nose to finish.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:45.310
You want to make sure that you keep the loop
tight next to the bead. Crimp the loop, and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:58.350
then you take your cutting pliers to cut the
remaining excess off. And then, just to make

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.969
sure that little tail doesn’t stick out,
you take the chain nose and crimp it down

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:11.070
again. And there you have the simplest of
earrings with carnelian.
