00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:08.069
People who have never met my JESUS, they don’t
believe in God, and they will tell me that

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.889
I just hear an imaginary voice in my head.

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.559
I laugh to myself because I know that is a
lie.

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:22.010
I want to share with you a few stories that
are my testimony for Jesus,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.090
that Jesus gave me the Holy Spirit and the
Holy Spirit is NOT just a voice in my head,

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.150
but that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of
the Living God!

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:42.500
See a year ago or so I was into four-wheeling
and I bought a jeep, and I was working quite

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.120
extensively on this jeep.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.630
And at some point the Holy Spirit spoke to
me and said; “Would you give your jeep up?

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.880
It’s become an idol!

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.640
Would you give it up to follow ME?”

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.570
And I recognized this as the voice of the
Holy Spirit, and so I prayer more fervently

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.470
and I said;
“Lord if this really your will, make it

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.470
evident to me that this is your will and provide
for me another form of transportation.”

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:19.550
And I tell you within 5 minutes I got a call
on my cell phone and someone offered me a

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.910
truck in exchange for my jeep.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:31.170
See I had prayed that; “If it’s your will
Lord, will you provide a truck?”, And the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.880
Lord provide for me what I had asked.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.270
He didn’t have to, but He blessed me with
a truck that I still have today that is completely

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.240
paid off,
I don’t own a dime on it, and it has gotten

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.909
my everywhere I need to go.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.460
My truck is not my idol,
the Lord gave it to me, and it is by far not

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.040
like my four-wheeling rig, BUT it gets me
where I need to go,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.460
and the Holy Spirit told me to do this.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.630
I know it’s not just my imagination, but
the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the LIVING

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.479
GOD,
and He leads the man of God.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:18.390
I want to give you another example: Last year
I was lying on my bed and while I was praying

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.530
the Holy Spirit spoke to me again, and I recognized
it as the voice of the Holy Spirit.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.890
He said to me; “Pack your bags and move.”

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.740
I kept on praying throughout the night and
I didn’t speak to my wife about this.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.120
In the morning my wife sat up and she spoke
to me and she said;

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.230
“Did you hear a voice last night from the
LORD?”

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.350
And is said; “What did you hear?”

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.230
And she said; “The Lord told me, “Pack
your bags and move north.”

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.250
It was identical to what I had heard, and
I knew that this was not just a voice in my

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.250
head.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.700
See the Holy Spirit is NOT just our conscience;
the Holy Spirit is not just our understanding

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.030
of the Bible.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.810
Christians today make God DEAD by thinking
that the Holy Spirit is their own imagination

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.510
or their own gut feeling, or that the Holy
Spirit is their interpretation or good understanding

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.510
of the Bible.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.000
It’s just a lie.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.090
The Holy Spirit speaks to us.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.090
HE IS ALIVE!

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.950
He has His OWN voice!

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.030
GOD IS REAL!

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.069
I want to give you another example.

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.200
When I obeyed the Lord and I moved.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.750
We were moving without any other job, and
we had a lot of debt still,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.849
and the Lord told me that He had a buyer for
my house.

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.769
See we were trying to sell our house
and people were offering me less money than

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.990
my house was worth, and we would be upside
down in our payment if this would happen.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.129
And I was concerned and I was praying about
this, and it was at this time the Holy Spirit

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.150
spoke to me again and He said;
“I have a buyer for you.”

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.150
I stored this in my heart and I believed HIM.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.680
And within a month my real-estate agent called
me and he told me;

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.419
“There is a buyer who is buying your house
for the price you asked.”

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.879
And that was the person who bought my house.

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.499
The Holy Spirit is no lie.

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.520
He speaks the truth.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.509
God speaks to His children.

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.439
The Lord gave me His Holy Spirit,
and He is the One who leads me and guides

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.439
me.

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:48.150
No Bible verse was able to tell me; “Pack
your bags and move north.”

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.610
That would be a lie.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.009
Don’t believe any Christian that tells you
that you can be led by the Bible.

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.099
You MUST have the Baptism of the Holy Spirit!

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.349
Are you truly led by the Holy Spirit?

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.020
Do you have true faith?

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.460
Or are you just led by your own intellect?

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.110
Are you just led by your Bible knowledge?

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.619
May the grace of Jesus be with you.
