00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:13.650
I competed for Australia in 2002
and 2003. I was a triathlete and also a cyclist,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.730
I’d always aspired to be the best that I
could be, you get that feeling of my body

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.909
shouldn’t be able to do this but it is,
that was the buzz that I got from it. The

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:33.420
day of my accident I went out for a training
ride and I was on my way home and as I was

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.539
coming up a rise I was struck just on my right
arm by a truck that was coming past that was

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:46.870
too close and I was then out of control and
thrown into the back of a parked four wheel

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:56.629
drive. Then woke up 12 days later in hospital
having had a number of operations and was

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:05.770
told I was a quadriplegic. It’s too big
a moment to take in and process and I can

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.370
still remember mouthing the words what happened.
The doctors told me I wouldn’t eat or breathe

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.740
myself again, and I was told I wouldn’t
walk again and wouldn’t be able to move

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.000
myself around in a wheelchair even myself again.
So very confronting, it was a total of about

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.640
seven and a half months before I was out of
hospital after the accident, so it’s a long

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.290
and lengthy process but I think once you leave
hospital, that’s really when it starts.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.310
The biggest and most difficult adjustment
for me to make was that I was obviously a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.170
very physically active person and whilst that was what I did it was also the way that I interacted

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.610
with my daughter, so taking her swimming,
taking her to the park, just playing with

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.360
her generally I had to completely change the
way that I played and interacted with at the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.960
time, my three and a half, four year old daughter.
It was about six months after I was out of

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.390
hospital that I sat down with my daughter
and we put together an application to get

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.990
an assistance dog. In my instance I waited
over four years before I received a phone

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.660
call to say my application had been successful
and I think we waited a week after receiving

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:44.230
the initial call. Fizz came down with a trainer
and we had our initial meeting. He’s an

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:52.390
incredibly athletic, bounding exuberant, well-trained
dog. The biggest thing that an assistance

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.850
dog can help you with when you’re in a wheelchair
and your hands don’t work particularly well

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.730
is picking things up. Anything that I point
to that’s in the road of the wheelchair

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.430
I can ask him to pick it up and pass it to
me so it’s not in the road anymore, but

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.240
the number one thing that he’s very helpful
for is my crutches. I can walk with the aid

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.130
of crutches but I can’t often reach them
and pick them up but he can pass them to me

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:36.380
so I can stand straight up and walk. He even
jumps up and grabs them when they’re standing

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:48.160
up now which I think is quite impressive.
The comfort and the layer of surety that having

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.410
an assistance dog provides over the top of
the way I’m now living is incredible. I’d

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.770
hate to lose that now and certainly he’s
provided for me a level of independence that

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:12.120
I otherwise wouldn’t have. The arrival of
fizz in our family has been a godsend. Since

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:20.560
his arrival the joy, the happiness, the laughter,
the fun games we’ve been able to play where

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.669
we included a dog in them is wonderful. But
certainly the relationship I have with my

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.709
daughter again with the arrival of Fizz is
wonderful.
