00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:07.900
And with that, we have our completed awards
show menu, and just in time, because it looks

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.410
like the pre-show is just ending. So, let's
go over what we've got here. We started with

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.359
our phyllo tartlets with the ricotta, and
sundried tomato, and feta, and goat cheese

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.180
inside--really, really delicious. Then, we
did our puff pastry cheese straws, which you

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:35.550
see how it sort of draws your eye up. You've
got very short, small bites of the little

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.379
smoked salmon canapes, which is a nice contrast
in height to the puff pastry cheese straws

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.320
arranged in this vase, just with some decorative
rocks in the bottom. And then of course we

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.780
go to the smoked salmon canape, with some
creme fraiche which is very creamy, and then

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:03.879
the saltiness of the fish, and the nice nutty
flavor and texture of the--this so-called

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.090
"European bread"--which you can then take
a little lemon juice to. And then we finish

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.570
with our fricos, our parmesan crackers with
mache, that baby lettuce, and served in an

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.880
alternate way in the martini glass with just
the same parmesan crisp, but not in the arced

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.710
format. So just another guideline to keep
in mind: how do you know how many appetizers

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.650
to make for your party? If it's not during
a mealtime, you want to have at least two

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.700
to three kinds of appetizers, so in this case,
we've got the four. But at least two to three

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.200
kinds, and bank on two minimum per person
for your party. If it is in place of a meal,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.920
however, you want to have--bank on five to
seven different appetizers, and again, two

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.009
to three per person. So, I'm Marieve Herington
with Expert Village, and I hope you enjoy

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.290
your award show party.
