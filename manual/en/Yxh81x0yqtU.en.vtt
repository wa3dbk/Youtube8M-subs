00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.410
Hey guys, so here�s a move that many of
you have heard of. It�s called the rainbow

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.860
and it�s not that difficult to learn. Let�s
break it down.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:19.380
So the first step is locking the ball between
your two feet. You want the ball pressed up

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.980
against the ankle, or actually the heel of
your standing

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.160
foot and you want your other foot pressed
up against the back of the ball at an angle.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:36.750
So this is your front foot where the ball�s
at the heel, you want your back foot turned

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.940
and those two wedging the ball together.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:51.690
The second step is you want to use your back
foot to roll the ball up slightly just above

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.420
the heel, just above the ankle, on your standing
foot.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.809
So here�s your standing foot, here�s your
back foot. You want to roll the ball up on

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.390
to your standing foot. Then here comes the
actual trick and

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.950
the actual motion. After you�ve rolled it
up onto your ankle, you want to pop the ball

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.579
up with your heel while leaning forward. So
you�re leaning

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:20.030
forward while you do it and popping the ball
up with your heel.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.930
Remember what I just showed you is a slow
version of the move. When I actually do this

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.119
trick like you saw in the beginning of the
video,

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.689
I�ll show me doing it again after I speak
here, but you�ll see that it is much quicker.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.289
I�m not deliberately wedging the ball and
rolling it up slowly,

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.789
I�m doing all of it in almost one motion.
Which actually makes it easier. If you do

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.469
it slower it actually becomes a little more
difficult because the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.479
speed helps the speed out. So remember, you
want to do it a little more quickly than the

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.219
slowed down process I�ve shown you here.

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.290
Well guys that�s how you do the rainbow
step by step. What I want you to do is make

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.209
sure you like this video and subscribe to
the channel.

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.739
But what I really want you to do is make sure
you comment below with your soccer related

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:07.909
comments and questions and I always answer
all your questions

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.360
and comments within 24-48 hours. I�ll even
get you started. Here is the question of the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.290
video, I�ll pop it up somewhere right here.
And I believe it

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.920
was which soccer trick do you want to learn
the most. So be sure to tell me which one

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.480
you want to learn the most in the comments
below and who know I

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.090
may even make a video explaining how to do
it.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.690
But until that video or my next video, I�ll
see you later.
