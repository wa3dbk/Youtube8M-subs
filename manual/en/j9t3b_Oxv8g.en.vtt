00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.490
Magic Mobility is proud to present its Frontier
V6 Mid-Wheel drive and V4 Rear-Wheel drive.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.190
We’ve listened to our customers, with packages
built to impress, offering three spoke alloy

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.060
wheels, stronger than ever heavy duty motors,
and a choice of upgradable features.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.249
Magic Mobility wheelchairs deliver a smooth
ride on the city streets, or off-road.

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:30.570
It’s all possible in a Magic!

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.620
The Frontier V6 range comes in five sizes
allowing you access to smaller indoor spaces

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.780
and the rugged outdoors.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.500
The All-Terrain option provides hours of hard-core
offroading, whether it be your back yard or

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.780
beyond.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.699
This package will impress those who prefer
the track to the tarmac!

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.680
For those who want to go on long outdoor adventures
and maintain a good indoor look, the Frontier

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.019
Hybrid is a natural choice.

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.500
But if you can’t choose, don’t worry,
the Hybrid and All-Terrain options are easily

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.270
interchangeable with a simple wheel change.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.760
You can always have a set of All-Terrain knobby
wheels for the days you want to go off-road.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.820
Smaller than ever before, Magic Mobility’s
Frontier V6 Compact range.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.000
The Compact 73 is ideal for those who want
to cover some distance and get around smaller

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.030
indoor spaces.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.520
With large size batteries that ensure a maximum
range, a turning circle of under 1m and great

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.180
suspension, you get the best of both worlds.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.930
The Compact 40 is another fabulous indoor/outdoor
option, small but perfectly formed, cleverly

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.670
using smaller castors to reduce the size of
the chair, the Compact 40 can hold its own

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.360
on the street but moves well in tight spaces,
making it the ultimate choice for predominantly

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.759
indoor uses.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.739
The Super Compact is the baby of the family,
but by no means an infant!

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.680
Coming in at less than 900mm in length, this
is our smallest base.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.569
With a narrow rear castor position, this choice
is particularly suited for indoor use and

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.650
is fantastic for children.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.700
The Frontier V6 family has the potential to
grow with you and your needs.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:40.659
With minimal cost and changeover of only a
few parts.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:47.349
The Frontier V4 is a dedicated Rear-Wheel
drive package inspired by the Frontier V6.

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.659
The V4 has a small footprint and gives you
an awesome ride like no other!

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.890
With All-Terrain tyres and the edginess of
the Rear-Wheel drive, the Off-Road V4 has

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.840
changed the face of the market with superior
stability, smooth suspension and unbeatable

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.840
climbing ability!

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.510
If you love Rear-Wheel drives but don’t
need All-Terrain capabilities, you can choose

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.159
smaller tyres for those days in the city and
at home.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.239
Magic Mobility wheelchairs are individually
made in Australia, and we pride ourselves

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.220
in being able to give you choice of colour,
size, weight and seating in our renowned range

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.950
of indoor and outdoor options.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.080
At Magic Mobility we’ve made it our number
one priority to offer size and weight ranges

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.060
that guarantee the best package to suit your
lifestyle and environment.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:47.269
We know choice and flexibility are important.

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.489
Thank you for taking the time to see our wheelchairs
in action.

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:58.949
