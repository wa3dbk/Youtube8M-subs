00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.580
Hi. I'm Tres Tew. I'm an instructor at Yeshua's
Ryu Martial Arts and on behalf of Expert Village,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.490
I'm going to be talking to you a little bit
about open hand combat. Now we are going to

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.309
talk about utilizing kicks and knees. Again,
range from kick to knee varies, so keep that

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.070
in mind. First, we've got the typical front
kick (you can leave that down). What you are

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.839
doing, you're pushing back with the heel of
your foot and you are pushing back. This is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.589
to create distance. Most of your kicks are
to create distance. If you can notice, punching

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:38.010
range and then kicking range are considerably
different. So, we've got several kicks. We've

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.660
got the front kick, which pushes out. We've
got the roundhouse kick to the legs. We've

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.230
got the roundhouse kick to the head. We've
also got side kicks to the knee. You can stomp

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.430
the knee. Side kicks to the midsection, face,
anything you want to do is there. Also, I

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.980
don't recommend this, but if you are able
to set it up, it's a very powerful kick. It's

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.740
called the spin kick. You just jump up and
bring it right across the face. It's kind

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.049
of a whip kick. You are smashing it out there
and pulling it back, so it is catching across

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.409
the face. Also, we have knees. You're probably
not going to be able to do many of these unless

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.259
you do flying knees from a pretty good range.
With a flying knee, you are just jumping into

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.620
it and pushing all the way through. Now, most
knees are going to be for in the clinch, right

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.090
here. What I'm doing, I'm taking and pulling
down on his weight right here and just bringing

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.509
my knee right up into it (either into the
head or into the body-whichever one I want).

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:49.649
I can do that with both knees. So, we've got
flying knees from a distance. Clinch knees

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.179
are also good for hammering the insides and
outsides of the legs and the sides of heads.

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:02.670
Whatever you want to do with kicks and knees,
it's there. Just remember, kicking range and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.689
knee range is a little bit different.
