00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.610
Now we are going to take a look at the upper
menu bar.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.309
It contains the camera settings.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:18.860
Here you are going to find everything you
should know from your own camera.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.410
First of all you can set the crop-factor of
your camera.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.079
The crop factor depends on the camera model
with which you work.

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:32.550
In case you don't know the crop-factor of
your camera, you can find it in the camera-manual

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.800
or you can search the web.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:45.570
The crop-factor for beginner DSLRs is 1.5
and 1.6.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.130
Now you can change the format with which you
want to shoot.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.489
Most common is an aspect ratio of 3:2 but
it depends on what kind of results you want

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.750
to achieve with your picture.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.010
You can always change your aspect ratio at
any time.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.970
If you click the next drop down menu all the
lens options appear.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.429
You can choose either which focal length you
want or whether you want a zoom or a prime-lens

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:20.109
If you choose a zoom-lens, you can use the
preview-window on the right side of the software

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:21.969
to select your framing.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:27.929
For that the slider on the right gives you
the ability to zooms in and out.

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.869
In general: Every adjustment you make on your
camera affects the image in the preview.

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.990
This happens of course in realtime.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.259
If you want to see the preview window bigger,
you can use the Switch-Button to exchange

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.850
the two windows.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.659
In here we have the shutter speed which doesn't
affect your image because the flash duration

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.069
are much faster then you shutter speed.

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:59.369
If you want more information, you can read
more about it in our FAQ-section.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.159
The next step is setting the ISO and the aperture.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.619
For studio photography a low ISO is normally
recommended.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.770
But as always, just try out and be creative.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.099
The last symbol of the camera-settings is
the Target Lock

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:21.290
Thanks to it, the camera is always looked
on the focused object when you move it around.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.569
Especially if you try out different perspectives
the target lock comes very handy.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.010
Right besides the Target Lock is the shutter
releases.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.180
The first Button takes a picture and renders
it at the same time.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.290
Depending on your quality settings, it is
possible, that this process might need some

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.290
time.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.849
As a result, we created a second shutter release.

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:53.629
It creates snapshots, which won't be rendered
immediately by set.a.light 3D

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:59.459
Now you're able to work without interruption
and take as much pictures as you want.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.799
All your pictures are stored down here in
the timeline

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.829
If you have taken all your shots, from every
angle you want, you can render all images

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.080
with one click on "Render all snapshots".

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.350
While the software gets to work you can take
your time for a fresh cup of coffee.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:25.489
The length of the rendering depends on a few
factors like: How many images will be rendered,

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.930
What are the qualitysettings and of course
How powerful is your graphic card.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.230
To secure your shots you have to safe the
project first.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.650
Go to the upper menu bar and under the file
butten you will find safe project.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.519
It generates a folder on your harddrive which
contains all pictures of your shooting.

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.980
Our file format is ".set."

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.709
As a comparison: .set is like .doc at the
end of every word-document.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.400
The .set file contains everything from shooting
to timeline.
