&gt;&gt; MR.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.440
WILLIAM BRADFORD:
It is not the one-hundred-year-old bricks

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.690
that define or distinguish our school.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.980
It is not the mascot or the school colors.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.369
It is not our ACT scores or our national rank.

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:19.070
It is, like a great book, the internal composition
of ideas, values, and voices

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:29.090
that collectively amount to a cohesive narrative
of progress, creativity, and difference.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.540

&gt;&gt; JULIAN WRIGHT: Within the walls of duPont

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.140
Manual, I’ve learned to live for a greater
purpose than myself.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.890
Within these walls, I’ve learned that what
I write isn’t nearly as important as why

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.199
I write – and the words that I say, and
the stories that I can tell, can do a small

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.149
part in bridging the gap between the way the
world is and the way the world ought to be.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.270
Of course, I’ve learned the ups and downs
of quadratics and the infinite details of

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.010
world history, but above all else, I’m learning
how to be a human being.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.310
And that’s all that matters.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.570

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.830

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.250
&gt;&gt; ELLIE MARSH: The diversity of thought
and breadth of talent is what makes Manual

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.740
so special to me.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.200
In one class, I may sit next to a kid who
is a National Science Fair champion; in another,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.200
I might sit next to a girl who’ll be attending
Juilliard for dance next year.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.860
And in another class, I might sit next to
a soon-to-be-Division-I linebacker.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.810
We are kids who strive for academic excellence
but have a strong appreciation for other aspects

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.810
of life.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.730
When you see National Merit Finalists painted
up in red and white at football games, you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.200
know you’re at a special place.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.830
The environment here at Manual is unparalleled,
and I wish every kid in America could have

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.170
the high school experience that Manual has
given me.

&gt;&gt; MR.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.180
TIM HOLMAN: duPont Manual is the arts.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.720
It’s science, it’s drama, it’s communication.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.729
It's a diverse collection of dedicated students
and teachers who are all working toward a

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.480
common goal: excellence.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.970
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL PERRY: As class president, and
more importantly, as a student of duPont Manual,

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.590
I would like to invite you, Mr. President,
to come and deliver our 2012 commencement

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.590
address.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.592
Thank you.
