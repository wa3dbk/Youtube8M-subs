What's up, you're watching Man Vs. Pin

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.580
This week, the most requested pin of ALL time

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.200
Suggested by a ton of you throughout the weeks, Tara, Phoebe, MurphysMadness, Lollipoper42, 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.440
I gotcha

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.540
The 'Ole, "Transfer a Photo to a block of wood"

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.660
Now, I was steering clear of this pin because a lot of other people have done it before

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.560
and have been successful at it, so no point of me having to do it. It looked like a bunch of BS,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.600
That's for sure. Now I haven't had a win in a while, so I was like, "Alright, I'll do this one, get my numbers

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.920
back on track. Pin-O-Meter, give me something good

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.740
I can roll with that.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.580
First up, I got my photo. I had a really bad bath salts problem a while back

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.600
this picture..reminds me of those times.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.100
It's and 8X10, so I got myself a block of wood the same size

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.020
Then I picked up this Matte gel and a couple brushes.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.280
First step is to apply the Matte gel to the surface of the wood. A nice, thick, even coat

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.920
I then placed the photo faced down on top of the wood, and then with a.."Library" card, I'll smooth out

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.360
any bubbles or uneven surfaces

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.480
Then I just let it sit overnight

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.920
As a backup, I got myself another even older photo. This one is really special because our 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.940
family camel, Felix, is in this one.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.420
I applied this to another piece of wood and let that dry overnight as well

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.120
The next day I took out a little water and a clean sponge and applied a pretty good amount of water

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.040
to the back of the bath salts photo.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.760
I let it soak in for a bit, then attempted to rub the back of the photo off, like I was told

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.520
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.220
Unfortunately, it wasn't that easy. I was up against my first obstacle. It sounded like plastic when I rubbed it

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.260
So..That's not any good. However, with my Exacto blade I was able to just remove this first sheet

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.940
of what seemed to be like, like a plastic-y paper material, over the back of the photo

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.100
Whatever the case, underneath it was the paper I was looking for, so I just applied more water 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.440
and began to carefully rub off the back of the photo. And rubbed I did.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.060
For...what seemed to be a pretty ridiculous amount of time. And it kinda started to suck, honestly

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.220
because nothing was happening. And then I came across another layer of paper I had to remove

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.960
And back to rubbing. Just rubbing it out. After I gave myself an early case of arthritis, I finally

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.680
reached another plastic surface. What kind of fresh HELL is this?

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:37.700
Another..coat of plastic. That I've now got to peel off, only to reveal a film layer, that is clearly

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.620
the real back of the photo. Which I can't rub off. Now they didn't say what kind of photo I was supposed to use 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.500
in this pin, so now, I'm kinda pissed. If that picture of Felix doesn't come out I am gonna freak the *BLEEP* out

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.780
I took that one out, I applied some water to the back and slowly began rubbing off the paper.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.700
This time it was actually a lot easier than the last photo, and within a couple minutes, I slowly

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.460
started seeing the photo reveal itself. Now you've gotta be super careful not to rub the photo off

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.960
Like I do in 3...2..awesome.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:22.400
You're doing it too fast, SLOW DOWN. Alright, this is turning out more and more like *BLEEP* every second

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.520
I mean, once you remove the back paper, and then rub off as much as you can, the image still isn't that clear

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.160
I mean you can barely make it out. I mean I can kinda see the camel there but..not..really

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.280
I mean seriously, now what? This looks..ridiculous. *BLEEP* It. The next step was to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.020
add Mod Podge to it to seal it up, boom. *BLEEP* you Wood Photo Transfer pin, that just ruined two

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.220
awesome, irreplaceable photos. *BLEEP*

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.300
