00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.280
&gt;&gt; JON: Can you do a Rico impression?

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.710
&gt;&gt; BIN: (Garbles)

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.289
&gt;&gt; JON: Hi everyone, it’s Jon!

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:07.809
&gt;&gt; BIN: And Bin!

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:10.070
&gt;&gt; JON: Cute and cuddly, Bin.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:19.130
&gt;&gt; BIN: (Laughs) We were able to all four
of the Penguins of Madagascar POP Movie Funko

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.130
penguins!

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.370
&gt;&gt; JON: We have always loved the penguins
from the Madagascar movie.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.310
But one of our favorite things to watch with
Teagan is the Nickelodeon Penguins of Madagascar

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.310
show.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.310
It is kind of old now.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.649
But it is streaming on Amazon.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.539
And there’s like a million episodes and
it is very, very funny.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:37.590
Then they came out with the movie.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.590
&gt;&gt; BIN: Yeah!

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.980
&gt;&gt; JON: So we have plenty of penguins around
our house.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.239
We found Rico, Skipper and Kowalski at Hot
Topic.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.149
For some reason at the different Hot Topics
we go to, those are the only three they have.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.609
&gt;&gt; BIN: But we could never find a Private.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.679
&gt;&gt; JON: We finally found Private at…

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.050
&gt;&gt; BIN: Barnes and Noble.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.399
&gt;&gt; JON: And they didn’t have anyone else
but Private.

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.500
It was so weird.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.120
&gt;&gt; BIN: We are very excited.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.409
There is also Short Fuse available.

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.970
&gt;&gt; JON: But we have never actually seen Short
Fuse anywhere.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.970
So if you have seen Short Fuse in stores.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.460
Is he like an exclusive some place?

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.060
It is hard to keep track of the release of
POP Funkos.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.220
&gt;&gt; BIN: Yeah , it is.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.980
&gt;&gt; JON: Let’s open these up!

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.210
As you can see, our Skipper box - this was
the only Skipper at Hot Topic – it looks

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.270
like there was some glue or tape on the box.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.640
Or maybe when they sliced the box open?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.100
Because that is kind of cut.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.640
But it doesn’t matter because we are going
to take them out of the package.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.790
Because the Penguins.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.390
You can’t contain them in their boxes.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.180
They would find a way out.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.180
&gt;&gt; BIN: Yes!

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.530
&gt;&gt; JON: Well, we have got to start with the
leader of the gang.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.860
&gt;&gt; BIN: Leader of the pack!

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.890
Skipper with his Cheezy Dibbles.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.140
&gt;&gt; JON: The Penguins’ favorite snack, of
course.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.340
&gt;&gt; BIN: So cool.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.800
I love that he is holding those.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.950
&gt;&gt; JON: Who are you going to open up next?

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.960
&gt;&gt; BIN: I am going to open up Rico.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.560
I love Rico.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.360
And here is Rico.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.610
And he is holding three sticks of dynamite.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.480
&gt;&gt; JON: That he probably just puked up.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.820
And that is not an error.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.820
That is intentional.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.920
With that little chip is how Rico’s beak
really looks.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.159
&gt;&gt; BIN: Yeah, so that is awesome that they
put that little detail on there.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.519
&gt;&gt; JON: Can you do a Rico impression?

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:15.629
&gt;&gt; BIN: (Garbles)

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:16.629
Kowalski!

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:17.629
Options!

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.810
&gt;&gt; JON: Next up, the brains of the operation.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.140
Well, not so much in the movie.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.549
I thought he was a little slow in the movie.

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:32.499
&gt;&gt; BIN: Yeah, they didn’t have him be so
Donatello-ish in the movie as they do in the

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:33.499
show.

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:36.470
&gt;&gt; JON: And he is holding a clipboard, or
a notebook I guess.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.739
And a little pencil.

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.029
And he has a determined look on his face.

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.069
&gt;&gt; BIN: We will open up Private next.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.720
There is little Private.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.190
He doesn’t have anything special.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.950
Aw, his little beak is chipped.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.659
Normal Private pose.

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.739
&gt;&gt; JON: Waving or saluting, I guess.

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.389
So fun that we found Private to complete our
set!

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:03.510
&gt;&gt; BIN: I know!

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.629
That is awesome!

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:05.729
So glad that we have all four now!

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.220
&gt;&gt; JON: We will definitely have to keep our
eye open for Short Fuse.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.930
But, you know, he is not as essential to the
set.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.549
You can’t really break up these four.

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:13.549
&gt;&gt; BIN: Right.

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:14.549
Right.

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.860
Well, I mean you could technically have gone
with these three… oh, I don’t want to

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.860
ruin the movie.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.969
So I am going to keep my mouth shut.

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.980
Yeah, we will keep an eye open for Short Fuse
but really we wanted these four because we

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.980
love the TV show

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.289
… that is not on anymore.

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:31.830
&gt;&gt; JON: You will have to let us know which
one of these penguins was your favorite.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.599
I think my favorite was Skipper.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.390
&gt;&gt; BIN: My… goodness…

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.180
I don’t know.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.629
I really like the notebook and the pencil
that Kowalski is holding.

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:47.709
So, I think I am going to go with Skipper
too.

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:48.709
Sorry, Rico.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.819
Though I love the fact that he has the stick
of dynamite.

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.779
&gt;&gt; JON: And if you guys liked our Penguins

&gt;&gt; JON: And Twitter.

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.359
We’ll see you next time, everybody!

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:05.359
&gt;&gt; BIN: Bye!

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.459
&gt;&gt; JON: Can we do the thing where they slide
across on their tummies?
