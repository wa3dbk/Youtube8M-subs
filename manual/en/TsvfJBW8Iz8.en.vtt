00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.470
You may have been in a situation like this
one that we ran into the other day when we

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.390
were out shooting and saw a gorgeous open
vista, but found that the lens that we had

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.119
with us was just not wide enough to capture
the entire thing in one shot.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.510
The next time that happens to you, try making
multiple overlapping shots of a scene and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.370
then use Elements' Photomerge technology to
stitch those shots together for you, as I'll

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.370
show you in this movie.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.280
I'm going to close this finished panorama
and I'm going to show you how I made it, starting

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.950
in Expert edit by going up to the Enhance
menu and down to Photomerge and over to Photomerge

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.560
Panorama.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.590
Here in the Photomerge window, I'll go to
the Source Files area and I'll browse for

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.399
the files that I want to use in the panorama.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.440
When I find them I'll select them all.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.700
Now before I open these into the panorama
workspace I want to tell you a little bit

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.710
about how we shot these photos for the panorama.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.150
We set the focus and the exposure settings
on the camera to manual so they wouldn't change

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.380
automatically across photos.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.170
We didn't happen to have a tripod with us,
so we shot handheld, which is fine for panoramas,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.890
just trying to keep the camera as level as
possible.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.050
We made five overlapping shots, although the
number of shots you include is up to you.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.940
And we turned the camera slightly between
the photos, trying to overlap each shot by

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.270
around 25% to 30%.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.240
We used landmarks that we saw through the
Viewfinder to estimate the overlap.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.060
So that's how we got the photos.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.350
Now with the photos selected, I'm going to
click OK, and that lists those photos here

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.710
in the Photomerge window.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.710
Next, I'll go over to the Layout area to choose
a layout method, which is the way that Elements

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.050
will position and in some cases transform
the images so they fit together.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.459
Now sometimes the default auto layout will
give you an acceptable result, but when you've

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:05.800
got a really wide scene with an horizon or
another element that you want to keep straight,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.140
Auto doesn't always give you the best result.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.780
In that case I like to start by trying Cylindrical.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.920
So I'll select that, and if I don't like the
result I get I'll undo and come back and start

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.610
again, experimenting with some of these other
layout choices, like Auto.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.720
Down at the bottom of this window I'll make
sure that Blend Images Together is checked,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.700
to try to get a seamless blend at the edges
where the photos meet.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.340
If we'd used a very wide-angle lens to capture
these photos, I'd also want to check vignette

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.530
removal and geometric distortion correction,
to try to avoid the vignetting and distortion

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.510
problems you sometimes get with a wide-angle
lens, but these photos weren't shot with a

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.370
very wide-angle lens so it's not necessary
to check those boxes.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.060
And now I'll click OK.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.520
In just a few seconds Elements will create
an initial panorama and it will ask if I want

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.370
to automatically fill in the edges of the
panorama.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.990
What it's referring to are these areas where
you see a gray and white checkerboard, indicating

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.800
transparent pixels at the edges of the initial
panorama.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.950
These transparent pixels are a result of Elements
trying to align the individual images, and

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.820
that left these gaps around the edges of the
panorama.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.540
I'll usually go ahead and click Yes here to
see if I like the result.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.069
If I don't, I'll undo, and instead of trying
to fill in these edges I'll crop them away,

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.280
and I'll show you that option in a moment
too.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.180
But let's see if Elements can fill in the
edges for us in this image.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.240
It did a pretty good job across most of the
image, I do see some stray pixels up here

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.650
that don't look right and some of the bottom
as well, as well as at the top of the tree

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.710
over here.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.240
Now I could take the time to get the Clone
Stamp Tool and try to retouch these areas

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.540
with pixels from neighboring areas, so that's
one option.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.069
Another option is to crop away the pixels
that I don't like, or even to back up to before

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.350
Elements tried to fill in these gaps and do
some cropping at that point.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.180
So I'm going to do that so you can just see
what it looks like.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.670
I'll press Ctrl+Z, that's Command+Z on the
Mac, a few times, to backup just before this

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.040
Undo Stamp Visible step.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.230
These are the steps that Elements took when
it filled in those transparent pixels for

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.230
me.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.390
And this time I'll go down and get the Crop
Tool and I'll move into the image and I'll

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.049
click and drag out a crop boundary.

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.829
The crop boundary will try to snap to the
invisible grid behind this image.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.340
So I'm going to have to sacrifice not only
the transparent pixels, but a bit of the image

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.949
as well, in order to get those cropped boundaries
inside of the image area and not include any

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:40.720
of the transparent pixels at the top and bottom
and at the left and right edges.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.889
When I've set the crop boundary, I'll click
the green checkmark to commit the crop, and

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.690
there is my resulting panorama.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.540
At this point all that's left to do is just
save the image.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.060
Now this is a very big file, so keep in mind
that if you're looking at this image at a

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.500
100%, it would be quite big, and it will make
a really impressive print to frame and put

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.639
on the wall.

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.400
Letting Elements stitch multiple photos into
a panorama like this is a great way to get

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.540
an impressive photo of a wide vista, but don't
forget that you can also use the Photomerge

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.850
Panorama feature in Elements to piece together
a tall scene or even multiple scans of a photo

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.760
that was too big for your scanner bed.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:32.570
So have fun experimenting with Elements Photomerge
Panorama feature in all these situations.
