Hello! My name is Dustin, and I am going to
talk about the traditional jazz guitar, often

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.500
referred to as the jazz box, the jazz arch
top or hollow body guitar. The traditional

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.039
jazz guitar comes in one or two styles: the
wide body or the hollow body jazz arch top

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:39.960
and the thinner semi-hollow or 335 style jazz
arch top. The wide body or the hollow body

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.750
guitar uses the same principles as your standard
acoustic guitar, where you have a broad, somewhat

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.920
thin top with a sound hole of some kind; and
in jazz guitars you usually see this F hole

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.149
style sound hole; you will also see those
types of sound holes in violins and upright

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:03.239
basses. These sound holes help to project
the sound of the string vibrations that resonates

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.140
through the body of the guitar. In your standard
acoustic guitar, the sound holes often are

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.920
larger and more predominant, because natural
resonants is often the only way to sound to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.400
the string vibration gets from here to the
ears. In jazz guitars you will also see usually

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.750
one or two pickups, these pickups actually
help to pick up the vibration of the strings

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.750
and transfer it out, your output to an amplifier.
Now youâ€™re probably wondering why have a

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.030
resonating top and projecting sound holes
when the vibration of the string is going

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.640
out your pickup here out to an amplifier.
Well, the resonating body of these guitars

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.910
actually helps to give the way the string
vibrates a subtle character or tone. So this

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:58.720
tone is actually captured by the pickup and
sent out to the amplifier. One important thing

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.860
to note about the wide body jazz guitar is
that, with such broad resonating surfaces

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.190
in such a thick pocket of air inside of it,
it often falls prey to the feedback problems,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.560
so you usually see these guitars used in small
combo settings or solo jazz guitar settings,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.500
where competing with other members of the
band for volume is not as much of an issue.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:32.800
Now the thinner 335 style semi-hollow, arch
top uses the same resonating principles as

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:41.180
the wide body hollow body, except it usually
has a thick solid piece of wood running down

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.890
the middle of the guitar between front and
back resonating surfaces. This along with

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.800
a smaller pocket of air inside the guitar
makes it less susceptible to feedback problems

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.740
and a better choice for louder jazz performances
like big band, fusion, or bop.
