HI, I’m Carolyn Scott-Hamilton, also known
as The Healthy Voyager! I’ll be sharing

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.139
with you my favorite healthy travel tips because
no matter what type of diet you follow, we

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.619
should all have the opportunity to see the
world and be healthy at the same time. Twelve

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.279
years ago I switched to a vegan, plant-based
diet for its health benefits. I mastered in

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.100
holistic nutrition and went to culinary school
so that I could live my life to its healthiest,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.790
and also help others do so as well. I love
to travel, and I quickly learned that it was

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.149
not so simple to both travel, and easily find
healthy food options. So I decided to make

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.489
it my mission to figure out how to see the
world and eat healthfully so that I can share

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.140
my knowledge with others, like you. Here are
a few of my favorite tips that can help anyone

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.070
stay healthy while away from home! No matter
where you may be, it is important that you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.899
ask the right questions in order to get what
you need. Restaurants are more then happy

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.530
to accommodate you because they want you to
come back and dine with them again, and because

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.340
they rely on good word of mouth advertising,
especially in our social media driven society.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.900
Be sure to let your server know what foods
to leave off of your dish, and also tell your

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.080
server what foods to add to your dish. For
example, I always look over the entire menu

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.890
to see what I like and then I find a way to
make it vegan. Let’s say my only choice

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.460
is a salad, but it has eggs, cheese and croutons
that I don’t want. I’ll ask the server

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.119
to remove those items but then I’ll also
ask my server to add in some other foods,

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.290
like cucumbers, avocado and tortilla chips!
Adding in vegetables, rice or even beans is

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.810
easy to do and will make the meal more delicious
and nutritious. One of my favorite items to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.570
take with me when I travel are my Select Wisely
cards. When I can’t speak the language,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.420
these cards not only tell the server what
I can and cannot eat, but they also have photos

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.600
so that there is no confusion. These cards
are available in a wide variety of international

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.280
languages as well as a number of special diets
and are super handy because they fit right

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.720
in your wallet! When traveling, staying hydrated
is key. Flying can dehydrate you and the time

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.920
changes can throw you off of your normal eating
or drinking routine. More often than not,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.420
you’ll find yourself only drinking water
when you’re dying of thirst. Make sure that

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.550
you always pack your own water bottle and
keep it full and with you at all times. I

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.190
recommend a large glass bottle, like this
one by Life factory, as it’s the healthiest

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.050
receptacle for any liquid. If you can’t
find a good glass bottle, opt for stainless

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.629
steel or a bpa free plastic bottle to keep
chemicals from leaching into your beverage.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.940
But no matter what, have a bottle handy because
it will save you money, keep unnecessary waste

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.690
out of the landfills, and keep you hydrated
throughout the day. When you’re traveling,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.460
you’re on the go. And when you’re on the
go, there’s not much time for a nice, healthy

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.860
sit down meal. And depending upon where you
may be in the world, healthy meals can be

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.330
few and far between. But that’s no excuse
to forget your six servings of fruit and veggies!

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.629
Each morning before I leave my hotel, I have
a packet of Go Greens by To Go Brands. This

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.849
packet, when mixed with 8 ounces of water,
gives me my 6 servings of veggies so that

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.959
I don’t have to worry about getting enough
nutrition for the day. Of course, nothing

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.600
beats fresh, whole foods, but when you’re
camping, hiking or jet setting, drinking your

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.270
greens is the next best thing. Most hotels
come with a coffee machine. For me, it’s

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.090
my best friend while on the road. Not because
it makes coffee but because it doubles as

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:45.270
a stove! You can heat up canned or powdered
soups like miso, beans, chili, or even left

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.400
overs in the pot so that you are sure to eat
good food before or after a long travel day.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.190
Cooking in your hotel room is a fabulous way
to save time and money while also making sure

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.760
that you are well fed throughout your trip.
Whipping up snacks in the morning and bringing

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.400
them with you while sightseeing is much more
convenient and much healthier than clamoring

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.659
for the closest gift shop for a bag of chips
when you suddenly realize you’re starving.

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.379
From hotel hummus to 5-star salsa, you’d
be surprised what you can cook up! I hope

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.060
that you have found my tips helpful and that
you even get to implement some of them on

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.970
your next excursion! For more tips like these,
