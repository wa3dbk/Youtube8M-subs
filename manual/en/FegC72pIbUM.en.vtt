Hi, welcome!
This is Nico from Floorplanner

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.769
and here’s Part 1 of Floorplanner’s tutorial
for advanced users.

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:12.980
You have probably seen my basic video series.
In the advanced series we’ll cover some

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.940
more sophisticated drawing features
and I’ll teach you some special drawing

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.720
skills.
In Part 1 I’ll show how to set up a project

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.369
using a background image
to draw floor plans quick and accurate.

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.100
Let’s have a look at the floorplan which
we draw in this video.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:39.480
It’s not a very easy plan.
It has a curved wall and it has some funny

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.789
corners
and a lot of rooms and different wall thicknesses

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.809
but I’ll show how you can do this more quickly
and more easily using a background image.

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.249
We’ll do it step by step.
Let’s first go to the Dashboard.

00:00:55.249 --> 00:01:02.249
From your Dashboard you can create a new project.
Click on the green Plus icon

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:09.999
and here you can give your floor plan a name.
Let’s call it Apartment

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.970
and here you can also choose the amount of
floors that your property has.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.930
Our property just has 1 floor and for each
floor you can upload a separate drawing.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.930
This drawing has to be a JPEG or PNG format.
You might have a PDF format, but then you’ll

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.280
have to convert it first to an image.
I’m navigating towards my Desktop

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.060
where I have my floor plan sketch
this one

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.750
and I’m opening it
and if I press Create Project

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.750
it will open the floor plan editor
and you see that the drawing is uploaded.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.440
First we’ll have to scale this image.
Click the last construction icon

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.750
to show the drawing properties.
Over here you find the set scale option

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.340
let’s press it
and you get a little video showing what to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.170
do.
The method is: you draw a line

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.170
of which you know the distance.
We’ll take this line here,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.620
which is 6 meters
and the enter the value in the pop-up menu

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.230
and press OK
And then you see that the drawing will change

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.590
scale.
Now it’s time to consider the orientation

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.239
of our floor plan.
You must look a bit ahead now

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.810
because it’s easier to draw rooms with horizontal
or vertical walls.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.129
You should take a rotation where your amount
of walls on an angle

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.079
like these
is minimized.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.499
But if we look closely to this plan then you
see that

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:57.709
most of the walls are actually horizontal
and vertical,

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.639
so that’s good.
Another thing to consider is that your plan

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:06.639
usually looks bigger and better on a screen
in a horizontal orientation. So

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:13.639
let’s rotate this plan 90 degrees counterclockwise.
So I’m typing -90

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.810
and this is what I want.
In this menu, you can also change the transparency

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:29.769
but I like it on 50.
You can show or hide the drawing

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.409
Position it at the bottom or on top of your
drawing

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.669
and if you want to get rid of it you can delete
it here.

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:42.709
But we’re done, and I’m pressing “Save”
And remember that you can always find this

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.849
menu back
with the last construction icon.

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.169
Okay, we’re done here.
We’ve set up a project for a floor plan,

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.389
uploaded a drawing
and scaled it and rotated it.

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.809
And now we’re ready to start tracing the
walls.

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:00.549
In the next part we’ll tackle some advanced
wall drawing skills.

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.120
Thanks for watching,
Bye!.
