Hey what's up, it's DJ BBQ

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.049
in my backyard and today I'm going to be cooking up for you

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.179
one of my favourite munchie foods. 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.590
Chilli cheese dogs

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.080
Come here, check these things out. I've got three beautiful beef dogs and three

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.220
pork dogs, the barbecues rocking a good
medium

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.220
hot heat and I've got some chilli that I've made

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.289
a couple days ago. This is a chilli con carnage and if you want to know how to make this stuff

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.400
all you gotta do is "Die Mortal" sorry it's a bit evil.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.590
because there's lots of chillies in there. Click on that pot 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.469
of chilli

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.660
Calm down bro, time to get dogs on

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.700
Let's get these on a nice hot direct heat

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.410
Beef dogs on

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.160
and then they're good friend the pork
dog

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.480
Why am i talking in a slight red neck accent?

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.109
that's a good question well walking over
to this side of Lake

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.719
Atlantic, I'd say hey how ya'll doing? 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.390
My mumma would say you feeling punk boy?

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.990
And punk meant are you feeling ill?

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.280
You want a jar over your head? it's a real big hodgepodge. My grandma would say

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.860
Christan you're my favourite grandson. I'd say I'm your only grandson. She said that don't matter, you still be my favourite

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.130
Thanks grandma! Her name was Della but my grandpa called her Fannie,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.490
Fannie was her nickname. In America fannie means this part, not the other side. 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.369
Look at these!

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.409
The dogs should take between

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.049
8 and 12 minutes depending on how hot
your coals

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.189
This is what you wanna see come hear man, look at this

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.191
It's when that skin start to crack

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.610
and that beautiful pork inside, that awesomeness starts to come through,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.270
Look at that! it's cracking right in front of us! It's like armageddon

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.389
it's like would like part of the earth splitting away

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.130
and you want to jump on the other side but all the hot chicks are on this side

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.869
but the guy you don't like is on that side of the hot dog

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.219
Alright so

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.560
Grab a clean pair of tongs, and a bowl.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.670
Let's get the beef dogs in there. Boom!

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.390
Whoops! Sorry ddue, sorry bro there's a prok dogs, ohh look at that! So good

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.050
Alright, let's get the bread and the Chilli and bring them altogether

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.040
to have a party. Boom.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.269
I want to burn the chill through. This thing's

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.870
super duperly triplely hot man. It's like an inferno of

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.150
tasty goodness, yeah! Ready?

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.530
Die mortals! Grrrr. Eat your camera, 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.970
eats Paul cameraman and then spits him out and then goes

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.110
to the pub for a beer. Now what should we go with first

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.340
the pork or beef? I say beef. 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.860
I'm in a beef kind of mood right now. So let's throw that guy in there

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.820
Oh yeah

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.290
You're just too big of a dog aren't ya? 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.500
Beautiful beef dog

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.810
now we're going to add some lovely lovely chili

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.769
onto said dog

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.549
Yeah!

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.920
Look at that

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.640
now we're not done yet I know she looks
tasty but we're gonna add

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.190
this bad boy, Red Devil. It's Red
Leicester

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.410
cheese with chilli, so we're going to peel off

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.290
the wax and then

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.360
we're gonna

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.740
grate it on there

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.790
Oh! Look at that!

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.750
Grate it by hand, it's going to be so spicy1 Mwahaha.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.950
Sour cream on top

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.520
Yeah, should we go with Wrath or should we go with

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.550
Psycho juice? I'm going to go with wrath, the kind of nag in there.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.770
the a bit of lime so it's a bit of sweet

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.680
Oh no you're gonna kill me. Look at that!

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.210
Huh.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:22.330
Does that just say Munchie food? Does that just say awesomeness

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.759
It should be on one of those, you know like cars when they spin them around?

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.330
Drive that straight into your mouth right? What's the best thing

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.039
for like chillies and having too much heat on your tongue in your mouth what is it is it

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.550
is it milk? I've heard yoghurt, I've heard beer, 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.970
some will say just go with water. I've
heard so many different things in

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.310
None of them work, what is the answer? Tell me below.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.280
