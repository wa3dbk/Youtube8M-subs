Mango sorbet

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.840
Today I'm making a perfect mango sorbet,
that's delicious, refreshing and very healthy.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.740
Let's cook?

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.840
You need one ingredient: mango!

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.840
- Wonderful, right?
- Wonderful!

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.880
It's like a frozen banana recipe.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.160
After chopping and peeling the
bananas, you freeze and blend them.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.380
It turns into an ice cream. Mangos are
sweet, so they're nice for that too.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.280
My tip is to use a mango that's
not too fibrous.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.220
Then it turns into a smoother ice cream. 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.220
Any juicy fruit is good for this, then?

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.860
Yes, it's good if they're juicy and sweet,
so you don't need to sweeten it.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.160
For instance, strawberries would
be nice, but they're too acid.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.800
This is a Tommy mango, but it could be
any one that's not too fibrous.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.540
Such as?

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.040
A good tip for when Paulo asks for an
example is: go to the market or fair

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.900
and ask for a mango that's ripe
and not fibrous!

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.480
When you have your mangos, peel
3 of them and chop them in cubes.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.240
Freeze them for 5 hours inside
a tupperware.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.240
I do this with bananas sometimes.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.140
Paulo does this a lot for
breakfast, that's right.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.240
If you want, use the old trick
I taught here already.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.840
First cut it into cubes.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.940
Then scrub it in a cup,
to peel it more easily.

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:57.138
Freeze for 5 hours

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.940
When it's frozen, just blend it.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.980
Blend until it becomes a cream.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.700
You can use a regular blender
and not a processor, but be careful

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.740
and remember to knead the mango a 
little, so it blends entirely.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.940
To finish, pour it in a pan.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.120
I added some drops of 
blackcurrant juice on top too.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.680
You can buy it ready or you can
use a concentrate, but then use less.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.480
Because it's much stronger.
It's just for a little extra flavour and colour.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.740
Then you can eat it as soon as
it's ready, and it will be softer

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.160
or leave it in the freezer again
for another 2 hours

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.620
and then it's really like ice cream,
you can shape the balls.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.480

 farofa to pour on top of the sorbet.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.500
This a practical and refreshing recipe
for the summer, I'm sure everyone will love it.
