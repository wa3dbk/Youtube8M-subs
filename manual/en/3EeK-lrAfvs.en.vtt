00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.809
One of the smoothest riding sedans on the
market gets a makeover this year.

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:19.000
With a modernized appearance, improved handling
and a new technology-fueled cabin, the 2014

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.490
Buick LaCrosse is a car that pleases the driver
and passengers alike.While the days of big

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.900
'ol Buick cars appear to be on hold until
the brand gets an honest-to-goodness large

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.820
flagship, the LaCrosse is doing its best to
play the part.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.309
It's a midsize with very generous rear seat
proportions and an average-sized trunk.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.390
But its hallmark trait has been and continues
to be its super soft ride.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.370
It seems as though car makers believe everyone
wants a European-tuned suspension so it's

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.320
a relief to see Buick building the LaCrosse,
first and foremost, with an unapologetically

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.710
American ride.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.550
And don't misconstrue that as sloppy, because
it's not.2014 Buick LaCrosse 1SL AWDBuick's

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.780
real-time damping front struts and Quiet Tuning
efforts keep the LaCrosse as one of, if not

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.330
the best riding, quietest cars on the market.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.170
And taking advantage of the high performance
all season rubber, engineers have tweaked

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.700
the suspension to further improve handling
while keeping that pillow of air ride quality.Last

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.640
time around I tested the LaCrosse eAssist
or mild hybrid, if you will, a car that lives

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.860
on for 2014.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.240
But here I've got the LaCrosse in the high-end,
Premium 1 Group trim with standard front-wheel

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.420
drive, GM's sweet 3.6-liter V6 and a 6-speed
automatic.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.670
This mill works beautifully wherever it's
used with smooth and linear power delivery

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.860
of its energetic 304 horses.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.860
It's also E85 capable, but running on 87 octane
you'll get around 21mpg combined.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.680
Sport Mode Selectivity raises the car's handling
thresholds and keeps the transmission holding

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.680
gears.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.629
To get this specific chassis, consisting of
continuously variable real time damping, HiPer

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:27.190
Strut front suspension, an H-arm rear suspension
and Sport mode requires a front-drive V6 model

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.270
with wheels at least 19" large.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:37.280
A new 20" wheel is standard in the Premium
II Group.Changes for 2014 include a refreshed

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.010
exterior design with the new familial wing-shaped
LED lighting, a more prominent black chrome

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.360
waterfall grille hiding active shutters for
improved efficiency, and a new rear fascia

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.660
with wraparound LED taillamps that has me
seeing Mercedes S-Class.Equipped with both

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.489
of the optional Driver Confidence Packages
and the latest generation of Buick's IntelliLink

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.491
system, the person in this seat has all of
the tools needed to feel confident and in

00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:15.849
control but when you're coming and going,
the curved dash often makes an unwelcomed

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.170
meeting with your knee and that goes for the
passenger's side as well.It feels a little

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.879
short and narrow in the front, but these new
seats improve comfort and the vast array of

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.909
GM's electronic expertise are on display.

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:37.290
All of the radar and camera based safety features
are here including Side Blind Zone Alert with

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.049
a new twist which detects fast moving vehicles
coming up alongside the car.

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.310
Warnings for all threats are felt by your
rear end as The Safety Seat vibrates on the

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.830
side of danger.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.049
A head up display is a fantastic safety measure
and the IntelliLink system has been updated

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:01.430
to include all of today's access to info in
a smartphone-like layout.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.129
But the best improvement comes in voice command
recognition which allows for natural language

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:18.620
to communicate your desires.The 
rear seats give 2 to 3 more copious amounts

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:26.020
of leg and head room, thorax airbags, pop
out headrests, an oversized sunroof and power

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:33.690
sunshade while trunk space can be expanded
by folding the 60/40 spilt fold seat.This

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.300
higher end model starts life just shy of $40,000
while mine, with all of the aforementioned

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.820
goodies and the extra charge Midnight Amethyst
paint -- a box I'd most certainly leave unchecked

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:55.250
-- finishes up at $46,090.
