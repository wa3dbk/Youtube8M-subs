Is often
In fact I come back in the game

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.760
What Long Serve
It is pretty scary

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.039

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.760
And I would like to teach to everyone
And this is just the this time

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.969
In this one receive skills
One of the receive skills

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.609
Just remember
Knuckle Long Saab and

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.149
Horizontal Long Serve
Speed ​​Long Serve

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.399
Above rotation Long Saab, etc.
Against various Long Serve

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.959
With its receive only one
And that all can accommodate

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:10.959
Wonderful receive technique is
I have a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.490
For any long Serve
Only one of the steps it

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.149
To Henkyu over the forward rotation
And I'm already such this only

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.030
And early in knuckle system
Also come long Saab

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.939
I bet the forward rotation
Even trees Long Saab above rotation

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.030
I bet the forward rotation
Long Saab coming bent sideways

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.270
even come early to the
I bet the forward rotation

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.069
I come to the other back
With respect to long Serve

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.009
For fast speed Serve
Just all put forward rotation

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.490
Another Long Serve
And I can return all

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.759
Especially the rotation of the other party
It is that it is good to me without looking

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.909
Well everyone
Against Long Serve

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.250
Players were combined in angle is often
Come fast Long Saab

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.450
When I took the upper rotation
I cover the surface

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.590
When the knuckle system of trees
I'll open the little face

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.580
When you come back with bent
The face of the racket

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.590
By little made the angle
So as not to Kurawa the lateral rotation

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.849
The Fu Tteyuu return
While using a nerve

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.620
While watching the one ball one ball rotation
I think that it had been combined in angle

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.890
But Actually
Against Long Serve

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.819
And of that match in the angle
It is difficult to have been very dangerous

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.010
And make the angle
Also by the other party

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.010
The quality of Long Serve
The different because at all

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.390
And fine-tune the racket every time
While the angle to fine-tune

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.560
I will return in a flat
Quite I am not stable

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.659
I Long Serve this person corresponding
In If you think also the next game

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.500
Also different people were
When Long Saab has come

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.470
Out the angle of the earlier of people
Maybe you ended up over mistakes

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.799
Net misses
Become a Fu Tteyuu

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.079
Even after forever after all
It is not possible to correspond Long Serve

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.239
Can not be processed
What something Na not good

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.890
We can think
What Long Serve this time

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.439
Knuckle Long on Long
Fast Long bend Long

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.720
Even issued Toka
Doing all this

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.470
In a little back
A small back drive

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.079
It is felt me ​​to
A little forward rotation

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.879
Please try over Innovation choli
Really only a little

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.930
Wrist only
Using the wrist only

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.180
Wrist only in the pit
Tteyuu Chobidora

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.890
I is feeling do Choritto
Please try over drive

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.280
Really great take-back
Dawn Toka

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.719
I am no longer need this
For fast Long Serve

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.060
Doing this in the receive
Room is not that you are waving

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.650
When you do not think to Tossa
that the long Saab comes

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.640
Since it is often so and Chori~tsu
It does not reduce the racket in Dainoshita

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.549
Just wrist on the table
Simply return the wrist

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.010
I bet the back drive
I such this only

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.000
To all of Long Serve this
Please try doing for

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.370
Then Is this
I return Nikake their rotation

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.049
It is Tteyuu
Because you can back drive

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.870
Even knuckle
Entering over the drive

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.310
Even above rotation
It on the rotation

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.959
To enter it because return on rotation
Even long of lateral rotation trees

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.180
Since fix it on rotation
Enter firmly

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.060
The drive of the arc
Because it is easy to draw firm

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.430
Also stabilized receive orbit
In short I bet this Chori~tsu

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.050
Only striking method of applying a forward rotation
If you learn firmly

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.340
Any long Serve
Remain the same angle

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:30.340
I will return without a nerve

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.780
Also come any long Saab
It is not too thought deeply

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.920
Is that
You think we did not want to think of anything

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.020
Chori~tsu and Once you fast to come
Since little even good

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.730
Please take a forward rotation
This is also a table software

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.710
It is everyone together in the back soft
Since little even good

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.850
to be able to apply
Opponent of the Long Serve

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.500
In all rotation on his
Since it can be overridden

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.660
And not affected by results in rotation
You will be Tteyuu

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.070
This Long Saab
I'm not afraid

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.010
Knuckle Long and
Bend of Long Serve

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.230
Distinguish Toka is difficult
Such consciousness I have still

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.040
That is why the just this time
Is we did not want to know

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.340
Come if come Long Serve
I do not know

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.730
But because little even good
Just wrist forward rotation

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.270
I bet Kyu
Is longer than the back this way

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.580
For Long Serve
Any long Serve

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.720
I will no longer afraid
Hitting point as much as possible

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.890
Early is where
Dropping and Long Serve

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.660
Since it has changed elongation or
As much as possible the hitting point

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.740
Immediately or can be bound
It is much vertices bounce

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.810
Attract the
It is better this time you do without

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.510
It is easy to Henkyu in reverse
By utilizing the momentum of long Saab

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.210
Papan and vigorously
Easy returns

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.450
So hitting point also aware expedited
Please try it

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.280
Since winning mon This you know
Another fast fast

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.300
From a little even good
The forward rotation and Chong

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.820
I bet in the wrist
It only everyone

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.480
Please try it
And pan in flat

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.250
I fit at an angle
Other it is a difficult era

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.790
If multiplied all and Chori~tsu
Because that would contain

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.039
Please try it
THANK YOU
