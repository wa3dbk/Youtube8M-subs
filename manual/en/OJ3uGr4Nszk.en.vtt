Hi, I'm Bobby crispy

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.439
this guitar lesson is about new speed picking method that I've come up with I

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.329
actually stumbled upon it a few weeks ago when I was visiting my friends down to San Diego I

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.999
want to play as not sure Katara, but I didn't have a pick on me, so I used a quarter instead I

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.908
Noticed have a quarter with its round edge moved over the strings smoothly and quickly

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.249
So what I got home I tried using the top quarter of a standard pick, and I got the same effect

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.820
So I'll demonstrate playing a few notes a few riffs

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.330
This is how it got my speed picking in my guitar solo video earth light

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.180
so what you're doing is using the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.360
top right corner of the pic you

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.800
can see it there and

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.429
Hold the pic so that the pointy end is

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
facing 11 o'clock

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.119
When you look down and try a few notes

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.180
But I feel a little awkward at first

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.979
Because they have to pick down a bit further what happened you have to go a little bit deeper

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.730
Prepared to holding a pick the regular way cuz you have the pointy end I would have to pick so hard so far down

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.119
But it works great when you're alternating between two strings like

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.050
Yeah works great like that for that and you can use it for rocket r2c

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.460
As well as skills

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.200
A little more a little bit more space to discuss, so it's not that major skill was born now. You'll be playing it for hours

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.910
Okay, that's a lesson. I hope it's been helpful and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.420
Thanks for watching
