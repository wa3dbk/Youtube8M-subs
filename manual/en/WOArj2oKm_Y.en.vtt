00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.540
Holley model 4165 and 4175

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.440
carburetors are considered universal
q jet

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.260
replacement carburetors and are easily
identified by these features

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.980
single inlet side hung float bowls

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.880
a primary metering block no secondary
metering block

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.260
and no accelerator pump on the rear bowl
4165 models

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.150
are mechanical secondary carburetors 4175
models

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.910
are vacuum secondary carburetors and
will have a vacuum secondary unit

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.910
connected to the secondary throttle
shaft on the passenger side of the carburetor

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.750
4165 and 4175 models are designed to
fit to it spread bore intake bolt pattern

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.180
but can also use an adapter to bolt to
square bore intakes

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.239
there's a lot more to the 4165 and
4175 model carburetors

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.899
let's take a closer look starting with
the throttle body

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.629
which is also referred to as the base
plate you will find two large vacuum

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:57.449
ports

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.530
the one at the rear is for a power brake
booster

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.030
and the one on the front is meant for
PCV any small ports on the base plate

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.400
will supply full manifold vacuum signal
for items such as

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.610
a purge canister EGR or an air cleaner

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.689
keep any of these unused ports plugged
up with a cap

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.070
on the base plate of the 4165 and the
4175 model

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.590
you'll notice an arm that will operate
the accelerator pump of the front

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.020
fuel bowl model 4175 vacuum secondary
carburetors

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.260
only have one accelerator pump located
on the front fuel bowl

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.170
a model 4165 will have an accelerator
pump located on the rear bowl as well

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.300
the throttle plate assembly also has a
curb idle adjuster screw on the driver

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.790
side

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.540
which sets the idle speed of the engine
by opening and closing the primary

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.600
throttle plates allowing more air to
enter the engine

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.030
on the passenger side you find the fast
idle adjustment screw

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.570
like every Holley carburetor the 4165

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.410
and 4175 have a primary metering block with
two primary Jets

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.100
idle mixture is set by adjusting the
idle mixture screws

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.380
located on each side of the metering
block engine idle speed is set with the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.500
curb idle screw

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.240
found on the base plate 4165 and 4175
models come with single inlet

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.730
side hung float bowls these bowls have a
single inlet located on the front

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.810
the primary ball on the bottom exterior

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.540
of all primary fuel bowls is an accelerator pump the accelerator pump arm

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.750
is affixed to the base plate and presses
against the diaphragm

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.010
inside the accelerator pump housing the
secondary system on the 4165 and 4175

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.820
carburetors

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.750
have one major distinguishing factor
that separates it from 4150 models

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.640
there's no secondary metering block if
we were to remove the rear fuel bowl

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.340
we would find a secondary metering
plate instead fitted directly to the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.140
main body

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.590
since there's only one inlet for fuel in
the primary bowl in this style of carb

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.650
there's a fuel transfer tube that will
bring fuel from the primary inlet

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.330
to the secondary fuel bowl now over to
the passenger side of the carburetor

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.550
a model 4175 controls the opening and
closing above the secondary throttle

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.080
plates with the vacuum unit on the
passenger side the carburetor

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.670
as the engine runs and the venturi air
velocity increases the vacuum signal

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.780
the vacuum secondary assembly will
automatically open when needed to supply

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.230
the proper amount of fuel

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.640
Holley has accessory kits available that
contain different springs with various

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.280
tensions

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.480
they can be used to tune the system to
your engines exact requirements

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.650
one more component to review is the
choke assembly

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.409
4175 carburetors come equipped with an
electric choke

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.970
the position at the choke plate is
controlled automatically when the engine

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.640
is started

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.239
and returns by itself to its closed
position when the engine is off

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.239
that will cover most of the details for
the 4165 and 4175 model

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.790
Holley carburetors let's see what's next
