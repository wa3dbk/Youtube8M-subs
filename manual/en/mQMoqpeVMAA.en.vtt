00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:08.950
The original CSI was on for maybe one season,
possibly two and then there was an explosion

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:16.000
of Law and Order that involved forensic science,
CSI, CSI: Miami, New York

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.490
You know, I once saw a cartoon, CSI:Tulsa.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.120
Quite often we have to spend some time with
those folks during the application process,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.800
try and give them as close a dose of reality
as we could.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.100
For me, personally, forensic science gave
me the ability to apply my knowledge and wares

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.820
in a way that gave me instant gratification.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.920
I think that that sentiment is probably fairly
universal among forensic scientists.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.469
It's sexy now because it's on TV, and there
is a lot of high-tech gadgetry that-that kind

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.250
of makes it fun, and the things that I do
in the forensic DNA laboratory, or that a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.540
forensic chemist does in the chemistry laboratory
is science in exactly the same way as a Harvard

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.510
research group studying the human genome or
the Nobel laureate trying to create the next

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.110
material, space age material.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.649
The efforts are just directed in a different
way.

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.979
Our program is, I think really unique, nationally
and perhaps internationally.

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:32.109
In terms of its scope, and how we'll tailor
to the extent possible, what you want to do.

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.650
I always recommend to a student that if you
can do it, come to campus right off the bat.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:45.530
There's a camaraderie and a piece of your
maturing that just naturally occurs professionally

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.369
if you have other peers around you, other
students.

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.030
And our students are active in outreach programs
in the community, bringing high school students

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.329
in, or college students, to sort of show them
some of the cool stuff in forensic sciences.

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:05.170
As of my last investigation we were one of
two schools nationally to have a practicing

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.679
crime laboratory and a forensic science teaching
program under the same roof.

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.830
The Tulsa Police laboratory used to be in
the Civic Center.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.680
Pretty cramped quarters.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.830
So they were in the market for some space.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.690
The Forensic Science program on this campus
was also kind of shoehorned in to some remodeled

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.690
space.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.440
So the crime lab director and I have a lunch,
we both need space.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.989
Three years later, we've got 125,000 square
feet of space that houses both the forensic

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.150
laboratory for the police department as well
as our graduate program in forensic sciences.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.080
A rather unique way they benefit us, obviously
student internships come to mind, and we've

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.599
had some students go down there, but more
importantly they're a progressive crime laboratory,

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.909
and they're always evaluating new technologies
for the practice of their science.

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:05.360
Sometimes questions from a crime lab guy becomes
a project for one of our students.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.620
As a forensic scientist, to be part of the
implementation of this new high-tech stuff

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:21.540
in your back yard is every bit as exciting
as any scientific discovery ever reported.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.950
My faculty is quite progressive thinking,
just one quick example, the medical examiner's

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:37.150
office is here on campus, and the medical
examiner is charged with explaining and investigating

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.980
any unexplained death.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.569
That creates a need in my mind.

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.780
So we've teamed with the M.E.'s office to
create a curriculum and a track in our graduate

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.510
program that's called "Death Scene Investigator."

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.260
This is a master's degree person who's going
to come out better prepared to problem-solve

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.310
and analyze evidence they encounter at the
scene of a death.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.700
Our students by no means are condemned to
a life in a forensic laboratory.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.690
We try and teach a skill set that, although
tailored for forensic science, could be applicable

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.861
in an environmental testing laboratory that's
looking at pesticides on farmland, U.S. Department

00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:28.580
of Agriculture laboratory that's testing meat
samples for e.coli--

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.420
I mean the skills that they learn here can
be applied in areas outside the forensic discipline.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.720
Robert W. Allen, I am Professor of Forensic
Science and the head of the School of Forensic

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.030
Sciences here at Oklahoma State University
Center for Health Sciences in Tulsa.

of Oklahoma's boldest cities.
