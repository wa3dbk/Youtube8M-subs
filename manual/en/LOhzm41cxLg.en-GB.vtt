00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.500
These are quick tips for the SOCRETHAR encounter
in Hellfire Citadel.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.830
The video is split into the 3 raid roles:
healers, tanks and dps.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.060
The entire raid should avoid green fire and
runes on the ground. Any player affected by

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.330
GIFT OF THE MAN'ARI should move away from
others. If targetted by GHASTLY FIXATION,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.599
kite the ghosts over the fire patches to slow
them.

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.790
HEALERS have 2 main abilities to watch for:
The first is OVERWHELMING POWER, which requires

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.970
single target healing.
The second is SHADOW WORD: AGONY, which should

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.339
be dispelled.
When required, use external CDs on tanks taking

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.760
REVERBERATING BLOW beyond 2 stacks.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.159
TANKS have 3 main abilities to watch for:
The first is SHATTERED DEFENSES, which must

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.479
be shared with dps, but not both tanks.
Taunt swap at 3 stacks.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:03.409
The second ability is REVERBERATING BLOW,
which will require a strong CD at 3 stacks.

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.939
The third is EXERT DOMINANCE, which should
be interrupted.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.409
In phase 2, one tank will be required to use
the SOULBOUND CONSTRUCT.

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.439
Use FELBLAZE CHARGE to create lines of fire
from the raid to the blue portal.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.740
Place a FEL PRISON just in front of the blue
portal.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.840
The blue and purple portals will swap occassionally,
so you'll need to maintain the fire.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.009
Use VOLATILE FEL ORB on the SARGEREI DOMINATOR
and blue portal adds.

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.829
Use REVERBERATING BLOW on the DOMINATOR and
boss.

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.689
DPS should be assigned to 3 pairs for sharing
the SHATTERED DEFENSES stacks. Each pair should

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.450
stand in front of, and closest to, the boss
until the debuff is applied. Rotate the pairs

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.789
so no dps takes more than 1 stack.
DPS priority is SARGEREI DOMINATOR then SHADOWCALLERS

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.990
then HAUNTING SOULS that are close to the
raid, and finally the boss.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.359
DPS have 2 main abilities to watch for:
The first is EXERT DOMINANCE, which must be

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.399
interrupted.
The second is FELBLAZE CHARGE, which requires

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.940
you to move in such a way that the incoming
fire does not impede raid movement.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.920
The third is VOLATILE FEL ORB, which can be
intercepted by walking towards it after having

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.940
moved away from other players.
