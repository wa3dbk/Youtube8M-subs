00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.620
It's very exciting to be part of the new Wiggle
Honda women's cycling team I'm really looking

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.880
forward to it it's you know a brand new team
and I think it's going to be really exciting

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.130
because we've got a lot of young girls and
a lot of people coming from different areas

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.560
and I think Rochelle's put together a really
good group of girls so the feeling we already

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.079
have is exciting.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.850
I have my ideas and would like to sit down
with the team and talk about which races I'd

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.350
like to try and win in 2013.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.760
I'm new to the road, I did it, I've done it
for 2 years but only for like small teams

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.039
and like club teams so it's just great that
I'm actually in a professional team so yer

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.949
I'm really excited.

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.679
Wiggle Honda's a great team you know we've
only got together today for the first time

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.570
but already I can see how professional it
is and I can't wait to get racing with the

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.460
girls.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.680
Of course with Wiggle Honda we already have
a step in the right direction, we have a team

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.720
in the UK now which is exciting for women's
cycling so hopefully we'll see it develop

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.510
more over the coming years.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.370
Rochelle set out a very professional team,
you know explored every avenue for equipment

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.720
and clothing sponsors so it's all, it's coming
together pretty well.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:38.710
We're targeting the flatter races the sprint
finishes, small groups for this year and I

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.583
think there's a lot of racing like that especially
early season and we've got a couple of the

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:47.750
best sprinters in the world so it should be
good.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.810
I'm really pleased with the launch actually
so really good turnout from all the media

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.980
and you know we had all of the, effectively
everyone we invited turned up plus some extras

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.310
spread of word of mouth and so on everyones
obviously really interested in learning more

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.710
about this new team and women's cycling trying
to really up the game in women's cycling and

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.780
bring it to the next level of professionalism.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.299
There's a lot of enthusiasm they seem to be
very engaged, there's a considerable amount

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:23.280
of confidence, I think that each of the athletes
are looking at you know the achievements of

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.230
some of their peers and thinking hello we
are part of something really special, and

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.260
so from our point of view to be able to be
part of that is fantastic.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.599
Yer it would be nice for the team to be considered
one of the top teams in the world for sure

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:48.510
and I think that right now we definitely have
the potential to be there.
