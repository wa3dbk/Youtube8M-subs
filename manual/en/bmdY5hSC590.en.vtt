00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.224
Did you know that your computer, TV and 
peripherals use power even when they’re turned off?

00:00:05.224 --> 00:00:10.426
Well they do and during this episode of Around 
The House we’ll show how the CCI - Woods Smart Strip®

00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:15.256
from Menards can cut energy losses and 
save you money on your energy bills.

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:25.751
[Music]

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:29.605
We all have a vested interest in 
reducing our carbon footprint…

00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:35.410
our homes contribute far more to global warming 
than our cars. So it’s important to start there.

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:40.890
A recent study done by the California energy 
commission estimates that 15 percent

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.671
of all household power used is consumed by appliances 
and electronic devices in stand-by or sleep mode.

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:54.195
Let’s do some quick math. If your electricity bill 
averages 100 dollars a month times 12 months,

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:57.864
that’s 12 hundred dollars 
per year in electricity costs. 

00:00:57.864 --> 00:01:02.973
15 percent of that 12 hundred dollars 
equals 180 dollars per year that is

00:01:02.973 --> 00:01:07.756
consumed by your appliances and 
electronic devices while in stand by mode.

00:01:08.406 --> 00:01:13.514
The Smart Strip® from CCI - Woods cuts power 
to unused electronic devices saving you money

00:01:13.514 --> 00:01:17.973
by combining the best in surge protection 
with automatic power control. 

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:24.103
The Smart Strip® works by cutting power to your electronic 
peripherals when it detects a drop in energy used 

00:01:24.103 --> 00:01:29.536
by your computer or TV when they are 
either turned off or go into standby mode. 

00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:32.787
Let’s take a close look at a Smart Strip®.

00:01:32.787 --> 00:01:36.316
There are three different kinds of 
outlets on the Smart Strip®…

00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:43.560
a master outlet, that’s where you’ll plug in your computer, TV, 
or any device you choose to control the energy-saving outlets.

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:48.390
The non-controlled outlets, these are for any 
device that should always remain “on,” 

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:52.480
such as a fax machine, cable-box, or satellite receiver. 

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:58.140
And the energy-saving controlled outlets; these are 
where you will plug in peripherals such as your printer, 

00:01:58.143 --> 00:02:02.040
scanner, DVD player, and home theatre components.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:07.660
The Smart Strip® is very easy to install. Simply 
plug it into an outlet and then plug a control device 

00:02:07.663 --> 00:02:15.460
such as a computer or TV into the master outlet. 
Next, plug peripherals that you want to be switched on and off 

00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:19.210
with the control device into the energy-saving controlled outlets.

00:02:19.208 --> 00:02:26.240
Some electronics that should stay on like a cordless phone or 
satellite receiver are plugged into the non-controlled outlets. 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.630
Now turn the Smart Strip® power switch to the on position.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:36.270
Let’s make sure the system is ready to start saving energy. 
Put your computer into sleep mode or turn off your TV. 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.050
Everything plugged into the energy-saving 
controlled outlets should now be completely off. 

00:02:41.054 --> 00:02:47.790
If not, the sensitivity adjuster should be gradually turned 
until the energy-saving control outlets are off.

00:02:47.787 --> 00:02:53.640
When you move your computer’s mouse or turn your TV 
back on your peripherals will again have power.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:03:00.140
The Smart Strip® is great for computer systems, 
home entertainment systems, and the workshop.

00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:04.230
Here are some examples of how much 
you can save with the Smart Strip®.

00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:09.520
For a typical home computer system which includes a 
monitor, ink jet printer, and a scanner. 

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:13.420
The annual savings is 36 dollars and 23 cents.

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:19.090
For a typical home theatre system that includes a 
DVD player, audio receiver, subwoofer, and speakers

00:03:19.088 --> 00:03:23.500
the annual savings is 39 dollars and 64 cents.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.910
The examples we’ve highlighted include only 
the basics. Think about how many peripherals you

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.040
have in your home and it’s easy to see 
how the savings can really add up.

00:03:33.043 --> 00:03:39.310
The Smart Strip® from CCI - Woods allows you to enjoy all 
of the benefits of your electronics while you’re using them

00:03:39.312 --> 00:03:43.680
and then automatically shuts them off for 
you, saving you energy and money.

00:03:43.678 --> 00:03:47.760
Stop by your local Menards and pick up 
a Smart Strip® for your home.

00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:52.540
