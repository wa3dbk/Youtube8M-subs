00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:07.208
In high school I wanted
to play college football.

00:00:07.208 --> 00:00:10.000
I had a dream,
but the chance was slim.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.125
The deck was stacked
against any walk-on,

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:15.208
especially a skinny tight end.

00:00:15.208 --> 00:00:18.458
I’d have to lift like crazy
and get bigger.

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:21.358
Within six months,
I was given a scholarship.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.020
That changed the course
of my life in dramatic ways.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:29.912
I had dreams, fantasies
of playing in the NFL,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.620
but they were never tied to reality
because I was so skinny.

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:36.417
I didn’t look like
an NFL football player.

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:40.500
I didn’t play like one,
and it took a lot of work.

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:43.833
I was lucky to play in the NFL
for nine years.

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:46.667
When I was finished,
I was finished.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:51.208
When I walked off that field
for the last time, it was glorious.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.000
One of the things about
being a football player is that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.042
we all feel we need to give back.

00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:04.500
It’s cool to see how many
guys have charities.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.625
It’s something
most guys really love.

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:10.125
We’re in Africa, Mount Kilimanjaro.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.417
The NFL asked if I’d be willing to
hike Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:24.542
with Teddy Bruschi of the Patriots,
Jeff Fisher of the Titans,

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.583
and four wounded warriors
from our military.

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:31.250
Three just came back
from Iraq, one from Afghanistan.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.500
Day two in the books, baby.

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:37.208
They asked if we would hike
with them to the top,

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:40.583
19,341 feet of Mount Kilimanjaro.

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:44.500
It was an adventure, and
it was difficult hiking for them,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.042
especially the two
with titanium legs.

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:49.250
They were absolute warriors.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.042
Teddy, Jeff, and I wanted
to shine the spotlight on them,

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:55.583
to help them get to the top.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.570
At 13,000 feet, loving life.

00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:01.542
One reason we were there
with the wounded warriors

00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:04.622
was to help them talk
about their experiences

00:02:04.622 --> 00:02:08.202
in Afghanistan and Iraq
and open up and really heal.

00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:16.208
I came to appreciate and love those
guys, and I’m changed forever.

00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:20.542
Now I want to tell people
how great our military is.

00:02:20.542 --> 00:02:24.000
They need our encouragement,
support, love,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.417
and especially our thanks.

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:31.958
I believe one of the most
important things I can do

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.292
is surround myself
with greatness.

00:02:34.292 --> 00:02:38.542
I believe through great challenges,
great things can happen.

00:02:39.542 --> 00:02:41.000
Look how cool.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.708
I’m a husband and father.

00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:47.250
I’m an NFL football player.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.792
I believe in giving back.

00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:51.542
My name is Chad Lewis,

00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:53.833
and I’m a Mormon.
