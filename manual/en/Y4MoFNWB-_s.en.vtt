00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.060
One of the problems that's beset philosophers
and cognitive scientists for the last 30,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.079
40 years is how on earth the brain represents
information.

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:18.090
An eternally appealing idea is something like
a language of thought that there's brain writing

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.470
or mentalese and we write -- the brain writes
sentences in mentalese that store the beliefs

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.610
so that when you learn that giraffes are mammals,
there's someplace in your brain where the

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.800
word -- the mental word giraffe and the word
mammal are tied together with a "is a" or

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.800
something like that.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.430
So we have a big library of sentences.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.430
Those are our beliefs.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.620
We have a belief box with lots of beliefs.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.739
That's an attractive idea of nice -- it has
a certain simplicity that -- and we think

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.420
we understand how sentences work to store
information.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:03.079
Well now, if that were so, could a clever
enough neurosurgeon wire in a false belief

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.879
just out of the blue.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.920
So, let's imagine that our neurosurgeon decides
to wire into our brain the belief that you

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.740
have an older brother living in Cleveland.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.640
So he figures out how to write that in brainish
and does all the microsurgery and there it

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.280
is written in brainish in your brain.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.979
Okay, you wake up from the anesthetic and
so he says, "Yeah, do you have any siblings?"

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.440
Well, if he's done his work well I guess the
first thing you do is you say, "Yes, I have

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.869
an older brother living in Cleveland."

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.220
"Oh, what's his name?"

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.330
And now what?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.659
Ah, ah, ah -- one of several things has to
happen.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:55.630
Maybe you'll start confabulating and you'll
say, umm, his name is Alfonso, and, um um

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.810
he's a taxi driver, and he lives with his
wife and two kids in the suburbs.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.100
That's one possibility.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.960
In other words, you couldn't just wire in
one belief.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.090
You'd have to wire in something which generated
a whole slew of beliefs.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.540
Alternatively, maybe you would say, "Oh my
gosh.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.540
What did I just say?

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.540
I said I had an older brother.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.120
I don't have an older brother.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.580
I have a sister or I'm an only child.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.950
What made me say that?"

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.250
In that case, what we would see is that whatever
the surgeon did, it wasn't wiring in a belief

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.420
because as soon as you reflected on it, boom,
it just vanished, it disappeared.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.470
Well, if it's a belief then it's gotta be
secured to a lot of other beliefs.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.260
That's just in the nature of belief.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.230
You can't have an isolated belief like I have
an older brother living in Cleveland.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.900
If that state was one that you seem to be
in, we'd want to explore it to see what came

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.170
along with it.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.269
And either we would decide that you had some
weird sort of growth in your brain that made

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.210
you fixate on a sentence, sort of parrot like.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.629
And you'd say, "I'm an only child and I have
an older brother living in Cleveland."

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.230
Which, of course, would be contradicting yourself.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.209
What we wouldn't decide is that you believed
you had an older brother living in Cleveland.

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:28.220
What this little thought experiment shows
is that beliefs don't parcel themselves out

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.349
the way sentences do.

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.930
You could take any sentence on any topic and
write it on any medium you like and put it

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.849
in a drawer and there it would be.

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.460
Beliefs aren't like that.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.470
They come in systems.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.150
They cohere in large clumps.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.570
This is sometimes called holism and there's
still some theorists who think that holism

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.250
is a bad idea.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.850
I think it's got to be the case.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.409
Holism is a good idea.

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:01.330
That a particulate non-holistic theory of
believe is a non-starter.
