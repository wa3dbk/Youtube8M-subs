00:00:03.517 --> 00:00:06.517
Recorded on December 20, 2006.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:01:00.517
Workshop Montevideo, Uruguay 2006.

00:01:14.517 --> 00:01:17.017
My interest in painting was late

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.030
let's say in 2000.

00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:24.084
Although I have always been interested

00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:26.013
kind of searching

00:01:26.013 --> 00:01:28.513
I did not know if it was hobby

00:01:28.513 --> 00:01:30.513
or a true passion.

00:01:30.513 --> 00:01:33.027
I started studying graphic design

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.000
It was then when I met Alvaro Amengual

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.542
the professor that guided me
into the world of painting.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.580
Or at least I feel it that way

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
besides been a good friend.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.400
At that moment I discovered a world
or an interest about something

00:01:48.547 --> 00:01:50.663
that although I was previously attracted to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.197
I haven-t feel it that way

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.350
that it could be for me more than a hobby

00:01:56.562 --> 00:01:59.089
something that could be every day of my life.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I don-t know if it was consciously

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.000
but after a few years

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.700
I clearly see that there is a repetitive thematic

00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:24.471
in my interests:

00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:26.141
it is the human figure,

00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:29.631
specifically heads.

00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:34.000
It is an excuse it is kind of excuse

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:36.155
to approach certain visual formal problems.

00:02:36.617 --> 00:02:38.417
Like 'color' or 'structure' ...

00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:41.512
Beyond that,
there is that background

00:02:41.616 --> 00:02:45.602
that I don-t really know if
I could explain the reason why

00:02:46.164 --> 00:02:49.164
the passion of someone for something

00:02:49.737 --> 00:02:52.737
I don-t know if can be transmitted
through words or based.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.460
In what I am working lately

00:03:00.155 --> 00:03:03.100
is strongly linked to a panic that I have.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.370
Thing is,

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.685
I-ve never painted  over a white canvas

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:12.280
over a completely virgin support.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.807
Particularly now

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.300
I-m looking for advertising posters

00:03:16.411 --> 00:03:19.400
in the street always with faces

00:03:19.412 --> 00:03:21.912
and based on the existing faces

00:03:22.477 --> 00:03:24.477
I-m elaborating new faces

00:03:24.914 --> 00:03:26.414
that are peculiarly non linked
to the initial character.

00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:28.915
I worked with a reference photo
in which I am interested.

00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:30.916
I start to deform the initial face

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:32.950
trying to make it closer to the person I want.

00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:36.701
Once the piece is finished

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:41.686
there is no contact point with the poster

00:03:41.953 --> 00:03:44.953
which makes me think that its only a excuse

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.720
it is just the trigger we all have

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.220
that make us want to do something.

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:07.656
Sincerely, I don-t really have schedules

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.200
I just trying not to have a routine.

00:04:11.393 --> 00:04:14.393
I believe there are 
euphoric and inspiration moments

00:04:14.394 --> 00:04:17.394
or the way you want to describe them

00:04:17.516 --> 00:04:20.016
but for sure they happen 
when you are working.

00:04:20.491 --> 00:04:22.491
It just happened

00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:24.992
there was a moment when it started to absorb me

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.500
more and more and I decided
I would dedicate myself to painting

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:31.316
and here I am.
