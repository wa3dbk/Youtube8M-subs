00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.490
Steve Swenka is a 4th generation farmer.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.800
He works on a diversified farm with his father,
as well as his two sons.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.120
His farm, which was started by his great-grandfather,
just celebrated its 100th year.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.089
Farming is a tough job, but Steve loves what
he does.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:23.289
Farming is in the blood.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.019
It’s in the family history and it’s all
I know and all I’ve ever done.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.699
It’s not an easy job; it’s surely not
an 8 to 5 job.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.970
It’s more like a 7 days a week job, 16 hour
day job.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.770
Steve’s farm is a family operation.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.739
There are no additional employees.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.239
He works the farm with his sons, Jake – who
is 17, and 13 year old Will.

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.289
They have a variety of tasks; they do anything
from manual labor – they’re feeding cattle

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.920
with buckets of feed, they’re stacking hay
on hayracks, and they also have responsibilities

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.570
on the platform of a tractor.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.679
When I was little, I always wanted to get
up on the tractor, drive the bigger pieces

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:00.730
of equipment.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.260
I always wanted to have more responsibility
entrusted into me.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.140
One of their early jobs was to drive a tractor,
like many children growing up on a farm do.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.790
When I was a little kid, my first job was
to rake a field of hay, that was about when

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.790
I was 6 years old.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.310
It was an open tractor, no cab.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.630
They went around the field with me about 1
or 2 laps to make sure I knew what I was doing

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.990
and then I was off the leash.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.710
Steve is proud of his kids helping out on
the farm.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.120
He is sure to keep an eye on them to make
sure they’re safe and able to perform their

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.120
chores.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.810
They’re the 5th generation on this family
farm.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.270
When you see your child out working, not only
is it a relief because they’re providing

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.090
some labor and helping get the job done, but
you really feel proud.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:51.470
On the farm, what I do, I kind of drive a
lot of the tractors around and I help a lot

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.470
with the cattle.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.909
I just love to go out there and drive the
equipment around.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.430
I guess that’s my favorite part.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.420
Farmers often rely on their children to help
out.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.649
And while farm work can be a dangerous job,
Steve makes sure his children can handle the

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:06.649
responsibility.

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.120
We do take the proper care to make sure that
they’re qualified to operate a certain piece

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.120
of machinery.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.150
It starts off when they’re pretty young,
probably one of the first things they do on

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.450
a farm is mow the lawn.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.520
They learn how to use the basic controls,
the steering wheel, the clutch, the brakes.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.620
When we feel that they’re comfortable or
they’re doing a diligent, responsible job,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.620
we move them up.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.629
A farm can be a dangerous place to work.

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.590
It doesn’t have to be a dangerous place.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.960
It’s all about the steps you take to ensure
your safety and keeping an eye on things.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.800
Personally, I think it’s more dangerous
to get in a vehicle and drive 30 miles to

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.000
a job everyday.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.790
But injuries can happen on a farm.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.700
That’s why Steve and his boys volunteered
for the Tractor Simulator Research Project

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.780
at the University of Iowa.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.409
We need our kids to help, we want our kids
to help, but they’ve got to be safe and

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.360
you’ve got to feel comfortable giving them
the tasks assigned.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.480
The Tractor Simulator Project research is
being conducted at the National Advanced Driving

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.040
Simulator, which is one the only simulator
of its kind.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.890
The National Advanced Driving Simulator is
a world-renown facility.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.060
We’ve got simulators ranging from our full-motion
simulator to our smaller, portable simulators

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.870
that allow us to do research that can’t
be done anywhere else in the world.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.020
We, at the University of Iowa, are at the
forefront of traffic safety research, whether

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.640
it be on our nations highways or in the farm
field.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.650
Tim Brown is the University researcher gathering
data for the project, which is funded by a

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.290
grant from the National Institute of Occupational
Safety &amp; Health.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.019
His research is to test the cognitive abilities
of children operating a tractor on a farm.

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.659
There’s a lot of development that occurs
from 10 to 17 and we’re trying to look at

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.950
different tasks that kids preform while operating
a tractor and how those relate to their level

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:47.620
of cognitive development to figure out what
tasks are safe to do at different ages.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.349
We have a John Deere 7920 tractor cab… it’s
a very easy tractor cab to use, from a physical

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.180
standpoint, there’s not a lot of strength
required to operate that tractor.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.240
So it’s a perfect platform for looking at
purely the cognitive side of operating a tractor.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.159
Because we’re looking at such a wide age
range, from 10-17, we really want to understand

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.390
the different tasks they’re preforming.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.959
We start off with a mowing task in a farm
field, then we have the driver traverse through

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.160
a farm yard, and then from there, its basically
a road trip to get to another farm.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.110
There were 88 children and 10 adults that
participated in the study, and the initial

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.630
results are expected around the end of the
year.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.420
Steve, Jake, and Will were one of the first
families to participate.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.630
I would say the research being done here will
just help qualify and maybe make you feel

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.230
more comfortable about the tasks you’re
assigning to your youth.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.190
Steve and his boys were excited and willing
to help with the research.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.720
And they felt the tractor and simulator did
an excellent job of replicating an actual

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.730
farm environment.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.770
I was very impressed.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.050
It’s a very state-of-the-art facility.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.830
The cab is an actual cab off of a tractor,
so when you sit down in the cab, its very

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.830
real-world.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.380
All the controls are the same as many of our
tractors around here.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.180
It felt like I was moving, felt like I could
feel the bumps, but every time I would look

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.970
around, I’d realize I’m not moving.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.580
It just seems so real.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.780
It just seemed like it was real.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.040
Even if you looked out of the cab, it seemed
like you were moving.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.260
The data is intended to inform farmers and
their families, to make it safer for everyone.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.420
There’s a lot of farm families in Iowa and
around the country who have their kids working

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.420
on the farm.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.930
They want valuable information that allows
them to make good decisions about what tasks

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.820
their kids are able to safely do.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.590
Our goal here is to merely collect the data
that allows us to look at the cognitive development

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.230
over the age of 10-17 and how it relates to
safety on the farm, particularly when operating

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.230
a tractor.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.230
We don’t make regulations.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.340
We don’t make laws.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.980
Our goal is to mainly provide data and knowledge
that families can use on the farm.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.130
And Steve wants to do his part to keep his
kids, and all farmers’ kids, safe, so they

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.650
can all enjoy the life of a farmer.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.680
There’s a lot of rewards, you learn to appreciate
the little things: a new calf being born in

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.230
the springtime, a bountiful harvest.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.670
That’s what keeps you motivated, that’s
what keeps you wanting to go back.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.600
It’s in your blood, its all you know, its
what you enjoy doing.
