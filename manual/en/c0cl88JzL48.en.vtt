00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
hi everyone this is geramicc85

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.420
today i need to replace the headlight switch on my 96 dodge ram 1500

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.600
the other day i was driving at night and the headlight just shut off by itself

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.820
which i cant tolerate

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.660
and i found out that there is a common problem with the headlight switch of the 2nd gen dodge ram

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.540
so this is how the switch looks like and in order to turn on the headlights you have to pull it out twice

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.660
but the problem then in this case is

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.180
if i move this pigtail around like this

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.860
you can hear it shutting on and off

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.100
even tho i am not pushing it back in

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.420
and i found out that this is a common problem on these 2nd generation ram trucks

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.660
what happens is, over the time while you drive around

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.140
and as you switch between high and low beams

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.560
there is too much power going through this switch

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.720
it is built without a relay and thats why the power going through starts to melt it

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.460
its melting from the inside and you cant repair that

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.260
so i went online and ordered a new headlight switch

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.080
this is how the part looks like

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.400
it sits in there that way

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.540
now in order to get to the switch

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.180
i will have to take off the dash panel

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.880
and before i do that i move my steering wheel all the way down

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.940
thats the easiest way to get the black panel out

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.980
here i unlock the steering wheel and push it down as far as i can

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.160
now i move the gear switch all the way down

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.560
you can only do that with the key in the ignition

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.240
so i put it in and turn it a lil

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.700
and move it down

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.100
then turn it back off

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.180
i leave the keys in there for now

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.520
now i take a philips screw driver

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.580
and i will take out 4 screws

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.520
two of them are holding the cupholder on both sides

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.740
i am taking these out

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.660
remove the cupholder together with the second screw

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:29.340
slide out the ash tray and remove both screws on the sides

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.000
and take out the ashtray

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.980
now that you have moved down your steering wheel and removed all 4 screws

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:44.760
you can take off the dash panel by starting ont he right side

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.960
when it is lose you can disconnect the power outlet

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.520
and the cigar lighter

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.400
watch out there are two plastic clips that hold the lighter that can easily break off

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.820
now i move the dash panel out of your way

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.380
in this case there is still a LED connected thats why i just flip it over and leave it there for now

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:29.640
now the three philips screws that hold the headlight switch are free to access, so i take them out

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.820
now i am sliding out the switch

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.300
now i disconnect two plug connectors

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.660
the smaller one up here

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:48.920
i take off the big connector by holding up these plastic clips here

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.720
now if you take a look at this you can see that there is the indication of melted plastic up here

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.680
thats the problem i told you about before and thats why we need to replace it

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:17.280
now that i got the unit out i will take off the three metal screws from the back that are holding the plastic front

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.680
now i pull out the pigtail as far as it goes and slide the plastic top off too

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.360
you find this little metal part here and twist it around

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.520
that way the pigtail comes hoff

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.820
if you have loosened up this little screw here

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.780
after that you should be able to remove the pigtail from the housing

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.600
this can be a lil difficult

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.840
now i take the front plate that came off and put it on the new unit

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.800
i put this little notch here into the hole of the metal plate

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.100
now i take the pigtail with the screw and the plastic cap

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.420
and stick it through the hole with the metal plate on

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.160
now i tighten up the screw thats around the pigtail

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.560
i press the pigtail in very good so that it clicks into place

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.600
now i reconnect the metal plate to the plastic cap

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.620
now i try to work the pigtail as it should

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.680
its time to put it back in therefor i reconnect to plug connector to the new unit

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.700
dont forget the small one on the top

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:04.000
if the switch is all back together i slide it back in

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.340
i watch out that i dont squeeze any wires

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:18.340
i secure the new switch with the three phillips screws

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.440
its time for a test

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.640
i am putting the dash cover back on, therefor i flip it around

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:38.780
i slide it behind the steering wheel first and then reconnect the cigar lighter and the power outlet

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:47.320
i push it gently onto the dashboard so that it clips into position

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.840
i reinstall the ashtray

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.020
and secure it with the two screws

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:07.500
i am sliding the cupholder back in and secure it with the screws

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.420
put the steering wheel back up and thats it, im done repairing my headlight switch

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.820
