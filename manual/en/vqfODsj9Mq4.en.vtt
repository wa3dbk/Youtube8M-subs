00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.279
How to Deal with Cold Feet before Your Wedding.

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:09.660
You’re having serious second thoughts about
getting married.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.309
Should you try to warm up those cold feet—or
use them to run as fast as you can?

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.839
You will need Self-awareness Feedback A heart-to-heart
with your intended Therapy and counseling

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.609
and a prepare/enrich questionnaire.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.699
Step 1.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.060
Ask yourself why you’re getting nervous.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.940
Is it marriage in general you don’t feel
ready for—or a lifetime with your betrothed?

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.940
Step 2.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.010
If it’s marriage that worries you, make
a list of exactly what’s beginning to freak

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.210
you out.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.640
If you’re just a little bit nervous about
the idea of never having sex with anyone else

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.900
again, that’s normal.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.850
If you’re chafing at the mere thought of
having to keep someone in the loop about your

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.960
plans, that’s more serious.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.960
Step 3.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.050
If it’s the idea of life with your betrothed
that has you breaking into a cold sweat, write

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.030
down the person’s pros and cons.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.501
If the cons outweigh the pros—or if one
is on par with “heroin dependency” or

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:11.859
“chronic infidelity”—call it off.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:12.899
Step 4.

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.390
Ask loved ones if they think you’re making
a mistake.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.460
Pick people whose opinions you trust—and
who are capable of being brutally honest with

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.460
you.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.460
Step 5.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.549
Talk to your intended about your fears.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.429
How he or she reacts—by being understanding
and reassuring about your concerns, or bitchy

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.579
and sarcastic about your maturity level—will
tell you a lot.

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:34.750
Step 6.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.719
Consult a third party, like your priest, rabbi,
or spiritual counselor.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.149
Or seek out a disinterested professional,
like a marital therapist.

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.670
Who better to discern if you’re making a
mistake than someone who counsels screwed-up

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.450
couples every day?

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.450
Step 7.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.671
Ask your beloved if he or she would be willing
to get premarital counseling with you.

00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:56.829
Here again, the person’s level of cooperation
will provide valuable insight.

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.959
Take the Prepare/Enrich questionnaire with
your intended.

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:06.950
Four separate studies found that this survey
predicts with 80% to 85% accuracy which couples

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.709
will have good marriages and which will find
themselves in trouble.

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:13.900
Step 8.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.060
If after careful consideration you still don’t
know what to do, postpone the wedding until

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.280
you feel completely comfortable either rescheduling
it or calling it off.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.860
Did you know Engaged couples can now take
out wedding insurance against one of them

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.460
canceling due to cold feet.
