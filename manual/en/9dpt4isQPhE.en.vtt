(INSTRUCTOR)
Up, up! Up!

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.100
[fast piano music]

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.600
Up, up, and up! 
Down, up!

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.300
(CLARA) 
It was harder when I was younger and was first starting out here

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.000
and this is, you know...
its the best ballet school in America

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and it's kind of daunting
dancing with people

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.000
who become your friends.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.200
It's so supportive and
I feel more confident now

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.100
having grown closer with them
 and having people

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.500
who I respect with their dancing be saying,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.200
"Hey, listen yo,
 that was good."

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.000
[sound of pointe shoes and piano music]

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.900
One of the things
I love about the finale

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
is that I get to go offstage,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.000
and watch everyone
come together

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.200
before I join them,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.100
and the first time I saw it,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.000
I was literally
jumping up and down on the side

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.100
because it is so amazing.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.500
There's so many people 
doing the same thing all together.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.200
There is just such a 
huge sense of camaraderie.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.100
You can feel the energy.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:33.100
[cheery, classical music of 
Balanchine's Western Symphony]

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.000
(INSTRUCTOR)
Hey, you guys!

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.500
I thought that was really fabulous!

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.600
I really, I really did. 
I think it was great!

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.600
Wow!

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.000
Everybody go home.
