00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.640
OK.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.110
So I ended the last video,
the one on twin and adoption

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.800
studies, with some
pretty specific language.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.520
I said that through
those studies,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.220
psychologists could estimate
the extent to which variation

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.900
of traits, or attributes,
for any given population--

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.230
the extent to which
that variation can

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.680
be attributed to
differences in genes.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.220
And I used that language,
that specific language

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.590
because I was actually defining
the term "heritability."

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.940
So a textbook might define
the term heritability

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.240
as the proportion of
variation-- so a percentage,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.080
because a proportion is just a
percentage-- among individuals

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.450
that we can attribute to genes.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.320
So I'll write "due to genes."

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.360
And so I know that
even at this point,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.930
that definition is
probably not very clear.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.980
And we're going to spend the
entirety of this video just

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.020
trying to clarify this concept.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.420
And so assume that we're
talking about intelligence.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.550
And we say that heritability
of intelligence is 50%, so IQ.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.700
And we've said that the
heritability is 50%.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.680
And so what we're not saying
is that the intelligence

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.210
is 50% genetic.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.060
That's what we're not saying.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.830
Really, what we are saying
is that the difference

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.790
in intelligence can
be accounted for

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.730
or is 50% attributable to
the genetic differences.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.200
So we're talking about the
differences in these traits.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.400
Because really to ask how
much of our intelligence

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.760
is mandated by our
genome as opposed

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.420
to instilled in us
by our environment

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.850
is completely inappropriate.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.300
And that's what we learned in
that tea and hot water example.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.670
But what can be answered and
what those twin and adoption

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.480
studies started to show
us is the percentage

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.940
of the different, or
variance, right here

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.300
that's attributable to
the differences in genes.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.470
So I know I've said
that several times.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.780
And let me move to an example.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.630
One of my favorite
examples of heritability

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.230
actually comes from Mark Twain,
the famous author and comedian.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.100
And he said that suppose you
raised four boys in barrels

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.140
until they were 12 or so.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.140
So I've drawn some barrels here.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.190
And we've got four
boys inside of them.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.840
And we'll feed
them through a hole

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.470
so that they get the
same diet and such.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.640
And we'll remove all
of their waste products

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.870
on the same schedule.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.350
And their environments
will be 100% controlled,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.760
almost sadistically controlled,
but 100% controlled.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.030
By the age of 12, their IQs
would probably be pretty low

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.900
compared to the
population around them.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.910
But the kicker is
that they're probably

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.470
not all going to
be the same, right?

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.140
So the differences
in their intelligence

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.130
couldn't be attributed
at all to the environment

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.360
because we've absolutely
controlled their environment.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.990
And we would say that their IQ
differences were nearly 100%

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.080
heritable because their
environments were nearly 100%

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.870
the same.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.440
So h2 is just short
for heritability.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.590
And we give it a lower
case because we're

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.600
talking about one
specific trait,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.390
in this case intelligence
as opposed to many traits.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.400
But the heritability
would be close to 100%.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.340
And so that was Mark Twain's
example of heritability.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.010
But alternatively, you
could say that maybe you

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.400
have four identical quadruplets
with exactly the same genome.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.620
And you raise them in crazy,
different environments.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.050
And so maybe one is raised in
the rain forest as a tribesman.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.400
And then maybe one is raised
in the desert as a nomad.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.730
And then maybe one is raised
in a North American family

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.550
as maybe an industrial worker or
at least in an industrial kind

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.780
of blue-collar family.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.190
And then maybe one we'll just
say is raised in outer space.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.260
He's raised up
here near the Moon,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.700
maybe on the International
Space Station.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.410
But the heritability of the
intelligence of these four boys

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.220
would be quite a bit lower
because now their environments

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.230
are counting for a bigger
percentage of the differences

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.940
in their intelligence.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.360
And I've said here that the
heritability is actually

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.730
0% because we've
established that they're

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.130
identical quadruplets.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.720
So genetically they're the same.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.750
And their environments
are completely different.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.750
So we would say that
all of the differences

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.610
in their intelligence
must be attributed

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.540
to their environments.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.580
So maybe a nice, oversimplified
way to think about this idea

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.620
is that as the
environment becomes

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.530
more and more controlled,
like in the example

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.060
of the boys in the
barrels, differences

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.645
in behavioral traits are more
closely tied to heredity.

00:04:58.645 --> 00:05:02.516
And the heritability of that
trait is therefore higher.

00:05:02.516 --> 00:05:03.890
And then maybe
another thing that

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.540
might increase
heritability would

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.400
be increased genetic
variation that

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.800
leads to different phenotypes.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.220
So if there was more genetic
variation in these boys,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.690
say maybe if they were
fraternal quadruplets instead

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.080
of identical
quadruplets and they

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.440
had different genotypes and
more genetic variation leading

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.420
to different phenotypes or just
the expression of their traits,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.340
those new variations would be
more related to their genes.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.280
So in this case, again, the
heritability would increase.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.310
And so heritability
is either increasing

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.230
because genetics are
contributing more to the genes

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.370
or because nongenetic
factors, like the environment,

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.830
are contributing less.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.860
But what matters is
that we're talking

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.150
about the relative
contribution of genes

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.330
to the variation in
behavior or traits.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.730
And so you might
have just caught

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.690
on that heritability
then becomes necessarily

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.100
dependent on the
population that's studied.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.000
And so think about
one last time,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.250
the population of boys
inside the barrels.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.480
Their heritability
is much higher--

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.910
or the heritability of their
IQ rather is much higher

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.950
than it would have
been if we had instead

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.200
studied the quadruplets.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.160
So one last time,
heritability of a trait

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.630
is the extent to which variation
can be attributed to genes.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.052
And it's very, very
dependent on the populations

00:06:32.052 --> 00:06:33.510
and the environments
that we study.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.884
But hopefully,
that just gives us

00:06:34.884 --> 00:06:37.690
a quick context for
what we mean when

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.480
we use this word in the future.
