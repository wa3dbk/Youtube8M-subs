00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:29.580
This is the PTC System for Simplifying Posterior
Dental Anatomy. It forms the foundation for

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.470
all the PTC Skill Learning Systems and it
introduces the terminology used for communication

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.850
in the dental laboratory.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.800
When we have a thorough understanding of the
features of the occlusal surfaces of the posterior

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.270
teeth, we find it is simple to design and
shape posterior teeth quickly and with a high

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.110
degree of anatomical accuracy and aesthetic
appeal.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.040
Lets begin by learning the names of the teeth.
The teeth of the maxilla, or upper jaw, are

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.440
called the maxillary teeth. The teeth of the
mandible, or lower jaw, are the mandibular

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.930
teeth. There are two basic types of posterior
teeth on each arch; bicuspids or premolars,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.050
and molars.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.630
The molars come behind the premolars and generally
have four cusps on the biting surface. There

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.960
are three pairs of molars in each arch, the
first molars, second molars and third molars.

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:37.259
Mesial is the direction toward the midline
of the mouth, following the curve of the arch.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.740
The surface facing toward the mesial is the
mesial surface.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.340
Distal is the direction away from the midline.
The distal surface faces toward the distal.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.369
Ridges are long, narrow elevations. There
are three kinds of ridges that we are concerned

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.119
with.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.240
Fossae are concavities or depressions on the
occlusal surface.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.440
So far, we've learned that all posterior teeth
have the same basic features. What makes one

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.750
tooth different from another is the way that
those features are arranged.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.180
Finally all upper molars, and the lower second
and thrid molars, have four oblique cusp ridges,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.290
and no transverse ridges. The lower first
molar has five oblique ridges, matching its

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.129
five cusps.

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.599
Since everything else depends on the proper
placement of the pits, it's important that

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.650
you understand the placement of each pit.
When you can visualize the pit placement before

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.790
you start your work, you'll end up with a
tooth that is functional and in harmony with

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.900
the rest of the teeth.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.769
Start with an imaginary curved line through
the buccal cusp tips. Make a parallel line

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.040
from marginal ridge to marginal ridge, dividing
the tooth in half.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.129
On the lower first molar, note the intersections
where the two buccal grooves join the central

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.709
groove. For the buccal dissectional groove,
the intersection is just mesial to the central

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:25.189
pit, and just buccal to the line. For the
extra disto-buccal groove, it is midway between

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:31.040
the central and distal pits, just buccal to
the line. Curve your central dissectional

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.280
groove from pit to pit, including these two
extra intersections.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.879
Because the crown is wider than the root,
the emergence angle is about 15 degrees to

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:49.849
the long axis of the tooth. The long axis
is an imaginary line running vertically through

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:56.909
the center of the tooth. The shape of the
tooth where it emerges is called the emergence

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:04.629
profile. The emergence profile starts just
below the gingiva and blends gradually into

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.650
the axial surface.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.920
Where the proximal walls approach the contact
areas, a slight V shape is formed. This V-shaped

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.120
space is called an embrasure.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.440
For every transverse or oblique cusp ridge,
there will be two secondary grooves that form

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.460
the sides of the ridge. Occasionally, a single
secondary groove might define both a marginal

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.490
ridge and the adjacent cusp ridge.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.680
Whether you know it or not, you've learned
the complete occlusal anatomy of the posterior

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.250
teeth, and better than you think you have.
