00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.950
Everyone has a story to tell.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.602
It can be grand, epic,
tragic, and adventurous,

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:10.970
but my story is beautiful.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.870
So I'm going to start off with
the usual, once upon a time

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.832
there was this girl who wanted
to show everyone, everywhere

00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:19.340
how to look beautiful.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.130
Then one day she appeared on
popular magazines and landed a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.820
deal with Lancome, the largest
luxury makeup brand

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.800
in the world.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.480
She appeared in Vogue, Nylon,
Marie Claire, People magazine,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.610
even CNN and popular websites.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.950
Her videos were noticed
worldwide and her

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.150
message was spreading.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.180
She even got her own display at
Sephora on Fifth Avenue in New

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.130
York, and she made it on
national TV; still doing what

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.960
she did from the beginning,
showing women everywhere how to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.490
look and feel beautiful.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.030
This girl accomplished so much
in such little time and I still

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.835
can't believe this girl is me.

00:00:56.835 --> 00:00:59.200
And I wanted to say
a little thank.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.590
Thank you so much for
supporting me all these years,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.200
for sticking by me, for just
being there for me and for

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.380
being my inspiration.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.130
Why am I so grateful?

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.690
Because of you I finally
reached one million

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.564
subscribers.

00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:15.056
What a milestone!

00:01:15.056 --> 00:01:18.820
I couldn't have made it this
far without any of your help,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.560
without any of your support,
and your encouragement.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.520
And I couldn't think of
creating a better video than

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.400
this video right here.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.600
And I wanted to celebrate my
one millionth subscriber mark

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.640
by showing you guys a tutorial.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.390
So, let's get started.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.140
You've see me explain this to
you hundreds of times, but

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.780
today's tutorial is not only
going to show you how to look

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.630
beautiful on the outside, but
most importantly,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.450
on the inside.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.460
My mother always told beauty
comes from the heart.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.880
When someone is kind
and good natured, they

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.370
give off this glow.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.330
It's true.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.140
Makeup can only cover so
much, but the heart is what

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.640
gives off your true aura.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.070
I wanted to pass the knowledge
of what my mother told me you,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.380
and let you know that there's
nothing more beautiful

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.130
than helping others.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.540
There's nothing more beautiful
than saving a life.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.920
There's so many ways to
save a life, but I don't

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.210
know all the ways.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.650
But I can show you one of them.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.925
All it takes is $1.

00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:25.150
But most importantly, for
you to spread the word.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.180
About 3.3 billion people, half
of the world's population

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.080
are at risk of malaria.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.210
Malaria kills a child every 45
seconds and overall, nearly

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.220
one million people each year.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.887
Today, nearly one million lives
have been saved from malaria

00:02:40.887 --> 00:02:42.340
because of mosquito nets.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.000
That's it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.470
It's as simple as a mosquito
net that can help save a life.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.600
Can you imagine if everyone of
my subscribers donated $1?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.960
Dollar We can save
so many lives.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.855
Just letting you know,
every contribution counts.

00:02:55.855 --> 00:02:58.550
If you're not able to make
a donation just help

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.450
spread the word.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.570
And again, thank you
so much watching.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.815
Let's make a happy
ending in this chapter.

00:03:03.815 --> 00:03:07.496

00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:09.410

help spread the word.

Let's all do a beautiful thing.
