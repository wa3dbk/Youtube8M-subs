00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:16.250
Hello, my name is VVinrar and my name is Shakarez,
and today we are introducing a new video series:

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.070
The Rework Forge.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.029
In each episode, we will be reviewing a problematic
champion in the current metagame and presenting

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.119
rework solutions to make the champion more
viable in competitive play.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.120
The topic of our first episode is **Skarner,
the Crystal Vanguard.** - Skarner Voice

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.649
Skarner was hit pretty hard in Season 3 with
the jungle rework, in addition to nerfs on

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:37.649
his skill cooldowns.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.320
The biggest nerf to Skarner was the recent
bugfix that "targets would no longer be ulted

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.200
if the target flashed while he was casting.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.870
This compounded with cooldown and mana cost
increases put the nail in the coffin for Season

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.520
2 Skarner and pushed him out of the meta.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.880
Additionally, new junglers such as Volibear
just outperform Skarner in every aspect in

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.370
Season 3.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.369
Volibear is much tankier, his flip is just
a slightly weaker version of Skarner's ultimate

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.960
with a much lower cooldown, while his movement
speed boost is faster more reliable than Skarner's

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.160
W, in addition to greater damage output through
his W and R skills.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.860
Other junglers who are considered superior
to Skarner and rely on movement-speed initiates

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.860
include Hecarim, Nocturne, and Trundle.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.590
Without a leash, it currently takes Skarner
3 minutes and 50 seconds to reach level 4,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.900
about 20 to 30 seconds slower than top tier
junglers, and a tiny bit slower than even

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.840
second tier junglers.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.420
This means that Skarner has fallen out of
favor, and is rarely picked today.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.720
Our goal today is to present a set of balance
changes to help make Skarner viable in today's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.720
metagame.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.120
The objective is relatively simple.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.500
We want to restore Skarner to his Season 2
glory without quite overbuffing him.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.540
To do this, we have to increase his early
game clear potential and ability scaling to

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.790
be on par with common jungle picks while adding
depth to the champion, but we have to make

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.019
sure that Skarner doesn't become too powerful
in the midgame with his ability buffs.

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.360
Skarner's passive is pretty good by itself.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.550
The most recent scaling attack speed buff
per level now let's him use this passive to

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.950
a greater extent, but it's still not enough.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.299
There aren't too many good attack speed items
that skarner can use, which means that he

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.499
is basically limited in damage output by cooldown
reduction.

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:35.559
However, since skarner will usually grab CDR
as a key stat, we don't think any changes

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:42.330
are needed to Energize since it is reliant
on his other skills and autoattacks.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.620
Crystal Slash is the skill that makes Skarner,
Skarner - it's his bread and butter damage

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.019
and crowd control lockdown skill.

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.260
The problem here is that in Season 2, Skarner
was the brick wall that you had to focus down,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.529
because Crystal Slash makes it so you can't
walk past Skarner.

00:02:56.529 --> 00:03:00.510
Unfortunately, the permaslow from Crystal
Slash has been indirectly nerfed with the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.110
addition of Iceborn Gauntlet: now, any melee
champion with a spammable skill, such as Hecarim,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.060
can easily slow like Skarner with basic itemization.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.169
So to help differentiate Skarner from other
champions, we propose that Crystal Slash should

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:17.799
slow on the first usage, not the second, and
have its slow percentage reduced slightly

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.159
to compensate.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.700
Currently, Skarner is charged up with Crystal
Energy if he hits an enemy with Crystal Slash,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.049
but we want to use this as a charge that will
buff all of his skills to add depth, and a

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.349
higher skill ceiling to Skarner.

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.400
So if Skarner hits someone on the second slash
when he is charged with Crystal Energy, the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.349
slow amount from Crystal Slash will be increased
by 50%.

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.700
This will help to increase Skarner's lockdown
power over other champions.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.709
Skarner's W, Crystalline Exoskeleton, is his
primary initiation tool, but its become overshadowed

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.529
by other champions.

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:57.129
For example, Hecarim gains 25 to 75% movement
speed over 3 seconds, while Volibear gains

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.150
50% for 4 seconds.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.799
Right now, Crystalline Exoskeleton has inherent
risk because Skarner loses his movement speed

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:11.230
buff when he loses his shield, so its neither
as fast nor as reliable as these other two

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.230
initiators.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.459
To bring him up to par, we want to do two
things, the first would be not losing his

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.359
movement speed buff when his shield gets destroyed.

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.669
He would still lose the Attack Speed buff,
but not the Movement Speed, that would be

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.789
present for 6 seconds

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.210
The second possible change would be to give
him a % resistance to slows, similar to the

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.020
Relentless defensive mastery.This would allow
Skarner to close in on his target without

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.819
being kited too hard.

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:43.729
He usually gets a tenacity item and tenacious
from the defensive masteries so the duration

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.280
would also be reduced.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.729
And finally, if Skarner is charged with Crystal
Energy, we want the movement speed bonus to

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.840
be present for a longer duration, say 2 extra
seconds.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.229
Now on to Skarner's E skill, Fracture.

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.130
Simply put, it doesn't heal enough.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.229
There is no point in getting this skill right
now because despite its strong ap ratio, the

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.569
base heal and damage is very low; Skarner's
shield mitigates more damage and Q does more

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:13.110
damage than Fracture, while the 10 second
cooldown prevents spammable use for damage

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.199
or heals.

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.270
It doesn't provide a whole lot of help in
killing champions, but at the same time the

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.569
heal isn't strong enough to warrant skilling
in the jungle.

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:25.500
It's basically a redundant skill that doesn't
add anything to Skarner's kit, and even in

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.080
the Skarner LoLPro guide, its recommended
not to put a point in Fracture until level

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.080
13.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.629
So to make Fracture relevant, we want to make
it so the Crystal Energy charge will place

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:38.460
a small armor/mr debuff on any targets hit
and deal an additional percentage of the enemy's

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.590
max health in damage.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.940
Skarner's ultimate, Impale, is what makes
him unique as a champion able to lock down

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.060
a carry.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.500
It's a great skill, but unfortunately its
also dependent on Skarner reaching his enemy

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.750
with his Crystalline Exoskeleton.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.409
We can't revert the bugfix on long-range Skarner
grabs, but what we can do is give him a small

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:06.210
dash, similar to Udyr's bear stance when he
wants to grab a priority target.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.129
This would bring him into viability without
making him extremely overpowered when going

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:12.419
for the ultimate.

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:13.419
------

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.630
Basically, these changes would help to bring
Skarner back into viability because they will

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.590
shore up all of his current weaknesses and
add depth to his basic skills.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.300
In the early game, a faster jungle clear will
allow Skarner to keep on pace with other junglers,

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.740
while still allowing him to scale into the
midgame and stay relevant as an immovable

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.720
cc-bot during teamfights.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.289
Meanwhile, the movement speed change on Crystalline
Exoskeleton will allow Skarner to initiate

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.560
as well as top-tier movement speed based junglers.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.030
In the last season, Skarner was more of a
resistance stacking tank, but that doesn't

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.780
favor the current metagame - the goal of these
changes is to push Skarner into more of a

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.790
utility tank role with greater initiation,
so that he has a place among current popular

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.790
junglers.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.939
The Crystal Energy buff on his E will provide
a slightly faster jungle clear, while changes

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:06.100
to his Q and W will shore up Skarner's lockdown
power in teamfights.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.860
Now, these changes are all our theoretical
recommendations and aren't perfect, but if

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.830
implemented, they would translate into a step
in the right direction.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.870
We hope you enjoyed the first episode of The
Rework Forge.
