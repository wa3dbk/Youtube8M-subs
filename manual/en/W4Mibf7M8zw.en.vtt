Hi I'm Joey Grant, I'm here today at the Cort
Centre for the Music Radar Bass Expo. Today

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:36.140
I'll be modelling the Cort Arona 4, picked
up this bass guitar today, had a play, really

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.020
impressed. Simple bass but very effective,
you have a natural finish which is alberwood

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.400
here it's not gloss but it's just, it's very,
it's just like varnish which is great, looks

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.400
great, comes with 2 pickups the jazz and the
humbacker. It's a 2 band EQ bass guitar, so

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.909
you have your volume, you have your pan selector,
you have trebles and then you have your bass

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:09.520
EQ. On the fret wood it's simply rosewood which
on the deisgn, which is great, you get an

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.640
aluminium knut on the first fret as well,
not many basses do that, you normally just

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.580
have the plastic bit but you still get a nicer
tone which gives you a nice little punch.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.580
With this guitar again very simple but a big
sound, soon as I plugged it in EQ's flat,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.940
hit the first note and I was like wow, for
example.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:46.670
[music]

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.510
Great bass it just feels right, I'm going
to play, I'm going to dig in and it's just

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.660
giving me everything I need right now. Also
with the guitar as well you do get a passive

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:10.989
active switch, which is great and just a brilliant
guitar if you're starting out you will have

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.910
a bass guitar, very good to record with, so I'd
definitely recommend it. Arona 4 from Cort Bass Guitar
