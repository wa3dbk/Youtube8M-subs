00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.300
Welcome back to another sushi video recipe,
my name is Davy Devaux and today I'm going

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.779
to show you guys something quite special.

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.510
I hope you guys enjoy it, and let's get straight
into it.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.109
Alright so for this recipe what you're going
to do is you're going to make smooth cuts

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.179
of salmon and tuna, you want them to be more
or less five fingers long, so just cut the

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:28.189
pieces of fish at the required length -- about
so.

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.950
So five fingers for me is about 10cm which
is 2.5-inches, there we go.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:41.560
So basically you just want to create a nice
smooth long piece of sashimi -- there we go,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.560
beautiful.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.650
So just drag your knife through it.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.490
If your knife isn't sharp enough to do it
then you can sharpen it or you can buy one

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.050
of these amazing knives.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.980
You can check out in my store, a link has
just appeared on the top left corner and there

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.490
you can see everything about sharpening your
knife, and also buying one of these.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.150
Okay, so just a couple cuts we need of each,
some of salmon and some of tuna.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.180
Now here the piece of tuna is extruding a
little bit so what I'm going to do is just

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.830
do one little cut just to make it all even,
and this can be used for the tartare later,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.909
don't worry about it -- no worries, nothing
goes to waste here.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.810
You just want it to be reasonably thin, not
too thin, because they are going to around

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:40.600
like a roll -- okay, beautiful, there we go.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.729
Alright so you simply take a little piece
of rice, you want it to be quite small because

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.950
you don't want it to go over the top -- like
so.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:01.380
Then you take a slice of avocado put it around,
taking care to put the green line on top,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.100
this gives it a nice aesthetic look when it's
finished.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.760
Now you wrap it in your fish, this one is
salmon -- okay, perfect.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:26.140
Okay now add a very thin strip of Nori seaweed
paper just to keep it all together.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:34.990
Okay, now make the tuna one, again a very
small ball of rice, not too big, and then

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:45.160
add your strip of avocado, very thinly sliced
just around with the dark green part on top,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.959
and then add your piece of fish -- this one
is going to be tuna, just wrap it around lightly

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.340
-- perfect.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.709
And you press the rice a little bit deeper
-- good, and now to keep it all together a

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.540
very thin strip of Nori seaweed paper.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.920
Make it thin, don't make it too big and just
wrap it around.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.080
I find the thinner they are the more pretty
it looks.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.709
Now set to one side and make the tartare.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.770
Now to make some salmon and tuna tartare,
all you need is little cuts of tuna and the

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:36.810
salmon that you had before and just simply
chop it extremely fine -- 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.520
just like so, there we go.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:48.110
Once you've done the main chop just turn it
around and then just do another round of chop

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.099
-- alright perfect.

00:03:50.099 --> 00:04:02.220
So that's the tuna, wipe your knife off and
then the salmon.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.500
Just chop it up into nice fine little tartare,
there we go -- beautiful.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:17.380
Alright once you've chopped it up, transfer
it over to some bowls, just like so, add a

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.390
little bit of sriracha sauce.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.810
I prefer this make, I've tried a lot of other
ones and this one's the best.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:35.250
Just a tiny little bit of that, a very small
dash of soy sauce, add a squirt of lime juice,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.970
just to give it a little kick.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:47.110
Okay and then some chopped chives -- alright,
perfect.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:57.750
Now 
just mix, beautiful.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.961
Okay so now just squish the rice a little
bit deeper if it's coming out too far, you

00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:07.550
want to be able to really heap this stuff.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:21.430
Okay so with the tuna one I'm going to put
the salmon, just like so -- there we go.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.890
Okay, beautiful.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:34.520
And then with the salmon I'm going to put
the tuna on top, it gives it a beautiful contrast

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.061
of colors, I like to mix it up.

00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:44.000
Okay, so just add some of the spicy tuna tartare,
beautiful.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:56.500
And then you just finish it off with a little
bit of chopped chives on top, there we go.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.230
Very little goes a long way with this.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.500
VoilÃ , finito.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.760
I hope you guys enjoyed this, these are delicious
and they are great to eat like this.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.139
If you want you can dip them in a little bit
of soy sauce with wasabi, but I mean they

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:16.289
are already seasoned and they have a little
bit of spice to it, so you can just eat them

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:17.289
like so.

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.430
