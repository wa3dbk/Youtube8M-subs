Hi and a huge welcome to Steve's kitchen It is subscriber Sunday and a special

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.899
subscriber Sharon who's been with the
channel a long time

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.059
has asked me to make a sugar free ice
cream not only that she has asked for a coffee

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.839
ice cream which is one of my favorites.
Now stevia if you know it

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.310
it's a product that replaces sugar
it's actually fully natural

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.000
and if you get it in this form it goes
like-for-like teaspoon for teaspoon so

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.580
it's great for baking

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.430
So if you want to substitute it with
normal sugar of course you can but we

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.630
are going to be using stevia

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.859
and we're going to make the most delicious
coffee ice cream you've ever had

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.620
 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.550
 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.100
now all great ice creams start with a lovely
vanilla custard and I've done this one

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.110
on my channel before so I'm going to keep
this very brief but if you want the full

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.260
detailed recipe

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.750
get across to here and watch it and
let's get on and get started

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.329
so very simply a pint a full cream milk
into a saucepan

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.460
and make sure it's a heavy based
saucepan. Take our vanilla

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.449
I'm just going to cut that down the
middle just going to

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.050
scrape out the vanilla beans and they go
into the saucepan

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.759
along with the pod and then we just pop
this on the stove and bring it up to a

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:13.220
simmer.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.780
So in a bowl we've got four egg yolks and into that we add 4 tablespoons of our

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.800
stevia sugar

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.520
and when you're making an egg custard you don't always add corn flour

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.660
but if we add a tablespoon of cornflour
there's less chance of our custard

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.330
separating

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.890
and then we're just going to whisk this until
the egg yolks lighten slightly.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.670
That is what we're looking for

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.340
then when our milk has just come up to a
simmer I'm going bring it back

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.770
over to our egg mix and what I want to
do is just

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.280
temper these eggs slightly, so I'm going to
pour a small amount

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.830
into the egg mix and then we are just going to whisk this now

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.520
this will just stop the eggs from cooking
and allow them to temper slightly before

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.590
we add the rest of the milk.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.590
Okay now I can pour the rest of our milk mixture in

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.950
and mix at the same time and then we
can pour that back into our

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.520
saucepan and I'm then going to pop this
back on the stove on medium heat

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.869
 I am just going to stir  it continually so it
doesn't cook the eggs

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.040
and bring it up to a point where this
thickens slightly

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.430
now I've bought that off the stove and you can see that the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.489
custard has thickened nicely we can draw a line through it and it stays separated

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.209
like that

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.290
that slightly sweet custard is now
going back into a jug

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.600
and now into that I'm just going to add
200 mls a third of a pint

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.130
of thick cream. Give that little stir through

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.130
and that will just help the custard come
down in temperature as well.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.030
Now remember this is going to be a coffee
ice cream, so I am going to put four heaped

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.950
teaspoons of coffee into this now

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.720
give it a little whisk through and you can
taste it at this point and see if it's

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.600
the right strength of coffee for you

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.170
I'm going to be adding some coffee beans
into this as well so

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.859
bear that in mind and when you got the
flavor you like we're going to set that in

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:52.430
the fridge

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.709
overnight we want that to completely 
chill down to give us the best chance at

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.290
making great ice cream.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.530
Now my ice cream mixture has chilled down and my ice cream bowl has

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.420
also been in the freezer overnight, just
going to pop the lid on it now

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.170
lower my mixer down

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.510
I'm going turn it on to the very lowest
speed

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.520
Then I'm very slowly going to pour the coffee ice cream into the bowl

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.520
and there you have it, thirty minutes from now that is going to be a wonderful soft

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.650
serve coffee ice cream

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.430
but really if you want to take it up a
notch and you can either trust me on this or

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.770
not

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.430
I'm taking a quarter of a cup of coffee beans, fresh coffee beans

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.900
and just dropping it in there as well. Now
I'm really think

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.750
coffee beans makes coffee ice cream you
don't have to add it in,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.970
it does taste great

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.769
and after 30 minutes of mixing

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.120
just lift that out, we've got this
wonderful

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.000
thick soft serve ice cream. Now I want to
get it out of there and into a bowl as

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.099
quickly as possible.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.200
Now you could of course just serve it
straight from here but

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.000
it's a little bit soft so what I like to
do is take that out and put it into a

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.069
freezer safe

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.190
container and we'll pop it into the
freezer for about 20 minutes or so just

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.750
to firm up a little bit more.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.920
Now will you look at that beautiful

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.949
coffee ice cream this is absolutely to
die for. I'm going take a scoop of this

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:20.579
now

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.789
Now me I'm a waffle cone sort of a person

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.840
so I'm going to pop that on there hope you
can see that all.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.169
That looks

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.600
absolutely delicious doesn't it just. Now

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.270
this ice cream is sugar free, it's very
easy to make it with sugar

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.430
but I tell you this is the best coffee
ice cream

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.590
you'll ever taste. Now I got to thank you

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.830

cream and secondly for doing my favorite

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.979
coffee ice cream.
