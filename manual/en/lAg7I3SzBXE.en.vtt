00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.310

in red bell pepper ka gravy

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.810
we're going to take spinach that has

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.779
been blanched and chopped ok in this

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.960
we're going to add grated cottage cheese

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.440
or that is paneer and then we're going to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.140
add chopped coriander into this little

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.290
more should do, chopped green chillies,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.590
salt, chilli powder and also little bit

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.260
of garam masala ok and then we're going

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.190
to make nice koftes of this; to add as

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.800
a binding you can add some all-purpose

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.230
flour in this now this will become like

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.910
kind of a dough then we're going to make

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.600
nice koftas just make them the shape

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.159
you like, these koftas

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.560
you can either fry them are shallow

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.689
fry the way I'm doing just take them

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.610
and put it on a hot oil if it is a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.110
nonstick you can do shallow fry

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.049
without fear of you know them

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.340
breaking into pieces

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.080
remember the binding should be good

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.659
add little bit flour to bind it even

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.450
you can add roasted besan flour that is

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.220
chickpea flour into this to give a

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.920
binding but here you know they are

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.750
pretty good by using a little bit flour

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.479
and they're almost done so i'm going to

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.619

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.930

bell pepper which I burnt i removed the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.290
