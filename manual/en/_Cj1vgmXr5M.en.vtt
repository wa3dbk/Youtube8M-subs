[music] Narrator: A long time ago, in ancient Egypt,

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.280
a clever human named Eratosthenes figured out that when the Sun was directly above a deep

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.390
well in one city, you could stand in a nearby city to the north, measure the angle

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.470
of the shadows there, and multiply that by the distance between the two cities

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.570
to get the distance around the entire Earth. With that, the science of

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.660
geodesy was born. Geodesy deals with the measurement and representation

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.720
of the Earth--or, to put it more simply, it's the science of where things are, and just

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.780
as importantly, where they have been and where they are going. Through geodesy,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.810
we learned the rough size and shape of the Earth, the direction of its rotation,

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.830
its distance from the Sun, and more. Through triangulation,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.850
we could create detailed maps of entire countries. We even figured out

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.970
that the Earth isn't quite a perfect sphere, and after some arguments and expeditions

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.080
to Lapland and Peru, we measured that it's just a bit thicker in the middle.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.200
Building on this information, we found tons of practical uses for geodesy.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.290
Using stars as reference points and accurate watches, we could reliably

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.390
determine latitude and longitude so that ships could cross giant oceans to get

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.480
where they needed to go. Explorers visited uncharted regions, mapped them,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.540
and even found the tallest mountain in the world. Later, engineers built railroads

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.580
to get us to all of these places. With a little math and the same reference

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.620
surface, rail tunnels could be started on both sides of a mountain and somehow still

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.660
meet in the middle. Life was good. And once we invented radio

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.680
telescopes and satellites, things got even better. When scientists

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.800
used a bunch of small radio dishes like one big one to look at quasars, somebody

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.940
got the idea that you could use these measurements to determine very accurately the

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.040
distance between the telescopes. Now, we can look at the movement of the Earth's crust, changes

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.150
in how long days are, and how the Earth wobbles on its axis. Satellites

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.230
also became very important. By analyzing their orbits, we can

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.290
learn about our planet's changing size and shape and gravity, and by making

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.360
laser measurements, we can look at everything from changes in the height and shape of the oceans

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.400
and ice sheets to how the tides work. So, from ancient Egypt to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.430
the hundreds of satellites in orbit today, geodesy continues to have a huge

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.450
impact on our lives. And all because somebody, a long time ago,

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.540
decided to look down a well.
