Railing planters are great way to add some greenery to your small balcony.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.560
So we're going to update this basic and inexpensive planter that we found a Home Hardware and give it a bit of a rustic touch.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.640
So we're going to be applying a layer of stucco to it but because the plastic's rather smooth,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.000
we're going to start by roughing up the surface with a bit of sandpaper.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.980
So we're ready to apply the stucco layer.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.140
This is exterior stucco so it's nice and weather resistant,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:44.740
and what you'll want to do is go really thick and just slap it on because we want kind of a rough, organic look to it.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.740
So I'm just kind of using the palette knife here to spread it out evenly before I give it a bit more texture.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:05.080
You don't want to forget the lip all around the edge but you will want to avoid the bottom of the planter because it will be sitting on your railing.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.791
I get right in there and put it on thick.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.380
And you'll want to put a little bit more on the inside ridge of the lip because your soil's not going to go all the way to the top.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.120
So go about 1" to 2" in.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.020
Just think of this as decorating a really big, misshapen cake, smooth it out.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.760
The stucco surface takes about 4-6 hrs to dry.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.720
Now you could leave it on this kind of plastery, paper mache finish,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.380
or you could paint it and add any finish you like.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.200
We've decided to give it that kind of cement look perfect for the city,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.820
so we're going to add a coat of pale grey paint.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.380
We've chosen Beauti-Tone Exterior Paint in "Vogue".

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.560
We're going to be applying a couple of coats, nice and even, to get that pale grey cement look.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.500
You could paint it any colour you like:

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.300
something maybe to match your exterior or something to make your flowers pop,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.640
just don't be shy.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.540
So we're just going to let this last coat of paint dry.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.440
We'll be able to bring it outside, fill it with flowers, and we can enjoy this all summer long.
