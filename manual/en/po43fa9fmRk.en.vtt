Hi this is Chris for Music Radar and I'm here
at Yamaha at Frankfurt Musikmesse 2009 and

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.549
Julian Maud is going to talk us through the
new NX series electro nylon strings.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.670
&gt;&gt;Hi Chris, the NX series is something that's
brand new, just launched here at the show

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.009
so 2 days ago we launched these to the world
and what this is, is a completely new range

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.279
of electro nylon string guitars, there are
actually 9 models, 2 different body sizes

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.279
prices ranging from £575 to £3100 and
what it's actually about is it's about nylon

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.859
strings fgor non-nylon string players. So
there's a big impression that nylon strings are for

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:49.829
classical or flamenco or jazz and that's it but
what we've really done with these guitars

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.829
is come up with a product that suits any musical
style so we worked with a lot of artists that

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.690
play a lot of different styles and what we're
kind of saying to people is look whatever

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.579
you play you should try playing is on nylon
strings because there's loads more dynamics,

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.640
lots of cool stuff you can do with these strings
that you just can't do with steel string electric

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.290
or steel string acousitc.
&gt;&gt;I guess there's also people like Willie

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.270
Nelson who played nylon strings it's not just
for flamenco players.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.620
&gt;&gt;No, that's it if you ask most people about
nylon string guitars they think it's either

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.770
a beginners guitar because quite a lot of
people learn on them or it's for flamenco

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.550
stuff but we're working with artists like
Rodrigo and Gabriela who, they're a Mexican

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.070
nylon string guitar duo but they started in
a thrash metal band in Mexico, they're playing

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.470
V Festival to 50,000 people doing Metallica
and Mega Deck covers on nylon strings plus

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.100
there's a whole breed of singer songwriters
coming through now, guys like David Matthews,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.350
Jack Johnson, Jason Mraz that are actually
seeing that nylon strings gives them a really

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.230
different sound, it gives them very very
different and open voice that you just don't

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.760
get with steel strings.
&gt;&gt;So this is the NTX900, will you just talk

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.390
us through the construction.
&gt;&gt;Sure, this is the NTX900 so what there is

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.030
there's 2 body styles on the NX, this is the
NTX which is kind of like our APX electro

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.780
acoustic; slim body, slightly more contemporary
design, the most noticable thing about this

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.769
is that it's got a slightly narrower nut and
a slightly curved finger board than a regular

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.760
classical, if you're used to steel string
acoustic or electric much more comfortable

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.719
to play than traditional acousitc. This guitar,
solid spruce top, flame maple back and sides

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:39.719
and it's got our new nylon string ART pickup
system so this is our acoustic resonance transducer

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.870
body contact system, loads of dynamic range,
fantastic feedback projection, loads of power,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.459
really natural sound and you actually get
a seperate pickup for bass and one for treble

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.370
so rather than needing EQ if you want to bring
in a bit more bass you can bring in more of

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.090
the natural bass sound of the guitar it just
sounds huge and really really powerful.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.090
&gt;&gt;Shall we have a look at the other one?
&gt;&gt;The NCX, it's very very similar in terms of spec,

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.799
big difference is that it's a traditional
classical acoustic style so a bigger size

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.889
similar to our CG guitars and it's got a traditional
classical neck so a 52mm nut width and flat

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.510
radius fingerboard, actually it's something
you can get used to as an electric player

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.290
but it's not quite as immediate as the NTX.
&gt;&gt;Like you said everyone seems to start out

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.659
on one anyway, I know I did, it probably would be strange
going back to something that you were used to but you've forgotten.

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.090
&gt;&gt;There is that and I think what a lot of
people did when they started playing nylon

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.700
string guitars was you'd start on a nylon
string then maybe get a steel string or an

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.749
electric then you'd play a few things, go
back to your nylon strings and think this

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:52.019
is kind of cool but maybe you started on a
beginners guitar and it didn't really feel

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.889
the same. Of course now you've got a great
guitar that, stick it through your acoustic

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:01.389
amp maybe a little bit of delay on there and
it's a fantastic playing experience, really

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:07.169
makes you play well as well. If you want to
use it, almost as an improvement tool, it

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.389
really makes you tighten up playing because
there's nowhere to hide on an acoustic guitar.

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:16.430
&gt;&gt;So are these all available now or..?
&gt;&gt;They'll be available from June, the first

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.200
guitars we're going to ship are the NTX700's
so it's this body size and the entry level

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.730
575, one of the best things about that is
we're actually doing it in black as well,

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.230
so get a little black cutaway electro nylon,
it's going to be pretty cool on stage. It

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.310
really does reinforce the thing that these really
aren't classical guitars, yes they've got

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.010
nylon strings but they're not for classical
players.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.990
&gt;&gt;Cool, well thanks very much for your time
and have a good show.
