00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Swing Out is a tradition at the Principia
Upper School. It started a very long time ago

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.200
when the Upper School boys were
on their way to the Girls' Dorm to a prank,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.000
and Mary Kimball Morgan saw them coming and
she said, "Boys! Why don't you come in?"

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.650
And that night turned into a night of gratitude
for Principia and the memories that they had there.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.500
Every year we have the Boys' Senior Dinner,
or the Boys' Org Dinner.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.910
We do this to celebrate
the seniors graduating, and it falls right

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.239
at the end of the year. And it's always a
really great time for everyone who comes.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.239
It starts off where the senior girls and the
underclassman who is swinging them out meet together.

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.500
They will walk in the dining hall,
and we have a really fantastic meal together.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.670
And then the residential head of the Girls'
Dorm gives beginning remarks.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.949
The speech from the residential head is given
to the boys at the beginning of every dinner,

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.330
and it's always very inspirational and such
a great speech to hear to wrap up the year.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.180
After the residential head's speech, the seniors
give their speech. Four seniors are chosen

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.090
by all of the guys in the entire Principia
School to give speeches on their experiences

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.700
or anything they'd like to share with everyone
at the dinner.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.200
After that, readings are given by a junior,
typically. This year, that's me.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.840
After these speeches and the readings, the
seniors are given the option to share gratitude.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.640
It's a great time to hear what they have enjoyed
and loved over the years at Principia. The

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.049
gratitude is definitely one of my highlights
of the entire dinner.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.170
I just so loved hearing all the individual
expressions of gratitude tonight and especially

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.439
the comments on their gratitude for the Christian
Science atmosphere that's here at Principia

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.549
and its purpose. It was just such a beautiful
thread of continuity woven in all of the comments

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.420
that always came back to, this is a special
place and they've all benefitted and grown

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.750
from that Christian Science foundation.
