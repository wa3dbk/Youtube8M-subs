00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.940
Hi I'm Karen for Expert Village, we are going
to practice on a plate until we feel confidence

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:17.470
to do it on a cake. I'm going to do a simple
a little rosette, now around and up it is

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:25.690
like a wave around and up, around and up.
When you feel confident you can do it on a

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:46.300
cake. Do small bits, stop and do it on the
cake, you should be going right on the edge

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:57.899
of your cake and continue all the way around.
You should keep a little of a rhythm going.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:19.490
Remember you hand is squeezing with your fingers
and your palm and this hand is guiding the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:30.460
bag. We continue all the way around. Okay
now we do the bottom, twist the bag to keep

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:43.140
the pressure consistent and continue with
your rhythm, turn the cake, stop again, stop

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:55.840
again, turn the cake, twist the bag and continue
on in a nice motion. You see how pretty it

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.890
is looking and we would just keep going. You
frost your rosette it would start on top where

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:13.890
you ended, you would end with a little tail
there and then you just right up on top it.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:24.249
There is your little tail and you just make
your little rosette, and a tail, and a rosette

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:36.349
and a tail all the way around the cake. Twist
the bag to keep that pressure and around we

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:47.790
go. This takes a little practice it looks
easy for me but you will have to practice

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.029
a bit and just end with a little rosette.
Then we are finish, isn't that beautiful.
