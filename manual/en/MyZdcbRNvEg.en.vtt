00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.859
Hi everyone, in this video I'd like to introduce
the general process of diagnostic nuclear

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:10.809
medicine.
Diagnostic nuclear medicine is a non-invasive

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.950
imaging modality that utilizes radioactive
substances in the diagnosis of disease.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.480
A key component of diagnostic nuclear medicine
is the radiopharmaceutical which is comprised

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.390
of a radioisotope combined with a pharmaceutical
or a drug like compound. This is administered

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.949
to the patient either orally or intravenously.
Within the body, the radiopharmaceutical then

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:43.190
localises in specific organs or cellular receptors
allowing medical imaging based on the radiation

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.819
emitted from its radioisotope component.
This schematic outlines the overall process

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:55.219
of diagnostic nuclear medicine from start
to finish, from the production of the radioisotope,

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.789
to the reporting by the clinician. We will
now discuss each step of the process, and

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.060
also further details in this section of the
course.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.119
One way of producing radioisotopes is using
a particle accelerator such as a cyclotron,

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.490
like the one you can see on the left. Radioisotope
generators like the one displayed on the right

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:27.000
picture are also sources of radioisotopes.
The next step of the process is the radiopharmaceutical

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:33.380
preparation. Depending on the type of radiopharmaceutical,
this can be by either radiopharmaceutical

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.380
kit re-constitution or by more complex radiopharmaceutical
synthesis using an automated synthesis module

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.649
such as the one in the picture. The choice
of the radiopharmaceutical depends on the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.479
disease or organ of interest that needs to
be imaged. Quality control is then performed

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.479
on a sample of the radiopharmaceutical to
ensure that it is safe and fit for its intended

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.070
use.
Once quality control is completed and has

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.749
demonstrated that the radiopharmaceutical
has passed specific test criteria, a portion

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:14.510
of the radiopharmaceutical is administered
or injected into the patient. The patient

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.280
is then imaged using a scanner. There are
various types of scanners available and they

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.440
are generally categorised as either SPECT,
an acronym for Single Photon Emission Computed

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.860
Tomography or PET, Positron Emission Tomography.
You would have learned about the modality

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.599
CT in an earlier section of the course. There
are hybrid scanners that use a combination

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.489
of imaging modalities including SPECT with
CT and PET with CT which can provide additional

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.940
information about the disease.
The particular scanner pictured is an example

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.799
of a SPET/CT scanner.
The choice of scanner used is linked to the

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.239
particular radiopharmaceutical, in particular
the type of radioisotope that it contains.

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:07.239
Here, a patient is undergoing a scan with
a SPECT/CT scanner. The moving parts that

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.739
you can see are the scanners detectors moving
into position and then rotating slowly around

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.750
the patient.
The radiation emitted from the patient is

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.750
then detected and turned into signals used
to generate the image.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.409
After the scanning is complete, the images
acquired are processed using sophisticated

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.920
software and then assessed or reported by
clinicians.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.840
I hope that you enjoy this section and once
you complete it that you will understand the

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.659
basic principles of diagnostic nuclear medicine.
Coming up next we will cover in more detail

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.280
isotopes and radioisotopes.
