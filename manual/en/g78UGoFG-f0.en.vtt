00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:10.500
This is a video that I'm making really quick to show how to resolve an issue that I was having with my printer.  

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.700
My printer is a Canon MG5320.  

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:27.600
And when I would go to print an envelope, as you can see here in Word, I would go to "Options". 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.400
And I'd have it set up for the rear tray.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.000
And when I went to click "Print"...

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.400
I was getting this error message:

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.200
"A paper size that is not supported by the automatic duplex printing function is selected."

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.700
"Stop printing.  Uncheck Automatic on the page setup tab of the printer driver.  Then print again."

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.200
I'm going to show you how to troubleshoot and fix this.  

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.200
I'm going to cancel this print.  

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.100
And what you're going to have to do is...

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.600
...go into your control panel and into your printer.  

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.100
Right click on the printer.  Click "Printing Preferences".  

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.600
And as you can see here, to save paper, I kept it as set for duplex printing and fast printing.  

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.600
And you want to uncheck both of those because if it's fast printing, the envelope will not be very clear.  

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.900
And duplex printing is what's causing the issue why it won't print an envelope to begin with.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.800
I'm going to "Apply" -- "Okay".

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.100
I'm going to go back into my Word.  

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.800
You have to get to envelopes by "Tools", "Envelopes and Labels".

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.700
You type in a delivery address.  I'm just going to put the same (as return address).  

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.500
Go into "Options", and this is how you pick where you're going to load it.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.400
Now what's strange about this one is, as you can see by this picture, I'd be loading it facing right,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.900
but what's going to happen is it's going to print opposite, so when I load the envelope, I'm going to load it facing left.  Let me show you that.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:42.300
As you can see here, I've got the MG5320, and in the picture it shows that I would be loading it facing right.  

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.900
But it's going to have to be loaded facing left, face up, in order to get the print correct.  

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.800
So you load it just like that.  

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.500
Then you're going to push "Okay" to print -- "Print".  

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Now I'm not going to get that error message.  

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.600
And there it is.  It comes out that way facing left.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:33.800
So I hope this helps you in case you had any issues trying to get your printer, Canon MG5320, to print envelopes.
