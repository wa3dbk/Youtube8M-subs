00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:07.390
Now it's time for the Man of Steel! The alien
from the planet Krypton. The first serial

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.630
was 1948, simply entitled "Superman". The
second one 1950 "Atom Man vs. Superman". Kirk

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.760
Alyn, that's spelled A-L-Y-N, was the protagonist,
but for some reason despite a very detailed

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.451
cast list in each episode, they did not show
his name. And I would have objected had that

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:33.550
been me. Now, in chapter four of that original
series "Superman" he had to reveal his identity

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.670
to an astronomer because he was dying by being
exposed to Kryptonite which, of course, is

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.399
lethal for him. But, after that chapter we
never saw that scientist again. Nothing more

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.989
was made about that very important revelation.
Now let's fast-forward to the TV series "The

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.910
Adventures of Superman" starring George Reeves.
In the very first season there were two episodes

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.140
where his identity was actually discovered.
In chapter ten "The Secret of Superman" Peter

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.540
Brocco, a villain, had hypnotized Lois Lane
played by Phyllis Coates in that first season,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.340
and determined that Clark Kent was actually
Superman. But conveniently he was killed in

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.189
a shoot-out with police. The identity problem
was never further explored there. Fast-forward

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:29.789
to chapter thirteen "The Stolen Costume" in
which a cat burglar finds Superman's costume

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:36.200
in a hidden closet. Clark Kent had to go for
a physical exam so he left the costume in

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.289
the closet in his apartment. The cat burglar
was killed, but before he died he gave the

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:47.099
costume to Vita Anborg and Dan Seymour, two
criminals and they were trying to blackmail

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:53.389
Clark Kent. So you know what he did? He flew
them to the top of a mountain, telling them

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:58.389
that he would bring them food later on. Well,
of course they didn't trust him, and they

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:03.549
tried to climb down the mountain and were
conveniently killed. So, in a sense Superman

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.919
was responsible for their deaths. That very
first season, I thought, of the TV series

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:13.299
was the best. Some very serious episodes for
individuals such as villains being killed,

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.370
and of course these two episodes: outstanding.
Phyllis Coates played the role of Lois Lane,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.730
just for that first year, did an excellent
job, but then was replaced by the gal who

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.310
was also in the two serials and the series
took a lighter tone then afterward. Then it

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.150
went to color and I felt that this deteriorated
to an extent. That first year of "Superman"

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.000
was superb. George Reeves, Phyllis Coates.
