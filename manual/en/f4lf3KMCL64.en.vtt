00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.780
 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.710
 Hello! My name is Charity Reedy-

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.610
Hines. I am staff and 
 part of the alumni

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.650
here at Gallaudet. Welcome
 to this beautiful campus

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.680
on Kendall Green. On this tour,
 you will learn about 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.980
Gallaudet's esteemed bilingual 
 liberal arts programs, 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.780
the engaging and 
 diverse student life 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.980
 and learn from our excellent

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.480
faculty and students. 
 You will learn about

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.880
how Gallaudet prepares 
 you for a successful

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.750
academic experience, 
 and how to stand out for life 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.950
after you receive
 your diploma. 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.180
At this liberal arts university 
 for the deaf, we take 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.950
a lot of pride in our 
 historic roots. We also

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.210
celebrate our present accomplishments. 
 I would like to tell you about

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.580
this sculpture of two important 
 people who started it all:

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.780
at Gallaudet: Thomas 
 Hopkins Gallaudet and

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.610
Alice Cogswell. 
 This sculpture shows

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.550
Reverened Thomas Gallaudet, 
 the namesake of this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.080
University teaching the sign 
 language letter "A" to his first

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.410
deaf student, Alice Cogswell.
 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.150
This was a gift to the University by the National Association 
 for the Deaf.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.850
Daniel Chester French 
 completed this in 1889.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.380
He was the same sculptor who did Lincoln's 
 statue in the Lincoln 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.550
memorial. Some people believe
 that's why 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.350
Abraham Lincoln's hands
 show "A" and "L"

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.510
You'll have to go see it for yourself
 and see what you think.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.510
 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.750
That's another great thing about
 Gallaudet: It is located

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.880
in the nation's capital, 
 we're just two miles

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.650
from the National Mall, 
 the Smithsonian Museums,

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.910
the Washington Monument, the White House, 
 and the Capitol. 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.810
The campus is easily accessible 
 to all the city has.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.010
 to offer.
