00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.920
Motorola XT928 and MT917.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.730
Expected December 2011 (China).

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.810
Two handsets heading to China, the Motorola
MT917 (heading to China Mobile) and the XT928

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:30.650
(heading to China Telecom) are the two most
powerful smartphones ever made by Motorola.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.920
Both handsets feature a 4.5" 720 x 1280 pixel
touchscreen on the front, a 13 megapixel camera

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.450
on the back and a 1.2GHz dual core CPU with
1GB of RAM.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:50.150
The MT917 is styled after the Motorola RAZR
(complete with Kevlar back), where the XT928

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.540
is a slightly more traditional design.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:00.370
Other features on these two phones include
a 1.3 megapixel video calling camera, 1080p

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.239
video capture with the main camera, a Gorilla
Glass coated display and all the usual features

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.590
that you would expect from an Android 2.3
smartphone.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:19.210
The MT917 is a TD-SCDMA device, the XT928
is a CDMA handset, but otherwise both seem

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.220
to be very similar, and they are certainly
more powerful than anything we have seen from

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.960
Motorola in Europe or the US.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.240
Motorola have been heavily involved in the
Chinese market for some time, with several

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.179
quite desirable handsets being made available
only in China over the years.

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.000
We don't know if these handsets will make
it out of China in a modified form though,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.880
Motorola have been quite picky about markets
lately and not all recent handsets have been

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.560
available worldwide.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.109
The Motorola XT928 and MT917 should be available
on their respective carriers from December

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.779
onwards.
