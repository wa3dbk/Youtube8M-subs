00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:01.909
Here we are.

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:03.320
Now get out of here!

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.120
Grazie.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.820
This way.

[Mission/Memory: Sibling Rivalry]

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.400
Quite a night!

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.240
Indeed.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.960
I only wish they were all as much fun...

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.880
Oh, wait! They are!

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.420
We should head home, Ezio.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.360
Father's sure to be wondering where we've gone.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.420
Yes. And I'd rather avoid a lecture.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.720
Up for a little race, then?

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.500
To where?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.860
Uhh... roof of that church.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.400

Come on, tartaruga!

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.740
Come on, then. This way.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.760
Where you going?

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.400
You'll see.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.790
It is good life we lead, brother. 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.780
The best.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.500
May it never change.

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.749
And may it never change us.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.160

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.420
Alright. Enough of that. We really should head home. Let's go.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.220
Wait...

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.780
What...?
