Hi, I'm Brenda Thompson, registered dietitian
and owner of Life Skills Nutrition. This segment

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm going to talk about the exchanged method
for meal planning to control blood sugars.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The exchange list, the exchange method excuse
me, historically is the most popular approach

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.679
to controlling blood sugars in diabetes. It
also has been used to control weight. The

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:27.210
exchange list divides foods up into groups
including carbohydrates, meats and meat substitutes

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.630
groups and fat groups. This form of meal planning
allows individuals to track the amount of

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.660
carbohydrates, proteins, fats and calories
from each food group of the food guide pyramid.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.600
When you seek advice from your registered
dietitian, she may give you an example of

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.940
something that looks like this. Let's say
that you are recommended to eat an eighteen

00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:04.689
hundred calorie diet. She may give you a lunch
where she asks you to choose three starches,

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:24.729
two to three ounces of lean meat, one fruit,
two vegetables and one fat. She would give

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:31.219
you a daily list for each meal including your
snacks. She would also provide you with a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.869
list that might look like this so that you
can plan your meals accordingly. So from this

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.520
list you would choose three starches, you
would choose two to three ounces of lean meat,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:50.880
you would then choose one fruit, two vegetables
and then one fat. There are also booklets

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.319
with much more extensive materials based on
the exchange system. This is a system that

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.930
I highly recommend and find that it helps
out people who are diagnosed with diabetes

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.409
to be successful in controlling their blood
sugars.
