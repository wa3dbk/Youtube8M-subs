00:00:07.746 --> 00:00:11.817
[Subtitles by danielsangeo]

00:00:12.484 --> 00:00:14.853
I'm wasting my damned time.

00:00:14.853 --> 00:00:19.958
I'm trying to open this elevator, but I'm
90% sure this elevator only goes down,

00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.426
like everything else here.

00:00:21.426 --> 00:00:23.228
That's pretty far down, though.

00:00:23.228 --> 00:00:25.664
All this security must be
protect something.

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:28.967
I bet we have gnomes down there
mining precious metals and gems.

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:29.835
I want a gnome.

00:00:30.702 --> 00:00:32.070
Damn, there's another alien.

00:00:33.972 --> 00:00:37.709
I'd put my gnome in a cage and feed
him granola.  I think they'd eat that.

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:38.810
Eh, who am I kidding?

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.713
If the aliens got down there, they'd
have eaten them all by now anyway.

00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:42.981
Gnomes are small.

00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:44.516
Wait, are gnomes even real?

00:00:44.516 --> 00:00:45.650
[headcrab squeals]
I can't re--WHOA!

00:00:47.152 --> 00:00:48.954
Dammit, I'm being followed again.

00:00:49.254 --> 00:00:52.824
What happened to that soldier guy?
I thought he was taking care of this?

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:54.893
Nobody's doing their job.

00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:57.829
Why is everyone who's
not me such a problem?

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.166
Y'know, some people might argue
I'm only focusing on the negative,

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.835
but I think that's because I
can't think of one thing today

00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:05.637
anyone else has done right.

00:01:05.637 --> 00:01:08.306
All anyone has been doing today
has been breaking things,

00:01:08.306 --> 00:01:09.708
running around screaming,

00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:11.076
shooting the wrong people,

00:01:11.076 --> 00:01:12.110
or dying.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.179
I mean, what am I
supposed to say to people?

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.749
"Wow, you sure did a good job
falling down that elevator shaft!"

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:21.920
Or "Way to lock yourself inside
the freezer.  I'm so proud of you."

00:01:22.487 --> 00:01:24.856
Hey, this is the homeless guy's foundation.

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:26.925
I'm going in circles again!

00:01:26.925 --> 00:01:28.393
I'd better speed up.

00:01:28.393 --> 00:01:30.729
If going to go in circles,
I want to go faster.

00:01:31.396 --> 00:01:33.398
Wait, wait wait, wait, wait.

00:01:33.398 --> 00:01:37.736
I haven't checked this tunnel out, and
I'm still waiting for hidden treasure.

00:01:37.736 --> 00:01:40.205
We get funding for
a lot of shady projects.

00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:42.507
Maybe there's some Nazi gold back here.

00:01:42.507 --> 00:01:44.509
Siegen sie mir das geld.

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.044
Eh, there's nothing here.

00:01:46.044 --> 00:01:48.480
Just a dead end and some more boxes.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.416
Probably filled with
network cards we can't use.

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:53.251
BNC or something.

00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:55.220
Well, back on the labyrinth ride.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.255
See, I'm remaining calm
about going in circles

00:01:57.255 --> 00:02:00.992
because I know I haven't investigated
every possible path yet.

00:02:00.992 --> 00:02:03.361
See, there's one.
I don't know where that goes.

00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:05.864
Some people stay lost their
WHOLE LIVES!

00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:06.898
Eeeh...

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:08.433
In fact, most people.

00:02:08.967 --> 00:02:09.567
EVERYONE!

00:02:09.968 --> 00:02:12.170
Everyone's lost, except me.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.471
Except for right now.

00:02:13.872 --> 00:02:14.806
There's that hook again.

00:02:14.806 --> 00:02:17.242
I'm going to come back here
if I can't find the right way.

00:02:17.242 --> 00:02:21.279
I won't be surprised if this entire track
is devoted to taking people in circles,

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:22.514
but I will be disappointed.

00:02:23.014 --> 00:02:25.684
Hey, there's one of those signs
again that might do something.

00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:27.018
I'm going to shoot it.

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.622
That's so weird; it spins the wrong way.

00:02:30.622 --> 00:02:35.393
Now, did that actually do anything, or am
I shooting at things for no reason again?

00:02:35.393 --> 00:02:37.629
Ah!  It did!

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:38.730
I'm surprised that worked.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.000
I wouldn't have thought that shooting
road signs was the correct thing to do.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.101
[rumbling]
I always thought that--

00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:47.205
Jesus Christ, are we running a
geothermal plant down here, too?

00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:48.106
Stop, stop.

00:02:48.673 --> 00:02:51.910
Okay, a dead body and an
alien who hasn't seen me yet.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.045
I can put one and one together.

00:02:54.846 --> 00:02:56.681
Actually, that's one and negative one.

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.851
Now it's negative two and me.

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:02.287
But wait, wouldn't I be number one?

00:03:02.754 --> 00:03:04.656
I don't know what
the hell I'm talking about.

00:03:04.656 --> 00:03:06.758
See, this is why you
have to define your terms.

00:03:06.758 --> 00:03:08.326
If you don't, people die.

00:03:08.693 --> 00:03:10.795
Oop, there's that tentacle again.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.665
Bad spot, chunky.

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.034
Get it all up, I'll wait.

00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:19.771
I should've just driven the tram
straight through it, but, I dunno,

00:03:19.771 --> 00:03:22.173
that might've caused it to come
crashing down on top of me.

00:03:22.607 --> 00:03:23.942
Wouldn't want that.

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.345
I wonder if circus people
already know about these things.

00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:28.580
Carnies.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.150
Some of the strangest things I've ever seen
in my life have been at the freak show.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.354
Ah, but they had the freaks in
cages where they belong!

00:03:37.222 --> 00:03:39.958
Back.  There might be something here.

00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.459
Besides death, I mean.

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.527
I doubt there will be.

00:03:42.894 --> 00:03:45.730
I'm sure I'll go up the stairs and
find nothing but a stack of dead bodies,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.998
with a smiley-faced sticker attached--

00:03:46.998 --> 00:03:47.632
[headcrab squeals]
with a smiley-faced sticker attached--

00:03:47.632 --> 00:03:48.299
Fugh!

00:03:50.635 --> 00:03:51.870
That was sneaky!

00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:54.472
Where did you go?!

00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:58.476
Well, let that be a lesson to you.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.981
How did those bastards know to jump towards
the only vulnerable part of my body?

00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:06.084
If I was quick enough, I might be able
to headbutt them, but I don't--

00:04:06.084 --> 00:04:08.453
Now, what's this?  The sentry gun?

00:04:08.453 --> 00:04:10.855
It can't be bothered to shoot
those aliens crawling around,

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:13.758
yet it has no problems
seeing me through a wall?

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.828
These things cause more
problems than they solve.

00:04:17.262 --> 00:04:18.897
Ah-hah!  Buttons!

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.131
What did that do?

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:21.733
Oh, it moved the hook.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.569
So, why the hell was
that there in the first place?

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.104
Well, that opens up some options.

00:04:26.104 --> 00:04:29.941
And I'm going to be Mr. Efficiency
and switch the track while I'm up here.

00:04:29.941 --> 00:04:32.944
Because maybe I'm just a pessimist,

00:04:32.944 --> 00:04:35.847
but I get the sneaking sensation
this track is going to find a way

00:04:35.847 --> 00:04:37.649
to send me back in circles again.

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:40.685
I mean, why should it be any different
than anything else in this building?

00:04:40.685 --> 00:04:43.488
I don't think this tram
has any real function here.

00:04:43.488 --> 00:04:45.857
It's just some CEO's fantasy track.

00:04:45.857 --> 00:04:47.792
Why have a model train
that goes in circles

00:04:47.792 --> 00:04:49.527
when you can afford the real thing?

00:04:49.928 --> 00:04:50.662
Aah!

00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:57.402
Yeah, I'm sure before long, I'll start
seeing some giant Styrofoam trees.

00:04:57.402 --> 00:05:00.972
I will say that I do dig this
sign-shooting track switch system.

00:05:00.972 --> 00:05:03.975
I mean, I thought there'd be a
control station with--Ah, wire!

00:05:03.975 --> 00:05:05.710
I AM going in circles.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.146
But no, they just want
you to shoot the signs.

00:05:08.146 --> 00:05:11.616
Like drunk hillbillies shooting
deer-crossing signs from their pickups.

00:05:11.616 --> 00:05:12.517
Works for me.

00:05:12.517 --> 00:05:13.451
[imitating banjo plucking]

00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:14.352
[machine gun fire]
[imitating banjo plucking]

00:05:14.352 --> 00:05:15.520
Hm.  Gunfire.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.089
I've changed my stance
from that being a happy thing.

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:20.525
HEY, DON'T MIND ME, GUYS!
I'M JUST PASSING THROUGH!

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:22.327
OKAY! YOU CAN CUT THAT OUT!

00:05:22.327 --> 00:05:24.262
I'M REALLY NOT TRYING
TO GET IN ANYBODY'S WAY!

00:05:25.897 --> 00:05:28.299
OH MY GOD!  WHY IS EVERYONE SO HOSTILE?!

00:05:30.168 --> 00:05:31.436
THIS THING'S SPINNING!

00:05:31.436 --> 00:05:32.570
I'M GETTING DIZZY!

00:05:33.104 --> 00:05:35.406
I CAN'T SHOOT YOU
ACCURATELY WHEN I'M DIZZY!

00:05:36.007 --> 00:05:36.808
WHERE ARE YOU?!

00:05:37.108 --> 00:05:37.775
NO!

00:05:40.445 --> 00:05:41.446
YOU FLANKING ME?

00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:44.182
I'M...READY...SORT OF!

00:05:46.217 --> 00:05:47.051
[exhales]

00:05:48.186 --> 00:05:51.022
I think I'm just going to
take a breather for a minute.

00:05:54.092 --> 00:05:55.734
I should've been a pirate.
