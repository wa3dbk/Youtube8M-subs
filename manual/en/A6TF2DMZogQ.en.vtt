Hi! Iâ€™m Yvette Parrish. Thanks for joining
me at Expert Village. Today, Iâ€™m going to

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.849
show you how to apply makeup properly, professionally
and the use of brushes. We did the eyebrow;

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.820
we strengthened them. What I am going to do
is a base on the eyelid, and this is a cream

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.240
base that you can get from most makeup lines.
And what I am going to do is just tap it in,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.890
and remember use your ring finger or your
middle finger. And I am just going to rub

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.870
in a base, and what happens is the eye shadow
that I apply will stick to this base, and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.770
you would not have so many sprinkles that
happen underneath your eye. So I am going

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.379
to apply this base, and it keeps the color
on longer and it is crease resistant and there

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.870
are all kinds of benefits, so you should always
start with a little bit of a cream eye shadow

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.010
first. I chose one that is a little bit yellow
golden because it goes with her natural look,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.990
but there are other colors that you can get
such as a pink, you can use a white. You can

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.690
even use a blue and that pink. You can do
a different base, this is Revlon, this is

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:16.711
Clinique, I have Aveda: whatever makeup line
you feel comfortable with. Anytime you are

00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:22.020
working with the cream, I would recommend
using your finger. Because if you use a brush,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.210
all the hair gets all really disgusted in
the cream. It is not a sanitary thing. Itâ€™s

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.610
a big mess. I promise you use a brush one
time and you will never use it again. So apply

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.080
the creams with your fingers. It will allow
you more control and you would not mess up

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:49.220
your pretty brushes. And I just put this golden
yellow base on her whole lid, and you see

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.140
how that kind of lightens her up, and now
whatever color that I use on her eyes it will

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.819
stay true.
