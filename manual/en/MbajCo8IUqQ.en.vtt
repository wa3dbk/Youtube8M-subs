00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.970
The SPD-S has really really cool effects.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.210
Simply press the effects button on the front
of the SPD-S, and this is one of the preset

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.450
patches with Filter 9 is what it's called.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.950
Filter because we've got that effect assigned
to the drum.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.310
So without you hear the drum and bass type
of groove sound like this.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.320
One.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.480
there it goes.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.160
Now with, I just press a button I can then
filter that groove.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
Hear it?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.299
So all the way to the left I get a very filtered.

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:43.299
Pretty cool stuff.

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:46.420
Ok 1, 2, 3, 4 and we're off.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.780
I can also use my stick and the pad, where
the velocity controls the amount of filter.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.879
So put the effects button on again, now watch
this.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.220
There it is.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.430
Play along.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.890
Now watch.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.140
So I can control soft.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:50.190
So different velocities control 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:58.800
the filter.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:19.510
So let's perform.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.760
Bye bye everybody.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:29.860
Filter 9.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.819
Another type of effect is slicer and this
is actually number 44 on the preset patches.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:35.819
So check it out.

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.350
We've got the main groove, the drum and bass
that we just heard.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.700
But now I can control by putting the effects
switch, 3, 4.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:52.450
See how I can create the different 16 notes
feel without, here's without, here's with.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:03.460
Now using the knob I can control the different
rhythms.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:13.230
Ok and back to the same.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:26.989
So you can see how I can use the dial to create
my own.

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:41.790
So that in essence is slicer.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:49.790
Slicing up that groove.
