00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.000
The T26E4 Super Pershing is an American medium tank in Tier VIII.

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:18.533
Since the game was released it has been showered with universal love and bitter hatred.

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:25.000
But its most distinctive feature always stayed the same: it was never a “regular tank”.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.067
The premium tanks in our game are always a little different.

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:42.533
“Unique gameplay” is often the way we describe it.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:46.033
Here that means a little more.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:56.267
Any premium tank is just a tank: shooting, driving, and pwning, but!

00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:58.867
There’s always, always a catch!

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:02.367
And for the Pershing it’s the speed.

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:13.700
Take a peek at its combat characteristics, and you’ll see its maximum speed of 40 km/h.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.433
40 kilometers!

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.167
To put it mildly, that’s not much.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.433
Keep in mind this is a medium tank.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.700
And even worse is the fact that once you leave the Garage and enter a battle…

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.700
you’ll realize that the Pershing never reaches that maximum speed… ever!

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:42.233
32 km/h is all you can get from this American if it’s not going down a hill!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.600
The Super Pershing has less than 10 horsepower per ton, which makes it the slowest tank within its type.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.067
Looking outside of its type, it’s even inferior to heavy tanks!

00:01:56.167 --> 00:02:00.100
And we aren’t talking about some AMX 50 100.

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:06.867
The IS-3, a Soviet heavy, can easily beat the American in a straight line.

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:10.667
And you can forget climbing hills too.

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:12.567
But there is something of note.

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:19.500
Our “not-quite-medium tank” gains speed faster when it’s going backwards rather than forwards!

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:26.433
You can still climb the hill facing either way, but it’ll be equally as slow.

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:30.167
So you’ll suffer whichever way you approach the enemy.

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:35.733
Why does this happen?

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:42.000
That’s easy: the Super Pershing is covered in so much armor that it just can’t move that fast.

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:49.067
This American’s turret is an unusual shape, so it’s very hard to penetrate, even in the weak points.

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:55.933
Not that its weak points are stronger than other tanks—but they still have to hit them!

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.700
The daunting BL-10 hits them 4 times out of 10.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.467
In other cases, the shell either misses or fails to penetrate.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.600
Armor-piercing shells, but it doesn’t penetrate!

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:18.233
It’s another story with APCR, they can penetrate anything.

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:22.100
Who uses APCR with a BL-10 though?

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:30.867
A cast iron turret and good angles allow the Super Pershing to be comfortable behind hills.

00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:36.567
On Himmelsdorf, it can simply stick out its turret… and fire!

00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:40.900
Most of the enemies won’t be able to do a thing!

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.333
Within the entire tier, only the Super Pershing and the T32 can manage this.

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:52.667
Well, the T-32, with its turret and elevation angles, can do this.

00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:55.667
But nobody can do THIS!

00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:05.500
In reality, the Super Pershing’s front plates were made from the sides of a knocked out Panther.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.700
And they were made with several layers.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.500
And we mean several.

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:18.400
If you calculate the effective armor on its upper front plate, it comes out at a daunting 300 mm!

00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:26.500
It’s impossible to calculate it more accurately, but one thing is clear, it’s one of the thickest in Tier VIII!

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.067
But there’s a catch.

00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:34.167
Isn’t that like having a top quality barbecue and living in Greenland?

00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:41.500
I mean, how often are you hit on your upper front plate?

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.133
Once or twice a month?

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:48.067
Even the beginners know that the most vulnerable spot is the lower plate!

00:04:48.167 --> 00:04:50.300
Usually…

00:04:51.767 --> 00:04:53.367
Not for the Pershing!

00:04:53.467 --> 00:04:58.833
The lower plate is made in the same way as the upper one, so it’s almost as strong.

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:01.633
This armor knows no equal!

00:05:01.733 --> 00:05:05.200
Well, you won’t fool the more experienced players.

00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:16.467
But the first move of many players is to fire at the lower plate!

00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:19.700
No penetration, what a surprise.

00:05:20.033 --> 00:05:24.767
Remember that the Pershing has a hard face and a soft behind.

00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:31.567
The armor is what makes the Pershing a real frontline tank.

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:36.100
Yes, this is a medium tank, but it does a heavy tank’s job.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.833
Think that’s strange?

00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:42.700
However, it’s easy to explain: the Super Pershing is pretty heavy!

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.967
You can’t really call it a medium.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.167
All characteristics shout that it’s heavy.

00:05:59.367 --> 00:06:03.267
There are some other paradoxes like that in World of Tanks.

00:06:10.467 --> 00:06:17.967
For example, the Super Pershing is a medium tank as much as the FCM is a heavy tank.

00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:21.433
The only thing medium about the Super Pershing is its gun.

00:06:21.533 --> 00:06:24.433
And it’s unbelievably normal.

00:06:24.533 --> 00:06:28.033
It’s strange to see something so standard on a tank like this!

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.133
Average aiming speed, average accuracy, average alpha: a standard medium tank.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.533
But a Pershing isn’t a Pershing if there isn’t anything to show off!

00:06:38.633 --> 00:06:41.633
One little thing: penetration!

00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:47.767
There’s a big difference between the characteristics of AP and APCR shells.

00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:55.800
AP shells manage 170 mm, and APCR go much further: 258!

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.067
That’s really impressive.

00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:01.900
And enough for any enemy the Super Pershing might encounter.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.767
The worst case is a Tier IX enemy.

00:07:04.933 --> 00:07:07.833
It’s meant to be placed at the forefront.

00:07:11.167 --> 00:07:16.733
Tease the enemy with its face, and take 3 to 4 thousand damage, that’s its role in battle.

00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:19.800
Don’t be too creative, simply face the enemy.

00:07:20.233 --> 00:07:22.633
No diamonds, or angled positions.

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:27.100
You are going to be hit in the tracks before you find the right position.

00:07:32.967 --> 00:07:35.300
Well, it won’t hold the front alone.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.633
But be honest, who can?

00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:44.067
Just remember that if you need someone to distract enemies and absorb damage, that’s the Pershing.

00:07:44.433 --> 00:07:49.300
It’s among the few tanks which you can almost call “impenetrable”

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.200
What a shame it will never meet the Bat.-Châtillon!
