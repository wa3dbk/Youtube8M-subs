I'm Cooie Grey-Lavin, and in this clip I'm
going to show you how to decorate a bare wall

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.180
or fence in your yard. In my yard I had an
old shed that the side needed painting, it

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.630
was weathered. And before I painted it, I
realized I also had a collection of bird baths

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.079
just, or bird houses, I'm sorry, just sitting
around. A lot of times, when there's just

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:28.359
one of things, one of things sitting there,
it's not as eye catching as if there's a collection.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.719
So, rather than paint the wall, I decided
to hang all of my bird houses on the one wall

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:41.929
and give it more of a dramatic effect. So,
I've sort of placed the nails where I want

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:47.050
them, playing around with the different colors
and the different shaped of the bird houses.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.640
A friend of mine makes the bird houses and
ends up putting spoons and old pieces of molding,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:06.310
and old roofing on it.
Put on there. I like some with a little color

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:20.140
just to add a little something different.
There are some great little shapes.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:31.340
A simple wood one with old nails in the side
of it, old square nails.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:39.400
Door knobs.
Another painted one. And some of them are

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:50.090
harder to hang, so I just added a little chain
to the back, makes it easier.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:02:02.090
Another guy right here; one more little one.
And now my old, unpainted side of the shed

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.580
has, is interesting and houses all my bird
houses. I used bird houses in this particular

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:17.860
instance, but you can use stained glass, ceramic,
pieces of old plates or pot lids anything

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.890
that you have a collection of.
