Hello there! I'm Alex, welcome to Pause/Break
Reviews!

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.060
Today, in our first episode,
we are going to be looking at an undiscovered

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.180
gem in the NES library.
A little game, known as Mr. Gimmick - by Sunsoft.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.420
In Mr. Gimmick, you take the role of... well,
Mr. Gimmick.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.239
-Pssst! If you look like THIS you can call
him Yumetaró!

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.940
Anyway, so you're given to a little girl as
a birthday present, and you quickly become

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.101
her favourite toy.
Of course, the other toys become jealous.

00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:48.840
Hmm... Toys getting jealous of other toys,
eh?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.170
That reminds me of a kid's film I saw once,
yeah, what was it called?

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:06.380
No, no, don't tell me, it's on the tip of
my tongue...

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.540
Alalalalala~

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.862
...Oh yeah, the Christmas toy!

00:01:09.862 --> 00:01:10.862
[ESCAPE FROM THE CITY SPED UP]

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:16.369
Anyway, the other toys get jealous and, uhh...
kidnap the girl and take her to another dimension...

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.980
Was it really necessary to kidnap her? She
literally had the new toy for less than a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.610
day.
I think it's understandable that she gave

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.690
it more attention than them. Cut her some
slack.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.080
Oh well.
As Mr. Gimmick, it's your duty to go through

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.360
six action packed levels, and bring back your
girl.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.869
So what's it like?
Well, Mr. Gimmick is a game that you play.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.140
Sometimes it can be also a game you watch
someone else play.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.989
But most of the time it's a game that you
DON'T play because it only came out in Japan

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:50.180
and motherfucking Scandinavia, and the only
guy on eBay selling it wants £400 for the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.539
cartridge alone, GOD DAMMI--

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.450
Yeah, Mr. Gimmick is a rare game. It came
out in 1992, near the end of the NES's life

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.229
cycle, so I guess Sunsoft just thought it
wouldn't be worth releasing anywhere other

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.899
than those territories.
But to be honest, they really should've, because

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.310
of all it did with the NES.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.900
The soundtrack is one of the first things
that hits you about the game.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.690
Lots of people think this game has a special
sound chip in, kinda like the Japanese version

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.110
of Castlevania 3 and Lagrange point, and they're
right for the Japanese version!

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.240
But just like Batman: Return of the Joker
and Gremlins 2, (other games made by Sunsoft),

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.431
in the European version, the composer just
used the Digital PCM sampler channel for the

00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:33.550
bass, (rather than drums or anything,) and
rearranged how the game was composed to create

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.050
a rich sound not found in any other games.
(However, the Japanese version DOES have a

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.050
few extra sound channels!)

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.840
The gameplay is great too!
Gimmick attacks by charging up stars from

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.120
his horn and throwing them at enemies.
But the most interesting thing is that the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.360
star has an actual physics engine!
In fact... pretty much everything in this

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.610
game does!
Everything feels weighted and as if they follow

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.810
the same laws of physics as you do, which
is absolutely genius for an NES game!

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.720
Take that, Half Life 2! You're nowhere near
as revolutionary as everyone says!

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.730
You and your Gabe Newell, and-- and your...
your... Secret Sauce Engine?

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.170
The only problem I have with Mr. Gimmick's
gameplay is its difficulty. I feel the game

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.320
expects WAAAAYYY too much of you to reach
the good ending.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.100
First off, in each level there's a hidden
treasure that gives you a ton of points. And

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.480
that usually involves you jumping across platforms,
doing some wicked star bouncing, oooorrr riding

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.830
a cannonball.
Now I said there are only 6 levels, but that's

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.100
because most people only ever see 6. You need
all of the treasures to enter Stage 7 where

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.000
the real final boss is. But if you get ONE
game over during the game, and trust me, the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.850
game is pretty hard itself, you've automatically
lost the way to get into Stage 7 unless you

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.931
start again.
And so you get the BAD ending, where Mr. Gimmick

00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:52.650
doesn't get any poontang that night!

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.390
Mr. Gimmick may not have the quick paced challenge
that games like Probotector or Ninja Gaiden

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.950
are known for, but I would have to say that
if you want the good ending, it is just as

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.810
challenging, if not more so.
But that challenge is definitely worth it.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.590
There are tons of little features that really
bring Gimmick to live.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.690
You stand in this part of Level 1, there are
these fully animated fish that never appear

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.019
again.
Or in Stage 2, there are these seagulls - again,

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.569
never appear other than here.
Look at this guy.

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:28.139
Look how well animated he is!
For an NES game that's pretty outstanding.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:35.250
And this kind of thing comes through the WHOOOOLE
game.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.570
So what are my thoughts on Mr. Gimmick overall?
The gameplay is tight, engaging, technically

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.770
amazing, and challenging without EVER being
unfair;

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.080
The music is great and crisp and punchy,
and the whole thing constantly pushes the

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.000
limits of what the NES is capable of!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.330
Go play it! Mr. Gimmick is a bundle of fun
that not many people have played, and I want

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.710
to fix that! So, if you don't feel like forking
out some cash, grab an Emulator and pirate

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.630
it!
Go on, but don't say it was me who told you

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.960
to...

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.160
Thank you very much for watching, seriously,
it means a lot to me.
