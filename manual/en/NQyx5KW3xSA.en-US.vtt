Hi! today we'll make this nice ornaments for the Christmas tree

00:00:02.397 --> 00:00:09.397
stay with me and subscribe to my channel

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:20.666
cut a frame using framelits one bigger than the other

00:00:26.936 --> 00:00:32.067
in my case I'm using Fantasy framelits but you can do this

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:37.937
with other framelits or cutting with scissors

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:43.167
on a beige cardstock stamp the design you want with white ink

00:00:43.167 --> 00:00:47.607
in my case I have chosen a reindeer that will

00:00:47.607 --> 00:00:50.747
combine so well with my ornament... as an additional detail

00:00:50.747 --> 00:00:56.787
I'm going to stamp again the reindeer on a white cardstock using red ink

00:00:56.787 --> 00:01:03.787
then I'll cut the sweater and I'll glue it on top of the other one

00:01:07.647 --> 00:01:14.647
ink the frame borders with your blending tool and hazelnut ink

00:01:26.117 --> 00:01:33.117
cut also the reindeer

00:01:38.157 --> 00:01:44.037
dress the reindeer with the sweater you just cut

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:48.347
cut also a background using the bigger framelits

00:01:48.347 --> 00:01:53.507
you used to cut the frame

00:01:53.507 --> 00:02:00.507
apply some snow stamps on the background using white ink

00:02:06.086 --> 00:02:10.717
put the frame on top of the background and make a hole

00:02:10.717 --> 00:02:17.717
to hang it

00:02:19.216 --> 00:02:26.216
then put some foam pads on the frame's back and glue it on the background

00:02:35.586 --> 00:02:42.586
using more foam pads glue the reindeer in the middle of the frame

00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:49.096
pass a ribbon through the hole and make a knot to hang

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:50.667
the ornament

00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:55.586
finally glue a tie

00:02:55.586 --> 00:03:00.816
changing the paper colors and ribbons of your ornaments

00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:03.736
you'll get wonderful reindeer to decorate your tree this Christmas

00:03:03.736 --> 00:03:06.686
