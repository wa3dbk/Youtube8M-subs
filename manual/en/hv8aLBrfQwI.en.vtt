00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.840
Hey beardlovers.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.840
Still in London.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.170
And I still haven't found my whale.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.260
But I've decided today to go right to the
source.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.710
The reason this whole thing began.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.170
What set this whole adventure in motion.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.170
The reason I'm here!

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.170
Hello.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.170
Mommy?

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.550
I still haven't found my whale.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.380
I still haven't found my whale.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.609
So then after I was done crying on the phone
to my mommy for a while, I decided to go right

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.930
to the source of the reason that I'm here
in London.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:27.930
Michael Phelps.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.939
You see, a little while ago, my whale, a mammal
of the water, was good buds with another mammal

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.600
of the water, Olympic gold medalist Michael
Phelps.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.050
Seriously, look at my old videos.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.550
They really were best buds along with David
Hasselhoff.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.550
Seriously.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.550
Just look it up!

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.550
Alright, so enough wading around...

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.660
How do I dive into a convo with the Phelpster?

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.050
Guess i shouldn't hold my breath.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.170
It's not like he floats around information
to anyone other than his pool of friends.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.079
As if he just logs on to a livestream, waves
and says, 'Hello entire world.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.730
At the stroke of midnight I'm gonna cap off
the night at Dunkin Donuts.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.150
Maybe I'll have some cheesy dip.'

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.930
Nah, this plan doesn't hold water.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.550
How do I wet his whistle without risking going
off the deep end?

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.659
I guess I just have to take the plunge.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.950
Rather than goggle from afar, I should start
training.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.899
Be part of the rising tide of Olympic contenders.

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.869
Then I could be kept abreast of Michael Phelps'
whereabouts.

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.590
Alright, enough treading water.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.280
I'm heading over to the Team USA house.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.450
Right here in London.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.170
Soak up some information.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.469
So I went to the Team USA house where they
seem to be overly tolerant of graffiti.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.779
The coffee was done, though, and I loved it.

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:28.420
Then I sensed something behind me.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.380
A presence I haven't felt since ... oh, it
was just a picture of Michael Phelps.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.709
Jenn Suhr talked about winning a friggin'
gold medal for woman's pole vault.

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:36.310
And I was overcome with emotion.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.810
Then later I was overcome with emotion again
because I found the free food bar.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.939
Then I went and ate some.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.639
At first I was very disappointed in these
rowing teams until I realized this was a photo

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:45.639
and not a window.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.219
Then I spotted something suspicious.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:48.219
What was that?

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.139
The resemblance to the top of a whale was
uncanny.

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:51.299
And what's worse, it was being hunted.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.159
It seemed like Mr. Getty Images had some explaing
to do.

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.450
Very suspicious, Getty.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.939
You'll get yours alright.

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.849
Or maybe I'll just walk away and forget I
ever saw this.

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:00.899
Then it was time to get talky with an Olympian.

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.579
- My name is Chris Coleman.

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.479
And I competed in four-man bobsled.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.569
- How could a 31-year old unathletic man like
myself get into the Olympics?

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.049
- You probably should have started about a
good 10, 15 years ago.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.049
- Time machine.

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.129
- Yeah, you gotta get into a time machine.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.129
Okay?

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.129
- Okay.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.129
- Head back in time.

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.129
Then start training hard.

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.970
- So you're telling me it's going to be a
lot of work no matter what.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.700
- There's no easy way into the Olympic Games.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.700
I'm sorry.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.590
- Have you hung out with Michael Phelps at
all?

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.299
- I have not hung out with Michael Phelps.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.299
- Okay.

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.060
Because he's the one who's probably got the
whale.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.060
So....

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.370
So if I was going to be on Team USA, I had
to train.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.310
I headed to the nearest track to begin.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.310
What's my sport?

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.310
Hurdles.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.790
Since I can obviously jump really fast to
conclusions.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.849
Too tall.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:42.909
Too tall.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.030
Do a shorter one.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.030
Hmm.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.209
Might need a little work.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.379
YouTube sensation Hannah Hart showed me how
it's done.

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.190
I can't compete with that excellence.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.129
So then I decided to try the hurdles without
hurdles.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:01.299
Also known as running.

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.659
But I forgot to bring a pillow so later I
got a sore neck.

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:04.659
Geez.

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:05.659
Who goes running without a pillow?

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.130
I'm too much of an idiot for this event.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.769
So then I decided to try exerball.

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.349
But before I did that I had to talk to the
reigning contemporary exerball champion, Sean

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.349
Klitzner.

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.150
- The tip is don't suck.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.150
- Okay.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.120
Because then the air comes out of the ball?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.120
- Yeah yeah yeah.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.090
You want to keep them fully inflated.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.000
- Okay.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.730
I'm doing it.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.549
Three exerballs!

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.459
- Oh.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.370
- Yeah!

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.190
Five balls.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.099
- Yeah!

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.019
- Yes!

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.019
Exerball was a failure too.

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.459
But if it's any consolation that's actually
not a real sport.

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.590
This was going nowhere.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.239
So I went back to talk to...

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.149
- Jenn Suhr
Olympic gold medalist in...

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:56.310
- Pole vault
Who should be helpful because...

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.310
- Did you know that I pole-vaulted in high
school?

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.310
- Really?

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.310
- Yeah.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.310
- Really?

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.310
- I got about, I think, ten... ten and a half
feet.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.310
How did you do?

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.709
- I got about 15.7
Okay, pole vault isn't my sport either.

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:06.930
New gameplan.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.605
- You, as a pole vaulter, have a unique high
vantage point in London.

00:04:13.605 --> 00:04:14.605
- Yes.

00:04:14.605 --> 00:04:15.605
- Have you seen any whales while you've been
up there?

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:16.605
- You know, it's kinda crazy you say that
because I actually... on my second to last

00:04:16.605 --> 00:04:18.519
jump, I thought I saw something.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.519
- What?

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.519
Where?

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.519
Was it in the stands or...?

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.519
- No.

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:24.110
He was, like, over beyond the stadium.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.110
- North?

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.110
South?

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.110
Which direction?

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.110
- Like south-southwest.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.110
- Okay, I gotta go.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.110
And so the journey continues.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.110
Or should I say, To Be Continued...s.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.120
Or something.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:48.490
While I'm narrating, allow me to narrate at
you that my band Driftless Pony Club has some

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.490
shows coming up.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.930
One this Thursday in Chicago.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.580
Click on that picture to go to the website
for more info.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.580
Wow.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.250
There's a car alarm during my narration.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.430
Also I've started a daily vlog on WheezyNews.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.280
Click on that to go to the first vlog.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.900
And you should check out these awesome people.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.010
Super Jackal Hawk Tiger Explosion.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.710
Team Wheezy Waiter.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.670
Super Jackal Hawk Tiger Explosion.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.120
Team Wheezy Waiter.
