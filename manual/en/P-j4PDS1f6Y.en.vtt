Hi I'm Tim Gipson and I'm going to talk to
you about how to buy a pressure washer. Now

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.440
when you are looking to invest on a pressure
washer it really depends on what type of jobs

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.960
that you are typically going to do and how
we classify that is from light occasional

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.779
jobs to medium size all the way up to heavy
duty jobs and to give you some examples if

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.380
a light duty job would be if you have minimal
amount of vinyl siding or trim on your house

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.370
just spraying off doors something that you
do just occasionally and maybe just kind of

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.960
small areas around the house as far as your
aggregate or your entry ways something you

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.480
can just do occasionally. Some medium sized
jobs would be spraying a complete driveway

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.569
down in preparation for sealing it, doing
large fences, spraying those down so depending

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:00.790
on what type of use you are going to get out
of your pressure washer will determine what

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.110
type. There are two types that when you go
to the store and look. There is an electric

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.620
type such as this small one here and they
are typically rated anywhere from about 1,500

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.720
to 1,800 PSI so that is pounds per square
inch, that is the amount of pressure they'll

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.960
put out and they'll have two kind of one's.
They'll have a turbo one which uses a very

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.760
tight pattern but it just files you around
and allows you to clean and it also has a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.680
variable wand on it that will allow you to
adjust it to spray from a soap all the way

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.681
up to a higher pressure fan spray. It does
run a lot on electricity and typically it

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:43.050
will have some kind of a detergent tank built
in to them. If you are using a lot of or have

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.280
a lot of larger jobs that you are doing then
a gas powered would be the next step up and

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.160
this particular one actually goes up to 2550
PSI so it means you have a lot more pressure

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.460
and it is going to give you a lot better cleaning
ability. It is going to be much faster than

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.440
the electric sprayer. This is something you
are going to want to use on your larger applications

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.209
such as a driveway or if you have got an entire
house that you want to spray down. It will

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:25.890
come with various wands, this particular one
it has a soaping wand, it has a 15 degree,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:34.400
a 40 degree and 0 degree. A 0 degree and the
number of tips and the type of tips that you

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.480
get again really depends on the type of job
that you are going to do. So again as far

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.841
as when you are looking at investing in a
pressure washer if you just do occasional

00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:48.870
light jobs then the electrical one is going
to be fine for most of your applications.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.939
If you get into this medium duty or occasionally
some heavy or larger jobs then investing in

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:00.889
a gas powered one would be your better choice.
I'm Tim Gipson and that is how to buy a pressure

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:00.949
washer.
