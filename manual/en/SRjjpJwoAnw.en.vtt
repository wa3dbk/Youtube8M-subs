00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.230
Vsauce, I’m Jake and I’ve been playing
a lot of the game Super Smash Bros recently

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.980
especially as the character Kirby who is known
for his ability to inhale and ingest things

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.210
a lot larger than himself.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.570
And that got me thinking about our own bodies,
the way they digest and their limits when

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.109
it comes to shoveling food into them which
brings up the question...How Much Can You

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.019
Eat?

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.999
Our bodies are full of surprises.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.781
Actions and processes that are always happening
that we aren’t entirely conscious of, for

00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:40.579
example the incredible functions of saliva.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.960
Let’s go to the bar.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.469
On average, you make 2 to 4 pints of saliva
a day or about a half gallon.

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.339
If you’ve ever eaten something acidic like
a pickle, you might have noticed that more

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.100
saliva enters your mouth, this is because
your mouth is trying to dilute the acidity

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.360
to protect you.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.699
Or when you eat bread you’ll notice it starts
to get sweet.

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.000
That’s the saliva breaking starch down into
sugar for your body to use.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
When you say something melts in your mouth,
it’s probably because of saliva.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.110
It also has histatins in it which speed up
the healing of wounds.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.650
Fun fact: sugar isn’t bad for your teeth,
it’s the metabolites that are created by

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.610
bacteria feeding on the sugar in your mouth
that are bad

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.220
It’s weird how you’re probably more aware
now of saliva currently in your mouth since

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.360
we started to taco bout it.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.020
Did somebody say “Taco”?

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.680
Oh, hey Taco Tammy!

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.680
Hey Jake!

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.500
Did you know that not only do you have taste
receptors in your mouth, but also in your

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.500
stomach, voice box and esophagus?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.890
This is true, but thankfully the only ones
that talk to our brain are the ones on our

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.890
tongue.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.340
Or did you know that your stomach digests
itself?

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.950
Yup, your stomach lining replaces itself every
3 days.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.980
Or did you know…

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.020
Don’t do it, Jake.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.300
Don’t eat the talking taco.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.500
It’s just the hunger hormone or Ghrelin
being released in your stomach due to the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.110
visual stimulation of a giant delicious taco.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.810
Forgive me.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.860
Jake, no, noooooooooooo!

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.690
How our stomachs digest food was a mystery
until 1822.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.760
Dr. William Beaumont treated a man who had
accidentally been shot in the stomach.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.110
He survived but Beaumont was unable to close
the hole in his stomach, giving him a window

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.860
into the digestive process.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.950
He would place food through the hole, take
out gastric acid for sampling, and even put

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.040
food and other objects into test tubes with
the acid to see how the stomach would digest

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.040
it.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.980
(Pull out from anatomy model) What he discovered
was that digestion was more of a chemical

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.370
process than a mechanical one.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.770
All, this talk of gastric acid and digestion
is making me hungry, are you hungry?

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.240
Oh still got some salsa on me.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.110
Come with me.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.810
Our stomachs can hold around 3 to 4 liters
of stuff.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.540
If you try and put more than that, your body
will tell you to stop and if you don’t it

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.040
will finally just make you throw up.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.080
But can you die from eating too much?

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.630
Yes...kind of, if you ingest a lot of sodium
bicarbonate.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.410
The people who have died from a stomach explosion
did so because they were incredibly full of

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:22.680
food and had ingested too much baking soda/alka-seltzer,
which reacts with the acid, creating gas and

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.790
causing them to burst.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:32.720
I’m sure you’ve done experiments with
vinegar and baking soda in a ziploc bag.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.580
But then there are people like legendary eater
Charles Domery.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.569
In one day Domery ate 10 pounds of raw beef,
4 pounds of raw cow udders, 2 pounds of candles

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.850
and 3 large bottles of beer, a total of 20lbs.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.880
In the 1790s he was in the Prussian Army during
the War of the First Coalition against France

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.310
but ended up deserting and joining the French
military since their food rations were larger.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.440
Then there are professional eaters like Takeru
Kobayashi who ate 18 pounds of cow brains

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.020
in 15 minutes.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.040
Now that might seem like a weird thing to
eat, but people have eaten weirder.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:16.739
Pica is a disorder where you crave and eat
nonfood items like dirt, paper, metal and

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.239
chalk.

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.259
Michael Lotito was famous for eating things
you generally wouldn’t.

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:33.169
He ate a 15 pound bicycle, a coffin and, over
the course of 2 years, an airplane.

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.020
Luckily he just ate airplanes and not people.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.979
Kuru is a very rare disease that attacks the
nervous system and one that you can generally

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.999
only get from eating human brain tissue.

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:49.819
It came about in the tribal regions of Papua
New Guinea where people would cannibalize

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.189
their dead relatives during funeral rites.

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:56.219
So don’t eat human brains...or just don’t
eat people.

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:57.620
Remember Charles Domery?

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.120
He tried eating the leg of a shipmate who
had it blown off in a sea battle.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.469
Hunger can you make you do crazy things, but
our bodies are always protecting us.

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:10.680
In general, it wont let us eat so much that
we explode and will try to protect us when

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.889
we put harmful things in it.

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.639
We can’t swallow as much as Kirby but Kirby
has another characteristic - when he inhales

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.720
people he can also absorb their traits...and
that is very similar to what we do with food.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.610
We absorb the nutrients, the pieces necessary
to keep our bodies moving, our brains functioning,

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.350
our stomachs digesting and our saliva flowing.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:42.090
All these little pieces come together to make
us work so you could say that you are what

00:05:42.090 --> 00:06:15.000
you eat...which is even more true if you eat
people...and as always...thanks for watching!
