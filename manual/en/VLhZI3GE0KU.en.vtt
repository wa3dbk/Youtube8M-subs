00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:12.259
A pre-recently we have covered some Chinese
character strokes. So namely they are "dian",

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:29.430
"heng"; "shu", "pie"; "na". So that horizontal,
vertical; left slant and right slant strokes.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:38.890
So example for "dian" and since we covered
some letters; some numbers here we have number

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:53.399
6 that use 3 dots, 3 "dian". And horizontal
and vertical together makes the number 10

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:03.039
and then we have 7 that starts with a horizontal
and then a vertical with a bend. And 8 is

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:16.030
a good example for both "pie" and "na"; left
slant and right slant strokes. So that's left

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:28.740
and right strokes; right slant strokes, that's
8; "ba", "liu"; "shi", "qi"; "ba" and here

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:39.980
next we are going to talk about more strokes
that's; we have 1 2 3 4 5 here and the basic

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:49.980
strokes in Chinese characters we use 8 of
them, so 3 more strokes. But these 3 more

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:58.000
strokes in different angles could be a little
bit more introduction than these basic strokes

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.890
that we covered then; "dian", "heng"; "shu";
"pie", "na".
