00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.990
Ok, on this section, on the step nine of the
breast stroke, I'm going to end up explaining

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.160
to you how to. Right, so you are back on prayer
position from step eight. Your legs were up

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.120
to your butt, you were getting prepared to
kick. Now, this section, if you can kind of

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.090
take a full body angle. All right. So you're
right here on step eight. When you are getting

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.710
prepared to kick, as you are doing the half
circle and kicking, you are going to end up

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.410
slicing through the water on step nine. So
you're repeating and you are continuing with

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.430
the breast stroke. And you are going to put
your head back in the water after you took

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.661
a breath. So, after I explain that, the reason
that you want to do that is because when you

00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:44.540
came up from step seven, the half circle.
And you are slicing into the water, you want

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.600
to have your head in so your body looks like
this when you are gliding. And so you are

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.510
just that more aerodynamic, and you can just
go that much more quicker, and its less effort

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.510
on your part. That's the main reason why you
do that. So again, step seven was like this.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.239
You come up half, your legs come up. And as
your legs begin to kick, you're going to be

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.260
in prayer position from step eight and slice
in with step nine with your head in. And that

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.350
is your full complete breast stroke. And thats
what you would do for step nine of breast

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.770
stroke. So you'll start off. You'll slice
into the water. You'll pull. And as you pull

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.400
thats when you'll be gliding with your feet
together. So as you watch me do it, just pay

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.670
attention to that. Every time I come up for
a breath, my legs are straight out. And when

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.130
I'm putting my hands back together in a prayer
position, slicing into the water, that's when

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.270
I kick. And with that kick I'm able to slice
and glide for a while. And then I'll come

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:58.810
back up for some air. So here we go. And then
I'll come back this way. And if you guys do

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.759
it just in that movement, you'll see that
I don't have to like actually struggle as

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:17.090
much. And I can still move quite a distance.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.959
And if you noticed, every time I brought my
legs together and closed, I waited for a while.

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.870
Because that extra three to five seconds,
you're actually able to ride that glide a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.959
little bit more than cutting yourself short
and working double.
