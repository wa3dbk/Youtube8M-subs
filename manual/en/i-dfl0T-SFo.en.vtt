00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.920
BERLIN is huge

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.320
Part 1 : Public Transport

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.239
Indeed my friend this place is big

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.739
Berlin is nearly the size of New York and
most of all it's like ten times the size

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.109
of my beloved Paris in france

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.789
so how do you move around

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.519
in such a big city ? the answer stands in two
words : Public Transport ! Here are

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.069
the ten things you have to know to get
moving in the capital. Let's go !

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:32.810
Ticket vending machines

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.230
FAHRKARTEN

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.140
Big red machines

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.080
located in most stations

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.020
touchscreen

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.490
Instructions available in many languages

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.490
They can provide any tickets you like
if you do have the cash... yep, credit cards

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.730
are not always supported !

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.010
TWO ! Validate your ticket

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.759
Fairly new for me, but you do have to validate
your ticket

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:56.399
for the train and the subway. You have to do it at least once if it is a several days ticket...

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.970
Don't forget, or fine you will get ! Three !
One ticket to rule them all ! Tickets

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.610
can be used to travel across all public
transportation : subway, trains, buses, tram

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.970
and ferries. They call it : the german
efficiency

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.950
Four ! One card to rule them all

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.060
But if you stay a few days in Berlin

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.410
You gotta pick one of these "WELCOME CARD". I know you don't want to be

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.420
called a tourist, but come on, it's worth it !

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.980
Five ! From and to the airport. There's one
airport in the north : "Berlin TEGEL"

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.570
It has no link with subway or train, so you got to take a bus or a cab.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.689
Another one in the south, BERLIN SCHONEFELD easy to reach from the city with the train.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.350
Discounters

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.590
this way !

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.409
six ! "S-BAHN"

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.900
SBAHN is the railway system as known as the urban train.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.500
It has a green logo and red trains.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.440
Useful to move fast and above the ground

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.480
Seven !

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.580
"UBAHN" the subway of Berlin. It has a blue logo and yellow trains.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.290
Usually moves underground

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.140
very useful

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.670
to travel locally

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.180
Eight ! The ring ! Berlin is surrounded by
two SBAHN railroads. The S41 line

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.700
which is running clockwise, and the S42 line which is going counter clockwise.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.979
So useful to go to the other side of the
city in no time

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:19.819
Nine ! HAUPTBAHNHOF : Biggest station in
BERLIN.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.669
huge brand new station.

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.069
city centered. Connections between the SBAHN and the UBAHN.

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.169
Very useful to go to any airport or any place in Germany.

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:35.029
Ten. Bikes. You gotta grab a bike. Every
berliner has one. They can even be carried

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:39.040
on marked cars in trains, subway and tram.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.339
Well that's it.

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:44.769
i think now you are ready to face it. In the
next part of "BERLIN IS HUGE" I will

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.239
reveal the secret places I have been to.

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.489
Thank you guys for watching. See you
around. Bye bye.
