[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:07.170
FELICIA: Where is my soap?

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:07.820
Where's my soap?

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:08.630
PJ: I haven't seen the soap.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.035
I saw the show.

00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:09.900
FELICIA: PJ, you're
dead to me.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.300
PJ: I haven't seen the soap.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.310
FELICIA: What about you guys?

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.340
Soap?

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.330
I don't even know what
you're doing.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.276
[SIGH].

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:18.587
Pens, oh god.

00:00:18.587 --> 00:00:22.580
There's got to be soaps in
one of these things.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.308
Oh, T-shirts.

00:00:24.308 --> 00:00:25.800
Oh, "Tabletop" mugs.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.530
"Tabletop" mugs.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.144
Oh, they're signed.

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:31.088
No soap.

00:00:31.088 --> 00:00:34.490
No soap.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.410
No soap.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.470
Oh, hey guys.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.880
So I guess you probably saw
"The Flog" yesterday

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.040
where I made soap.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.280
Where's the soap?

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.340
There is soap somewhere in this
office, this Geek and

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.970
Sundry office.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:47.830
I am going to find it.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.550
Kevin?

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.900
Intern Kevin, do you
see this sign?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.580
KEVIN: Yeah.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.440
FELICIA: Yeah.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.500
This is the integrity of
our company right now.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.045
Where is my soap?

00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:57.306
KEVIN: In your bathroom?

00:00:57.306 --> 00:00:58.238
FELICIA: Danielle?

00:00:58.238 --> 00:00:59.170
DANIELLE: Hi.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.085
FELICIA: Hello, do
you see this?

00:01:00.085 --> 00:01:00.456
DANIELLE: Yeah.

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:01.980
FELICIA: There's a thing called
a "Flog." Have you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.440
heard of it?

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.990
It's my show.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.939
DANIELLE: I love "The Flog."

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:05.400
FELICIA: Yeah, thank you.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.850
Where's my soap?

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.740
DANIELLE: I don't know.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.780
FELICIA: Where's my soap?

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.365
DANIELLE: I don't know.

00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:09.360
FELICIA: Where is my soap?

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.142
DANIELLE: I don't know
where the soap is.

00:01:11.142 --> 00:01:12.084
I'm sorry.

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:14.440
FELICIA: OK.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.940
OK.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.650
Let's do a schedule.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.115
No soap, no soap, no
soap, no soap.

00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:18.846
KIM: Excuse me.

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:20.340
FELICIA: Where is
my soap, Kim?

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.840
KIM: I don't have it.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.710
I don't know where it is.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.612
I don't have any soap.

00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:23.338
FELICIA: OK.

00:01:23.338 --> 00:01:24.790
Yeah.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.758
Get out of here.

00:01:25.758 --> 00:01:27.008
Sheri.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.200
Nick, where's my soap?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.045
NICK: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:36.090
FELICIA: Where is the soap?

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.570
Do you have it?

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.696
Hey, Neil.

00:01:39.696 --> 00:01:40.552
Hey.

00:01:40.552 --> 00:01:41.220
NEIL: Hi.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.320
FELICIA: Where's my soap?

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.240
NEIL: Nick had it last.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.020
FELICIA: Nick?

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.470
NEIL: Yeah.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.170
FELICIA: Nick?

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.956
NICK: I have not seen it.

00:01:46.956 --> 00:01:48.492
FELICIA: Don't be
on the phone.

00:01:48.492 --> 00:01:49.747
Where's my soap?

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.050
OK, so I have looked
everywhere.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.090
I have.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.480
I can't find it.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.040
Brit, do you have the soap?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.570
I don't know if I believe
that camera shake.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.500
OK, that one, more emphatic.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.920
All right, Brian.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.729
Brian does all our production.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.860
He's new.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.110
So I can go like this.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.716
We do not have the soap for the
soap making "Flog" that

00:02:17.716 --> 00:02:18.630
went up yesterday.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.505
Where would that soap be?

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:20.730
BRIAN: So you lost it?

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.800
FELICIA: I didn't lose it.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.770
It was in this office

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.920
BRIAN: How would it-- we just
moved into this office.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.230
FELICIA: Well, it was at the old
office and then it moved

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.460
and somebody-- somebody--

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.590
somebody did--

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.455
it's somewhere.

00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:31.600
BRIAN: But you moved
the stuff.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.600
FELICIA: I don't know.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.690
I wasn't there.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.110
I was in Jamaica.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.670
BRIAN: Wow.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.470
FELICIA: It's a long story.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.180
It was really great.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.090
I drank so much rum.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.590
Anyway, where's my soap?

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.610
BRIAN: I don't believe
in soap.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.475
I don't use soap.

00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:42.460
I don't use toothpaste.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.380
I don't use deodorant.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.550
I don't use shampoo.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.640
FELICIA: OK, guys, well, you saw
that I searched the Geek

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.280
and Sundry office.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.290
I abused everyone who
works for me.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.597
And we didn't find it.

00:02:53.597 --> 00:02:53.984
Dammit.

00:02:53.984 --> 00:02:56.190
Who could possibly
have that soap?

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.830
Cubby!

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.660
You ate the soap!

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.280
Aw, it's OK.
