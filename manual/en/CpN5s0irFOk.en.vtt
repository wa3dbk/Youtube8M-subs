00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.700
It was a demonstration car from the beginning so it is only the outer shell that is saved by the cosmetic then

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.300
 it's full cage on the inside

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:28.660
with an American drive train, then I have used Audi 5 cylinder 20 valve engine.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.660
- Jens made the best known of the earlier black S4, which was highly praised. But he wanted more and one

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.780
 day he decided to sell it and build on an Audi A5

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.960
With the help of friends they found the A5 in Germany at the right price, which quickly slaughtered 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.660
and the only thing that remains of the original is the husk.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.300
But the old Audi engine did not work out as planned in the new automatic transmission.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:04.180
We didnt get it all together as we where planning with the converter, it is difficult with small motor and a lot of

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:11.400
power to get it set up in the start. So it was clutch and liberty box after that. 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.660
2013 was the first year we ran with clutch and manuel transmission.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.840
- So its time to check whats under the hood, when the red carpet is rolled out 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:35.740
If we start with the engine it is a 5 cylinder 20 valve engine, methanol is from the early 90's

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:48.820
With a new turbo Borg Warner 82mm. The last time we drove at Tierp Arena so gave it around 1350 hp.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:22.660
Leandersclutch 3 lamellar, Liberty gearbox 5 speed that is clutchfree. Then it's a Ford 9-inch rear axle.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.520
Aftermarket stuff with prisma, banjo and stuff like that

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.920
- The intake manifold seems extremely large?

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.320
Yes it is converted to 5mm aluminum! the former one was made of 3mm and redesigned with single throttle

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:45.140
we got to do it for the burst of pressure, it becomes so when you load 4 kg.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.760
- And everything is not always flawless as everyone knows.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:57.080
It was in Tierp last race when the crankshaft broke so it was a little extra work otherwise it has been together

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.180
together really well, last season so it went well without breakdowns. But then, it's not gone really well at all 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:20.020
all competitions. For it might have been able to perform better, that's cause the driver who has not been the best

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.340
- Why is it then?

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.100
It will be well, lesson one has to know the car now that is pretty beginners

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.860
- Beginner?

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.200
Yes competitors've been driving for over 20 years 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.680
- What is the biggest difference driving drag racing series and not as before on the street?

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:51.780
It started out with Bilsports events on the strip then you move on up. but it is more competitive now and then 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:02.460
then it's a price range on everything and more and more expensive it becomes.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.380
- But how far should you go now, are you happy with the car at this level or should you climb even higher?

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:20.580
There is nothing that is firm but probably I want to climb higher up. But right now, I'll keep it and continue 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.840
- It has gone well so far last year, he took home the Swedish championship in his class, and this year 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.720
he came second

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.460
And this weekend is approaching UmeÃ¥ Open where hopefully waiting for a trophy after some fine-tuning.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.180
Yes, we will change if the chassis settings and a bit on the clutch, and reverse the effect 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.200
so we take off hopefully
