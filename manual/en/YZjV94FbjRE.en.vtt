00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.430
Bokeh is a word to describe the quality of
the out-of-focus areas of an image. In this

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.790
easy project from Make Volume 26, we’re
going to use a lens’s bokeh to create a

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.800
cool photographic effect like this one. Let’s
take a look at what you need.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.271
Of course, you’ll need a camera and lens.
I’m using a digital SLR and a 50mm lens

00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:24.000
for mine and it worked great. You also need
some black paper, scissors, an X-acto knife,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.119
a ruler and a compass.

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.630
The first step is to make a circle out of
the black paper to cover the front glass of

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.000
the lens. Measure out the diameter where you’ll
be able to put the piece of paper and set

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.630
your compass to draw circles of that size.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.870
Draw out a few circles on the black paper
and then cut them out. Leave a tab so that

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.410
you can easily remove the disk from the lens.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.460
In the very center of the disk draw the shape
you want.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.620
Using your X-acto knife, carefully cut out
the shape. Be sure to try out lots of different

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.800
shapes and sizes.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.680
Put the disk in front of the lens. Set your
camera into aperture priority or manual mode.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.750
You want the aperture to be as wide as possible
for maximum blurriness, so set the f-stop

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.740
number as low as possible. On this lens, it’s
a 1.4, so I’m going to use that.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.100
The disk is going to block a lot of light,
so you’ll need to set a longer exposure

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.770
time in order to compensate and therefore,
you’ll need a tripod or something else to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.060
stabilize the camera while the shutter is
open.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.730
Other than that, you just need to experiment.
Any small point of light that’s out of focus

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.170
will turn into the shape you cut into your
disk. If you want to work indoors, you can

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.180
use a strand of Christmas lights. Or go outside
at night and shoot.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.070
So I went outside and shot a little bit of
video with this method.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:58.280
And here are a few Flickr photos with some
cool bokeh effects.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.460
So this is a really easy project and it doesn’t
take much time, so I encourage you to try

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.060
it yourself. If you do try it out, be sure
to post your results to the MAKE flickr pool.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.670
So long.
