There's all sorts of cover that is good to
flip, but flipping bushes has to be one of

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.269
my favorites.

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.760
When I start flipping bushes the first thing
I'm going to look for is cover in the right

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.930
depth.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.519
Depth can vary by season but typically I'm
going to look for bushes in shallow water.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.419
The next thing I'm going to look for is a
bush positioned by itself like this one here.

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.910
Then once I get on the bush that I want, the
presentation I'm looking for I want to get

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.180
right on the truck of the bush. That's where
the bass in dirty water is going to position

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.550
itself is right on the trunk. So you've got
all the arms and the appendages of the bush

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.930
that are sticking out and branching out from
it but somewhere in the center of it is the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.090
trunk and that's what you need to hit no matter
where you're flipping. This is actually a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.660
group of bushes clusters together here and
that is kind of the key in bush fishing in

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.160
general is don't make one presentation and
don't just pitch it in there, hop it, and

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.450
hop it out. You need to give the bass a chance
to find your lure. You may not drop it in

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.100
on its head but if you work it up and down
over a branch you can draw ones attention

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.470
over to it.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.470
I place the bait in different locations, sometimes
you got to pop it and shake it to get it to

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.990
drop through there. You can see I'm over a
lot of branches I don't worry about that my

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.430
trolling motor I can pop the poles up, put
the trolling motor in there and get right

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.470
on top of him if I need to if it's a big one.
A lot of times if you just set the hook as

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.930
hard as you can and just keep pressure pulling
as hard as you can, you will turn his head

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.580
and he will come firing out of there in the
direction you got him going.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.650
A big problem people find when they're flipping
bushes is they're getting bit and they don't

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.030
know it. 9 times out of 10 if I'm yo-yoing
a bait up on a limb like this, all you're

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.090
going to feel is you're going to feel like
your bait is stuck. A fish generally in a

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.869
bush won't generally swim out of there. He
will grab hold of it and just hold it. So

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.819
when you go to pick up and it feels like your
baits is locked on a limb, that's not a limb.

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.269
If you've yo-yoed it up and down 10 times
and it hasn't got stuck and then all of a

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:25.269
sudden it got stuck that's generally a fish.
That's bush fishing right there. Thanks buddy

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:33.219
(talking to fish he caught). Alright that's
so fun.
