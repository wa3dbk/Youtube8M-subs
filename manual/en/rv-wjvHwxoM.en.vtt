00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:06.569
Is it bad to microwave breast milk?

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.660
On one hand, I want to save it in the fridge,
but I don’t want to hurt the baby by nuking

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.660
it.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.830
Don’t worry.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.220
He won’t gain superpowers by drinking microwaved
breast milk.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.350
But will it hurt him?

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.429
Microwaves break down the molecular structure
of food.

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.720
When you microwave food, it makes the water
molecules inside of it vibrate, generating

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.720
heat.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.860
You are not altering the chemical structure
of the milk via microwave.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.780
I heard it makes the food less nutritious.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.120
In theory, boiling vegetables and pouring
out the hot water costs some nutrients, but

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.260
ease of digestion more than makes up for it.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.539
And giving your kid cold breast milk can cause
him stomach pain.

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.870
Someone I know blamed microwaved breast milk
for baby’s stomach bug.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.239
If you express it, cool it, cook it, cool
the leftovers and go around and around, it

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.320
will spoil.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.300
The same is true if you leave the bottle out
on the counter too long.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.950
I know some people use bottle warmers for
breast milk bottles.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.370
Oh, great, another appliance you’ll hardly
ever use – and that one is more likely to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.509
be where the baby can play with it and get
burned.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.469
The CDC says you shouldn’t microwave breastmilk.

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:25.079
You shouldn’t try to microwave frozen breastmilk
and then give it to the kid.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.650
It may have a superheated outside and cold
core, burning and freezing his mouth at once.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.140
It also breaks down nutrients.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.909
Your kid shouldn’t be on a raw vegan diet,
which isn’t healthy anyway.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.700
If you’re going to go all natural all the
time, hire a wetnurse.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.420
A what?

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.560
Hire another woman to breastfeed the baby
when you aren’t there, so he gets warm milk

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.380
whenever he wants it.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.840
Did that even exist since the Middle Ages?

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.840
Sure.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.009
We’d call it a nanny with extra perks.

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.390
I’ll just get a bottle warmer and use that.
