00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.539
It's so weird how this works out, and I swear
it wasn't planned...but it's been a year exactly

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.279
since I reviewed this game on the PlayStation
2. Totally unintentional. How weird is that?

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.320
But I was happy to do it, and that's for a
few reasons. One, it's Looney Tunes. I love

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.220
Looney Tunes. Which brings us to reason two.
Might be wishful thinking, but...maybe this

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.250
thing's better than I remember. Maybe I was
too harsh on it last year. Maybe it's actually

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.170
a decent platformer that captures the humor
and style of the best cartoon in the history

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.230
of animation.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.140
I mean, maybe it's better than it looks.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:58.140
Oh, for f*ck's sake.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.670
So, here we go again. Looney Tunes: Back In
Action was released in 2003, it's based on

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.520
the movie, Brendan Fraser sucks. Although,
that said...his abs were pretty impressive,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.299
in George Of The Jungle. I'll give him that
one. But hey, that's more than I can say for

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.930
this game. Playing this piece of sh*t again
was the worst decision I've made in hours.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.909
I had Chick-fil-A for breakfast.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.520
No clue what I was thinking.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.030
Chances are, if you played any video game
in the early 2000s, you played something that's

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.030
almost identical to Looney Tunes: Back In
Action. This is the most generic 3D platformer

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.829
this side of...generic, 3D platformer. Town.
You run around, you collect coins, you break

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.200
things. Sometimes, you get to drive things.
Like yourself, crazy. Playing this f*cking

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.530
game.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.799
It has no identity of its own, and that's
probably deliberate.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.340
That way, you don't remember it. And it's
probably better that way.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.340
Let me tell you about how crappy this game
is. You start off with Daffy, and you have

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.290
to run across this highway, Frogger style.
And I guess that's kind of funny. Whatever.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.600
It's, like, "Hey, we're a video game. Let's
reference a video game." I get it, and I'm

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.660
fine with that. But then, you've just beat
that part...and what happens?

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.079
You get Bugs. And you have to do the exact
same thing over again.

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.070
Sufferin' succotash, that's stupid game design.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.609
Anyway, on the bright side, the game definitely
doesn't control as bad as I remember. The

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.930
controls are adequate. Not great, could be
a lot tighter...but not, like, game-breaking.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.290
The camera, on the other hand...that's actually
worse than I remember. I mean, in part, that's

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.940
basically the way a lot of platformers were
back then. But not this bad.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.669
This camera is bad even for 2003.

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.359
Also, it's ugly. And the music sucks.

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:14.359
And I mean, it's nice that Bugs and Daffy
are a team, and there's a lot of banter, but

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.100
none of its
funny. I didn't so much as smile at a single

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.519
line of dialogue. Forget laughing. And that
sucks. I'm a huge Looney Tunes fan, so to

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.919
not even smile at this game...that's the most
disappointing thing of all. Wait...no. The

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.160
camera. The camera's the most disappointing
thing.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.290
Anything else is a distant second.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.760
There are five different regions, but none
of them are very Looney Tunes. It's set up

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.840
like Mario, in that you have to complete a
certain amount of missions in each area before

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.209
moving on. Only it's never even a fraction
as good, or well-designed, or responsive,

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.970
or fun...as Mario. I mean, maybe a Looney
Tunes fan would enjoy this...but again, I

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.440
am definitely a fan.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.440
And I...definitely did not.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.690
You know, it's not that this is some completely
broken game or anything. But the thing is...you

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.950
could take out the Looney Tunes and replace
them with any other characters. It wouldn't

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.220
make any more or less sense. Back In Action
plays okay, but it's as standard as game design

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.220
gets, and totally uncreative. Not a great
fit for the Looney Tunes.
