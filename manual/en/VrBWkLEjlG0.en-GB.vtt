Maria Doulton: It’s almost Christmas, you
have to buy her something, she wants a watch

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.730
and you’ve got £5,000. Here are the perfect
five to choose from.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.080
First up is Ralph Lauren’s Petite Stirrup
watch in stainless steel, with diamonds around

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.460
the bezel. This is a watch that is as much
a bracelet as it is a timekeeper, and it’s

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.160
just really pretty and elegant.
You know, Ralph Lauren is all about the lifestyle

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.290
and the stories behind it, and of course everything
equestrian is really big at Ralph Lauren,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.960
and it’s just been so cleverly interpreted
in a watch. It’s got this lovely chain bracelet,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.650
which sits on the wrist like a bracelet, and
then that pretty classical dial with the Roman

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.190
numerals, and you might have noticed some
diamonds. It’s a classic, but it’s also

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.000
so wearable.
This little bijou of a watch is just so cute,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.989
you really want to eat it, and it’s La Mini
D de Dior. Its miniature, miniature little

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.000
dial set with diamonds on a neon pink strap
is both cool and very precious, so I think

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.780
this is for somebody who’s really young
at heart.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.730
The Liens watch by Chaumet is going to become
a classic. It combines a very simple design

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.570
with some really distinctive features. This
version, with its slate-grey strap and diamonds,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.780
really is just so chic, but so different.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.210
Female 1: It’s very, very stylish in a Parisian
sort of fashion; I just love it. I love the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.050
round shape, it is quite perfect, at least
for me anyway. I would put it on my Christmas

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.030
list without hesitation.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:45.630
Maria: This Louis Vuitton Tambour Lovely Cup
Chronograph would look great on the beach.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.070
It’s on a white rubber strap, it’s got
this sporty look about it, and it’s also

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.290
very useful. It’s a really well-made watch.
It’s got the Louis Vuitton stamp on it,

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.810
and also it’s very distinctive.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.330
Female 2: This is the Hermès Cape Cod in
stainless steel, and it’s a classic design

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.909
for Hermès, but it’s got a really unusual
long leather strap that wraps twice around

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:18.750
the wrist so that it becomes part bracelet
and part watch. The leather is just so soft

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:46.689
and supple because it’s Hermès leather.
