00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Japan is the first team
to be welcomed to Aotearoa

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.840
in the formal Maori way.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.680
Today at Aotea Square in Auckland,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.120
the local iwi and the
NZ Royal Navy haka group

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.360
welcomed the Japanese
team with a pohiri.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.800
Maori welcome the Japanese
rugby team with an official pohiri.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:39.040
Today, many gathered at
Aotea Square in Auckland.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.440
A statement supported
by the warrior of the day.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.240
It's an honour, because their coach
is former All Black, John Kirwan.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.320
But the coach says
the honour is his.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.680
And the two Maori in
the Japanese team both agree.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.680
They will play hard,
regardless of their opponents.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.320
They're both Maori
and will play their best.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.640
Six RWC teams have arrived in NZ.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.600
This is the first of 19 teams

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.920
that will receive
an official Maori welcome.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.240
Today, the Japanese team has arrived
and are taking plenty of photos.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.600
On Saturday, there will be
a pohiri for the All Blacks.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.600
