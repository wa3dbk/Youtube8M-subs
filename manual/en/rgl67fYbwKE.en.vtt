00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.830
GCTV Ep#10 Integrated Weed Destructor

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.230
Narrator:
There�s not much in GRDC�s portfolio of

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.180
research projects to equal the Harrington
Seed Destructor or so you might think.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.770
Invented by Ray Harrington the HSD has been
over the last four years studied, trialed

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.410
and modified by research engineers at the
University of South Australia.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.780
And while that research has been underway
so has a parallel project which could see

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.469
a new version of the technology available
in five to 10 years.

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.730
Packed in behind the covers on the rear of
this harvester is an Integrated Weed Destructor.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.719
It�s like a Harrington Seed Destructor in
that it pounds the life out of weed seeds

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.670
but the resemblance stops there.
Leading the University research team is Dr

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.670
Chris Saunders�

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.670
Dr Chris Saunders: Research Engineer University
of South Australia

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.909
We compared impact theory with the data we�d
collected from the HSD, we then did some lab

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.119
testing some computer simulation and we got
very good relationships between the speed

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.190
of the cage mill, the size, the design and
why it was killing those weed seeds. And from

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.110
that we were able to redesign and optimize
a method of providing the critical impact

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.140
speeds to a weed seed in a chaff fraction
to kill it.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.250
Narrator:
The integrated device will require a complete

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.560
reconfiguration of the HSD technology.
In this early prototype, changes include the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.020
replacement of the cage mill with its separate
motor and the trailer needed to carry it.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.560
Instead there are now twin mills driven by
the harvester, fed by a split stream of material

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.289
from the back of the sieve. The milled residue
exits either side of the device for a better

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.630
distribution across the paddock.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.640
Paul Meibusch: Manager, Commercial Farm Technologies
GRDC

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.369
We needed to have a machine that was going
to be able to cope with a much larger volume

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:01.530
of chaff coming through it. So a class 9 harvester
producing almost double what the other harvesters

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.140
in the past have been doing we needed a much
bigger unit.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.860
Narrator:
Only larger capacity harvesters would have

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.800
enough power to allow the integrated device
to run off the internal supply with minimal

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.849
effect on the header�s performance.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.110
Ray Harrington: Grain Grower &amp; Inventor, Darkan
WA

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.360
It�s the evolution of the HSD its where
I always wanted it to be in the header and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.990
I could say thanks to GRDC and farmers�
money.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.040
Narrator:
Financial support that amounted to one and

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.920
a half million dollars not including monies
Ray Harrington initially put into the HSD.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.670
Initial tests have produced positive results
however this integrated prototype will require

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.709
further development and testing to evaluate
how well it performs at various speeds and

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:43.709
under different loads.

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.690
Chris Saunders:
So from our lab testing we know that the portion

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.239
of kill increases with the proportion of rotational
speed and there�s a characteristic that�s

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.650
specific to our machines and there�s a characteristic
that specific to the Harrington cage mill.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.130
So what we are doing is varying those rotational
speeds and also varying the throughput of

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.939
the material and then monitoring the speed
of the mills and the power of the mills for

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.500
each of those settings to get the curves and
characteristics of our system.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.879
Narrator:
Sifting through what�s left of the chaff

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.769
and seed that�s gone through the new mills
Ray Harrington reckons its pretty good gear.

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.379
Ray Harrington:
This is doing as good a job this new style

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.909
of mill is doing as good a job or better job
than the original.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.750
Narrator:
A good understanding of air and grain flows

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.910
through the back end of the harvester enabled
the University�s engineers to design virtual

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.230
models even before taking the project into
the workshop.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.350
And being able to install the device underneath
the back-end provided the flexibility to have

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.570
it fold away when not needed and to be retrofitted
to suitable harvesters.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.680
Extensive work will also need to be done with
the harvester manufacturers around warranty

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.120
related issues and the research engineers
want to do more before they finish this project.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.290
Dr Chris Saunders:
if we can increase the number of weed seeds

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.379
in that chaff fraction by improving the way
the harvester separates that chaff and also

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.209
get more seeds into the front of the harvester
we can then potentially kill more weed seeds

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.489
in this operation so therefore increasing
the efficacy of the integrated system.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.579
Narrator:
This prototype doesn�t mean the trail behind

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.610
HSD will be quietly retired to the shed. Older
harvesters don�t have the horsepower to

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.310
drive an integrated destructor.
And because there�s more engineering to

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.900
be done and manufacturers have a long lead-time
for changes to production schedules, it could

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.090
be another 10 years before a retrofit version
is commercially available.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:46.230
GRDC foresees a need for the existing HSD
for a long time yet and in 2012 licensed the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.100
manufacturer of the trail behind Destructor
to South Australian firm de Bruin Engineering

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.220
which has contributed to the refinement seen
in the latest version.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.220
Richard Konzag: Grain Grower &amp; GRDC Southern
Panel Member, Mallala SA

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.979
We need a complete package to manage resistant
weeds or herbicides resistant weeds and having

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:08.220
something like the Harrington Seed Destructor
during harvest is another string to the bow

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.110
to help us tackle these problems.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.720
Narrator:
The technology that�s been created, as well

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.841
as the technology currently under development,
is world class according to GRDC�s farm

00:05:17.841 --> 00:05:19.720
technologies manager Paul Meibusch.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.199
Paul Meibusch:
Look all these types of inventions have many

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.610
fathers and this one is no exception there�s
been a lot of people involved.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.770
Ray Harrington is still involved and offered
a lot of good advice as we have been moving

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.330
through the research phase but I have to put
in a special mention to Nick Berry the young

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.750
PhD student that started a GRDC scholarship
on this project. He was integral in doing

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.280
the very basic work of understanding what
kills weed seeds, understanding the amount

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.190
of impact and the number of impacts that are
actually required to kill a seed.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.190
Narrator:
Fathered by many, and supported by GRDC, this

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.410
innovative engineering prototype promises
to deliver more options and more great results

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.410
for grain growers.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.410
