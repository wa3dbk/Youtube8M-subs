00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.609
The next opening is an opening that used to
be played quite a lot at one time. But, is

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.370
much more rarely played now. But, it is significant
in that it is probably the oldest of the so

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.449
called gambits. And, when you come to look
more deeply into the openings in Chess you'll

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.859
find that gambits form a very big part of
it. A gambit is basically just a sacrifice

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:32.840
of usually of a pawn, in the hope of getting
a stronger position in return. And, usually

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.590
the pawn that is lost is very quickly recovered
anyway. Now, in this king's gambit the again

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:49.960
the center king pawns were moved to the fourth
row. And, then the distinguishing feature

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.510
was that white would then play this move.
Now, one I think very undesirable aspect of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.000
this and probably the reason why this opening
is no longer very popular is that it immediately

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.869
takes away one of the key offending pawns
from the king. Especially, when if you remember

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:16.359
when the king castles to here. But, nevertheless
it was played and it's worth looking at. And,

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:23.780
typically in this situation the gambit can
either be declined or accepted. Declining

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.649
would mean, playing something like this simply
not going for it. Or, accepting it would indeed

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.990
mean taking the pawn. The gambited or as it's
sometimes called the poisoned pawn. So, we

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:44.619
come to here and then probably the next move
for white would be possibly this move. And,

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:51.009
thereafter very shortly this pawn would be
developed so that he now has an attack and

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:59.340
has a way of recovering this pawn here. And,
as I say the underlining idea is that it does

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.880
get the pieces out quickly.
