00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.429
Hi, this is Peter from JoomlArt. Today we
will be talking about the T3 version 3 Framework

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.019
for Joomla.

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.090
This is a 2 part video series about layouts.
The first video will be about Layout Configuration,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.320
and the second one is about Layout Customization.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.539
So let's start with the Layout.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.109
There are 3 main parts in this tutorial.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.939
Layout Overview
Layout Configuration

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.329
Exporing layout files
Ok, now let's check out the layout overview.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.329
Each layout is built up from multiple blocks.
One block can contain one or many module positions.

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.000
The customization can be operated from any
level: layout or block.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.719
The layouts they are very flexible, you can
change from 3 columns to 2 or full width.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:02.640
The base with elements are from 1 to 12 and
this can be configured depending on each layout.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.640
We can go with combination of 3-6-3, 8-4 or
simply 12, it's up to you.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.979
Ok, now we're going to move on to Layout Configuration.

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.979
First we're gonna go to Template Manager,
this is under Extensions at the top of your

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.040
screen. We're gonna choose a template. In
this tutorial, we're gonna use JA Mitius

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:38.000
template. Ok. Now let's go to the Layout tab.
Let's scroll down. Here's the list of all

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.970
the layouts on the site, select the layout
for the Home menu.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.970
There are 2 parts to this Layout Customization:
the Module Positions and the Responsive Layout.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.899
We're gonna start with the Module Positions.

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.310
The Module Positions allows you to change
the structure of the layout. You can change

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:12.900
any module position that you want. For the
spotlight block, you can set the number of

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:20.019
positions to assign to any module position.
If you don't want to publish any position

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:29.600
in the front-page, just assign to "None".
Always remember to save your settings. When

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.660
saved, go to the top of the screen and see
in the green bar, "Style successfully saved".

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.910
The Reset Position button allows you to reset
module position tab to default settings while

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.910
Reset All resets all settings in the layout
including the responsive layout settings.

00:02:53.889 --> 00:03:00.889
So let's check in the front, ok the front-end
looks pretty good.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.440
Just in case, we can save the layout in case
you make any change that we want to come back

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.440
to, so we're gonna name this example default-cloned,
then save.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.320
So we're gonna move to Responsive Layout,
the top of the screen to the right of the

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:32.310
Module Positions. Here's the supported layouts.
There are 5 layouts and you can configure

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.100
the theme one by one: Wide, Normal, Xtablet,
Tablet and Mobile.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:46.900
Ok, let's try Xtablet layout, the layout for
iPads. We can disable any position in the

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.079
layout simply with one click of the mouse.
We can resize the positions inside any spotlight

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:03.300
block, just drag and drop within the base
of 12. Can disable the positions that may

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.440
not be displayed well in the layout. Ok let's
check the front-end in XTablet or iPad. You

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:16.880
can see here, the front page is displayed
absolutely with what we've just configured.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.480
The last part in this tutorial is Exploring
Layout Files.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:33.400
Each layout has a separate PHP file, the files
are located in template/template_name/tpls.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
We have 6 layouts by default and one cloned
layout so we have 7 total layouts and here

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:47.900
are 7 PHP files. Please note that our settings
in the back-end for layout are not saved to

00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:00.900
PHP files, they are saved to ini files. The
ini files are located in template/template_name/etc/layout.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:11.000
As you can note, only layouts that have been
changed here will have an ini file. The files

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:20.200
also include the change settings. We can actually
change the settings of layouts from the files

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.510
but we generally don't recommend that for
users, let's give it an example.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:31.340
In the first position: block 1, spotlight
1, you can change that, can set the default

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:45.300
with span 6 to span12. Now we go back to the
Layout settings panel and refresh and we see

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.490
that it's changed in the back-end successfully.
You see that the position-2 has been changed

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.170
to -1 and the span has gone from 6 to 12.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.780
Remember to stay tuned for the second part
of this video. This is one of many videos

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.780
for T3 version 3 Framework.
