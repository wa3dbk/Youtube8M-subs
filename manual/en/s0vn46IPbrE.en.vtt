00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.000
Stalingrad is officially known as a Hero City (a Soviet honorary title awarded during WWII).

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.500
The massive battle fought here became one of the turning points of World War II.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.800
Our game is military, with a historical perspective.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.200
For this map, we wanted to make something really amazing, and also recognizable.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.000
One thing that made that difficult was the fact that Stalingrad was almost completely flattened during the war.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.150
No building was left intact.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.900
The landscape literally came to resemble the surface of the moon.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.950
We decided to represent the city at a certain point, when it was only half-ruined.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:11.350
This was a real challenge from a historical standpoint, because there are not many documents left to help us reconstruct the topography

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.500
and architecture of the city, especially of the late 1930s and early 1940s.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.200
The most interesting part when creating a map is choosing the location.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.800
It sets a tone for the whole map.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:35.200
The right choice of location and a good scheme for the map are very important; the final quality of the map will depend on these decisions.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.800
We viewed the location first hand to get a feel for how it looks.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.750
We needed to estimate distance between buildings; we took a lot of pictures,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.600
and you could almost say we made the map based on our own impressions.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.650
We needed to reconstruct the historical residential areas of Stalingrad as well as industrial areas.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.850
We relied heavily on aerial photographs.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.000
We had nothing but an aerial view of this area, of a factory there.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.650
We had to reconstruct its geometry and look.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.600
It needed to be historical and correspond to historical descriptions.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.400
It was challenging to create this map because the city is so flat.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.650
The terrain, the land surface, is flat.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.200
There are no elevation changes, so to make the map visually and artistically interesting was a tricky task.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.850
For the Stalingrad map, we chose the area around Lenin Square.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.650
We chose this area for gameplay reasons.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.200
It was relatively symmetrical; it had a center and recognizable buildings.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:01.300
The map features iconic buildings where the fighting was most brutal: Pavlov’s House, Zabolotny’s House, the flour mill, and the NKVD building.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.000
They’re already partly ruined but still recognizable.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.750
Stalingrad at that time consisted of small two and three story buildings arranged close to each other.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.950
From this arrangement of buildings, we needed to pick out some quarters and shape them in terms of the gameplay.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.100
The central square in front of the mill was also problematic.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.800
This was a large piece of open ground, which needed to be filled with something to make it visually interesting.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.750
It’s dotted with destroyed vehicles and shell craters, and obscured with smoke haze.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.300
We didn’t want it to look empty — as if we just didn’t have time to work on it.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.500
We also have a coastline along the Volga River.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.650
It was quite hard to work on it because we couldn’t make out elevations from the aerial photographs.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.200
I remember how, together with our historical consultants, we looked at the pictures of rail cars, measured their height,

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.800
and then put one rail car on top of another to determine the actual height of that slope.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I like that part of the map where the built-up area turns into a river valley.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.300
The elevation difference is small.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.950
It’s not a city any more, but still not a village.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.000
Just these blocks of houses.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.350
There’s a view of the Volga.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.350
Look at it.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.250
It’s beautiful.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.700
The Volga is foggy, the sun is shining, there are splashes of light.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.100
We worked on these areas a lot because we wanted to have some vantage points where players could see many interesting details

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:48.650
while they’re driving to a particular map area; we wanted to really highlight the visual arrangement of the map.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.000
Now, this map is probably the most accurate 3D depiction of how Stalingrad looked at that time.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.200
Of course, we want players to play on this map and enjoy it.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.650
It should evoke some powerful emotions.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.650
I liked this map very much.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.800
I’ll say it straight, I put not only my knowledge into this map, but also a part of my soul, so I’m very excited, of course.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.600
We expect players to like this map.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.400
We hope they’ll play on it with pleasure and have fun.
