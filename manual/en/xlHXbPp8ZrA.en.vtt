Hi! My name is Shawna on behalf of Expert
Village. In this clip, I’m going to demonstrate

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:19.320
how to sew in a non-roll elastic and keep
your elastic band from rolling. I press down

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.920
my casing again so that I have a nice wide
space for that to go through, and I’m just

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:35.800
going to start it out by running a straight
stitch down the back side of the bottom side

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.809
so I can run that through. So I’m going
to run my elastic through, and this is the

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.760
non-roll elastic. It’s made so that it doesn’t
bend. There’s a lot of elastics that will

00:00:49.760 --> 00:01:00.339
bend; this is a great one for that.
Once I get that to the end, I’m going to

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:06.800
straighten it out and make sure that it hasn’t
twisted on me. I’m going to sew it down

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:20.960
again on top so that it’s part of the waistband.
I’ll pull that through to my desired elasticity,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:35.310
and I’m not going to too much. Again, I’m
just going to keep it pulled. I’m not pulling

00:01:35.310 --> 00:02:12.340
through, just keeping it pulled. Then I’m
going to do at the bottom again.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.810
Then I kind of want to balance out all those
stitches so that they look like they’re

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.290
all supposed to be there. So I can come up
again next to that top stitch and do that

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:39.370
over again.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.090
Then I can even run it two more times, and
that just gives it a really nice elastic band

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.719
that you’ll see on anything from pajama
bottoms to athletic pants and shorts. It’s

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:56.169
a nice stretch, so it’s a very nice waistband.
