Hi Guys, this is Cindy Lietz, your Polymer
Clay tutor, and this is the introduction video

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:14.240
to my paid tutorial series; Faux Abalone Paua
Shell Cuff.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.861
Now this is a really neat tutorial where I
first show you how to make a Polymer clay

00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:25.390
cane with a Faux Paua Shell technique.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.800
And each slice that you take off this cane
will look different like a new piece of shell.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.700
I’ll also show you how to use those slices
in making a cuff.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:44.190
Now there are some wonderful Brass blanks
and Copper blanks that I've got from Rings

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.329
and Things, and they are just absolutely stunning.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.219
They come in a bunch of different sizes in
both concave and convex, and we're going to

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.539
be using these blanks to cover with our Paua
Shell technique.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:06.300
Now here I'll show you, this is one of the
wider cuffs in the concave design, and the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.930
technique… now hopefully the camera picks
it up, but it's just got a ton of shimmer

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.030
and depth to it, looks just really wonderful
and cool looking.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:26.140
Here's another design, slightly different
color way, and it is in the convex style…

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.720
and it’s bowed out, and it's a little bit
skinnier band here, it’s just lovely.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.060
Now here's another one in a convex as well,
and it is in a color way…

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.580
I was experimenting, and it came out unlike
any real Abalone that's out there, so I guess

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.530
we can just call it our Phony Abalone.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.340
And then, I've got other ways that you can
use this technique.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:59.090
We can make things like these beautiful disk
earrings, they've got some little disks and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:09.450
some Fluorite stones at the top on Sterling
Silver ear wires.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.850
We've also got up here some beautiful necklaces,
you can use this technique in Bezels and this

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.880
is one of Lisa Pavelka's Bezels, and it's
the heart shaped one and it looks just great

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.910
in there.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.390
I’ve also used it in a way where I've baked
it in a curve shape so it actually looks like

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.390
it's just a big chunk of shell, and this is
really stunning.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.770
And the neat thing, when you're using Polymer
clay, is you can make it in any size that

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.920
you like.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.350
I've also got down here some samples of the
way I've used it to make little buttons which

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.160
is a great technique as well.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.160
I've got a couple of square beads here and
I've also got one more Lisa Pavelka Bezel,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.910
done in a sort of a Brass Antique look, it
has a completely different look and it looks

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.040
great with this technique.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.860
So I hope you enjoy this tutorial, it's gonna
be a lot of fun.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.640
And I will see you in the next video of this
series.
