00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.200
Airplanes

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.660
are essentially pressurized cylinders zooming through the air 10 km above the ground.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.840
They take us to work and on vacation, bring us to family

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.520
and in general move us from point A to point B faster than any other publicly available transport on earth.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.740
Here's how a modern commercial jet aircraft is made:

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.540
So, it's a beautiful fall morning

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.020
and I am getting ready to go

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.140
get on an airplane

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.200
to go to france to learn about airplanes.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.400
I flew to europe to visit the factories, research and design facilities of AIRBUS

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.880
because they wanted to give me and you a behind the scenes look at their newest airplane, the A350.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.120
Here it is!

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.240
But before the first flight happens,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.380
even long before the first rivet is set,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.580
a team of thousands of engineers and designers spend years developing the design for both the aircraft

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.660
and how it will be manufactured.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.400
They have to take into account the desired passenger capacity,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.960
the range and speed of the plane,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.980
passenger comfort,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.080
requirements for landing and navigating airports,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.120
flight controls,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.900
fuel efficiency,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.920
how and where materials and parts will be scourced and produced

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.780
and a million in sundry other details.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.240
Over the course of the design

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.160
engineers use computer simulations and wind tunnel models

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.520
to test the aerodynamics of the aircraft in its takeoff, cruising and landing configurations

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.740
and even use scale model engines powered by compressed air

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.000
to understand the wing engine interaction.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.380
Fluid dynamics is freakin' complicated.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.320
All of the various systems have to be independently tested,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.920
the wing flaps and the landing gear deployment and the engines and so on.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.720
They even shoot several dead ducks into the engine at high speed

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.380
to make sure it can continue to provide thrust if it encounters a flock of birds.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.200
Once a plane is designed, the parts  --all 2.65 million of them--  have to be manufactured and assembled,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.820
some by AIRBUS itself

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.180
and many like the engines and landing gear by outside contractors.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.180
In the case of the A350 aircraft

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.660
the wing tops and bottoms are made in an additive process using carbon fiber infused resinous tape,

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.700
which is then cured in a massive oven until it becomes stronger and lighter than steel.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.900
Let me say that again:

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.400
That is going to be an airplane wing --

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.580
made out of tape.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.160
The wingboxes are assembled and fitted with electrical, hydraulic and fuel systems,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.060
painted and then the flaps, slats and ailerons  --the things they use to steer--  are added.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.160
They ginormous tail fin is constructed in a similar fashion.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.180
The fuselage (struggles to pronounce)

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.320
and rear pressure bulkhead are built separately,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.000
again out of carbon fiber composite materials

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.060
and are wired and outfitted with instrumentation and hydraulics.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.560
The nose of the aircraft is added

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.540
and then all the parts built off site

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.460
are flown by a special and hilarious looking airplane part carrying airplane

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.920
to the final assembly line

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.200
where in a single stupendously massive hangar the fuselage pieces are fastened together,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.440
the wings are connected,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.880
landing gear installed,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.600
auxiliary power unit put in place,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.600
vertical stabilizer and horizontal tailplane are attached,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.720
seats and ventilation and cabin and cockpit interiors are installed,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.600
etc.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.160
Finally, at the very end, it's time for the engines.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.120
They're the most expensive part, so they're put on last.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.780
The plane then undergoes in flight testing to make sure all the systems are working as intended.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.700
When a new aircraft it being developed, the first few planes built

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.520
are covered with sensores and tested extensively to the range of their limits:

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.480
Cold weather,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.880
hot weather,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.880
high altitude,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.160
water on the runway,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.260
tail scraping on low speed take off,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.500
wing bending strenght,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.260
etc.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.300
And in addition to this extensive prototype testing, every single plane that comes off the assembly line

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.320
is taken on its own testflights.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.240
Once the test pilots and test flight enineers are happy

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.920
we're done!

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.920
The plane heads out onto the runway for delivery to an airline somewhere around the world.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.520
When it's running at full speed, AIRBUS' facilities will build ten A350 aircraft every month.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.800
That's one plane completed every two working days.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.460
It's a pretty amazing feat of engineering, manufacturing, infrastructure and technology.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.800
And if there is one thing that I learned about airplane manufactur while visiting AIRBUS,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.820
it's that every single part of the process has its own expert.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.860
There are airtraffic control experts,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.660
seat experts,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.780
wing flap experts,

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.760
wind tunnel engine model experts

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.300
and even carbon fiber recycling experts.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.240
All, so that you and I can get from New York to London in a few hours instead of a few days.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.140
I am here in the escape hatch of the AIRBUS A350.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.540
Ahh, if there were an emergency I would have to jump out of this place.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.820
But I would like to say thank you to AIRBUS for bringing me here,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.680
it's been an amazing trip, I have learned so much about airplanes

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.480
and it's been really fun to see the production facilities and-

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.620
and to see the test aircraft and stuff like this.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.100
So yeah, thank you to AIRBUS for allowing this to happen, I hope you've enjoyed it.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.980
I can't believe how big this airplane is.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.980
It is huge.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.260
I don't want to jump out.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.340
Oh, and one more thing:

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.460
If you'd like to buy an AIRBUS A350,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.440
just get in touch with AIRBUS and let them know I sent you.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.940
(wink)

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.440
LOL
