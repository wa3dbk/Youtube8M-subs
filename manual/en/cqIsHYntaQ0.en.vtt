00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.330
[Music]

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.030
We've filmed the South Somerset Ferreters
before.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.030
Well, they're back - and this time they reckon
they've got the ultimate warren.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.080
It's a hill not far from the South Devon coast
and it's a honeycomb of buries.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.822
The South Somerset Ferreters are a group of
families who get together on a Saturday not

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:26.550
to go shopping, not to go to a theme park.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.740
They go ferreting.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.290
Between them, they have everything that ferreters
need, including two lurchers, a little Lakeland/whippet

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:40.650
cross and their not-so-secret weapon, Louis,
a remarkably sprightly 10-year-old Jack Russell.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.060
Also on hand to help is the Fieldsports Channel
cocker spaniel Muffin and her year-old daughter

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.060
Mina.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.210
Yes, I don't think it really gets any better
than where we are today, anywhere in the country

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.500
really.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.680
First job is to put the nets out - both long
nets and purse nets

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.580
We know what we are up against today, because
we did it last year.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.820
Yes like I said we have got the whole perimeter
again.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.510
Blocked off the long nets and we have still
got a lot of purse nets to set.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.460
Roughly about 200 nets.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.720
Yes it takes time, but if you don't put the
time in, you don't get the rewards.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.930
It's not just a case of bunging a net over
a hole and banging it in.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.000
So you have got different sized nets here?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.220
Yes, I have got four footers, five footers
and six footers, all for different holes.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.980
Does it depend on the size of the hole.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.990
Yes.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.300
Then there are the elastic bands

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.080
Every purse net we use, we put an elastic
band around.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.020
So when we pick them up if we have any elastic
bands left we know we are missing a net from

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.020
somewhere.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.409
It takes a couple of hours to put out this
many nets.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.810
About 600 yards of long net we have got to
set up around as well, five dogs, about 15

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.620
ferrets which we put down all in one go.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.500
So hopefully fingers crossed, not a lot will
get away.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.509
Next up the stars of the show.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.840
The ferrets.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.220
We take time off for a bite to eat.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.620
Then - nets, dogs, children - everyone gets
in position.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.740
There's even time to disentangle Mina from
a long net.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.420
The first rabbits don't take long to bolt.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.230
Men, women and children are stationed round
the long nets, ready to dive on anything that

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.230
wriggles.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.660
After a quarter of an hour of no activity,
we reckon we have had the best of this bury.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.660
Now we have to retrieve the ferrets.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.030
When ferrets lie up and have to be dug out,
they uncannily choose the thickest part of

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.450
the brambles.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.209
You need to sweep the brambles with Ferret
Finders.

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.760
Just goes to show that without these finders
you would lose ferrets.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.500
He went right the way across the other side.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.290
So good we have got them all back now.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.069
Plus a rabbit for a bonus.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.030
Years of experience tells them that this last
ferret is deep underground.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.720
The fastest way to cut through the bramble
roots is to send in Louis - still keen as

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.980
a puppy.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.739
Once Louis has done his work, Jaf calls for
another piece of kit.

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.620
It's a ferreting endoscope.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.940
At last we find the final ferret.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.800
It was nowhere near the brambles but in the
next field, curled up with a rabbit.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.720
The next step is the main event.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.790
We're ferreting the open hillside.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.260
Jaf is relieved to find the bury here is not
connected to the holes under the brambles

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.900
next to it.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.670
We get more rabbit action from this side of
the hill - and we're in a perfect place to

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.670
watch it.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.280
There is even an opportunity to train a young
dog to stay away from ferrets.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.430
The last ferret of the day has chosen the
only clump of gorse to lie up beneath.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.580
It's another digging exercise, with Louis
on hand to offer help.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.300
