Hi! Good to see you again dear viewer. Today
we’ll see some conversations about families.

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:27.147
Make sure you listen to them all, and also make
sure you see the vocabulary section at the end.

00:00:27.147 --> 00:00:35.115
Don’t forget to practice the lines by pausing the
lesson and repeating the dialog anytime you want!

00:00:35.787 --> 00:00:37.849
So let’s get it started!!

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.459
Do you have any siblings?

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:49.435
Yes. I have a younger brother. What about you?

00:00:50.014 --> 00:00:53.553
I have quite a big family with 2 brothers and 2 sisters!

00:00:54.045 --> 00:00:58.193
Wow, a big family… I’d have liked a sister too.

00:00:58.732 --> 00:01:04.349
Yes, they're my sisters and they are very nice. They’re
kind and smart and I feel lucky to be their brother.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:06.435
What a nice thing to say!

00:01:12.983 --> 00:01:15.271
So you were gone visiting your grandpa last weekend?

00:01:15.662 --> 00:01:20.224
Yup! My grandfather must be in his late 80’s and he’s very active.

00:01:20.764 --> 00:01:23.834
Wow! That’s great! What about your grandma?

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:30.873
She’s a very sprightly old woman too. In fact my grandparents
from my mother’s side are pretty healthy and active themselves.

00:01:31.483 --> 00:01:35.396
That’s really good to hear. Your folks
know how to take care of themselves.

00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:40.459
Yeah, our family eats right and exercises. That’s why we’re healthy.

00:01:47.286 --> 00:01:49.356
Where’s your younger brother these days?

00:01:49.754 --> 00:01:55.386
Well, John got admitted to the medical college
 in New York. He’s going to be a doctor.

00:01:56.202 --> 00:01:59.224
Really? You must be so proud of him.

00:01:59.772 --> 00:02:08.006
Yeah, I am. My old man was a carpenter, and I got into the
same profession, but little Johnny’s always studied hard.

00:02:08.022 --> 00:02:10.389
He’s going to bring credit to the family name.

00:02:11.123 --> 00:02:13.506
So happy for you Sam!

00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:24.545
Hey John, I met Samantha at the party last night. Is she your sister?

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:31.279
Samantha? No, she ain’t my sister. She’s Frank’s daughter.
Frank is my brother. Samantha is my niece.

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:36.217
Your niece? But she’s not very young!

00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:43.865
Yeah! My dad married my mom when he was in his 40s.
Frank was already 18 then. He’s my step-brother actually.

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:50.990
Wow! Families are weird. Aren’t they?
A woman older than you is your niece.

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:53.037
That’s how families are Joanna.

00:03:02.334 --> 00:03:10.560
Your siblings are your brothers and sisters. Sibling is a
gender-neutral word that can be used for both brother and sister.

00:03:15.412 --> 00:03:20.834
Sprightly means lively… Full of energy.
It’s used commonly for older people.

00:03:26.053 --> 00:03:28.795
The meaning of folks is people,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:36.145
but when you say ‘my folks’, or ‘your folks’,
refers to your parents, or other family members.

00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:45.903
'Bring credit’ means to bring fame, or add prestige.

00:03:45.927 --> 00:03:52.340
When you bring credit to your family, you do something
that is good and noteworthy which makes them proud.

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:05.770
You can use ‘elder to’, or ‘older than’ to
talk about someone who’s older than you.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:13.582
Always use elder with ‘to’, and older with ‘than’. For example:

00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:25.221
My brother John is elder to me, or My brother John
 is older than me. Don’t say ‘older to’, or ‘elder than’.
