00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.500
There are two different ways in which you can meter light.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.740
one is called a reflected meter reading and that's what your camera does.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.469
it measures the light that's reflected
of whatever it is you're pointing the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.400
camera at, 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.760
the others called in incidents meter
reading and that measures the light that's

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.200
falling

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.420
onto the subject. The light that's all around us out here in the atmosphere 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.279
Let's just have a little think about the reflected meter reading first, 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.400
there's one obvious drawback, and that is that different things reflect light

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.400
in different ways and in different
amounts just imagine you were at a wedding

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.809
you've got a blonde haired girl with very pale skin she's wearing a white wedding dress 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.900
and she standing in front of a white
wall

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.559
that's going to reflect tons of light isn't it, that's going to be quite bright even on a 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.219
kinda flat evenly lit day like today. The guy she's marrying 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.600
he's black and he's wearing a dark suite

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.750
not actually standing in front of the white wall 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.199
the white wall ends here with the bride
the groom standing here 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.420
with a load of sort of shadowey bushes and greenery going on behind him 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.600
off in the distance, well none of that is going to reflect very much light at all

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:08.220
is it?

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.680
let's put into practice here, meet my bride and groom.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.860
Now then, suedo bride and groom I should say.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.800
if I was gonna set up and take a shot

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.950
of the bride, what i'd do is. I'm not gonna compose this very well 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.900
because I don't really need too, i'm gonna bring up my light meter in the back of the camera 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.020
so the cameras now pointing at our bride, 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.960
and if you can see the light meter is saying it's massively over exposed because 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.210
it's off to the plus end. what I've got to do is to 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.479
under expose a bit so I need to bring that shutter speed up 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.670
I need to speed up the shutter speed until we get the correct exposure which is 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.649
very nearly there

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.259
here we go at 800th of a second at F8, got the autofocus on so it can't focus 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.060
hang on, here we go. I take a picture of our bride, 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.829
now I don't know if you can see in the back of the camera 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.540
that's not very white is it. It's really quite grey.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.050
Next, i'm gonna bring up the light meter again this time

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.540
let's have a look at what happens when I
move between our bride and our groom.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.400
so the exposures about right for our
bride

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.319
the lights changed a little bit there we
now come with me

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.100
as we point the camera at the groom who
so drunk he nearly fell over

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.400
there we go look the light meter has now

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.940
goal to massively underexposed and yet

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.310
this the correct exposure for the bride
how peculiar is that

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.300
the same amount of light is falling onto both of them 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.349
it's because the white bride with the
white dress in the white wall

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.550
is reflecting masses more light than the black groom in the dark suit against the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.239
bushes.

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.800
so what would you do about that? well if you're actually going to photograph that in 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:55.890
real life 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.769
those two things will mix together
become what's called mid grey that's 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.930
a grey tone it's exactly half way between the two. 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.569
so if I was actually to take that
picture and I just set up the

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.000
where are we, there we go, as you can see

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.180
the whites white and the blacks black

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.390
and all I did was to set up the light meter,  I had to do it through the view finder

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.800
because I couldn't line up the shot if I
was looking at the back.
