Hey, it's KC from G Free Foodie, we're
talking chocolate.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.860
Okay, we are making my friend Rachel the
Gluten-free Momma's double fudgy

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.750
brownies, so I of course I'm using her
flour blend. This is her coconut blend. I

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:37.100
put my other dry ingredients in here,
some baking soda, and salt, some xanthan

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.530
gum,
of course, and this is the best quality

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.250
cocoa I could find. Don't be skipping on
the cocoa, people. This is the chocolates,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.899
so I'm just going to give that a quick
stir, make sure that that xantham gum is

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:07.310
mixed throughout our dry ingredients. Dry,
good. To go wet. So I've got some oil. You

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:16.720
can do corn, you can do canola, you can do
whatever oil works for you, and two eggs,

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.549
and we're going to get to whiskin, just
to get those incorporated, crack those eggs

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.020
open. Okay, and I'm going to add some
water, sometimes if I have leftover

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.880
coffee, I'll put that in there and it
gives it just a little extra kick, some

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.340
vanilla, gluten free of course, and some
sugar.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.750
This is bakers' sugar, which is a little
more fine than

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.259
traditional white sugar, you can use
white sugar, that's just fine, when I'm

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:59.149
baking I prefer to use baker's sugar,
switching over to the big spoon because

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.560
we're going to incorporate our dry
ingredients a little bit at a time.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.590
Okay, now that I have this all
incorporated, for a little extra kick I'm

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.720
going to add some chocolate chips, you
don't have to, I want to, they're my

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:58.960
brownies. It's my prerogative. So just get
those incorporated, prepared 8x8 baking

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.300
dish, this is going right in there. We're
going to get all that goodness in the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:24.660
pan, give it a spread, 350, now it's the
waiting game. Look at that deliciousness.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.410
This, I'm telling you is a brownie that
you're gluten eating friends are going

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:41.200
to beg you for the recipe. So flippin good.
 G free foodie, check us out. I'm on

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.590
chocolate.
