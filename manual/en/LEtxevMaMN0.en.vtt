00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.710
How to Make Bacon Cupcakes.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.750
Bacon and cupcakes are delicious on their
own.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.620
Combine the two, and you'll be surprised at
how good they are together.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:22.340
You will need 1 1/2 c. flour, sifted 1 1/2
tsp. baking powder 2 tsp. cinnamon 1 tsp.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:35.350
grated nutmeg 1/2 tsp. salt 3/4 c. butter
1 c. sugar 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract 3 large

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:48.040
eggs Maple syrup Half-and-half 6 strips cooked
bacon, chopped 8 oz. cream cheese 2 c. sifted

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:56.549
confectioners' sugar and toothpick (optional).

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:57.549
Step 1.

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:03.540
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees and place
paper liners in the cupcake baking pan.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.540
Step 2.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.360
Whisk together the flour, baking powder, 1
teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a large

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.790
mixing bowl.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.170
Step 3.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.540
Combine one stick of butter, the brown sugar
and the sugar in another large mixing bowl.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.720
Cream the ingredients with a mixer on low
speed for 6 to 8 minutes, until the ingredients

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.800
are well combined.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.800
Step 4.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.560
Add the vanilla and egg to the butter mixture
and continue mixing.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.180
Scrape down the sides of the bowl frequently,
and mix it until the mixture is light and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.570
fluffy.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.800
Step 5.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.780
Add a third of the flour mixture to the creamy
mixture.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.890
Then add 1/8 cup maple syrup and 1/4 cup half-and-half
and mix until it's combined.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.100
Then add another third of the flour mixture,
another 1/8 cup of syrup, and another 1/4

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.420
cup half-and-half, and mix again.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.940
Finally, add the remaining flour and mix until
the ingredients are just combined.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.940
Step 6.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.440
Fold 5 of the 6 chopped strips of bacon into
the mixture and pour the batter into the muffin

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.440
tins.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.560
Fill each cup three-quarters of the way to
the top and bake for 40 minutes.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.420
Then allow the cupcakes to cool completely.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.760
Use a toothpick or fork to test to see if
the cupcakes are done.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.050
Insert one into the center of the cupcake.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.860
If it comes out clean, your cupcakes are ready.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.000
Step 7.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.330
Mix the cream cheese and remaining two tablespoons
butter in a large bowl on medium speed until

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.810
the mixture is creamy.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.410
Then add confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup maple
syrup, and a teaspoon cinnamon, and continue

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.110
to beat until everything is combined.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.150
Step 8.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.420
Use a spatula to spread the frosting evenly
onto the cooled cupcakes.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.880
Sprinkle them with additional chopped bacon
and serve immediately.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.230
Be sure to set one aside -- you don't want
your friends to eat them all.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.790
Did you know March 1st is National Pig Day
in the United States.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.380
The celebration started in 1972 when two sisters
decided that a day was needed to honor and

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.629
give thanks to pigs.
