00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.300
...used a pencil eraser...

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:24.462
Yup!

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.102
...fought a series of explosive fire trees...

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.261
Uh-huh.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.700
...snuck past a massive cult...

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.008
Pretty much!

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.762
... and now you're here?

00:00:34.053 --> 00:00:35.925
Yeah, that's the gist of it.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.135
Eh, yeah, you took your sweet time getting here!

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.900
Do you even have any idea of how tough it was on the way?

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.500
Well, just sit down, and tell me everything from the beginning. Okay?

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.700
(first, a full-day hike through misery and torment and NOW, storytime.)

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.300
(alright, let's go with, um...)

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.400
Well, it was, hm...

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.200
It was on a fateful night!

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.300
There was this big meteor, right, that fell near the...

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.900
No, no. Not that one.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.700
What?

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.091
You know what I mean... earlier!

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.400
(well I guess before, there was the fat red smart kid and the skinny orange dumb one.)

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.610
(and that gang that ran that arcade!)

00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:20.200
(and then there's the alien talking bee that visited me from the future

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.200
that told me I was one of the Chosen Four to save the world!)

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.469
(and then there was those roadblocks. Oh man, those roadblocks were...)

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.085
(wait a second... maybe she's actually talking about--)

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.726
Oooooh! That's what you meant. Okay then!

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.250
♫ Character select, N. E. S. S. ! ♫

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.750
♫ Give it up for the brainiac, I'll name him Jeff! ♫

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.300
♫ I'm the man, with the plan, and I love to rock! ♫

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.675
♫ I'm gonna name my dog King, even though he's not! ♫

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.600
♫ I got a girl on my crew, I'll let my game name her! ♫

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.894
♫ Paula?! Could that be any LAMER? ♫

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.492
Wait wait wait, what did you say about my name?

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:03.469
Oh boy.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.501
Oh, come on, it was just for the rhyme!

00:02:07.998 --> 00:02:09.937
So! It was me, Pokey, and King.

00:02:10.245 --> 00:02:12.319
King's my dog, and Pokey's my neighbor.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.682
We were all going back up the hill to check out what happened, now that the cops were gone.

00:02:16.148 --> 00:02:17.453
The animals were all crazy!

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.000
Snakes biting, crows trying to peck out your eyes...

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.000
Pokey's useless in a fight by the way, 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.300
but King's primal! A real hunter!

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.731
And between his fangs and my bat, we made it back to the top of the mountain to find Pokey's brother, Picky.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.676
... napping next to a giant meteorite, which I'm sure is super healthy.

00:02:31.942 --> 00:02:33.845
And then this talking space bee from the future,

00:02:34.024 --> 00:02:37.577
told us he wasn't really a bee, but that he really was from the future!

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.091
... beg your pardon?

00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:41.095
That's what got me too! Because...

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.400
if his name is Buzz Buzz, how is he not a bee?

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.981
But it's cool, because he said there's three boys and a girl

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.440
who are destined to save the world. And I'm one of them!

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.000
Pokey, uh... he thinks he's one of them too, but I don't know.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.000
Anyway, we're headed back down the mountain,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.100
and then this silvery thing called a Starman shows up!

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.779
But totally-not-a-bee Buzz Buzz blasted him!

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.200
... and then got crushed to death by Pokey's mom, two minutes later.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.200
But before he died, he gave me the Sound Stone,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.087
which I have to use to collect the Eight Melodies, and save the world.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.108
But... what about the meteor crash?

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.900
Oh yeah! The meteor crash. Well...

00:03:38.678 --> 00:03:39.800
Hey, is that...?

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.400
... woah.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.590
Hey Tracy! Tracy!

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.300
Tracy where are ya I need to tell you about this a meteor fell--

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:49.428
Oh wait, you're already up.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.110
But anyway! A meteorite fell near Giant Step!

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.944
So, are you gonna take a look at it?

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.607
Of course I'm gonna check it out!

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.199
Alright, I'm going back to bed. Have fun.

00:04:12.244 --> 00:04:13.707
Oh boy oh boy oh boy!

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.231
More roadblocks!

00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:17.138
Yaaaay-eh-no.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.650
What?! Who's there?

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:35.758
Hey, Ness! Hey! L-L-Listen to what I've got to say!

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.799
When I took Picky to the place where the meteorite landed...

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.371
Oh! Good evening ma'am.

00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:44.744
You're looking lovely as usual.

00:04:47.004 --> 00:04:49.099
Anyway, as I was saying,

00:04:49.401 --> 00:04:54.926
the police that were guarding the meteorite landing left suddenly to deal with the Sharks.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.400
You know the Sharks, they're the local ruffians, and they were really...

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.787
Oooh, that Pokey fellow doesn't seem trustworthy.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.100
To me, anyway.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.784
But I'm his best friend!

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:07.450
Well, um...

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.000
I'm his... only friend, but...

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.258
...whatever!

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.431
Well, once I kicked the Sharks outta town,

00:05:13.634 --> 00:05:15.600
I had to go deal with the police officers...

00:05:18.694 --> 00:05:21.100
(I'm outta here, that looks like it's smarts!)

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.500
♫ Check out my Super-Ultra-Mambo-Tango-Foxtrot martial arts! ♫

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.950
♫ I'm the Captain, I'm strong, that's why I'm Captain Strong! ♫

00:05:29.153 --> 00:05:33.326
♫ If you think you're getting past me, well... you're wrong! ♫

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.100
And then I walked!

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.800
I walked...

00:05:48.771 --> 00:05:49.767
... I walked!

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.600
... I *WALKED* until I literally crumbled into the first hotel I saw in Twoson.

00:06:02.287 --> 00:06:04.820
... and I was told you were kidnapped!

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.600
Found a bike, trekked some more,

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.159
and hauled myself into this loghouse.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.600
Ness, you forget one step!

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.000
...the rest area, hmm?

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.000
Oh! Right!
