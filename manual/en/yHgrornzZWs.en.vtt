00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.219
Hello and welcome to another edition of
ProTech

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.029
today we're going to talk about a common
complaint related to a GM manual

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.500
rack &amp; pinion unit found on over 1.6 million 
vehicles on the road today

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.560
The affected models include the 2004-2011
Chevy Malibu

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.490
2005-2010 Pontiac G6

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.699
and the 2007-2009 Saturn Aura
with complaints of noisy

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.250
clunking during low-speed turns

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.300
CARDONE's analysis of the problem revealed
that the noise issues are unrelated to

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.680
the rack &amp; pinion

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.239
GM has also released a tech service
bulletin that details 3 noise conditions

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.949
that manifest themselves in a way that feels
like they could be coming from the

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.290
rack &amp; pinion

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.660
the first is a slip stick condition of
the intermediate shaft

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.500
the initial version of the intermediate
shaft did not have the proper coating

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.710
and also lacked lubrication

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.580
the second condition could be due to
interference between the clamp and the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.600
steering gear input shaft

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.480
this is a result of improper assembly at
the factory

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.090
last there could also be a possible
transmittance of noise coming from the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.830
radiator storage tank

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.180
all three of these noise conditions can
be resolved by following the TSB

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.290
instructions

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.940
but these must be investigated and
understood so the rack &amp; pinon is not

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.350
prematurely removed and returned

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.090
there's also a specific torque
specification that must be applied when

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.200
the rack is mounted to the chassis

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.060
the mounting fasteners must be tightened
the 52 ft lbs plus an

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.110
additional 90 degrees

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.100
if this is not done the rack with rock and/or
pop when torque is applied from the electric

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.950
steering motor

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.590
to make sure installers don't miss the
important information CARDONE has

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.890
provided several methods of
communication related to this issue

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.650
we placed a bright yellow input shaft
tag on the rack &amp; pinion warning of the

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.090
noise condition not related to the
rack &amp; pinion

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.130
there's also a bright yellow detailed
instruction sheet in the box covering

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.260
all three OE noise conditions

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.010
and the fix for each

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.869
also there is a yellow mounting tag
warning about vibration in providing the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.040
exact torque specification for the
mounting bolts. I hope this information helps

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.660
you avoid time spent going in the wrong
direction when trying to diagnose the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.299
steering noise issue

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.579
be sure to check out part 2 of this
ProTech where we will talk about the solution

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.339
CARDONE implemented to resolve a noise
problem inside the manual rack &amp; pinion

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.649
that's it for this edition ProTech

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.849
thanks for your time and i'll see you on
our next episode
