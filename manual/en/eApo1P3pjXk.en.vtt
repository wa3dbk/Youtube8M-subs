Hi I'm Angel with FleeceFun.com. Today I'm
going to show you how to make a scrapper mitt.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.810
Perfect for keeping your hands warm and dry
while you scrap the windshield. For this project

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.450
you will need the following. You will need
a 1/3 yard of fleece for a small size (little

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.110
less than 1/2 of a yard for a large) and actually
you can make several from this or a matching

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.890
hat to go with it if you want. An 1/8 of a
yard of faux fur and this is optional but

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.640
I do recommend it. 4-5 inches of sew on Velcro.
A 1 inch d ring and and of course a windshield

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.350
scrapper and I got mine at the dollar store.
Once you have all those things it's time to

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.870
start cutting out your pattern. You'll need
to cut out two of the lining pattern, two

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:09.040
of the exterior, two of the cuff, one of the
loop, and two of the amazing size adjuster.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.130
Now for this pattern you will be cutting fur
and something I highly recommend is that you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.140
don't double up on fur. You need to cut out
each piece individually. The pattern's symmetrical

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.100
so you don't have to worry about flipping
over the pattern. You just need to cut out

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.990
two singley of the fur and make sure that
the nap of the fur is going the same direction.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.310
I like to have it going down the glove so
you'll just pet the fur if you will and see

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.479
what direction it lies so you want it lying
all in the same direction on both sides of

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.860
the cuff when you put it together. Another
thing is you really want to cut this either

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.420
outside or when you're done cutting it inside
take it out immediately and give it a good

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.270
shake because the fur is going to fly everywhere.
You need to be very careful. I don't want

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.369
you to have to clean up the mess. Also, you're
going to want a lint roller for yourself when

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:07.750
you're working with fur. But trust me it looks
so great it's worth it. We're going to start

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.780
with the lining. Putting right sides together
you're going to sew each side of the seam

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.920
of the lining using a half inch seam allowance
leaving the bottom and the top open- the little

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.889
square at the top. Once you've sewn on each
side try slipping the scrapper into the top

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:26.090
of the mitt to make sure that it fits. You
might want to make the opening a little smaller

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.510
to make it a good snug fit if you need to.
Turn it right side out and then set it aside.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.489
Once you have the lining put together set
it aside and let's get started on the rest

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.290
of the mitt. Taking the two pieces of the
size adjuster, place the right sides together

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.040
and leaving the short straight side open sew
arm using a quarter inch seam allowance, trim

00:02:49.040 --> 00:03:00.709
down the excess, and turn right side out.
Make sure the seams are well pushed out. Then

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.689
top stitch close to the edge less than a quarter
of an inch all the way around. Then taking

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:12.029
the 4-5 inches of Velcro sew the hook on one
end and loop on the other end leaving a gap

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:16.930
in between. Now that the Velcro is all on
the same side of the size adjuster once you

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:24.639
have that done set it aside. Now it's time
to make the exterior with the cuff. With right

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.870
sides together you're going to take one of
the exterior and one of the cuff, pin together,

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:41.109
and then sew using a half inch seam allowance.
Repeat with the other side. Now you're going

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.439
to tack on the D ring, the loop, and the amazing
size adjuster to run on the exterior sides.

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:51.180
You're going to take the loop piece, fold
in each side, and sew a straight stitch down

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:00.409
the middle to give it a nice finish look.
Then slip the D ring on. Loop the folded half

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.629
to secure the D ring on and you're going to
pin it to the mitt. And then you're going

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.349
to pin the amazing size adjuster to the other
side, the opposite side of the D ring loop

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:17.750
and I just recommend sewing and tacking those
on. Ok great now that you got that done it's

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.949
time for the next step. Alright now it's time
to bring the exterior together. Sew like you

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.720
did with the lining. Sew each side using a
half inch seam allowance taking care to go

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.220
slow over the very thick sections where sewn
on the D ring and the size adjuster as there

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.950
is a lot of fabric and leave the top and the
bottom open. Alright now that you have your

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.000
exterior ready it's time to get you interior
and bring it all together. Taking the lining

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.630
you're going to stuff it inside the exterior
so right sides are touching. Line up the seams

00:04:51.630 --> 00:05:01.220
on the bottom, pin them together, and sew
them together using a half inch seam allowance.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.980
You're going to turn it right side out by
pulling it through the opening in the top.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:13.310
So you're going to pull it all the way out
then you're going to stuff the lining back

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.560
in. Then you're going to insert the scrapper,
loop the adjuster through the D ring, and

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:29.120
you are finished. Now one final thing even
though it is picky is you should try using

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:37.680
a little needle to pull fur out of the seam
of the cuff. It will just make it look nice.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.200
