00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:09.580
Hey, if you're into cute of all kinds, this
is the place to be.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:22.240
You are so adorable.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:36.690
So, this be one of your's here, Emily?

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.690
Yes.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.690
Can we get him out?

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.690
Yeah.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.690
I assume it's a he?

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.690
Yes.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.690
Oh yeah, what's his name?

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.690
His name is George.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.730
George, I like that.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.490
Hey, George.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.320
So, he's a Himalayan, right?

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.320
Yes.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.730
Now, what you recommend this rabbit breed
as one for young kids to start with?

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.730
Yeah, definitely.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.310
These are a lot more calmer, and you can pick
them up and play with them and stuff.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.310
Yeah.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.310
And they don't get crazy.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.310
Yeah.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.310
And has this guy been through the judging
yet?

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.340
Yes, he was just a second ago.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.340
Oh, really?

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.340
Okay.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.340
How'd he do?

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.619
He got 1st. 1st, well congratulations.

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.619
Thank you.

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:12.619
Yeah, that's excellent.

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.560
Hey, George, you got a blue ribbon.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.950
Hey, big boy.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.119
I love their pink eyes.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.119
Yeah.

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.520
They're almost like pink with a little bit
of violet in there too.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.520
Yeah.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.600
So, with George getting a blue ribbon, what
are some of the characteristics that you think

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.189
the judge saw about this particular rabbit
that gave him a blue ribbon?

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.569
In this one they look for themâ€“they're actually
supposed to see if they can fit in a Pringles

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:35.569
can.

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:36.569
In this breed.

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:37.569
Really?

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:38.569
Yeah.

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.010
So, they're a really long, narrow rabbit when
they stretch out?

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.010
Yes.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.530
Through a Pringles can?

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.530
Yeah.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.790
And then they look for the boots.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.790
They call these the boots.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.359
And they see how high they are.

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:48.719
Right, right.

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:49.719
That's fun.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.530
Actually, I saw earlier in the show, one the
ladies who works here as judge actually had

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.109
an apron on and had some Himalayans in the
apron.

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.139
They were just like laid back, so easy going.

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:01.959
It was really hilarious.

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.319
Pocket bunnies, or pocket pets she was calling
them.

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:05.319
Yeah.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.319
That's great.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.939
So they have to have a really long conformation.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.170
And the boot color has to be right.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.170
Yep.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.170
And what about ear length?

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.450
These, actually, they don't go on the length.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.280
Some of them, like the Mini-Rex's, they can't
have it passed their nose.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.930
So the color, the color shouldn't be passed
their nose.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.790
Yeah, they like it to kinda go like that.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.790
Right.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.790
George, you did so well.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.860
We're so proud of you, George.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.140
Thanks for sharing him with us.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.140
You're welcome.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.370
Yeah, great talkin' to you, Emily.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.690
Good work, keep it up.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.690
Thank you.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.170
