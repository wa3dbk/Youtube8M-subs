Style Question &amp; Answer - Male Fashion Tips

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.500
Hi!

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.870
I'm Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real Men

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.550
Today, I'm going to be talking about what
to wear on an anniversary date.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.900

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.030
Okay, this is the question that came in.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.130
"Antonio, I found myself in quite the pickle.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.130
I have an anniversary date this Saturday and
I'm taking my wife out to a dinner.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.860
The attire is assessed to be semi-formal.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.129
A dark suit with a modest tie would be perfect.

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.250
However, I currently don't have it.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.420
What I do have is a light brown suit, a blue
pinstripe suit, and an odd black suit with

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.379
about nine buttons and a half collar.

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.039
It looks like a military uniform.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.690
Money is a little tight right now.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.360
What would be your advice?

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.970
Thank you in advance."

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:01.970
Okay.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.500
That's an interesting group of suits he has
especially that last one, so let's go ahead

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.820
and throw this out there.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.689
The question is he's got a dinner date.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.159
He wants to look good with his wife.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.140
His wife actually probably is going to put
in a lot to her outfit and look very sharp,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.920
and he doesnâ€™t want to disappoint her.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.479
And so, what can he do?

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.960
My advice is immediately let's look at what
he can't wear or he shouldn't wear.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.689
He could wear it, but it's not going to be
recommended.

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.150
So immediately, that last suit with nine buttons
on the front, it does sound like a military

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.720
uniform and I don't know if this is like some
type of Nehru jacket or what he has going

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.410
on here maybe from the 1970s or maybe the
heyday of the 1980s, but I would say that

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.509
jacket, let's put it to the side and most
likely that needs to disappear, head off to

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.590
The Salvation Army or Goodwill.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.860
All right, the other two jackets, he's got
the pinstripe and the light brown.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.970
Now, the light brown is probably going to
be a jacket in which you're not -- that's

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.380
more of a day jacket.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.819
Thatâ€™s lighter colors.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.860
You see them during the day and you see them
during the summer.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.870
It's December, the year 2011, so I'm going
to say that yeah, let's not really go with

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.330
the light brown, although if that's your best
fitting jacket and it's going to, let's say,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:31.330
be an early date, maybe you could consider
it, but I'm going to lean towards the pinstripe.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.849
Normally on a pinstripe, I would say "no"
because pinstripes signify business, but it

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.250
sounds like it's a very light pinstripe.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.290
And if that pinstripe isn't really jumping
out at you, it may come across to most as

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.440
a solid, darker colored suit.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.940
So assuming that you've got the fit right,
that the style isn't outlandish or have really

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.830
wide lapels or anything like that, and again,
that the fit is good, I'm going to advice

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.250
you to go with the pinstripe suit.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.670
If you disagree, if you've got your own comments,
I would love to hear them down below.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.909
Otherwise, I'll see you guys in the next video.

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:05.069
Bye-bye.
