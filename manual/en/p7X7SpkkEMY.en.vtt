00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.689
Hi, my name is Ben and I'm going to show you
how to tie a tie.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.099
We're going to tie a Double Windsor Knot and
it is a very popular knot because it is symmetrical.

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:40.379
Ok, so the first step is to put you collar
up and put the tie around your neck.

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.890
I keep the long end in my right hand because
I'm right handed and the short end in my left

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.890
hand.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.269
The first step is to cross them over.

00:00:50.269 --> 00:01:01.440
Cross them over like that...you want about
a half a foot on the short end and you can

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.460
adjust depending on the size of your neck.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.820
One rule of thumb is that you'll see on most
ties that they've been...they have a little

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.320
line where the manufacturer sewed it.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.660
And so, you just line it up right there with
that line and you switch hands.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.250
Remember, I had it...I had the long end in
my right hand, well, I cross it over and I

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.770
switch hands like so.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:37.400
And then I take this end...the long end...and
I stick it up and behind ...through this little

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:46.650
hole that I have...so, behind and up through
the little hole and then pull it all the way

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.650
through.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.790
Then down.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.310
Now, I don't switch hands, I keep it on the
same side.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.670
Remember, before this tie was just coming
down strait but I went up through and then...and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.140
now I'm at this point.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.590
This time, we put it around back.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:12.120
We don't go through like we did last time,
we put it around back and then switch hands

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:20.270
right here and put it up through the front
of that hole between the necktie and your

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.270
neck.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.360
If you've done it correctly, what you have
is the inside of your knot.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.620
At this point you can kind-of shape it to
the shape you want.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.000
It is a triangle.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.240
Shape it to the shape you want and if you've
done it correctly, that is what it should

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.590
look like right there.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.620
The last step is to put a cover on the inside
of your knot.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.880
Push this around...you push it around all
the way...so you kind-of wrap that inside

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:04.340
knot and then push this up through the hole
between your neck and the tie.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.830
And once we pull this through we're going
to stick it through this little tunnel we

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.830
created.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.560
See, when we go around the front, we've created
a little tunnel that we can push the tie through.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:24.590
So, you push it up, pull it through and then
open up this little tunnel that you've created

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.960
and pull the tie down through.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:36.700
Keep the small end in the back and you just
kind-of tighten it and pull it like so.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:48.910
You can shape your knot however you want and
you just play with it till you get the tie

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.090
just how you want it.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.700
Tighten it up to your neck.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.980
Pull your collar down and walla!

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:14.280
Now, this tie is actually going to be a little
bit short when I line it up like I did at

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:24.169
the beginning, so when I tie this tie again
I'm going to not line it up with the line,

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.139
I'm going to make the wide end longer.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:45.620
The longer I make the wide end, the longer
it will be in the end.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.879
So, you need to practice it until you get
it right.

00:04:51.879 --> 00:05:19.360
I'll do it again to see if we can't get this
right.
