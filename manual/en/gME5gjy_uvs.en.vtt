&gt;&gt; Wade: Hi, I'm Wade Wingler with the INDATA
Project

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.620
at Easter Seals Crossroads in Indiana.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.870
Today we're going to talk about, you guessed
it, the iPad.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.360
You know, everybody's excited about Apple's
new product

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.450
that's out there taking the world by storm.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.880
Well of course we're interested in technology
because

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.759
we kind of get geeky about things like that,

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.900
but we're really interested in how can the
iPad

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.410
help people with disabilities be more independent.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.089
That's kind of what we're all about here.

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.990
So we're going to spend some time in the future

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.249
talking about the iPad and different things
that it does.

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:34.550
As most people know, it's kind of a laptop
replacement,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.900
or a larger sized iPod touch or a dozen similar
things to an iPhone.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.900
We'll spend some time on that.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.240
But one of the programs we want to talk about
today

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.450
was designed to work on the iPod touch in
the iPad.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.540
It's called iPrompts.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.650
It's a really cool program that does a few
things to help people

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.400
who have issues with memory, cognitive issues
to be productive

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.400
throughout their day.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.710
So for example, one of the things it does
is called Schedules.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.710
It has a list of things you can create to
help remind you

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.860
how to do things throughout the day.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.280
So for example, the one I have here is called
"Getting ready in the morning".

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.010
So we have "eat your breakfast", "getting
dressed", "brushing your hair",

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.900
"brushing your teeth", and it has both pictures
as well as text

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.960
to help somebody know what they should do
next.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.441
You can import these schedules from selected
ones that are already available,

00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:25.610
you can create your own.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.500
You can import pictures into this and make
them however you want.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.300
So you've got a series of different schedules
to remind somebody

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.170
how to be more independent throughout the
day.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.030
There's also a thing here called Countdown,
so if you told somebody,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.570
"Hey you need to spend at least 2 minutes
on washing your hands"

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.120
you can go in and set a Countdown, so that
somebody who's doing that activity

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.640
could have a picture to remind them to wash
their hands,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.480
and it counts down for 2 minutes and gives
you a visual representation here

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.590
of how much time you have left so that you
know when you've spent enough time

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.549
washing your hands, or brushing your teeth,
or those kinds of things.

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.420
You can also use it for basic choices.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.210
Now here I've got set up a Yes and No screen,
where somebody can indicate

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.979
with their hand or visually whether they're
answering yes or no to a question.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.450
You can also add pictures to make them a little
more intuitive

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.379
for folks who might not be literate and have
the ability to make choices like that.

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.400
Then there's a library application here that
lets you choose

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.420
from a lot of different pictures that are
already available

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.420
to help you set up Schedules or your Coundown
timer or your Choices.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.013
So there's a lot of things in here that have
a lot of

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:30.349
common household objects, different activities
of daily living,

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.030
things that everybody wants to be able to
do to indicate what they

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.120
want to be able to go out in the community
and spend their day

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.739
and do those kinds of things.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.590
So this is just one of the programs on the
iPad that we're going to be talking about.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.400
In the future, we may spend some time talking
about some voice recognition,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.401
some communication systems, and other everday
kinds of things

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.469
that you can do with an iPad.

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.859
So if you have questions about the iPad or

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.400
want to know how it might be useful for you,
let us know, help us choose

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.620
what those future Tech Tips might look like.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.749
So that's your Tech Tip for this week.

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.370
I'm Wade Wingler with the INDATA Project in
Indiana.
