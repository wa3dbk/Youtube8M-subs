00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.070
Nicola Di Pietro - Student: I visited the campus before applying and I liked it very much

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:35.040
and I like the program and everything related with food and nutrition is my passion, so I felt like at home here.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.890
Camilla DeHoscha - Student: It is a program that talks about biology, chemistry, nutrition

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.450
engineering. And it is also about one thing that is important to everyone that is food.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.500
I like to understand how things work in the human body and how can we

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.140
improve and optimize its mechanism through nutrition.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.840
Steve Boloudakis - Faculty: The Food Science Technology program is a three-year Advanced Diploma and there's 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.960
a two-year fast tracked option for students that have a university or college background in the related field.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.920
I learned how to develop and process the food with quality

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.909
to insure safety to it, and also I learn
how to be a good manager.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.030
One of the positions in the food industry that is called quality insurance manger.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.630
So, we need to make sure that the product is with high quality and it is safe for the people to eat

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.480
so we need to know how to deal with people.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:40.720
There's courses in food analysis, food product development, food regulations there's project courses 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.640
as well quality assurance, plant sanitation. It's important to learn the entire process so they understand

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.710
the science behind food being developed, the field, the quality measures that are taking in the production of food

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.869
and also the procedures that are required within the processing of a food product and sure that it's of

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.069
high quality, that its original, unique. Different types of food parts can be developed at the processing 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.840
stages as well, so they really learn the full gamete of information regarding food and the science behind it.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.800
