&gt;&gt;Dahlton Brown: I heard about the program LEAD, Leadership

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:08.990
Education and Development in business, I applied, got in and

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.149
when it said you're going to Stanford for three weeks I was

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:15.240
like, oh, hey, that's pretty awesome, working with Google,

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.250
Apple, Goldman Sachs. I was like, oh, I wonder if there's a

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.250
wrestling camp?

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.899
&gt;&gt;Jason Borelli: Shoulder, hip, knee, head, everything's in

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.419
a line for the most part.

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.099
&gt;&gt;Dahlton Brown: There's a week wrestling camp that our head

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.619
coach, Jason Borelli, puts on and it really set off my love

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:32.099
for Stanford.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.369
&gt;&gt;Jason Borelli: If I'm trying to get to my feet I wanna be

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:36.869
aligned so I can drive better.

&gt;&gt;Dahlton Brown: I live in Muwekma-tah-ruk which is themed

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.789
house here on campus. It's Pacific Islander or Native

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.269
American and we really function like a family here. I got in

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.889
through a scholarship through NAFOA, Native American Finance

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.389
Officers Association.

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.409
&gt;&gt;Professor: So that's going to bring us into the Indian

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:03.409
Removal Act

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.909
&gt;&gt;Dahlton Brown: I'm Miwok, from a small tribe in Wilton,

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.390
California. What I wanna major in pertains to Native law

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.829
especially gaming and tribal sovereignty. I wanna learn as

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:16.150
much as I can, not just about myself or not just about my

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.670
tribe but the Native American people.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.909
&gt;&gt;Professor: That's it. That's the document. That's where it

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:20.909
all starts.

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.329
&gt;&gt;male #1: I wanna welcome you all with all my heart and

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:26.599
tell you how incredibly important you are to this

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:35.560
institution and really to this nation.

[People chattering]

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.079
&gt;&gt;Dahlton Brown: I come from a small town so everybody's

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.079
super supportive, everybody knows your name, everybody knows

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.079
what you did this weekend so, like, my whole town of Jackson

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.250
really, like, helped me get here and my family, they always

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:50.109
told me you can do something great, Dahlton. You really can.

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:52.879
When it came through, you know, we'd like to offer you

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.629
admissions to Stanford University; I was like, uh, are you

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:55.629
sure?

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:56.629
[Laughs]

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:58.378
&gt;&gt;Dahlton Brown: This went to the right kid, right? It was

00:01:58.378 --> 00:02:01.164
just one of those moments and my mom didn't believe it when

00:02:01.164 --> 00:02:04.413
she got the, when I was in the living room and I was like,

00:02:04.413 --> 00:02:07.431
mom, I got in. She was like, "Stop it." I was like, no

00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:08.359
really, I got in.
