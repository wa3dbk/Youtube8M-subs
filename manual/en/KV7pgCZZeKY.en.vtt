00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:03.998
This is the University of Rochester.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.929
OK! Well,this is our eighth  annual pumpkin launch,
sponsored by the student  chapter of the American

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:17.310
Society of Mechanical  Engineers (ASME when
I get jargony). And, it's open  to anybody.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.000
We have high school kids  coming in, we have
high school kids from as far away  as Livonia

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.500
 - I'm not sure they're  coming this year 
- we have a number of city high  school kids

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.480
here this year. I think we're  going to have
 - this looks like our biggest one to  date.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.550
I'm imagining we're pushing  maybe a dozen
teams. We've got a team from RIT,  several

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.220
U of R teams, and some of the  high school
teams. Ah, we're from Livonia Central  School

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.640
District, the high school,  and we have one
group this year that's participating  with

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.190
our engineering development  and design course,
and we also have a POE group  that's participating.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.760
We actually had a second  group, but they kind
of lost theirs out of the back  of the truck

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.980
on the way here,
so it was in  pieces. So, we actually only

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.170
have one group. Most of them  are built 2 by
4s, bolted together. So you need a  saw, you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.909
need a drill, you need a  bunch of bolts, um...it's
not that big a deal. If  you're really cute,

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.000
then you go out and buy some  decent bearings.
That's the key to getting the thing  to swing

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
properly. There are two  categories of launchers.
There are the trebuchet, the  catapult kind

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.380
of thing that you all know  about, and then
there are people bringing air  cannons. Air

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.560
cannons, apparently, are  unlimited. So we've
had to say that you're not  allowed to go over

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.560
300 feet. But we have had air  cannons in the
past come fairly close to hitting the  fraternity quad.

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.569
So you want to put these in the pumpkins. (OK.) And where these land is where we score from.

00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:55.895
[ cheers ]

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Announcer: Well done!

00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:05.508
Announcer: Ok, you got a hop, skip and a roll.

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:07.500
Announcer: Pumpkin Pie launching....

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.640
[ cheers ]

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
[ groans, laughter ]

00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:22.923
[ cheers ]

00:02:27.122 --> 00:02:30.122
Announcer: OK, we have a last-minute Baja U of R  team.

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.339
Here they go with their air cannon.

00:02:36.642 --> 00:02:39.642
Ready?  You are ready.

00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:43.821
Safety off.

00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:46.701
[ cheers ]

00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:53.481
[ applause ]

00:02:54.568 --> 00:03:02.000
Oh my god, it's been a blast.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It's been a lot of learning and difficulties, problem solving, but it's been a blast.

00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:09.456
This is the University of Rochester.
