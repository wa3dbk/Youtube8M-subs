The Nokia Lumia 521 for T-Mobile has a compact
design in a tapered vessel that fits just

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.389
right in your hand.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:16.270
The removal back cover hides a 1,430,000 powered
battery that keeps the 521 going for nine

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.679
hours of talk time with 16 days of standby
time.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.740
Tucked in by the removal battery is a place
to install micro sim card to get you connected

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.470
to the T-Mobile network, and a place to increase
storage with the micro SD card.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.310
Powering the Lumia 521 is a one Gigahertz
dual-core processor in 512 Megabytes of RAM.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.610
It also has eight Gigabytes of on-board storage
to keep your music, movies and pictures.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.910
The colorful and active Windows phone eight
Operating System, running on the 521 looks

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.620
fantastic thanks to the 480 by 800 screen
resolution on the four inch LCD display.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.580
Navigating the Operating System is easy thanks
to the super response of touch screen in the

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.309
three navigation buttons at the bottom.

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.629
If you enjoy listening to music on your phone,
the Lumia 521 offers you a standard 3.5 millimeter

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.140
headphone jack so you can use your existing
headphones.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.679
To charge the 521, you simply use the included
micro USB charger that comes in the package

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.399
to plug it into a standard wall outlet, or
into a USB port on a computer.

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.170
Along the right side of the phone is the volume
up and down rocker switch, power and sleep

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.960
button, and a dedicated camera shutter button.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.539
Taking pictures on the Lumia 521’s five
Megapixel primary camera is simple and quick

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.219
thanks to a shortcut that launches the camera
application with a long press of the shutter

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:32.659
button.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.959
Using the shortcut will help you capture that
quick picture opportunity without the need

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:37.659
to unlock your phone.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.219
With its excellent integration with all Microsoft
products, the Lumia 521 seamlessly integrates

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:47.299
and displays information on live tiles on
the home screen for Microsoft exchange accounts,

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.719
Outlook calendars, and even your Xbox Live
account.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.590
Live tiles provide you information from within
the application without having to open up

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.829
the application.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.679
That’s a quick look at the Nokia Lumia 521
for T-Mobile.

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.469
My name is Scott Lewis for Wirefly.

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:03.049
Thanks for watching.
