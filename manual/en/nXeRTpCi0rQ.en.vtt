00:00:00.118 --> 00:00:04.388
(blissful Pakistani music)

00:00:05.452 --> 00:00:06.759
- So let's make our marinade.

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.569
Now for a base, I'm using Greek yogurt,

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:10.705
so let's season this up.

00:00:10.705 --> 00:00:12.370
Got some salt,

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:15.738
turmeric powder,

00:00:18.587 --> 00:00:20.307
coriander powder.

00:00:20.307 --> 00:00:21.907
All the ingredients are
gonna be listed below

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:23.659
under Show More.

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.110
Got some red chili for spice.

00:00:28.758 --> 00:00:30.502
Got some cumin.

00:00:31.583 --> 00:00:34.767
And my favorite, garam masala.

00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:41.878
Some ginger paste and some garlic paste.

00:00:48.788 --> 00:00:50.559
And then, I'm usin' some lime juice.

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.467
If you don't have that,
you can use lemon juice.

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:56.326
And as an optional item,
you can put a couple drops

00:00:56.326 --> 00:00:57.685
of red food coloring.

00:00:57.685 --> 00:00:58.876
You con't have to use these.

00:00:58.876 --> 00:01:00.465
All it's for is color.

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:03.545
Hence, the name food coloring.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.049
And then, we're gonna give
this a really good mix.

00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:08.776
So now we'll take our chicken,

00:01:08.776 --> 00:01:10.288
we'll put it into the marinade,

00:01:10.288 --> 00:01:13.236
and we're gonna mix it up really good.

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:18.716
After we get it mixed up, we'll
cover it with some plastic,

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:21.092
and we'll put it in the
refrigerator and let it marinate

00:01:21.092 --> 00:01:24.251
for one hour, and that'll
work out real good

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:27.035
'cause that'll give me time
to get the grill ready.

00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:29.619
Then, we'll start puttin'
our chicken on our skewers.

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.490
Gotta make sure they're
on there pretty good.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.586
Sometimes you gotta
kind of hook 'em around.

00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:36.871
Anyway what we'll do is we're
gonna put these on here,

00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:37.934
and we're gonna put 'em together.

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:40.104
Now, don't mash 'em real tight.

00:01:40.104 --> 00:01:43.463
Just kind of put 'em against each other.

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:44.939
And when you're done,
your skewer should look

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.557
just about like this.

00:01:47.668 --> 00:01:49.797
And when the grill's hot,
we're gonna put our skewers on.

00:01:49.797 --> 00:01:52.538
(chicken sizzles)

00:01:53.573 --> 00:01:56.077
And when it comes time, we're
gonna flip these things over.

00:01:56.077 --> 00:01:58.490
Now be careful 'cause they
could be kind of stuck.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.182
And if you do, just gently wiggle 'em

00:02:00.182 --> 00:02:01.335
and get 'em to break loose.

00:02:01.335 --> 00:02:02.522
You can see that one was stuck.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:05.257
I kind of broke it loose off camera.

00:02:05.257 --> 00:02:07.353
When I was in Pakistan working,

00:02:07.353 --> 00:02:10.502
chicken tikka was definitely
high on my list of favorites.

00:02:11.563 --> 00:02:12.873
When the chicken's fully cooked,

00:02:12.873 --> 00:02:14.643
and we've got some charred bits,

00:02:14.643 --> 00:02:15.722
then we're gonna take it off.

00:02:15.722 --> 00:02:17.662
We'll be ready to serve.

00:02:17.662 --> 00:02:20.757
So how does it taste?

00:02:22.924 --> 00:02:24.447
(laughs)

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:29.138
Definitely loaded with flavor.

00:02:29.138 --> 00:02:32.226
It's not too spicy, so if
you like it really spicy,

00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:34.178
be sure to add more red chili powder.

00:02:34.178 --> 00:02:35.901
But anyway, this is really good recipe.

00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:37.060
Hope you enjoy it.
