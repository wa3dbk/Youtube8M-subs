00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.320
Okay... long distance treks, crowded streets,
and fast paced activities. What do all of

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.980
these have in common? They are all situations
where tripods can't be easily used. Though

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.550
they are incredibly useful, sometimes tripods
just aren't convenient. In these situations,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.330
knowing how to get a steady just using your
hands can take your footage from being distracting

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.689
to looking professional.

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:37.269
By far the easiest way to keep your image
steady is to have the right kind of camera

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.210
with the right kinds of settings. In this
regard, a camera with an optical image stabilizer

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.570
built right into the lens can go a long way
in lessening the inevitable small shakes and

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.110
jostles while holding the camera in your hand.
An optical image stabilizer is a floating

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.920
lens element that can sense small movements
and then use magnets to move the lens in the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.390
opposite direction. It makes an image steadier
but often adds a lot to the price.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:08.580
ii.Camera Design - Of course, the shape and
weight of the camcorder body itself can also

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.619
help keep your image steady. A shoulder mounted
camera with a weighted back end keeps an image

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.890
steadier since it uses your body as a pivot
point for both the weight and the movement

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.640
of the camera. Also, since the arm that is
holding the camera is close to the body, vertical

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.560
drift is often eliminated with this kind of
camera design.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:34.039
iii.Wide shot - However, the easiest and most
effective way to make your image steadier

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.030
is to simply keep your zoom as wide as the
camera's lens will allow. Zooms not only magnify

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.540
objects in your frame, they magnify camera
shake as well. As a result zoomed images should

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.540
usually be avoided.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:54.020
Keeping the camera steady doesn't just involve
camera features and design, knowing how to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.069
position your body can be just as important.
Nowhere is this more important than the locked

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.759
down shot. The best way to keep a locked down
shot steady is by taking advantage of your

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.660
body's rigid skeletal structure. By placing
your feet slightly apart while keeping your

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.069
elbow and arm close and perpendicular to your
body, you can ease the burden of your arms

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.849
and utilize the steadiness of the bones in
both your arms and legs. Because your arms

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.060
are so close to your body, this method will
keep your shot from drifting vertically and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.739
laterally.

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.450
Low angle shots are a great way to add depth
and interest to your video. Interestingly

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.290
enough, capturing steady handheld low angle
shots are actually easier than capturing a

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.239
standing locked shot. This is due to the lower
center of gravity that the best methods use.

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.620
Getting down on one knee with your elbow resting
on your leg can help you keep a wider stance

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.090
and lower center of gravity. For really low
shots, sitting on the ground in a cross-legged

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.959
position with your elbows on your legs can
help you keep horizontal and vertical balance

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.880
as well.
iii.Natural Objects - Of course, using the

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.209
natural objects around you can also be an
extremely inexpensive way to keep your shot

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:19.510
steady. You can lean against a wall or tree,
sit in a chair with armrest, or use the top

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.690
of a car hood for a steady shot. The main
idea is that by giving your arm an anchor

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:32.299
to rest on, you can eliminate most of the
jittery movements from your video.

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.750
Though it may not initially seem like it,
complex camera moves are possible with and

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.019
without a tripod. Shots that usually require
tripods and tracks like pans, tilts, and dollies

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:52.459
can - with practice and planning - look just
as good as those shot in the movies.

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.049
The first advanced handheld movement is the
pan. A pan can be performed by first getting

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:04.349
in the locked down position, then determining
where you want your pan to start and end.

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.599
Lastly, rotate your torso using only your
hips from your starting position to your ending

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.609
position while gently shifting the weight
from one foot to the other. Of course, easing

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:24.130
into and out of your movement will make the
pan easier on your viewers.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.380
The next advanced handheld movement is the
tilt. A tilt can be achieved in a similar

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.180
manner to the pan. The biggest difference
is that instead of rotating the torso, you

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.169
must bend it forward or backward, depending
on the direction you want to go. For this

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.750
movement, it is a good idea to keep the camera
as close to your upper torso as possible since

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:52.449
that will give you the greatest tilt distance.
Probably the hardest advanced handheld movement

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.920
is the dolly. To perform a dolly movement,
it is best to keep the camera close to your

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.700
body while not touching your torso. Next,
bend your knees and walk forward in a gentle

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.280
heel to toe fashion. This will allow you to
get rid of the shaky impact of your foot hitting

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.889
the ground as well as most of the up and down
movement that walking usually requires. That

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.470
being said, this move will take the most practice
of all the advanced movements, but is usually

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:24.020
worth knowing as it can add color to a video.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.250
Like running the four-minute mile, steady
handheld shooting can seem impossible. However,

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.300
with a knowledge of steady camera and body
positions as well as practice and planning,

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.919
you can also make the impossible happen.
