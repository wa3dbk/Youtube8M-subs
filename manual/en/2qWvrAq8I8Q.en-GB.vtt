00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.890
Yamaha was the first to fuel India's obsession
with faired motorcycles, with the launch of

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.710
their
revolutionary track tool YZF-R15 in 2008*.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.889
A move that triggered the resurrection of
the dying brand here in India.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.130
Today Suzuki is walking on the same path with
the hope of repeating history with the launch

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.300
of the Gixxer SF

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.650
Only fully faired motorcycle in the 150cc
segment under 1 lakh, The SF doesn't get any

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.020
fuel injection or liquid cooling

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.120
Neither it is track focused, which obviously
raises a lot of questions, questions that

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.899
our fans the #PDArmy are seeking answers to

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.140
The answer to decipher if there is more to
the SF than just the cosmetic job that many

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.230
fear it to be.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.149
Our fan Joby started off with the most fundamental
question.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.399
and to answer that question we just have to
look at the data that Suzuki has compiled

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.640
through its extensive research

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.859
The 150cc category has registered consistent
growth year after year in the ever growing

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.600
Indian two-wheeler market

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.140
and Suzuki wants a piece of that pie by focusing
on what would appeal to the Indian youth.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.260
Their research showed that the big chunk of
the target audience did not care as much Cubic

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.220
capacity, Power figures or Acceleration as
much

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.120
as they did about styling and that most of
them were looking for a sporty ride for city

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.160
commutes and occasional Highway riding.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.540
This was the reason why Suzuki decided to
build on it's already successful Gixxer platform

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.720
and launch the Gixxer SF

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.880
Is there more to the fairing than just its
aesthetic value a question that our fan Prathamesh

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.110
expressed stating -

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.980
SF is designed by the same engineers from
Japan who designed the GSX-R. The sports fairing

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.730
has been aerodynamically tested

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.850
in the same wind tunnel where their MotoGP
bike the GSX-RR was tested, the idea was to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.850
decrease wind drag

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.160
and increase down force for high-speed stability

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.360
but other the fairing, aluminium finish on
the exhaust and cap and the new single piece

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.920
handlebar clamp, SF is identical to its naked
sibling from its flesh to the bones.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.209
Which means that the SF makes the same power and
torque as the Gixxer and is a good 4 Kgs heavier

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.859
thanks to the fairing and it's obviously gonna
take a hit on its performance, or will it.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.720
The Gixxer has its nose in front from the
dash to 0-60 but the SF catches up real quick

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.359
to record the same exact 0-100 timing. In
terms of top speed, the SF was able to record

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:50.760
a higher top speed of 122Kmph.
And also, better fuel economy in varied riding conditions.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.860
I absolutely love the solid front-end feel

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.129
of the Gixxer which rivals some track-focused
motorcycles from the higher segment and the

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.420
SF with more weight on the front is even better.
It offers even better feel and inspires more

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.480
confidence in braking and in the twisties,
it is even more poised at corner entry, allowing

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.189
you to commit to the corner without any hesitation.
It is also more stable in high speed corners.

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:25.529
The only limiting factors being the foot-pegs
which graze the ground very quickly limiting

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:30.400
your leans and corner speed. But for most this
won't be a problem, in fact this will be a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.700
solution for our fan Abhishek who wrote to
us saying...

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.960
The Gixxer and the SF share the same exact
rider's triangle, the ergonomics are exactly

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.359
the same, which means that the SF will be
just as comfortable as its naked variant in

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:55.859
the city and more so on the highway with the
fairing reducing the wind blast.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.480
A fan NsBeckham though had his apprehension
about riding this motorcycle in the city.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.120
The SF just like the Gixxer, comes with Suzuki's
patented technology called Suzuki Jet Cooling System.

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:14.400
The system sprays engine oil at high
speeds to the base of the piston and inside

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.180
valves of the cylinder, help cool it down
and apart from that, huge vents in the panel

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.020
have been designed to suck in air and divert
them towards the engine.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.080
And that seemed to work during our test because
we never faced any overheating issue.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.669
Which brings us to the expectations of enthusiasts
like me who feel that the SF should have been

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.430
offered also in a race variant, you know,
with clip-ons, with rear-sets and more power

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.330
to exploit the full potential of this chassis
and sticky MRF tyres as our fan Sriram puts it...

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.139
Well there is hope for us considering that

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.009
Suzuki India is entering the One-Make series
this year to be run along side the National

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:06.109
Championship and I have a feeling that the
race-spec SF could pretty much have everything that we seek.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.300
So to conclude, I'll admit that considering

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.699
how high a bar Gixxer had set, my expectations
from the SF were a lot more, I mean I feel

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.389
like it could have come with fuel-injection
and more power. But there's no denying the

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.940
fact that the SF definitely takes the game
forward in terms of braking, in terms of handling,

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.009
top speed and of course aesthetics and it's
gonna prove to be a mighty enjoyable ride

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.580
no matter who swings a leg over it.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.629
Did you notice anything weird about that video?
The part where I was riding on the streets

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:46.169
wearing nothing else but just a helmet? It
did look odd right and I felt ever odder cause

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.490
here at PowerDrift we believe in the concept
of All The Gear All The Time. Because plain

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.610
and simple it saves your life. So if you're
inclined on buying such sporty motorcycles

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.319
like the SF, invest in good gear and wear
it all the time.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:03.099
