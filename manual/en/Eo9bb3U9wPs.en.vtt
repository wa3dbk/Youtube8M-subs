00:00:10.658 --> 00:00:13.400
Right now, right now,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.560
400 millon miles away in space,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.498
there's a spacecraft 
circling around a comet

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:22.068
looking for a place to land.

00:00:22.068 --> 00:00:26.101
This is actually happening 
right now, and in just a little while,

00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:28.820
we are going to get a chance
for the first time in history

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.306
to land on a comet.

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:33.976
It's amazing. It blows my mind.

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:37.759
I say 'we' fairly loosely
because I'm not a scientist,

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:39.819
I'm not an engineer,
I'm an artist.

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:42.056
But these comet hunters
came to me and asked me

00:00:42.056 --> 00:00:45.362
if if I could help them
teach people about comets.

00:00:45.364 --> 00:00:46.954
And I said, yes!

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:50.278
The problem was I didn't know
anything about comets.

00:00:50.278 --> 00:00:52.460
But I was willing to learn.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.531
And I had a really great opportunity
to go and interview

00:00:56.531 --> 00:00:59.711
some of the world's
famous rocket scientists.

00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:02.639
And my mission
was to pique their brains

00:01:02.643 --> 00:01:05.853
to try to figure out everything
I could learn about comets.

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.678
And it turns out comets
are incredibly interesting.

00:01:11.512 --> 00:01:12.977
First thing I learned is

00:01:12.977 --> 00:01:17.417
that comets are like
giant mountains of ice

00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:20.427
and when they get near the Sun,

00:01:22.717 --> 00:01:24.327
they get heated up,

00:01:24.327 --> 00:01:26.690
and they shoot out
these jets of water vapour

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.070
that form around the comet 
and then eventually strech

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.947
into these beautiful and magnificent tails
that streak across the sky.

00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:40.156
I also found out that comets
are really, really old.

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.099
Comets may come from a very, 
very, very beginning of our Solar System.

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.669
And in fact, if you were to get
a piece of a comet

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:49.779
and look at it and study it,

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:54.001
it's literally like looking back 
in time, 4.6 billions years,

00:01:55.068 --> 00:01:57.020
to the beginning of our Solar System,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.260
when all of this, we were, 
just all of us, a swirling cloud of dust.

00:02:00.615 --> 00:02:04.615
I also found out that comets
may have delivered

00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:07.925
some to all of the Earth's water.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.530
I mean, think about that,
tha's crazy.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.508
Every time you drink a glass of water,

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:15.918
you may be drinking comet water.

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:22.136
We are made up of water, partially, right?

00:02:22.136 --> 00:02:23.659
There's lot of water in us

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.669
so we maybe be made up
from the stuff of comets.

00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:29.739
So, you can imagine,
at the end of this day,

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.579
my mind was just reeling.

00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:35.765
But I had one interview left,

00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:38.464
and I was so excited for this

00:02:38.464 --> 00:02:42.974
because it was perhaps one 
of the world's greatest comet scientists.

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:46.664
And he walked in, he sat down,

00:02:48.294 --> 00:02:50.114
and he looked up at me,

00:02:51.176 --> 00:02:54.683
and just before I could even jump into
my questions, he said first:

00:02:54.683 --> 00:02:58.443
"David, what are you going to say

00:02:58.443 --> 00:03:01.170
to make people care about comets?"

00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:04.987
I thought, this is my chance.
I can tell everything I've learned.

00:03:04.987 --> 00:03:08.927
So I thought, maybe I'll talk
about the instruments on the spacecraft,

00:03:08.927 --> 00:03:13.267
or the diameter of the comet,
the surface, what we know about it.

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:14.765
And he said: "David, no,

00:03:15.658 --> 00:03:17.835
people don't care about that.

00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:20.195
People care about emotion.

00:03:21.575 --> 00:03:24.206
Do you realize we are about

00:03:24.206 --> 00:03:27.546
to land on a comet
and ride it around the Sun?"

00:03:28.463 --> 00:03:30.173
And I said: "Wow!

00:03:30.751 --> 00:03:33.721
Out of all the things I've learned, 
science and technology

00:03:33.721 --> 00:03:37.001
and pouring, feeding my brain
trying to figured it out,

00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:41.353
I ended up with this vision
of a wild cowboy

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:44.615
riding a comet across 
the Solar System around the Sun.

00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:49.355
I couldn't believe it, and he reminded me 
of something that was so important to me,

00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:55.539
it's that, sometimes we need to focus
on something a little bit different

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.425
so that the facts can come through.

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:04.345
He changed my ideas from questions
of logic to questions of wonder.

00:04:05.043 --> 00:04:08.193
It's an amazing thing, this wonder.

00:04:08.193 --> 00:04:10.306
My questions became:

00:04:10.306 --> 00:04:14.395
"What would it be like to walk
inside the tail of a comet,

00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:17.729
to feel comet dust breeze
across your face?"

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.939
"What would it be like to be
inside that tail and just experience it?"

00:04:24.387 --> 00:04:27.777
Well, we had an opportunity
to do something about that.

00:04:28.947 --> 00:04:32.367
This is a picture of something
I created with my colleagues

00:04:32.367 --> 00:04:34.807
to celebrate comets,

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:37.130
the transformation that they go through

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.750
from rocks of ice
to these brillant and beautiful things.

00:04:42.905 --> 00:04:45.185
We wanted to give people the opportunity

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:48.256
to experience that wonder
but at human scale.

00:04:50.237 --> 00:04:55.827
And so, when I think about wonder, 
I think about-- it's a powerful thing.

00:04:55.827 --> 00:04:59.930
It starts in our heart
and rises up to our brain.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.850
It's the mother of curiosity.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.449
It's the driving force

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.780
that provides the desire
for us to learn and to understand.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.132
It's where science is born.

00:05:11.992 --> 00:05:15.992
And when art and science 
come together to provoke wonder,

00:05:17.454 --> 00:05:21.854
we get to the root
of why we explore, why we research,

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:25.454
and why we´ve been chasing
this comet for the past ten years,

00:05:25.454 --> 00:05:27.194
trying to land on it.

00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:29.398
Why do we do this? Why?

00:05:29.398 --> 00:05:31.649
It´s because we need to know.

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.819
I believe that we're experiencing
a Renaissance

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:39.609
where art and science serve
to elevate each other.

00:05:41.295 --> 00:05:45.565
If we want to raise the value 
of science in our culture

00:05:45.565 --> 00:05:47.725
what we need is more art.

00:05:48.743 --> 00:05:51.232
It's a beautiful thing, I mean,
nature has its beauty

00:05:51.232 --> 00:05:54.342
that deserves the attention
of both the mind and the heart.

00:05:54.342 --> 00:05:57.504
And I think that the role of art

00:05:57.504 --> 00:06:00.664
is not to inform people,

00:06:00.664 --> 00:06:04.898
but it´s really to get them
to experience something

00:06:04.898 --> 00:06:06.768
through the heart of emotion

00:06:07.653 --> 00:06:10.593
so that they can go on to ask questions.

00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:13.059
We want to plant the seeds of curiosity

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:15.419
so that they can go on
and do it for themselves,

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.179
they can find out for themselves,
through their own curiosity.

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:23.010
And when you see images like this,

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.582
and sometimes we think
they're wonders for children, right?

00:06:26.582 --> 00:06:29.508
But it´s not. It´s for all of us.

00:06:30.193 --> 00:06:33.313
It´s actually an emotion
that defines our own humanity.

00:06:33.313 --> 00:06:36.323
It´s one of the great gifts that we get.

00:06:36.323 --> 00:06:39.649
And so, I ask you,
when you feel it next time,

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.286
let it in.

00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:44.037
Let it start that spark

00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:46.876
that rises from the heart up to the mind,

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:50.741
because it could blossom into passion.

00:06:50.741 --> 00:06:55.060
And with passion, then 
that can take you to places

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.330
that we can only dream of now.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.453
Thank you.

00:06:58.453 --> 00:07:00.193
(Applause)
