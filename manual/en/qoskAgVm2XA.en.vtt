Hi Jackie this is Jon here at Handy Toyota,
I know you had some interest in the Prius

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.890
that's why I'm showing you the 2014 Prius
2.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:17.660
Which is right here in our winter grey color
its gonna get 51 MPG on the highway and I'll

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.200
say that again 51 MPG on the highway.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.420
It's actually 2013's best overall value award
winner for 2013.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:35.519
Your gonna have 13 inch wheels, you have power
and heated folding mirrors.

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:41.149
One of the cool things about this vehicle
under the hood your gonna have a hybrid synergy

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:52.579
drive, as you can see here the hybrid synergy
drive is a drive train that combines a gasoline

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.089
engine two electric motors a continuously
variable transmission and a high voltage battery

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.519
pack that powers the larger of the two motors
when its driving the wheels.

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.490
The hybrid synergy drive can operate an electric
only, gas only, or combine electric and gas

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.780
mode.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.420
Alright now were in the back of the vehicle
here and you can see here we have a rear spoiler

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.600
and all of our 2014 hybrids are gonna have
this nice blue outline here on our Toyota

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600
logo.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.079
Open the trunk, see there's a lot of room
for storage a lot of space in here, if you

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:39.880
want your things private cover it right up,
got some storage area here.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.090
All of our Prius's come standard with a smart
key system so your gonna put it where ever

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.729
you want put your foot on the brake hit the
button, starts right up.

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.110
your gonna notice its a very quite start to
the vehicle and that's because your hybrid

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.360
engines gonna start first very quietly and
then about after 20 seconds your gasoline

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.840
motor will start then.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.170
Your gonna have a touch screen display here,
here you have CD, AM, FM, one of the things

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.740
you'll notice that's a little different is
the way you shift into gear you actually turn

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.650
this knob over, down, and then it goes right
back to where it started and then the car

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.510
will move, go into reverse same deal it will
beep when you go into reverse and you park

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.090
the car your just gonna hit this button here
and it goes right into park and it gives you

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.170
a whole new feel of driving, its pretty cool
its almost like driving in a video game, that's

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.970
how I like to explain it.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.760
One of the other cool things you'll see is
all the nice display things here your gonna

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.080
have a multi informational display with your
odometer, your gonna have fuel economy, history,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.930
your average fuel economy, your distance to
empty, your speed, your trip distance, your

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:12.110
energy motor, your hybrid system indicator,
and your eco savings for record.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.709
Alright Jackie I bet your wondering what else
comes with this vehicle but don't worry I'm

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:17.709
gonna tell you.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.290
You have a storage space here, this is actually
also where your USB and AUX ports are going

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.720
to be and you come forward your gonna see
you get a cup holder here and another cup

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.610
holder here, you have the ability to go into
EV, ECO, and power mode, it also has cruise

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.180
control, you also have all your controls here
on your steering wheel you can control everything

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.319
on your display, you also have hands-free
Bluetooth capabilities which you can control

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.689
through your steering wheel and microphone
up here.

00:03:53.689 --> 00:04:01.909
Alright Jackie here's a fun fact of the day,
the word Prius actually means safety in Japanese,

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:07.909
I actually just lied to you right there, I'm
sorry I don't know why I did that, I'm sorry.

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:13.320
But seriously let me ask you a question, is
safety important to you?

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.450
I'm sure you answered right there and your
talking to the screen and its weird, but its

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.050
cool.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.830
This comes standard with 7 airbags, so if
safety is important to you I bet that's a

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.790
good fact for you.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:39.540
