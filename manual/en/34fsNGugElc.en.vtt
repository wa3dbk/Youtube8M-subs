00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:08.170
 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.709
I am Kelsey Mays for cars.com were
at the 2013 New York International Auto

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.330
Show looking at land rovers

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.750
latest redesign the new Range Rover
sport

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.240
Range Rover Sport slots between Land
Rovers Range Rover Evoque

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.310
and the flagship Range Rover itself
it'll be a little difficult to tell them

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.599
apart now that the sport

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.050
adopted siblings sorta windswept
tactical styling will cover what

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.770
differentiates the sport which competes
with cars like the Porsche Cayenne and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.950
the Mercedes m-class

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.920
come join us Range Rover Sport actually
looks a little more like be invoked in

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.450
the Range Rover if you look closely

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.710
things like vertical sections here where
the fog lights go

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.810
if you come along the side easy way to
tell them three vehicles apart actually

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.960
is look at the Beltline

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.320
the Range Rover Evoque has a very
sharply rising beltline

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.630
the Range Rover has a very flat beltline
the sport

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.770
has kinda one that goes on between rises
very gently

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.200
let's take a look inside see how that
affects visibility it's actually not too

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.670
bad the windows don't taper off too much
and so

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.960
next level OTA visibility looking over
your shoulder up the rear head

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.539
restraints

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.649
are very big typical Land Rover and they
do take up

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.130
a lot of space if you look straight back
can mature over what you'd expect for

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.549
ok have a mid-tier luxury SUV lotsa
leather leather long the dashboard

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.109
others even sitting around steering
wheel here

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.399
%uh Land Rover has ditched the rotary
knob in the Range Rover and Range Rover

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.939
Evoque

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.090
as a transmission for this transmission
gearshift right here

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.200
on it's got electronic the tents I'm
very common among luxury car makers now

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.899
not even feel good and be Range Rover
Sport

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.039
kinda the same story Land Rover's
Terrain Response System now has an auto

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.689
setting

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.289
which automatically detects what's
around you and adapts the drivetrain

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.409
suspension systems

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.799
the kinda suit that if you don't use it
you can still rotate over to

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.770
various modes here

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.210
second row a little bit tight here with
leg room um

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.880
I've got enough but people are taller
might find that it's a little bit short

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.490
for them are about six feet tall that's
where I would set to drive ahead room is

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.790
excellent but the sea could set a little
bit higher of the ground here my knees

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.290
our little bit up in the air especially
given all the extra headroom I was Land

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.710
Rover

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.980
race to see a little bit very
comfortable back here plenty of features

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.700
we've got individual climate controls in
this car the other show a heated

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.720
and cooled seats on very luxurious
there's occasional use

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.840
third row um basically it's for kids are

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.840
teenagers or something like that it's
optional land rover expects

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.040
00 20-30 percent have a Range Rover
Sport shoppers

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.790
to eventually buy it a note about
engines

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.010
there's actually a supercharged v6 now
available that also v8s a

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.500
less power than before but the Range
Rover Sport

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.630
through the use of extensive aluminum a
parts

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.230
is 800 pounds later than the last Range
Rover Sport

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.520
that means it's quicker and more
fuel-efficient despite having

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.360
less power you know it's like losing a
guerilla even in its final year on the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.840
market the old Range Rover Sport

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.150
outsold the Range Rover in the Range
Rover Evoque combined

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.530
its successor arguably has more reason
to use the Range Rover name

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.019
Land Rover says to develop both Range
Rover and Range Rover Sport

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.040
together and so there's a lot to share
components as opposed to last time

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.489
around on the old Range Rover Sport was
on a completely

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.510
separate platform stay tuned for more
news because the Range Rover Sport goes

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.180
on sale

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.850
this August
