00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:05.964
(cassette tape rewinding)

00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:08.384
("Soul Kitchen" by The Doors)

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:09.673
- Are you hungry?

00:00:09.673 --> 00:00:10.844
- Why you ask that?

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.352
- Well, maybe we can order
our for some sandwiches

00:00:13.352 --> 00:00:17.131
or some chicken delight or something.

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:27.366
You're not hungry?

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:27.952
How about you?

00:00:27.952 --> 00:00:29.280
Are you hungry?

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:31.764
Oh, it's lunch time.

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:33.398
Did you have breakfast this morning?
- Yeah.

00:00:33.398 --> 00:00:34.576
You did?

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:35.609
What'd you have?

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:38.267
- Oh, little things

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:39.950
like chocolate cake and tea.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.386
- Is that all you had?

00:00:41.386 --> 00:00:41.810
- That's all I want.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.975
- You should eat more, Howard.

00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:45.150
(laughing)

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.961
- You put on a lot of weight.

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:48.123
Are you eating a lot?

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.685
- Well,

00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:53.703
you know, that's something that's

00:00:53.703 --> 00:00:55.901
really bothers me.

00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:58.443
What's wrong with being fat?

00:00:58.443 --> 00:00:59.547
That's what I want to know.

00:00:59.547 --> 00:01:00.962
Why is there such,

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:02.529
- I didn't say there's
anything wrong with it.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:05.967
- Why is it so odorous to be fat?

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:12.378
I don't see anything wrong with fat.

00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:14.016
You know.

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:19.016
I remember when I use to weigh 185 pounds.

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.452
I'm the same height.

00:01:21.452 --> 00:01:22.874
I was the same height that I am now

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:24.974
and I weighed 185 pounds.

00:01:24.974 --> 00:01:26.995
And I was going to college

00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:30.699
and I had this food
ticket at the cafeteria

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:33.694
and the cafeteria food is mainly

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:35.179
all based on starch,

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.955
you know, it's cheap food, right?

00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:39.381
And so, I don't know what it was,

00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:42.378
but in order, I don't know,
I just felt like I was,

00:01:42.378 --> 00:01:44.176
if you missed your
meal, you just, you know

00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:46.580
I just figured, well I was
getting screwed, right?

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.880
If I missed a meal, I just blew it.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.493
("Why Do You Love" by The Doors)

00:01:51.493 --> 00:01:53.327
So, I'd get up

00:01:53.327 --> 00:01:58.327
at 6:30 every morning just
to make breakfast, right.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.833
(laughing)

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:05.700
Eggs and grits and sausages

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.112
and toast, milk.

00:02:10.112 --> 00:02:12.916
And I'd go do a few classes

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:16.055
and I'd make it in there for lunch.

00:02:17.392 --> 00:02:20.681
Mashed potatoes.

00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:21.733
You know, every now and then

00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:25.391
they'd put a little piece of
meat or something, you know.

00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:27.456
And I'd go to a few more classes

00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:28.966
and then I'd go to dinner.

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:32.760
And it was more mashed potatoes.

00:02:41.052 --> 00:02:45.058
And so, about three months
later I was 185 pounds

00:02:45.058 --> 00:02:46.253
and you know what?

00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:48.348
I felt so great.

00:02:48.348 --> 00:02:51.814
I felt like a tank, you know?

00:02:51.814 --> 00:02:53.218
I felt like a,

00:02:53.218 --> 00:02:56.632
like a large mammal.

00:02:56.632 --> 00:02:58.733
A big beast.

00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:00.938
When I moved through the corridors

00:03:00.938 --> 00:03:02.413
or across the lawn,

00:03:02.413 --> 00:03:04.722
I just feel like I could knock anybody

00:03:04.722 --> 00:03:07.497
out of my way, you know?

00:03:07.497 --> 00:03:10.087
I was solid, man.

00:03:10.087 --> 00:03:12.350
It's terrible to be thin and whispy

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.216
because, you know, you
could get knocked over

00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:20.594
by a strong wind or something, man.

00:03:20.594 --> 00:03:23.575
Fat is beautiful.

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.083
- How much do you weigh now?

00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:28.511
- I don't know, to tell you the truth.

00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:32.214
I guess somewhere in the
neighborhood of about 150.

00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:35.213
- Really?

00:03:35.213 --> 00:03:36.076
- Uh huh.

00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:39.169
You want to compare biceps?

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.177
(laughing)

00:03:41.177 --> 00:03:43.476
Do you want to bet arm
wrestling match, Howard?

00:03:43.476 --> 00:03:44.871
Are you ready?

00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:47.190
Are you in shape?
- Alright, yeah.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.573
Well, the interviews over.

00:03:48.573 --> 00:03:51.335
(laughing)

00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:55.629
