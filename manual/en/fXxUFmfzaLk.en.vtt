00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:09.930
The bell at the Shirpoor School in Kabul is
a rusty Soviet-era rocket shell.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.860
Hedayatullah Mardanzai has been its director
since 2006.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.410
He still makes sure all the students arrive
on time.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.060
“In our school we have seven hundred students
in total.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:31.310
Five hundred and twenty-eight men and one
hundred and forty women, those who had no

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.850
access to education because of poverty and
the civil war.”

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.219
Afghanistan has already seen vast improvements
in its educational services.

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.770
Before the fall of the Taliban in 2001 only
fifty thousands of the one million children

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.100
in school were girls, but since international
intervention that figure has risen to eight

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.489
million, including three million girls.

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.649
But with five million children still out of
school, the Afghan government is working hard

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.550
to provide the much-needed access to education.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:17.729
“We have a plan to establish two literacy
schools in each province in the whole country.

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:30.480
One of these schools should be for professional
skills learning and the other one for literacy.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:40.770
Those who are not educated now they can study
and learn skills such as art, how to use a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.930
computer and English language.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.229
They can learn these skills after their work.”

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.720
Through these programs which include classes
in basic literacy, art, biology and religion,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.290
the Shirpoor School has been able to provide
education to men and women up to forty-five

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.470
years of age.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.009
For some of them this school means an once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.149
“My name is Ali.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.970
I am thirty-years old and I am a policeman.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.900
Because of the civil war and emigration, I
could not continue my education, and now I

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.160
can do that here.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:28.140
After receiving a diploma from this school
I would like to join the police academy and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.280
continue my job.”

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.200
“My name is Rita Wajma.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.310
I have been working at the Radio Television
Afghanistan for twenty-nine years.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.190
I was illiterate, and this is why I enrolled.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:58.800
I hope one day I will be able to read and
write and achieve my goals.”

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.720
Like the other twenty-nine state-run evening
schools in Kabul, the Shirpoor School constantly

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.650
struggles to maintain its services.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.930
The demand for education is such that tents
contain the overflow of students.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.320
The director says they don’t receive enough
financial support from the Government.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.150
Beside that, there are still cultural barriers
to break down.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.959
“In our society we have fathers who are
illiterate and they have old prejudices.

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.330
So we need to change this by teaching them
and then they will encourage their children

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.560
to be educated.”

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.750
But with an increasing numbers of girls and
boys in schools in Afghanistan, Ministry of

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.319
Education’s biggest challenge is currently
facing the lack of trained teachers, essential

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.519
equipment and lack of infrastructure.

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.690
Nevertheless Mr. Mardanzai says prospects
for education in the country are looking up.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.540
“We have an Islamic saying that says: ‘study
from cradle until the grave’.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.299
Therefore, it is never too late and should
learn anytime possible.

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.180
