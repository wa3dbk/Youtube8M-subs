00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.000
Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.240
This is Marc at the National Weather Service
in Norman with a briefing on severe weather

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.500
potential over the upcoming Mothers’ Day
weekend.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.320
Here’s the thing, it’s May and we’re
expecting what we normally get this time of

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.700
year – severe weather.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.160
We’ll see our first chance of severe storms
on Saturday, though any storms that do form

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.780
will be few and far between.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.060
There’s even a chance that there won’t
be any storms on Saturday.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.960
Anyway, if storms to develop, they’ll probably
be severe with large hail and damaging winds.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.890
Sunday will hold greater potential for severe
storms across a good part of Oklahoma and

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.930
western north Texas, and severe weather potential
is likely to persist right into Monday morning.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.579
So, if you have travel plans this weekend,
either to attend a graduation ceremony or

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.110
visit mom, you’ll want to keep a very close
eye on things!

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.890
Here’s what Saturday looks like.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.700
While the environment will be favorable for
severe storms over much of the area, only

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.020
a small part of northern and central Oklahoma
looks to favor actual thunderstorm initiation.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.850
We’ll be dealing with a strong cap over
much of the area, so there is a chance that

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.140
no storms will develop, which would be good
for everyone.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.250
However, if a storm or two do manage to form,
they will likely be severe with large hail

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.390
and strong damaging winds.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.440
Storms will diminish after sunset.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.070
Much of Sunday morning and early afternoon
will be dry – perfect for Mothers’ Day

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.920
festivities, however, by mid to late afternoon,
isolated storms may develop over portions

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.850
of northern and western Oklahoma and western
north Texas, spreading eastward through early

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.850
evening.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.659
Initially, the storms may be high based and
pose mainly a large hail and damaging wind

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.710
threat, but as we head into the evening hours,
conditions will become more supportive of

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.570
tornadoes.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.720
Additional storms are likely to develop from
Sunday evening through the overnight hours.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.120
Storms that were initially discrete may merge
into clusters or lines.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.670
Stronger storms may continue to produce very
large hail and damaging wind gusts.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.260
Training of storms over the same area may
also lead to a localized flash flood threat.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.280
Any storm that remains isolated from early
evening through midnight will carry a threat

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.640
of tornadoes, but the tornado threat should
generally decrease from midnight onward.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.349
Storms are expected to merge into one or more
clusters or lines as they move southeastward

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.379
overnight into Monday morning.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.769
Stronger storm cells within the cluster or
line will continue to pose a threat of large

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.750
hail and damaging winds.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.069
Heavy rainfall may also become more of a concern
over portions of south central and southeastern

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.680
Oklahoma leading to flooding of low lying
and poorly drained areas.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.159
Slide 7
Severe potential should slowly wind down by

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:55.099
Monday morning, though some hail and wind
threat will persist.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.980
Heavy rainfall will likely become the main
concern as training storms dump heavy rainfall

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.730
over the same areas.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.139
This may lead to localized flooding.

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:11.810
It’s May and you’re in the Southern Plains.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.739
You should never fear severe weather!

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.299
Just make sure you have a plan for it.

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.450
Check that phone app, favorite TV network
or local NWS page before you head out!

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.489
Be sure to check back for updates, as the
forecast can change very quickly.

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.109
Make sure you have some way to receive severe
weather information while not at home, such

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.159
as a cell phone, or portable weather radio!

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.420
Always have multiple ways to receive warnings,
don’t wait for outdoor warning sirens to

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.120
alert you to an impending hazard.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.620
They are not intended for people indoors.
