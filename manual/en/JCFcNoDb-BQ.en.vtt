00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.340
Hello and welcome to Adrian Steel's demonstration
of the two position partition for Transit

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.680
Connect Wagons.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.179
The Transit Connect is a unique vehicle, as
it allows for the seats to move forward, providing

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.809
more cargo room.

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.070
So here's the demonstration of repositioning
the partition with the seats folded.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.340
Once you've removed and stowed the headrests
of the seats, you can move the seats forward

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.009
as outlined in the Transit Connect instructions.

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.110
Then loosen the two hand knobs on the two
position partition.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.800
And now you're ready to slide the partition
forward into its second position.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.510
Once in the next position, then tighten the
hand knobs.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:56.620
Sliding the partition is easy with the heavy
duty, ball bearing slides.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:04.000
You can gain as much as twenty inches by moving
that partition forward.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.909
Now let's show you how to reposition the partition
to allow for the second row seats.

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:23.600
You start by loosening the hand knobs that
will release the partition.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.909
Once the hand knobs have been loosened, you
can slide the partition easily back to that

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:28.909
position.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.719
Following the instructions of the Transit
Connect seats, there is a yellow lever you

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:42.149
will release to pull the seats back down,
and then up, and they'll snap back into position.

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.450
Once it's in position, be sure to fasten the
hand knobs.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.639

your Adrian Steel sales representative.

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:52.069
