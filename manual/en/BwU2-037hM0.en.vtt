Hi, in

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.750
this video I'm going to talk a little bit
about the A minor blues; i'm going to start

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.610
with a basic set of chords, it will be a twelve
bar chord progression, and then we'll develop

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.400
the progression by adding in some bass notes
and this will create a walking bass type of

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.290
effect and that can be very useful if you
are working in say ... a duo situation were

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.230
you want to create some movement and some
interesting flavours behind the soloist.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:39.230
So, I'll start by relating the twelve bar
A minor chord progression of the blues, I'll

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.570
try and relate that firstly to the standard
twelve bar blues progression that we would

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.909
know say ... in the key of A ... A major.
So, I'm going to start by running through

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.030
a typical chord progression for the twelve
bar blues in A major: we'd have four bars

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.030
of A, two bars of D, two bars of A, two bars
of E and then back to two bars of A.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.280
Now, to convert that progression over to the
A minor blues chord progression all I'm going

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.050
to do is change the A chords into A minor,
so that means our chord progression will be

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.410
four bars of A minor, then I'm going to change
the D chords into D minor ... two bars of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.170
D minor, then back to two bars of A minor
... 
the E major chord, I'm going to change to

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.959
E seventh, so that will be two bars of E seventh,
then coming back to finish on two bars of

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.959
A minor.
So, that's the chord progression you will

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.940
see in front of you on the screen: four bars
of A minor, two bars of D minor, two bars

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.140
of A minor, two bars of E seventh back to
two bars of A minor.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.140
And here's how the A minor blues progression
sounds ... one, two, three, four ... 
A minor, D minor, A minor, E seventh, A minor.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.120
The next step is to spice up that basic chord
progression with a few little surprises, and

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.870
the first surprise is going to occur in bar
nine; and what we're going to do there is

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.379
instead of going directly to the E seventh
chord we're going to start on an F seventh

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:22.620
in bar nine and then we'll go the E seventh
in bar ten.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.620
So, here's how that would sound we'd go F
seventh, E seventh then back to A minor in

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:39.559
bar eleven and twelve.

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:46.419
So, here's the chord progression now with
our surprise in bar nine, I'll start right

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:53.419
at the beginning of the progression; one,
two, three, four ... A minor, D minor, A minor,

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:17.370
here's the F seventh, E seventh, A minor
