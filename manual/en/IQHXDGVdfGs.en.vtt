Hello. This Is "Is It A Good Idea To Microwave This?" And I'm Your Host Jory Caron.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.800
Wow. An Egg. America's Pastime.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.700
Weather You Like It Scrambled, Sunnyside Up, Or Roasted, Toasted, And Blown Up In A Microwave

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.800
There Still Good To Eat. So Let's Go Find Out Which One It Does.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.800
Let's Go Roast Some Nuts

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I Wonder How Long I should Put It In Their For

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.000
Okay

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.800
Ventalation Is Key

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.500
Oh Jeez

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.500
Safety Is Our Number One Concern

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.300
Yeah. I Think It's Just Gonna Catch Fire

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.700
Because Nobody Likes Roasted Nuts

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.100
Definitely A Good Idea

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.100
STOPING STOPING

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.900
"Is It A Good Idea To Microwave This?"

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.100
Let's Go Find Out.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
Here At The Jory Caron Laboratory Number 2

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.400
Safety Is Our Number One Concern.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.500
We Have A Tin Foil Shield Here. To Protect Our Nuts

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
'Cause Nobody Likes Roasted Nuts.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.800
We Also Have A Proper Ventalation System Consisting Of Two Fans.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.300
And As Always, Old Reliable, Sharp Microwave.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.000
So In Goes The Egg.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.800
Okay. I Wonder How Long I Should Put It In There For?

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.200
[Jon] Three Minutes.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.000
[Jory] Three Minutes. Okay.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.000
First Ever I'm Gonna Do It By Hand.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.900
And. Let's Go. Let's Go.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
[Ezra] It Is An Egg.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.700
[Jory] Yes. But We Don't Know. You Know This Could Be A Genetically Enhanced Egg. We Don't Know.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.700
I'm... I'm Not... I'm So Cheap.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.600
It's Eventful. That's What It Is Truthfully.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.200
You Could Tell Some Like... Chicken Cross The Road.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.000
[Ezra] Why Did The Chicken Cross The Road?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.500
[Jory] I Have No Idea.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.150
[Ezra] To Save Its Infant Child From Jory Caron Laboratories Where It Was Going To Be Tortured To Death.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.000
[Jory] Okay. It Was Never Going To Be Anything. Okay?

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.900
[Ezra] You Don't Know That.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.500
[Jory] That's A Good Point. That's A Good Point.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.500
Yeah. So. Pretty Much We're Just Uh Sittin' Here.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.100
[Explosion]

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.900
[Ezra And Jory] Oh!

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.600
[Jory] That Was Awesome.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.100
Scrambled Eggs Hardcore.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.500
Kill it. Kill it.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800
Oh My God.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.000
[Jory Laughing]

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.500
We Should Try It In The Crate Next Time.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.500
So Now It's Time To Open Up And See What We Just Created.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.600
What Do You Think Came First? The Chicken Or The Egg?

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.500
[Jon] In This Case, The Explosion.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.600
[Jory] It's A Soy Sauce Egg. That's What We Have Goin' On Here.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.600
[Jon] Oh... My... Lord.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.000
[Jory] That Fell At The Most Perfect Time.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.500
[Jon] Look At The Door Too.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.400
[Jory] I Have One Paper Towel.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.150
[Jon] Inadequate To Say The Least.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.500
[Jory] Buff This To A Nice Shine Right Here.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
[Jon] Oh My God.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.100
[Jory] Its Hanging From Every... [Stutters]

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.300
Okay. Let's Just End This Right Now.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.100
[Jon] We'll Clean That A Little Later.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.000
[Jory] I Think I've Come To A Conclusion.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It's Not A Good Idea. Weather You Want Scrambled, Sunnyside Up, Uhh Aumlet,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.000
Keep It For The Stove

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.500
The Microwave Is No Place For An Egg.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.900
If Its Shelled. Unshelled, It Might Be A Good Idea.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.300
But Here, Bad Idea.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.000
So That's It For This Episode Of "Is It A Good Idea To Microwave This?"
