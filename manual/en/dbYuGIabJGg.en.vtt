00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.150
If you want to stay
in Britain,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:20.039
there are different kinds
of accommodation you can choose:

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:28.050
hotels,
guest houses,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:37.280
youth hostels
or even camping sites.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:46.890
As everywhere else,
your choice will probably

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:58.140
depend on the amount of money
you want to spend.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.360
The most usual choice is,
of course,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:20.500
a hotel.
These are in different price ranges

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:29.660
according to quality
and service given.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:40.280
The more stars it has,
the higher the price is

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.540
and the better
the quality will be.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:56.950
A four star hotel
will be very expensive,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:05.600
but the service
will probably be very good.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.860
Once you have chosen the hotel
you want to stay in,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:20.420
it is usual
to book a room

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:33.700
by phone or fax.
When you arrive at a hotel,

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.840
you usually have to go
to the receptionist,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:50.150
who will ask you to sign
the register

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:59.560
and give you
the key to your room.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:11.830
Rooms are either single or double
and usually have bathroom facilities,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:22.240
with a private bath or shower.
The price varies

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:37.069
according to the meals you want to have.
You can choose overnight accommodation,

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:48.120
which includes breakfast,
or half board

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:58.600
(breakfast plus evening meal)
or full board,

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:10.050
with all meals provided.
Most hotels also have room service,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:18.549
so that it is possible
to order a meal in your room.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:31.800
There are other kinds of accommodation
that are not as expensive as a hotel.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:45.189
One of these is a boarding house.
This is often run by a family

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:57.849
and situated at seaside resorts
or other tourist centres.

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:06.150
If you want something
typically British,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.321
you should choose
a Bed and Breakfast.

00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:23.860
These are private houses
where you can stay overnight.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:31.559
You may have to share a bathroom
with other people,

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:38.009
but you will usually be given
a full English cooked breakfast

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:46.800
(cereal,
bacon and eggs,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:54.599
and toast).
You will also experience

00:05:54.599 --> 00:06:01.020
the particular atmosphere
of a British house

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:13.740
and will probably find
your hosts very friendly.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:21.629
So,
if you are travelling around Britain

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:26.819
and you see a notice
Vacancies

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:34.610
outside a house,
why don't you stop

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.580
and ask for a room.
