00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.300
I'm going to teach you now how to create fake
cuts.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.119
The first thing is we're going to clean the
area where we're going to put the cut.

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:27.340
So, I'm just going to take a little spritz
of alcohol and clean this area here.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.770
Now that that's nice and clean I'm going to
put down some spirit gum to make the skin

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.170
tacky so that the mortician's wax that we're
going to use will stay.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.590
Now, I just want to show you really quick
this is the wax that I'm going to use.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.590
It's mortician's wax.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.290
It looks like this.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.900
If you are at your local store you can use
scar wax.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.780
That's usually what they sell in things like
Halloween stores.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.640
There are a lot of different brands of scar
wax.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.260
I know that Ben Nye makes a nose putty/scar
wax that's really great.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.640
And this is what I'll be using.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:18.550
To use spirit gum I'm going to take a Q-tip
like this, open the spirit gum, and I'm going

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.540
to apply just a little bit.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.970
Spirit gum is something that people sometimes
are highly allergic to, so you want to test

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.430
your models first to make sure that they're
not allergic.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.490
I'm just going to put a little dab right here
on her wrist to make sure.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.230
We're going to just let that dry for a minute,
and if it doesn't turn red and itchy we're

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.640
probably fine.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.640
Okay.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.090
Now I'm going to apply a really thin layer
of spirit gum where I want the wax to go in

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.200
the shape of the cut.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.840
Spirit gum does not work unless it's activated.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.490
It takes a few minutes for the air to hit
it and become tacky.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.730
I'm just going to spread that out, and then
to make sure it's tacky I'm going to tap it

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.020
with the tip of my Q-tip.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.960
You'll be able to see it becomes kind of stringy
and sticky like maple syrup.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.960
Okay.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.809
So that's tacky now.
