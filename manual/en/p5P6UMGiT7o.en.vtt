Welcome back for Part 4 of our series on selecting lure colors

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm Greg Vinall and this time we'll be talking about

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
about choosing lure colors that work in dirty water

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
For those viewers who haven't seen earlier parts of this series

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In our previous presentations we've talked about how water

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Selectively filters out various wavelengths of light

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And how that can reduce the visibility of some lure colors

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So under typical conditions we found that reds and oranges 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Might only get down to about 5-8m (17-20ft)

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Whereas more persistent colors like dark blue

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.069
Will typically get down to around 35m or 115 ft

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Under dirty water conditions the story is very different

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So lets have a look at how dirty water 
 changes the way fish see lure color

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
To do that, I'm going to split our box up and we'll

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Look at dirty water and clean water side by side 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
For the purposes of direct comparison

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Lets start by filling the box on the right with dirty water

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And already you can see a change in the visibility of the colors

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And we'll go back and use the same multi-colored lures

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
That we've used in previous presentations, so we can see how 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
All lure colors are affected by dirty water

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Lets start dropping these lures down into the depths

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What you notice is that the lure in the dirty water

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The red color is already strting to disappear at around 2-3m (4-6ft)

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Orange gets down to around about 5m (15ft)

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Compared to 8 or 9m (24-27ft) in clean water

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Yellows are getting down to around 9 or 10 m (25-30ft)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Which is around about 25 to 30 feet

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Greens and light blue lure colors are seen a little bit deeper

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And by the time we get down to a depth of 25 metres

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Which is about 85 feet, you can see 
 that the lure in the dirty water

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Really has no real visible color, just a little dark blue left

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And of course, way down at 35m and compare the two lures

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The lure in the dirty water has no visible color left

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So lets put all of those lures back 
 on the screen at the one time

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
At the one time so you can compare them all directly

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You can see that there is quite a bit of difference between

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The colors that are visible in clear water

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Compared to those in dirty water

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
As always in this video series, please don't take the depths

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
That I've shown here as gospel. In fact

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
In fact, in really dirty water those depths will be significantly reduced

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And reds, oranges and yellows may not be visible

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
More than an inch or two below the water surface

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You can use this knowledge about lure colors by realising

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
That reds, oranges and to a lesser extent yellows

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Are much less visible to fish when the water becomes dirty

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So you can choose much darker colored lures

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And lures with strong actions to help the fish feel the lures

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Rather than seeing them

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Dark colored lures have a stronger silhouette

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So that will improve your catches in dirty water

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Once again, don't forget that there is a whole series 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
