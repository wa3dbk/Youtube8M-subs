00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.210
The Windows 7 Taskbar has been improved to
help you access and view your files and programs.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:22.310
You can pin your favorite programs to the
taskbar and access them with one click of

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.630
a mouse.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.250
Once a program is pinned to the taskbar, you
can view a Jump List by right-clicking the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.610
icon.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.760
A Jump List is like a "mini-menu."

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.860
For example, on the Internet Explorer Jump
List, you can access the web pages you frequently

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.900
visit.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.470
If you want to personalize your taskbar, you
can do this by rearranging the icons.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:55.150
If you want to remove an icon, just right-click
and select "Unpin this program from taskbar."

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.620
You can view other open windows without clicking
away from the window you're currently working

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.570
on by using Aero Peek.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.000
To use Aero Peek, hover the mouse over the
program icon on the taskbar, and a thumbnail

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.170
window of that open window will appear.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.810
From within the taskbar, you can also view
and manage notifications.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:22.700
With one click on the Action Center icon,
you can view notification messages.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.270
If you would like to peek at the desktop,
hover the mouse over the Show Desktop button

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.619
in the lower-right-hand corner, and if you'd
like to clear the windows off the desktop,

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.740
click the button.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:02:00.219
Those are just a few improvements found in
the Windows 7 taskbar.
