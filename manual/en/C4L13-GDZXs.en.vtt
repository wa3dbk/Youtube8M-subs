00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.450
No one here.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.280
phew
Let's search the palace.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.480
Open every closet.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.090
Check under the bed.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.460
Open every room.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:40.460
I want to be absolutely certain that there
isn't an intruder living in my home.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:01:00.520
What are you doing?

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.320
This is the window to the library.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.550
Checking if someone climbed up.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.659
The guard said every windows are locked, especially
the library.

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.860
Just checking if there is any footprint.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.409
Maybe climbed down from the top?

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:18.770
Maybe.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.900
Let's check the roof.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.260
No the thief didn't enter this way.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.100
He couldn't have flown in.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.759
What is the building over there?

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.700
It's Duke Westing's house.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.789
It's been empty for several years.

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.079
So no one lives there?

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.270
Yeah, Duke Westing helped build a part of
this castle, but his children didn't follow

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.450
the same footstep.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.409
Ever since the Duke died, the place has been
empty.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.289
Guard, is there any secret entrance to the
palace?

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.289
No.

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.659
But this is an old palace.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.249
It is possible that there is a secret entrance
that no one knows about.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:08.070
But we have a guard at every location.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.570
Phew.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.810
What a day that was.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:23.400
Hey, that's coming from my room.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.730
I'm afraid the intruder is still living in
the house.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.670
He just went into my room, broke this flower
pot and left.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.470
Is anything lost?

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.130
Not that I can see.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.700
It's just this broken flower pot.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.890
Guard, Guard.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.380
Did you see anyone get in or out of my room?

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.380
No.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.180
Not a single soul went into your room.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.670
No one can get out of this palace right now.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.610
BTW, Hans is out on the lobby looking for
you.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.530
Hans is here?

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:13.620
In 
the lobby?
