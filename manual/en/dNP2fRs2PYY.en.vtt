00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
On May 6th 2010 a premiere was celebrated:

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The first Airbus A380 was shipped in the colours of the Lufthansa and then presented to the public.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In front of the press and representatives of the participating companies, the A380

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
was to undertake its maiden flight, bearing the logo of the crane,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and was then to land on its future home airport shortly thereafter.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But first, the symbolic delivery of the world's largest passenger airplane took place

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
between the sales director of Airbus, Andreas Hermann, and Oliver Wagner, Direct Sales Manager of Lufthansa.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm very impressed with the whole Miniatur Wunderland.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm looking forward to seeing the airport actually going into full operation.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm even more excited to be able to take over this amazing airplane.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Ingo Meyerdierks also followed the proceedings.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The flight captain will be one of one of three pilots who'll fly the plane from Frankfurt am Main to Hamburg

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
on its first date of delivery on May 19th.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The largest of the miniature airplanes is then brought into position

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to begin its first flight towards Knuffingen.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Even though the tension was high beforehand, the Lufthansa A380 launched through the emblem of Hamburg without difficulty.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
However, in the Miniatur Wunderland the plane isn't expected in Frankfurt,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
but for the first time at the Knuffingen International Airport - soon to be the largest miniature airport in the world.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
As it is customary after the very first touchdown, the A380 is greeted by the fire department of Knuffingen

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
with jets of water.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It wasn't revealed if real water was used.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
After the festive greeting, everyone headed towards the Lufthansa buildings.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
In front of 526 miniature flight guests the aircraft was welcomed by small and big journalists.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Using a pipette, Micky Braun, mayoress of Knuffingen

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and wife of Gerrit Braun, christened the new Lufthansa A380 "Knuffingen".

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Welcome to Knuffingen, Mr. Meyerdierks.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I wanted to ask you if the flight to Knuffingen Airport is any different to a flight in the real world

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
or if it is similar.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I'll wait a moment for you to deplane.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So, is it any similar to the real world or was it different?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It's very realistic.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
First of all, the approach to Knuffingen was really impressive.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The glide towards the the landing strip,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
the runway was so well-prepared, and as you have seen for yourself:

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We accomplished a precise and accurate landing.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So everything was prepared ideally, and I'm very impressed by these airport grounds .

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I was also impressed by the performance of the propulsion units of the A380.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Our runway is shortened a bit with a length of 13m. That would be about equal to 1.3km in reality.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Hand on heart: On a stretch of 1.3km, would it really be possible to slow down in time with a fully-loaded A380?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Yes, it's possible.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
This airplane is characterized by a low dive speed, despite its high weight.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
One reason for this is the large wing span and its surface of 845 square metres.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I've already been able to try it myself, and I landed on a landing strip

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and came to a halt after 1000m.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Impressive.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I'd say we'll turn the camera off now.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
That way we can analyse the errors and corrections with a pro.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Thank you very much for your visit and that you've done this inauguration at our place.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Thank you so much that we could be a part of this.
