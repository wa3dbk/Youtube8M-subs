Hey guys. Toy Scouter here with the Sleeping Beauty deluxe figurine playset

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.580
There are nine figures in this box. I got this from the Disney store for $19.95

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.060
Let's check each one out

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.740
So here are the figures and the one that I like the most is this dragon here

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.920
It looks like it's breathing fire

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.320
And my second favorite is Prince Phillip with his shield and sword here - really really cool looking

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.260
And now we're going to take a close look at each one

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:04.980
This is Aurora. She is disguised here as Briar Rose because the three good fairies are trying to keep her safe from the evil fairy

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:13.460
So she changed her name and started living in the forest. You can see here she has a basket with some kind of fruit in it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.400
Here we have the three good fairies. Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. They are supposed to protect Aurora from Malificent

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.680
You can see their faces are kind of funny

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.200
But they are fairies so they have magical powers

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.260
Next we have the Mock Prince. These are Aurora's animal friends

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.480
We have the owl, the squirrel, blue bird, robin and two rabbits here

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.460
They are disguised as a prince. It's kind of funny

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.280
See?

00:02:05.095 --> 00:02:06.535
Show you guys the back

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.780
Can you guys guess who this is? It's the evil fairy - Maleficent

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.380
She has a raven on her shoulder. The raven's name is Diablo and she's holding her magical staff here

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.320
She looks kind of schemey

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.840
She's the one who put the curse on Aurora

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.360
It's a sleeping curse

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.560
Maleificent

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:54.340
These are goons. They are simple-minded creatures that work for Maleficent and their task is to find Aurora

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.660
They don't look too bright, of course

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.420
The goons

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:17.220
This is Samson and there's a squirrel on him. He's Prince Phillip's horse. He doesn't speak human but he kind of has a mind of his own

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.220
Very intelligent horse - kind of knows exactly what's going on

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.720
Samson

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.520
This is Prince Phillip. He's holding a blue shield here and a sword in the other hand. 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.760
He's about to fight Maleficent to save the whole kingdom from her curse

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.660
Nice red cape in the back

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.425
Prince Phillip

00:03:48.500 --> 00:04:00.220
In order to save the kingdom from Maleficent's curse, Prince Phillip must defeat Maleficent first and this is Maleficent in dragon form

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.620
Very very tough to beat

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.720
Look at that. It can breathe fire. It's supposed to be really big

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.420
Very cool. 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.120
And you guys all know who this is, right? It's Princess Aurora in her pink dress

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:37.340
At the end of the movie, of course, the good triumph because Prince Phillip defeated Maleficent

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.280
And then he kissed her, a true love kiss, to save the entire kingdom

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.220
Princess Aurora

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.740
