Ciao everyone here it's Marchettino, today I'm visiting my friends at Lamborghini Miami.

00:00:05.035 --> 00:00:11.175
They've kindly given me the access to their cars so I wanna take you for a tour in their 2015 Lamborghini Huracan.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.520
The model that you see here is finished Nero Nemesis (matte black)

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.620
with black Mimas 20-inch forged wheels, pretty badass configuration if you ask me.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.580
I don't know why many people dislike the design of this car.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.820
Just like any Lamborghini, also the Huracan is named after a Bull which throws fear from any angle

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.660
and with this paint the edges are even more sharp.

00:00:41.913 --> 00:00:43.913
This is the key, let's open it!

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.040
Right, here we are inside the Huracan!

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.980
Black alcantara and leather are the dominant elements in the cockpit,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.360
love the contrast with the orange stiching.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.700
The clutch pedal has become a distant memory,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.660
now the gears can be changed only through the paddles behind the steering wheel.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.820
Near the pedals there's a little button that gives you access to the engine.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.860
For a cool 5000â‚¬ you can opt for the glass engine bonnet and the beautiful engine bay made in carbon fibre.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.820
So here's the 5.2L V10 just behind me.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.840
The car that I'm filming is fitted with the factory option *Race exhaust. This is the key,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.760
let's make some noise!

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.700
I love this, it's like a jet fighter!

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.060
Ready?

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.980
Just listen to the difference when you put it in Corsa mode!

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.180
In Corsa mode, the gas flow of the exhaust bypasses the silencer and basicly it becomes a straight pipes exhaust!

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.760
The engine is still cold so let's wait a little bit before to rev it up!

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.540
Ok so, as you can see it doesn't have anymore the rev limiter up to 6000rpms,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.960
that means that now we can rev it up!

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.660
Absolutely amazing exhaust note, it really sounds like a racecar!

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.460
I think that every Huracan should be fitted with this exhaust because it sounds amazing!

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:27.675
Love the way also how it pops and crackles, it really sounds menacing!

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.633
But if you want to travel, the noise is not the real problem because

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.840
just like most supercars, even the Huracan suffers a tiny boot.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.880
I don't know how they managed but actually the capacity is even smaller than the Gallardo's.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.780
I wanna say thanks to Lamborghini Miami for allowing me to shoot one of their cars,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.140
I hope you guys did enjoy the tour, make sure to subscribe to my YouTube channel for more

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.615
