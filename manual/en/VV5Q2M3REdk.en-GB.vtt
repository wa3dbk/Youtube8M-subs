00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.600
Few boots are capable of really putting that
spark of imagination into player's heads the

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.000
way that the new Nike Superfly IV has; spawning
everything from Flyknit futsal shoes to a

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.099
Mercurial-inspired running shoe, the new Superfly
is almost suspiciously 'iconic' before it

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.460
has even hit a store shelf.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.279
But the trouble with making a shoe this big
before anyone has had a chance to wear it

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.540
is you there is almost too much hype; can
even the best boot ever conceived live up

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.859
to the expectations created around the new
Superfly? Well, we've been lucky enough to

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.500
have a pair for a few weeks now, so let's
take a look.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.030
Starting with comfort, if the Mercurial Vapors
VIII and IX were the nails in the coffin of

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.999
the myth that all Mercurial must obliterate
the wearers feet, then the Superfly IV buries

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.879
the coffin, then blows up the cemetery for
good measure.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.480
You can't wiggle a toe or flex a tendon in
your feet without the boots upper responding

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.480
in some way; when Nike say they've 'edited'
the Superfly down to the bare minimum, they

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.360
certainly weren't kidding.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.979
In terms of feel on foot and touch on the
ball, these are the most minimal football

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.430
boots we've ever worn; but the NikeSkin layer
on the upper does add the sense that something

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.189
is wrapping around your foot, as well as providing
a sense of durability to the boot.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:32.189
With that in mind, the ACC All Conditions
Control finish also helps waterproof the boot,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.159
and provides protection for the Flyknit from
water, mud and debris, making them easier

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.460
to clean.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.939
Before we leave the fit completely, I do want
to say the V12 last used on the Superfly IV

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.950
is around half a size long-fitting; if you're
an average-to-wide footed player, you'll find

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.840
this combines with the FlyKnit to offer up
the most forgiving and adaptable fit yet seen

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.729
on a Mercurial, whilst narrow footed players
might consider going half a size down from

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.469
their usual size to get what will probably
be the best fit they've ever experienced in

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:06.909
a soccer shoe.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.690
Playing in the boot is a wonderfully pure
experience; you'll find that the Superfly

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.500
IV gives a real sense of one-to-on movement
with your feet, bolstering confidence and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.000
making for some sweet striking and passing.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.340
One thing you might not know about the Superfly
IV is that it does have an interior liner,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.340
so the touch, especially when moving at speed,
isn't as minimal as you might think...at first.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.530
After a couple of wears, you do get a great
level of break-in around the forefoot, making

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.070
that sense of edited-down touch a real feature
of the boot.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.180
One are that is also prominent out of the
box is the soleplate. Whilst Nike have stripped

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.450
the Carbon Fibre on the boot down to just
two layers, there is a not-unexpected level

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.230
of resistance to the chassis.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.900
I might be alone in this, but I get a little
bit of cramp in my arches when a boot is a

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.850
little too stiff, and I definitely got that
on the first outing in the Superfly IV. Thankfully

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.850
after a few wears that does get a lot easier
and begins to do the traction plate justice.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.130
Which is only fair, given planting twisting
cutting and breaking is as good on the Superfly

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.000
IV as you'd hope; the new traction plate and
stud layout is hands-down one of the best

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.810
you'll find if you're a fast player.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.210
And fast players usually get a lot of time
on the ball, which is exactly the sort of

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.480
tenuous link I need to say keeping a pair
of Superfly IV's will need a lot of time,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.160
too. The finish on the upper is pretty much
wipe-clean, which will no doubt surprise some

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.020
people, but the Dynamic Fit Collar is 'raw'
FlyKnit, so you're going to need to clean

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.040
your boots regularly.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.810
That said, the collar will absorb sweat and
grime, so don't expect to keep them box-fresh

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.180
forever.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.660
To round-up quickly, the Superfly IV is as
good a boot as you would hope for the price

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.990
- if a boot could possibly justify that sort
of cost. It manages to pack in more bells

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.370
and whistles than your average super car,
but somehow the result is a an unbelievably

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.690
pure touch, with responsive traction and a
phenomenal sense of unity between the not

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.259
just the foot, but the whole lower leg and
the boot provided by whatever magic Nike weave

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.459
into the Dynamic Fit Collar.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.080
Despite feeling surprisingly hard-wearing
in the hand, we will say that the exposed

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.169
Flyknit on the collar and laces is something
to keep a sharp eye on in the long term but

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:37.930
that, the little bit of stiffness and probably
a longer-than-average fit would be our only

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.500
concerns on the boot overall.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.500
Other than that is the crowning glory on Nike's
range of 
football boots.
