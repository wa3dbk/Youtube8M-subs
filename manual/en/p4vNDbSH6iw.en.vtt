00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.759
Today we're going to review the Rhino Rack
Master Fit Rooftop Cargo Box, part number

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.370
RMFZ65.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.350
This rooftop cargo box has a 14 cubic foot
capacity.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.450
The box is designed to fit round, square,
aero, or elliptical shape bars as well as

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.539
most factory crossbars.

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.530
It has a dual side access lid meaning you
can open the box from either the driver's

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.800
side or the passenger's side of the vehicle.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.440
Rhino Rack has also put in a keyword tension
feature on their lock system.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:38.440
When we go to unlock our box and open it up
we can't remove the key, this is to help prevent

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.420
locking the keys inside the box.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.739
Inside are two nylon luggage straps that you
can use to secure your gear.

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.129
It's designed to fit crossbar spreads between
24-1/4 inches all the way up to 36-1/2 inches,

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.989
so you want to make sure that your particular
roof rack crossbars couldn't fit within this

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.010
range.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.200
It's manufactured in the USA and is covered
by a five-year limited warranty.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.360
To open the box we'll insert our key, unlock
the lock, and pull the lid open.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:23.479
There are three 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:55.740
hinges 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:28.870
inside 
the box 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:03:13.669
on 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:31.659
either side.
