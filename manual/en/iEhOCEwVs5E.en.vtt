00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.099
Hey guys.

00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:04.290
Get ready to fire your peashooters, sunbeams
and... zombie dolphin.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.460
Yeh you heard me.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.390
I went along to Electronic Arts offices to
try out upcoming third person team shooter

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.700
and tower defense game Plants vs. Zombies:
Garden Warfare.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.290
Now here's a preview of the game and what
you can expect for the next addition in PopCap's

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.370
popular PVZ series.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.720
Heads up it's just as crazy and absolutely
mental as the last one.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.670
I was told immediately that I'd want to use
my headphones for this game because the noises

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.000
are not to be missed.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.649
The great personality and style that PVZ is
famous for is continued in this next addition

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.059
to the franchise and the third person perspective
adds a new freedom to the game.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.170
A green flag to go nuts.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.139
PopCap's expanded the already plump collection
of game modes with the introduction of 24

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:53.999
multiplayer 12v12 matches Gardens and Graveyards
alongside Team Vanquish, Classic Team Vanquish

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:59.629
and four player co-op Garden Ops.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.890
I had a go on the mass server with some G
and G and Classic Team Vanquish so here's

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.990
some information on what you can expect from
those game modes.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.640
12v12 is absolutely great chaos.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.490
I was launched into a Gardens and Graveyards
match that sees you on a team of plants, or

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.840
zombies defending or attacking 6 seperate
zones.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.190
At the final capture point you're going to
want to get a certain amount of your team

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.500
to safety, but good bloody luck.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.600
We managed it ONCE but I was getting absolutely
annihilated by tumbling chestnuts, don't ask...

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.250
When starting the game you visit the Sticker
Shop where you open up some complimentary

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.829
packs of sticks that are given to you.

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.969
Now you can open up new characters and customizable
features and the customization in this game

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.869
is vast and very funny.

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.710
You can wear a hat made out of a spam tin
for crying out loud!

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.530
When you're in the game you pick yourself
a plant or zombie type depending on what side

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.710
you're on or you can use your sticker bonus
character.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.020
I got Marine Biologist who, as I said earlier,
has a zombie dolphin shooter.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.830
It's weird and I liked it.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.829
He was also primarily a healer so I went round
sticking down heal pods that released a lovely

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.929
goo that my teammates could shower in and
restore health.

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.229
Luxury goo.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.830
Then you'll have people like the engineer
that will drop handy teleports so you can

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.990
get back in on the action swiftly after respawning.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.980
You'll unlock moves and items by completing
challenges such as vanquishing strings of

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.980
enemies.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.800
You'll then be equipped with timed attacks
and items with Y, left bumper and right bumper.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.330
Each character has different moves such as
jumping really high, warping, healing and

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.610
attack moves.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.600
A great name for one was the sticky explody
ball but wait until you see all the others

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.470
and you could really tell the change in gameplay
when people started to level up.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.280
You can bring NPCs to life by planting them
in pots dotted around the map or zombie graves.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.290
Classic Team Vanquish is a first to 50 face
off between teams and there's two exclusive

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.960
modes for Xbox One players of local co-op
and boss mode where you use Kinect to get

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.330
a birdseye view style on the game dropping
aid into the map.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.010
You can visit your sticker shop throughout
between matches to cash in your coins for

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.480
more features and work towards unlocking new
characters.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.550
The game was developed with the Frostbite
3 engine used for Battlefield 4 and upcoming

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.830
game Dragon Age: Inquisition amongst others.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.350
The visuals in this PVZ Garden Warfare are
bright and colourful but what else would you

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.750
expect from PopCap the guys behind colour
fantastic Bejewled and Peggle.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.290
So whether you fancy being at one with nature...
or being undead, this looks like it's going

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.800
to be a lot of fun.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.600
It's coming out on Xbox 360, Xbox One on February
25th in North America and the 27th February

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600
across Europe.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.460
It will come out on PC at a later date.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.610
Thanks for watching.
