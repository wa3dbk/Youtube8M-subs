Hi! This is Louis Ortiz on behalf of Expert
Village and today we are going to show you

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:13.720
how to shred cabbage on a mandolin slicer
and there are various models on the market.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.710
I tend to like this model simply because it
is stainless steel and it's easy to clean.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.529
There are some smaller varieties that are
made of plastic and obviously the blades are

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.239
stainless steel but this is a total stainless
steel package. It is nice and sturdy. It's

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:36.340
got a nice steady foot and ramp and it is
easily adjusted and those are the things I

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.470
look for. I've got some cabbage here, a head
of cabbage I should say. I have a half and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.969
a quarter. We illustrated to you or demonstrated
in another video of how to remove the core.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.670
So this is the half and we cut obviously the
half into another half and got a quarter,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.579
so we've exposed the core here and I am going
to go ahead and take this out. I like just

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:15.150
making a V cut on each side to remove this.
So that's that, all gone. I've already adjusted

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:25.290
my blade on the mandolin and the blade that
I am talking about is right here. You adjust

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.350
the height of the base on how thin or thick
you want your cuts to be and you use this

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.180
machine for all kinds of vegetables. So I've
got a really shallow setting on the knife.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.310
This is the ramp that the food will be fed
down onto and just be careful with your fingers

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.030
heading toward that open blade. So again I've
got a really shallow setting so that we can

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.740
just get a nice fine shred out of this. I've
got squared sides on each side so it's a little

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.470
bit safer to push down this ramp toward that
sharp knife. I'm just going to the right to

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.520
the cross there. As you can tell this is much
faster than using the knife. A little more

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.510
convenient as far as that goes. I just shaved
off a little and I'll move this off to the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.400
side and I'll show you the finished product.
So we've got a nice fine shredded cabbage

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.500
here that we can use for Cole slaws. We can
braise it with some chicken stock and onions

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.819
for some braised cabbage. We can also use
this for some garnish on some fish tacos or

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:38.410
a garnish for salads as well. That's the way
you get a nice shred off mandolin. There's

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.470
another video out there to get a similar cut
with a knife. This is a lot quicker and more

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.900
efficient.
