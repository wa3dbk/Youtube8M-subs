00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.469
Hi Everyone, welcome to DiscoveringNatural. Today, I will be talking to you about

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.500
Shampoos and also some other cleaning agents that I use for my hair.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.449
and you can also use for your hair if you choose.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.270
The first one we are going to talk about is "Sulfate Shampoos"

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.710
Sulfate shampoos are shampoos that contain

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.820
ingredients such as the ones you are going to see right over here

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.840
and I don't use Sulfate Shampoos so I don't have one to show you

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.190
fromy my stash, but Sulfate Shampoos

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.350
are very good at removing oil and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.970
build up and things like that, dirt, from your hair

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.460
and just know that when you use sulfate shampoos, it does

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.530
strip your hair and removes also your natural

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.110
oil that you produce from your scalp. So, you have to be

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.729
very carefully. You have to make sure that you do a deep conditioning

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.989
to replenish the moisture back into your hair and

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.479
and before you use a sulfate shampoo, some people

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.900
also do a pre-poo

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.180
What a pre-poo is, is that you mix a couple of oils

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.159
Oils that absorb intoyour scalp. You mix them together and you apply it into your

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.259
hair, prior to the process, you wait about 30 mins, 1 hour or

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:27.210
even more

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.140
so that those oils penetrate into your hair, then you can use a sulfate shampoo

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.240
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.150
Another type of shampoo is a "Sulfate Free Shampoo"

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.680
A sulfate free shampoo that I use is

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.350
Elasta QP CrÃ¨me Conditioning Shampoo

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.830
and this shampoo is very moisturizing. It contains a lot of oils

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.250
and it doesn't strip your hair. Sulfate free shampoo

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.650
use is very good for people that do not want to do a

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.250
co-wash. What is co-wash? You can read all about conditioners

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.780
over here

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.140
The third type of shampoo that we have is a "Chelating Shampoo"

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.740
A chelating shampoo is very good for people that live in

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.500
hard water area. So if your water is hard

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.640
this shampoo is very good. What hard water does to

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.640
natural hair is that it deposits minerals

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.989
into the hair. So, in order to remove that mineral

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.000
you can't remove it with sulfate free shampoos for sure

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.770
and some sulfate shampoos you can. So you need a shampoo targeted to

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.420
removing minerals from your hair. So that is where

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.980
chelated shampoo comes in. I don't have one to show you

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.050
because I do not live in a hard water area but I'll show you a picture of one

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.460
right over here

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.700
The other type of shampoo that we have is a "Clarifying Shampoo"

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.830
This is a clarifying shampoo. This is the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.020
50:50 Balanced Hydrating Shampoo

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.280
by Giovanni. You can see that I have used it

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.610
way down here. We use this

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.880
to clarify our hair. It actually does remove

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.420
build up. It removes oil, dirt. It is

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.830
very good for your hair. This shampoo is not so stripping

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.750
unlike other clarifying shampoos. What I like about this is that we use a lot

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.630
when we go swimming and we go swimming a lot

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.140
and you can see we have used a lot of it. It helps remove chlorine

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.740
for our hair and we do love this shampoo

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.060
If we do have to clarify our hair,

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.270
we clarify our hair once a month and I use this mainly for the girls

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.270
 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.540
now what do

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.060
I used to cleanse my hair I used

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.209
Bentonite clay. Bentonite clay is a very good

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.560
natural cleanser. I have a video

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.049
that shows you how I mix my bentonite
clay and I also have a video on how I

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.100
apply it to my hair. It works really well in

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.350
cleansing my hair since I do not use any shampoo whatsoever

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.500
I will use bentonite clay to cleanse my hair. If I feel that my scalp

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.889
need cleansing and I need to

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.270
remove any dirt from my scalp, I'm going to use

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.060
Apple Cider Vinegar. I take 2 oz of

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.970
 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.789
apple cider vinegar with 6 oz of water

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.940
and I apply it to my scalp and this

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.520
actually does remove build up. So, that is all I have to share with you today

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.030
