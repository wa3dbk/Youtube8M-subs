Vegan Apple Oatmeal Muffin Recipe by The Sweetest Vegan

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.706
Hey my Sweet Vs, It's The Sweetest Vegan here and today 
 on the show we will be veganizing a recipe

00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:10.356
from my fellow YouTube Next Chef, Average Betty. I 
 will put a link to her channel here

00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:14.907
Please go check here out, she is so awesome. She was 
 in the LA Times, thats how awesome she is.

00:00:14.907 --> 00:00:21.922
She approaches food in a whole new way, she talks about 
 food news, and she gives advice for special holidays.

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:27.094
Like the SuperBowl and Chinese New Year. Awesome awesome channel.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:32.810
So she made oatmeal apple muffins and I thought it was a 
 little bit healthier a recipe than what I usually make

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.921
and I want to go in a healthier direction, 
 so I was like "I can vegan-ize that."

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.921
and I want to go in a healthier direction, 
 so I was like "I can vegan-ize that."

00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:40.707
So that is what we will be doing today. 
 Vegan Oatmeal Apple Muffins. Here we go.

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:52.175
To a large mixing bowl, mix together your wet ingredients:

00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:57.469
Brown sugar, which sugar is always added in with 
 the liquid ingredients because it dissolves so fast,

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.719
applesauce to replace the one egg that was in the original recipe,

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:07.152
vegetable oil, almond milk to replace the buttermilk that was in the original recipe,

00:01:07.152 --> 00:01:14.165
but you can make vegan buttermilk by adding a little vinegar to 
 your non dairy milk, just as you would with regular milk

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:17.160
and vanilla extract.

00:01:23.453 --> 00:01:30.744
Next you want to mix together the dry ingredients: 1 
 part all purpose flour, 1 part whole wheat flour,

00:01:30.744 --> 00:01:36.223
then I am going to add in my quick cooking 
 oats, as well as my spices and salts.

00:01:36.223 --> 00:01:40.540
baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon.

00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:43.540
Just give that a good whisk until that is well combined.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.050
You should always add your wet ingredients to your dry ingredients,

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:03.410
but since I used the wrong bowls originally I ended 
 up adding my dry ingredients to my wet ingredients.

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:08.380
Whisk it together, and then fold in your shredded apples.

00:02:08.383 --> 00:02:11.530
I just used a food processor to shred those.

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:17.760
Then you want to bake the vegan muffins at 
 320 degrees F for about 20 minutes

00:02:17.764 --> 00:02:21.290
and do a tooth pick test to see if they are done.

00:02:21.293 --> 00:02:25.870
Which mine were done. The muffins turned out delicious. They were yummy and cinnamon-y

00:02:25.868 --> 00:02:30.420
And I love anything with apples, so it was the perfect recipe for me

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.810
and maybe you too. Bye.
