00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.170
all right thank you and welcome uh...
today we're going to look at how to

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.399
write an essay when your teacher has
and in-class writing test

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:19.399
so first we look at the writing
question or the writing prompt

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:24.739
"What are some healthy eating habits you
used to have in your country?"

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.429
That's the question we're going to
answer

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:33.220
so here is the essay and the title is
"Healthy eating habits"

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.969
the students name

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.310
is Xiao Lu so

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.580
you can see the student's name is first

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.670
then you want to write the date

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.259
next is the professor's name

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:49.430
an then

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.300
put a name to this test. It's called
the Writing Test

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.130
and in my class I want you to uh
put this in the upper right hand corner

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.920
of your paper

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.160
also I want you to notice

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.170
when you write your essays, please
write on eight-and-a-half by eleven

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.350
paper

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.590
this is what we call college ruled paper

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.280
it has a red margin line on the left

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.920
and then the red margin line shows
through from the backside over here. So we

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.580
have two margin lines.  Okay?

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.610
So again

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.030
uh...

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.799
please put your student name

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:28.840
the date

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.440
the professor's name and then
writing test

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.840
uh...

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.690
Right here we have what we call the
title of our essay.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.539
Okay, the title is in the middle

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:42.929
of this paper.

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.000
It's on the top line

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.900
You see the top line right there.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.500
It's on the top line and the title is
"Healthy eating habits."

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.510
Now, we're starting a new paragraph.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.729
When we start a new paragraph, you want to indent five spaces.  one two three four

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:01.990
and five

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.680
it's about one inch

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.240
and in English we say

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.209
indent i-n-d-e-n-t that's the
indent for the paragraph

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.619
Alright, when you write

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:17.189
the first sentence

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:18.210
you go

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.989
approximately to the next

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.340
margin. See that redline right there?
It goes all the way down the paper, that

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.859
red line.

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.290
And you want to write

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.309
toward or near that redline or that
margin. So I'll write on here

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.199
this is called

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.199
a margin

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.529
It's right there, that red line

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:44.290
so in my country China I had many

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.299
healthy eating habits... period

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.359
So notice what happened here. I indented
my first sentence/

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.449
In my country, China, I had many healthy
eating habits.

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:00.119
This sentence I wrap around.

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:02.799
So in English we say, "Wrap

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.639
the sentence."

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:05.799
Okay?

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.480
So wrapping the sentence means

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.599
you write up until that right hand
margin

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.170
then you go back to the left

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.769
margin-right here. So we have a left
margin

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.579
We call this a left margin

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.569
and then we start... we continue

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.749
this sentence here

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:31.089
and then we have a period.

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:36.119
Now notice our second sentence. First of
all, I used to buy groceries. What happens

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:38.569
here we wrap the sentence

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.720
near the right hand margin the red line

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.280
and then we come back to the left margin

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.279
and we start again.

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:50.410
Now there's one other thing to notice
about this writing test.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.079
We are skipping a line.

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:59.559
Alright. We call it, "Skip a line." We write 
on this line here, but then we skip

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:00.909
a line.

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.349
We write on this line

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.179
and then we skip this line. So, in English
we say

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:09.169
skip

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:10.769
a line.

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.109
Why do we ask our students to skip a
line?

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.459
We ask our students to skip a line

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.459
so if we need to make any comments or
uh check for spelling or uh

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.289
make a notation

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.030
As the professor we have

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.520
room our your paper to make a
comment in uh pen.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.069
So, for example, um,

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.330
maybe I will say over here

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.000
uh

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.729
let's see

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.789
uh...

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.650
We admired each other's recipes

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.510
and enjoyed the fresh flavors of noodles,
dumplings, fried rice and steamed vegetables

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.860
and I might say

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.889
What about

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.690
the fruit?

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.110
So, I'm the professor and I want more
details about fresh fruit and I have

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.729
that line, that empty line

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.740
to write my comment.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.990
So that's why we ask you to skip a line.
So let's review

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.830
what, um, we ask for this writing test.
First of all,

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.909
please put your name, date,

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:27.279
the name of the professor and the name
of the test in the upper right hand corner.

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:30.180
Please put a title in the middle of your
paper.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.430
Make sure you indent on your
paragraphs.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.400
Um, please leave a one inch right hand
margin and one inch lefthand margin.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.199
Also please wrap

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.039
your sentences

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.620
and after you finish one sentence

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.059
leave a space. Notice there's a space
right here

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.879
And then continue with your next
sentence and then wrap it

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.240
 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.180
period

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.919
new space,  a new sentence

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.969
and then you wrap it some more.

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:04.439
Also please skip a line as you're writing
your essay

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:10.770
This helps your instructor, um, read your
essay. It also provides space for the

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.989
instructor to write questions or make
comments on your paper.

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:20.239
Alright, thank you very much. Thank you
for following, um, these guidelines and

00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:21.469
I look forward to seeing you in class!
