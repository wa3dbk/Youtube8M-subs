Alright today on Repairs101 I�m going to
go over a list of shop supplies that I depend

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.100
on all the time and that you�re going to
want to have handy in your home or shop.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:21.181
OK the first solvent I�ll mention is Acetone.
It�s good for cleaning up just about any

00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:26.160
kind of paint and many plastics and polyester
resin. It even makes a good degreaser and

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:39.810
clean up for solder flux.
Now besides the obvious use of thinning paint

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.990
I use Paint Thinner to remove the gummy residue
left behind by the labels from bottles and

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:58.700
jars and as a smoothing agent for caulking.
Brake Clean is a really strong solvent used

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:07.799
for greasy dirty brake components and can
be used to remove grease stains from carpet

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:23.299
or upholstery just by applying it to a rag
and lifting off the stain.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.780
I find Carpenters Glue handy for all kinds
of fixes to all kinds of furniture and for

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:39.360
making wooden boxes and repairs to other household
items.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.750
I use J-B WELD and J-B KWIK for wood, plastic
and metal repairs and just about anywhere

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.829
� at home, at work, auto� marine � it
bonds great, it�s remarkably strong and

00:01:49.829 --> 00:02:08.030
it�s sandable and therefore shapeable.
Mineral Oil is non-toxic, cheap and available

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.760
at almost any pharmacy. It�s perfect for
kitchen utensils because it doesn�t go rancid

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.950
and it can be used to revitalize furniture,
tools, art or whatever else you have made

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:32.530
of uncoated wood.
WD-40 is a terrific penetrating oil that I

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.580
also use for corrosion and rust treatment
and prevention.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:52.910
Now as far as lubricant goes � here�s
a small bottle that lasts a long time. Only

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.960
a tiny drop of TENACIOUS OIL is required to
lubricate almost anything including bicycle

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:17.150
chains.
NEVER-SEEZ is designed to protect fasteners

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.370
from corrosion and rust � but it can also
be used around the house to lubricate things

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:36.050
like hinges and locks.
NEVR-DULL is a super-fine polishing compound

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:56.740
that can remove rust � a form of slow oxidization.
It also easily supports a form of rapid oxidization.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.239
