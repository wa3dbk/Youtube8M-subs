00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.940
In 1989, the park was nearly complete.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.300
Our investors demanded on-site approval and
I,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.150
idiotically as it now turned out, believed
we were ready.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:23.499
The debacle of August 27, 1989 is
now quite well known, and the legal consequences

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.150
were as you may well imagine, rather
extensive.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:34.530
I still believe Nedry left himself a back
door, something about the hobbits or god

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.710
knows what.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.090
On October 3, 1989, I sat on a wooden bench
in the waiting room in

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.090
Washington, D.C.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.629
A government panel put me on the stand.

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.530
As my name was read out, the
session room went silent.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.860
I walked up the isle towards the stand.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.980
I was being called to
account, but I had no clear explanation to

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.980
give.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.500
I'm sure you've heard the rest of the story
on

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.700
the television news or in the tabloids.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.880
Bankruptcy!

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.670
I leaned against the wall, my whole body shook.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.899
I dropped the mug, it shattered.

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:35.640
I let it lie there, we would be leaving soon.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.219
When it became known that I was bankrupt,
workers simply dropped their tools and walked

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:46.610
away.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.539
As we left, we vandalized our own
locking mechanisms.

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:56.509
InGen tolerates no trespassers.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:04.079
Buildings were stripped of everything
valuable.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.270
Technicians and workmen crowded around the
docks, fearing they might be left

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.619
behind when the security ring collapsed.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.129
Armed guards stood watch.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:25.319
I can picture them, moving cautiously through
the dusty rooms in bulky biohazard gear,

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.550
clutching rifles, poring over our records,
reading our files.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.330
We sealed off the town, safe for a
few crucial gates: southward to the lowlands,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.320
eastward to the power plant, and laboratory.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.980
We
sealed the eastern gate for the last time.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.530
Gazing from my study window, I hit on a simple
mnemonic for the pass code.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.180
Like Nedry, I felt like I needed to keep a
back door open.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.200
I gave
myself over to the strange, lonely discipline

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.610
of the market.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:12.019
Investment strategies and profitÅ¯
I stood apart, master of codes and lost worlds,

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.510
of heat and cold and the sleep of a hundred
million years.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:27.069
A lost world is a sort of scientific myth,
an evolutionary scenario in which an ecosystem

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.080
is
isolated and preserved.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.030
The rest of the world changes, leaving a tiny,
fragile pocket where

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.970
ancient species survive.
