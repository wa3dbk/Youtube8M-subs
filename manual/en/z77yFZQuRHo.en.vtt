00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:05.190
What's up guy and girl players of World of
Warcraft. This is Ryutarou AkA Tarou bringing

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.070
you this week's WoW Report Episode 31! For
more FREE WoW guides, check out my website

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.440
at tarouwowguides.com

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.800
In this Tarou Weekly WoW Report, I'll cover
general Cata news, PvP, Auction House chaos,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.710
Profession news, as well as a Q&amp;A session
so let's get started.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.069
In Cataclysm news, the Feast of Winter Veil
continues and you'll now notice there are

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:32.940
presents under the tree in your faction's
major city. Make sure you get this year's

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.460
special present. Also be sure to be spreading
your holiday spirit whenever you can. Today,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.070
I tried doing my part by giving away 50,000
gold. Eight lucky people on my server each

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.410
got 5,000 gold each for following some easy
instructions and I gave ten more people 1,000

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.059
gold each for showing their holiday spirit.
Was lots of fun and I hope all the winners

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.949
enjoy their little holiday cash. I also hope
everyone had a Merry Christmas yesterday.

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.700
I know my kids did. Got them some pretty awesome
presents. Let me know how your holidays or

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.220
Christmas went in the comments below. Oh and
in what your favorite present was as well.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.479
Mine was a new watch from my mom. I'd seriously
been wearing a broken watch for like 2 months

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.719
cause I couldn't get it fixed and feel way
too weird not wearing it.

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:26.570
In other Cataclysm news, tons more hotfixes
have been rolling out and here are some for

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.439
each class. There are a lot more and as usual
I'll toss up a link to them on my blog.

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.729
Also in Cataclysm news, if you haven't heard
yet, there is a new Time-Lost Proto Drake

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.909
type rare spawn, Reins of the Phosphorescent
Stone Drake. This thing looks insanely awesome

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.540
and should be fun to camp for. Set aside atleast
a week of no sleep, grab the addon, NPC Scan,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.240
and tell your friends you won't be raiding
or instancing for awhile and you should have

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.469
no problem getting this drake while you enjoy
your stay in Deepholm. Well, therotically

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.670
atleast. Good luck to everyone.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.970
Moving on to Cata PvP news, Season 9 has been
going on for almost 2 weeks now and teams

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.220
are already skyrocketing to the top. Some
are getting there too fast it seems and so

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.080
Blizzard went ahead and put the 2200 rating
required weapons to now require character

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.260
level 86. Looks like you'll have to wait about
a year and half for your Season 9 weapons.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.860
Just kidding. It's just a temp fix until they
fix the current arena bug.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.110
Ok now on to Auction House news. Things are
starting to settle down slighty as prices

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:53.030
for almost all materials for making anything
are coming down.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.750
Epics and Rare crafted pieces are lagging
behind so make sure to utilize your armor

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.230
crafting professions while the prices show
huge profit margins.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.130
Moving on to profession news, you guys and
girls asked for more profession gold making

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.660
information so here you go. Alchemists need
to be transmuting metas old and new since

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.080
the mat prices have plummeted, the profit
margins are huge. Living Elements is also

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.280
pretty awesome when compared to True Gold's
CD. On my server I get 500g profit atleast

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.730
compared to Truegold's 200-300g. Blacksmithing
is enjoying some nice profit from PvP sets,

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.100
enchanting rods, &amp; epics. Engineering is looking
good for scopes, new &amp; old pets, as well as

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.570
the Mechano Hog. Enchanting is one of the
worst off when it comes to selling what it

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.290
makes. Enchanters should focus on DE'ing and
buying some dirt cheap enchanted scrolls that

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:59.270
have been flooding the market from levelers.
Inscription is insanely profitable right now

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.080
with all the Glyph sales, Darkmoon Cards,
Recipes, and Mysterious Fortune Cards flying

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:13.670
off the Auction House. Jewelcrafting is a
bit more tricky but I have been banking off

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.130
of Wrath metas, New metas, prospecting, and
a few cuts. Leatherworking is yet another

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.199
profession doing well with a good demand for
pvp sets, leg enchants, bags, and epics. Tailoring

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.969
is a bit lopsided but still is doing well
with new &amp; old bag sales, pvp sets, leg enchants,

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:37.169
and epics. For Gathering professions I listed
some good zones to try out that I've found

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:43.289
to be pretty awesome for farming. All in all
a very interesting profession start to a new

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:44.289
expansion.

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.389
Finally, I'd like to end this Tarou Weekly
WoW Report answering a few questions you guys

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.419
and girls have asked me over the last week.

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.289
Q1. Can you make 1-525 leveling guides for
Archaeology, Skinning, Herbalism, Cooking,

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.289
 &amp; Fishing?

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.830
A1. Listening to all your comments I added
all of these to my website except for Cooking

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.740
and Fishing which will be added this week.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.220
Q2. Can you take the gold selling ads off
your website?

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:11.080
A2. I have about 180 websites blocked and
once in awhile a few get through. When I notice

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.789
them or someone reports it, I add it to my
block list. I also went ahead and removed

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:21.370
some ad placements. I will be removing even
more while I adjust some of the website. Unfortunately,

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.259
I can't get rid of all ads. Visitors clicking
on advertisments that interest them are what

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:31.060
keep the website running. I'm already nearing
my new server's max which means I'll have

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.740
to upgrade again which really means more money
every month. Sorry the ads have to stay :(

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.680
Q3. Can you fix your forums &amp; login?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.099
A3. Yes and I fixed them. I'm very sorry.
I had no idea they were even messed up like

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:53.300
they were. They should look a lot better when
I get some free time to redo some of the coding.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.710
Question 4 is special and will always be something
outragious that you want to know. I will include

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.090
one in every week's episode so please ask
your insane 'what if' questions in the comments.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.349
I'll then pick one and feature it in my new
mid week video. Here's the first one.

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:13.379
Q4. What happens when you spend 5,000 gold
on Mysterious Fortune Cards?

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:18.319
A4. Most people have yet to find out what
this is but basically its a scratch off for

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:29.129
wow that Inscribers make. You have a chance
to win 5,000 gold. To find out what happens,

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:31.719
pay attention to your sub box for a mid week
video release.

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:35.831
That's it for this week of Tarou's Weekly
WoW Report and I hope you liked it.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.099

spawn mount drop.
