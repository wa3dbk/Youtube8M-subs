00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.390
 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.430
I'm Dave Thomas for cars dot com

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.690
where the 2008 Mazda 3 hatchback you
can believe in this car came in nearly

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.820
five years ago

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.880
hasn't changed much since then but it
still competes with about the Honda and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.400
Toyota

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.400
even the most of the mazda 3 remains the same since the debut back in 03 and in the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.960
same here is the same

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.399
an 07 mazda did revise the finance they
wanted to make it a little more cohesive

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.590
arrest the lineup that new fog lights
new headlights

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.860
and a front bumper treatment you see
here

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.129
plaza 3 comes into everybody's out with
two dimensions hatchback we have here

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.660
only come to the larger 2.3 liter and
both sporty

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.800
think it's pretty good gas mileage gets
22 miles per gallon 30 29 highway

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.100
which is actually better than the new
Toyota Matrix and the Scion xB

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.510
to get something feel better they
analyze board

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.250
another aspect that hasn't changed that
the debuted isn't here

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.560
obviously they haven't really upgrading
since 2003 but after not been one for a

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.080
few years

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.050
I'm really surprised at how well held up
our test vehicles

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.300
what mother calls the Grand toe ring but
you really get

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.630
with a grant I package is leather on
it's a it's

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.210
a lot of safety features of the coming
clued in with grant or that are optional

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.399
or extra otherwise

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.289
like side airbags and stability control
one play some other three is showing its

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.640
age

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.190
it with navigation system size and
option clear on

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.840
in nineteen hundred dollar /option and
its really antiquated

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.009
I know how to say it but basically it's
built right into the top of the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.020
dashboard

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.030
he had a bind its wings up and a
controlled it down here next to the ship

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.409
their

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.000
because I actually my last post and
therefore you say before you're not

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.380
looking at the control you're looking at
the screen out there

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.430
but everything's really outdated it
looks cold it's really expensive

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.520
I definitely would recommend it does go
get aftermarket per couple hundred bucks

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.280
there are six actually quite spacious

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.489
exactly by P 10 inches tall I the driver
seat

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.299
exactly where has a driver her client
quite a bit that I like to drive

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.870
and my knees touch the back just lightly
sucking it up just a little bit they be

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.359
fine

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.359
just

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.450
reason you get a Mazda three hatchback
over sedan is iris Lee

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.370
for the cargo area thought more
utilitarian a lot more room

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.859
you can't put down the rate it's really
his lead expand that room get a bike in

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:34.730
there what have you

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.549
even has cool up storage compartments
underneath the floor

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.790
that are lined up plastic so you can
there are some money in there

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.160
thrilling night trap

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.380
soon after a few years the month the
Bristol competitive on price

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.269
competitor like fuel economy at that but
I went out a lot and in the drive me

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.900
feel like a lot of fun to drive

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.019
so if you're looking at a Honda Civic
Corolla the author a little more fun to

00:02:59.019 --> 00:02:59.450
drive

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.530
I got the library the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.220
home for additional information on this
car or any other

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.040
