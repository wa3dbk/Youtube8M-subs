Hey, everybody!

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.450
It’s Rob from Man Sewing and have I got
a quick tip for you.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.450
That’s right.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.980
Today is needle knowledge time.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.430
And now, I must warn you, this is my personal
opinion based on a lot of fact and a lot of

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.430
experience.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.430
So, here we go.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.689
And I want you to all follow along close.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.669
I’m going to try to give it to you slow,
but you know I’m excited about this kind

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.060
of stuff.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.329
And I’m excited because I truly believe
needles are just like ice cream.

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.329
That’s right.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.289
We all, in the textile world, love our needles,
so, therefore, we all also must love ice cream.

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:41.149
Now, when you’re buying a needle, like ice
cream, you’re getting two things: different

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.870
flavors and different scoop sizes.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.089
So, let’s talk about what the sizing means.

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.719
So, here’s a fun, cool, super giant needle.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.850
This does not actually fit in your sewing
machine; I wish it did.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.989
Oh and, by the way, if you’re watching Facebook
and Instagram, you saw the cool wooden needles

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.640
that were out there that I tried to carve
for this shoot, but they wouldn’t let them

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.239
on the airplane or strapped to the wing like
missiles, I guess.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.260
Anyway, moving on.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.500
So, here is a needle numbering system.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.969
And often you’re going to see like 80/12,
90/14, 100/16, and what that really is, is

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:17.600
the 100 is the metric system and the 16 is
our U.S. standard.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.579
So, you’re always going to see those two
sets of numbers travel together: 80 and 12,

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.670
90 and 14, and so on.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.479
Now, the bigger the numbers, the bigger the
needles are going to be.

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.540
The bigger the needle, the bigger the features.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.659
And the features are kind of like flavors.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.259
So, let’s talk about some of the parts of
our needle.

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.539
This is really cool stuff, actually.

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.280
You wouldn’t believe how much engineering
goes into needles.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.829
You have on the front what is called the curve.

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.890
Now, the curve or the front groove is where
the thread lies as the needle is piercing

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.900
through your project.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.900
You have the eye.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.350
Hopefully all of you have no problem threading
those, right?

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.340
On the back of the needle, a very cool feature
here, this is called the scarf.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.350
And in the scarf what happens is, as your
needle penetrates, the hook passes behind

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.140
it so that hook fits in nice and tight, right
there, and picks up the loop of thread that

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.020
forms the stitch.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.780
And then we have the eye of the needle and
we have the tip of the needle.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.870
Now, needles are kind of divided.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.960
There’s, there’s, gosh, I think seven
or eight different styles of needles that

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.870
I can think about off the top of my head,
and they’re very project specific, but I

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.569
want to kind of try to teach you the different
names needles have to offer.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.580
So, let’s start with a universal needle,
for example.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.110
A universal needle has kind of a medium-sized
eye and the eyes come in two kinds of shapes:

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.200
circles or big, long ovals.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.870
The smaller the eye, the more wear and tear
on the thread; the longer the eye, the less

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.050
wear and tear on the thread, right?

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.370
So, with a universal needle you have kind
of a medium-sized, kind of a rounded eye and

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.170
pretty much a very rounded and blunt tip.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.370
The tip of the needle penetrates the fiber.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.900
It doesn’t cut the fabric, it just separates
the weave.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.230
So, the more aggressive the tip, the faster
it penetrates the fiber, right?

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.250
So, let’s talk about some of the bigger
eye needles out there.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.300
There, and I’m going to try to go up in
size, we’ve got embroidery.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.500
Now, an embroidery needle has got a very sharp
tip and about a medium oval eye, penetrating

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.099
lots of dense area with your embroidery machines.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.330
You’re sewing a lot of compacted area, right?

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.549
Then you’ve got your quilting needles.

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.830
Now, your quilting needles have a little bit
more of a rounded, not quite as sharp of a

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.579
tip, and a larger eye.

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.601
Sometimes that larger eye will actually cause
some skipped stitches because the thread is

00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:38.880
riding the top of the eye of the needle.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.760
And your topstitch needle is your biggest
eye and your bluntest tip.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.470
Now, the topstitch needle is really designed
for your cool, decorative threads so you can

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.480
be sliding those big threads in and out of
the eye of that needle over and over again

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.090
without shredding the thread, right?

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.379
But often it’s a very large eye if you’re
doing free motion machine quilting.

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.890
Now, the two needles I actually do most of
my quilting with are none of the three I just

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.890
mentioned.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.920
But I use denim needles and sharps needles
with my free motion quilting, actually.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.709
Let me explain why.

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.709
The denim needle has a very aggressive tip
and a very strong eye because it’s meant

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.130
for going through denims and twills and canvas.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.790
And when I’m machine quilting through my
fusible web, that density really pounds on

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.320
the eye of the needle, wearing out the eye
quickly.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.199
So, one of my tricks is using a denim needle
when fusible, like batik applique, is involved.

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.669
That’s a nice trick to have out there.

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.220
And then the other needle, my personal favorite,
is a sharps needle.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.630
Now, a sharps needle has got a crazy aggressive
tip.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.639
It’s like a patriot missile.

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.000
It was designed to go through silk and taffeta
without catching a thread or snagging, so

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.310
it penetrates quickly, but then it also has
a very small eye and that small eye allows

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.199
less movement of your thread.

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.639
And I also do a lot of fine cotton thread
and polyester threads when I’m sewing, so

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.389
that’s why the sharps needle works well
for me.

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.050
Most importantly, though, I just want you
to understand the different variety of needles

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.830
and understand that a specific project could
really require a specific needle and just

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.860
changing that needle for the job is so important;
it will make a world of difference.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.190
And do not forget, you should be changing
your needle almost every 10 full hours of

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.190
sewing.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.180
And I always start a new project with a new
needle.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.491
So, I’m hoping that quick tip gotcha right
between the eye of the needle here at Man

00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:30.500
Sewing.
