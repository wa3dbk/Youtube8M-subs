00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.449
Board right here. Kept it clean, kept it classy.
Look at that pearl top sheet. Look how it

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:29.650
shimmers. This is a TWS Goodwood winner from
2011. Fantastic. It's an anti-camber board,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.989
negative force. It's going to be flat between
the feet, it's going to rise about four millimeters

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:43.010
from about right here to right there. It has
the radius to flat, nose and tail, so it means

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.910
those babies are nice and flat, causing for
a nice stable and flat landing ollie pop and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.379
landing if you get a little bit off balance.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:57.519
Nice wide stance. You can set it up right
at the center at 24. It has a stratus[?] core,

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:07.251
which means 100% vertical laminate, poplar
core. And, because it's an anti-camber board,

00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:14.050
DC has decided to put a camber core inside
of this. So you know the board is shaped like

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.420
this, the core inside is shaped like this.
It's pretty wild. It has Quadrax glass on

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.860
the inside, which means there's four different
directions of fiberglass that sandwich the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.800
core. The base is what you call the DC Truebase,
and it has Structurn, and if you don't know

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.100
what Structurn is, it's laser etched base
that causes for reduced friction to keep you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.700
going fast, whether you be doing pond skips
or or jobbing cliffs. Flex of this board right

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:57.700
now? It's about a six. Wow. It's about a six.
One-ball factor waxed, directly out of the

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.439
factory, this thing's going to be fast, it's
going to be a lot of fun. Lauri rides it,

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.920
why wouldn't you?
