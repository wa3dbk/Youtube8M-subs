00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.200
Xenopsylla Chepois

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.480
MDCLXV

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.420
We used the helicase to

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.600
Blind the CXV

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.800
Non-responsive

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.340
And their ferritin is high

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.740
In vivo

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.420
But still seem to be alive

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.260
Controls are feeling fine

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.200
Despite the awful sounds

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.460
Brought the incidence of

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.660
Tallowy offal down

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.680
we all fall down

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.900
we fall down

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.960
we all fall down

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.920
we fall down

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.360
The martyr's brethren

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.920
Were not to be set free

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.340
In vitro planet earth

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.160
In vivo you and me

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.280
He had them watch me

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.180
And lock everything around

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.280
He told me

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.280
You seem awful down

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.540
we all fall down

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.740
we fall down

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.880
we all fall down

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.520
we fall down

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.920
It will end in flashes

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.120
And we'll choke on ashes

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.040
And we'll all fall down

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.640
Long lives the phantom

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.680
I hear him sing and

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.780
Scream out his anthem

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.620
I feel the shadows

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.820
Crying

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.800
Running

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.600
Coming

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.640
For me

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.440
Too dark

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.200
Too see

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.980
we all fall down

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.360
we fall down

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.380
we all fall down

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.200
we fall down

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.980
It will end in flashes

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.000
And we'll choke on ashes

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.860
And we'll all fall down

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.600
It will end in ashes of their lies

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.840
We can still see flashes in our eyes

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.000
But until it crashes

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.660
And the atom smashes

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.000
All our minds will

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Just fade away

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It will end in flashes

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.800
And we'll choke on ashes

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.460
And we'll fall
