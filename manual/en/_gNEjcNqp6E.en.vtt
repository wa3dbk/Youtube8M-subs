00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.950
Kyle from Cruiser Customizing and Peter has
picked up a nail over here and now he has

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:11.080
a flat tire. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
use this Slime 40022 to fix his tire. I'm

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.449
gonna use some regular slime, remove the valve
stem, remove the nail, fill it with some slime

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.519
and this tire inflator from Slime.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.769
This particular has a digital read. It's got
a light and everything we're gonna need. The

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.980
sun's almost down so I need to act quickly,
so take a look at this particular kit.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.629
First thing in fixing any flat is removing
any object that is stuck inside the tire.

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:45.620
Oh my goodness. In this particular case was
a big construction type nail. Now I'm gonna

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.730
turn the tire around so the hole is at the
bottom and I'm gonna fill this tire with slime.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.879
Now that I've got the hole moved to the bottom,
so the slime will go to the bottom and seep

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:04.329
it through that hole where it sits. So I'm
gonna remove the valve core using the top

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:14.610
of the slime bottle, and now we've got the
valve core removed we're gonna take slime

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:31.469
to my large slime bottle here, and now I'm
gonna fill this tire with slime.

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:40.329
Now we've got ample slime in this tire we're
gonna replace the valve core, now I'm gonna

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:51.530
open my slime tire meter here.
Now this is the Slime Tire Inflator. Super-super

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.340
simple to use, we're gonna pull out the inflator
cord here, we're gonna screw it onto the valve

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:05.520
cap. Once you've got this screwed onto the
valve stem we're gonna go ahead and take out

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.720
the inflation cord, plug it into the cigarette
lighter, and we should be able to see magic

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.720
happen.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:32.760
As you can see, good to go here, hit the power
button, and what you're gonna see is the pressure

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.980
increase on the dial so you'll know what exactly
you got going inside the tire.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:47.690
Now this tire
fill job should take about 6 minutes according

00:02:47.690 --> 00:03:00.590
to the Slime manual. We're gonna time and
see exactly how long it takes.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.890
Alright, we just turned off the compressor.
It's been six minutes and 41 seconds and we

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.500
have 35.5 pounds of pressure. Now, a really
cool thing with this particular kit is that

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.950
you hit the light as you can see the sun is
coming down. You can actually illuminate everything

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:23.450
you see with this light in this compressor
kit. The Slime inflator is a great asset in

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.400
motorcycle and four wheeled vehicles.
