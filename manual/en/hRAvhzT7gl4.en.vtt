00:00:01.115 --> 00:00:01.567
If you have a psp

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:03.390
you have probably heard about

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.390
Installing custom firmware

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:06.567
Or hacking it

00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:07.430
This is a guide on how to do it

00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:07.430
This is a guide on how to do it

00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:07.430
This is a guide on how to do it

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:22.133
You will need two things a pandoras battery and magic memory stick

00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.933
The pandoras battery is a special battery that your psp 
 will boot to files off ot your memory stick

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:29.675
Not the flash files on your psp

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:31.800
It is like booting from a cd on a computer

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.633
To make a pandoras battery you will need 
 a sharp knife with a sharp point

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:40.133
The first thing you will do is slowly cut around 
 the crease in the middle of the battery.

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:47.500
Then you will need to take a pin out of the battery

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.037
Buying a pandoras battery is a lot easier than making one

00:00:51.037 --> 00:00:53.300
I bought mine from amazon.com

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.367
For around $10

00:00:54.367 --> 00:01:00.976
You can press a button on it and it will 
 switch between a normal battery and a pandoras battery

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:10.700
If you are lucky you will have a friend with a hacked 
 psp and you can use his things to make it

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.140
The magic memory stick is just a memory stick that has 
 files on it that your psp can boot to.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.400
You can buy one or make one I would reccomend making 
 one because it is not hard and it is cheaper.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:33.600
You will need a memory stick with at least 
 512 MB I used a 1GB memory stick

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.433
You will need to format your memory stick

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:44.530
Then you will need to download the file in the description labeled one

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:57.800
Run the .exe file that is in the .rar file.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.870
Then drag the other files to the root of your memory stick

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:34.830
Now you will need to know if your psp is hackable.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.900
In the description there will be a link to a picture labeled two 
 that will help you know if your psp is hackable or not

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.830
A non hackable psp will not boot to 
 the magic memory stick and pandoras battery.

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:39.030
If you psp's original firmware is 4.01 or above 
 then your psp will not be hackable.

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:44.970
There is a 1 in 6 chance that your psp 
 is not hackable if it is a 2000 series

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:44.970
There is a 1 in 6 chance that your psp 
 is not hackable if it is a 2000 series

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:45.270
Boot to the magic memory stick and click nand opperations and then click 
 dump nand so you have a backup of your psp's flash files

00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:55.500
Then install the firmware that has M33 after it

00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:16.330
Then make sure that it is M33 in the 
 system information when you are done installing

00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:27.450
Hold the R button while booting if your psp froze when booting.

00:05:27.448 --> 00:05:32.790
Go to advanced settings and then format flash one and reset settings

00:05:32.788 --> 00:05:39.380
Wait for the psp to shut off and then turn back on and the psp should 
 load there is a chance that your psp will boot to a blue screen

00:05:39.383 --> 00:05:51.270
If you get the blue screen just press circle and your psp 
 should have a black screen just wait for it to reboot

00:06:03.233 --> 00:06:12.670
