00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.190
This K&amp;N air intake system is designed to
increase power and acceleration by reducing

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:35.480
restriction in the intake path. K&amp;N’s 69-5308TS
air intake fits 2012 and 2013 Kia Soul with

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.460
a 2.0 liter engine. The 69-5308TS air intake
is not legal for highway use in California

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.850
or other states adopting California emission
standards. Check KNFilters.com for an up to

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.439
date list of models this air intake fits and
for a list of other CARB adoption states.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:01:02.729
K&amp;N power testing showed an estimated power
gain of 5 horsepower at 5664 RPM with the

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:10.440
69-5308TS air intake installed on a 2012 Kia
Soul with a 2.0 liter engine. Actual results

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.290
will vary depending on the condition of the
vehicle, mileage, weather and other variables.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.970
With the air intake installed we ran the vehicle
on the dyno to test the sound comparison verses

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:43.340
the stock intake.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.700
The intake system includes components that
have been designed or matched to the needs

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.690
of these vehicles to produce a safe horsepower
increase. Detailed installation instructions

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.690
are included with this kit.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.090
