00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.470
If you’re looking for a quiet, peaceful
place to go fishing, Dam 5 on the upper Potomac

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.230
River probably isn’t the best choice. There
is a constant roar in the background from

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.369
the water coming over the dam. But depending
on the time of the year and the water levels,

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.300
it can be a good spot to fish for channel
catfish. For that reason, I brought Camden

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.620
and Landry down here in hopes that I could
give Camden his first opportunity to pull

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.620
in a channel catfish.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.100
The water level is currently just under 4 feet on the Hancock gauge,  and

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.330
that means the water is low enough that you have the choice of either fishing from the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.920
shore or you can wade out and walk out on
the rocks in front of the dam. But the former

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.920
choice is a little more kid-friendly, so we’re
gonna try our luck from the shore today. 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.050
This place isn’t known for large catfish. There are a few big ones in there, but you’re

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.530
fishing for size, there are a lot better spots
on the Upper Potomac. But today with the boys

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.120
along, I’m looking for numbers, and this
place has the potential to give you a lot

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.120
of action.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.400
 Well, on this particular morning,
we fished for about two hours and pulled in

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.689
three decent-sized catfish, as well as numerous
smaller ones. We all had an enjoyable time,

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.420
and most importantly, Camden now knows what
it feels like to catch a catfish.
