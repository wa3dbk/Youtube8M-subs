00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.250
&gt;&gt; Court: This is a new one from A2B, it's
the Alva.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.200
Check it out, it kind of reminds me of the
Metro.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.550
Got a front shock, no rear shock.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.010
Got those beautiful fenders, front and rear
lights.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.770
Which you can kind of just leave on and they
actually still work even if the battery runs

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.770
out.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.930
They're based on the motor spinning.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.619
So that's a really great feature there.

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.890
It's always nice to have those for safety.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.240
Let me just jump into the specs.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.620
So this is a 500 watt gearless, just gigantic,
hub motor in the rear.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.690
It offers a lot of torque, really smooth,
coasts silently.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.300
And that's being powered by this gigantic-looking
36 volt 13.2 amp hour battery.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.120
But I hear they're also coming out with a
17 amp hour battery, so that's just, you know,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.219
it's a lot of range.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.800
You'll be able to get a long way with this
bike.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.860
Excellent for commuting.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.640
It's a little bit heavier, this is like a
62 pound bike.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.520
A little bit more expensive but very high
quality.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.840
One of the things I like about this frame,
other than it being beautiful and all, is

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.049
that it's got the adjustable neck.

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.039
Got your seven speeds to choose from.

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:19.009
Its actually got hydraulic disc brakes and
the twist throttle in addition to pedal assist.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.049
Three modes of pedal assist.

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.310
So, its kind of got everything.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.029
I mean when you think about this, you can
hop on, twist that throttle like a scooter

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:27.499
and it will take off.

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:31.630
If you want to extend the range and maybe
your wrist is getting tired you can turn on

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.509
one of those three modes of pedal assist.

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.810
Leisurely cruise along and as you're doing
that, this is one of the other design features

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.740
I wanted to call out, you've got this nice
little mini-chain guard right there.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.380
So you're pants, they aren't going to get
greasy or anything while you're pedaling around

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.380
on it.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.380
I think that's awesome.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.599
Also a nice little bash guard, chain guide
on that front ring.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:53.640
Really looks nice.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.640
And solid pedals.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.789
A lot of times ebikes have sort of plastic
stuff, it's a little easier to slip off.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.590
This bike is just really professional.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.849
It screams professionalism.

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:07.179
They're using the new charging standard, sort
of magnetic adapter there for plugging in

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.520
that battery pack.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.180
Just a beautiful bike.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.870
No lock out on the front shocks but you know,
it gets the job done so, smoothes out the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.870
ride a little bit.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.030
Also, I did like the seat a little bit more
on the Metro.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.489
But I think this one's actually going to be
easier to pedal, it's kind of narrow right

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.400
here verses that sort of Vespa look.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.959
And again, this one offers pedal assist so
you would expect to be pedaling more frequently.

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.709
Of course we've also got these nice disc brakes,
hydraulic disc brakes, pretty standard size

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.680
but it's important to have that if you're
riding a heavier bike and using throttle mode.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.000
And as you squeeze those brakes it cuts out
the throttle so it's a good safety feature.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.349
And I think the coolest thing about this bike
is actually how you start it.

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.489
Got a cute little key fob here.

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.150
Just hold it over the screen like that.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.640
Pow, it just turns on, Hello A2B.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.499
Immediately in twist throttle mode so I could
just twist that and take off, or you use this

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:09.850
little like dial to change pedal assist modes
one: economic, two: standard, and three: high

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.310
power.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.400
So that's just really cool.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.390
I'm going to take it out and give it a ride.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.920
One of the questionable features about these
bikes is the tires.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.129
I like that these ones are a little bit more
narrow than the Metro or rather, now they've

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:26.569
renamed it the Octave.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.870
This will fit in more standard bike racks.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.670
Or even if you've got like a rack on your
car or something.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.099
It doesn't have to be so large.

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.299
They're still extra thick though, they're
going to offer a little bit of padding and

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.700
maybe make it harder to get a flat tire while
you're riding around.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.030
Okay, so I'm just going to pedal and it just
takes right off.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:57.430
Woo! [motor noise] The other thing I wanted
to call out, they're using the TMM4 torque

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.930
sensor, so there's different levels, different
quality I guess in terms of torque sensors

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.720
for pedal assist and this is one of the higher
ones.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.720
Helicopter!

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.980
Woo, look at that!

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.980
Anyway.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.540
Let's go!

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.860
Let's do this again.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.950
Okay, so I start off pedaling, kicks right
in.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.400
Got the nice little dash up there.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.360
[bell rings] The bell, very sweet.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.833
I'm going to go ahead and twist throttle.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:28.833
Oh yeah!

00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:31.470
Man, it just kind of takes right off.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:45.740
[wind noise] This is definitely one of the
smoother electric bikes I've had the chance

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.520
to ride and I guess all of the A2B, you know,
gearless hub motor designs work this way.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.730
They're just really smooth.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:00.130
And I love the hydraulic disc brakes, excellent
stopping power.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.690
Yeah, there we go.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:11.760
Huh, I'm going to change it to pedal assist
level 3 here.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.860
Here we go.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:25.330
Well there you have it.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.330
That's the A2B Alva+.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.210
Not to be mistaken for Jessica Alba, also
very beautiful.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.060
