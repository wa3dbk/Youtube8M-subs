00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.970
Okay, we're going to start putting our pastry
sheets together. We're using cooking spray

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.532
to bind the pastry sheets together. It's really
light, a lot lighter than butter so it will

00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:15.650
keep your little tartlet just flaky and very
light and not weighed down like butter would,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.830
which butter is good in other situations,
just not today for this. I'm going to lightly

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.499
spray this dish, just lightly. That's all
we need for that. All you're going to do is

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:32.661
take your first sheet, lay it down in front
of you and spray it with the cooking spray.

00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:39.071
Again, not too much because you don't want
to weigh it down. Make sure you get the edges

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:45.550
though. The edges will be the first thing
to crack in the oven. So take that, and layer

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:53.960
the next sheet. Perfect temperature for the
sheet. Lay it on, just directly on top, as

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.440
evenly as possible. This one's bunching a
little bit. It does that if you don't lay

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.549
it on exactly even. No big deal, you just
straighten it back out. Very nice. I'm going

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.630
to spray this one. Get the whole thing again
and get the edges. You will use, depending

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.670
on how thick you want them, I use four to
six sheets. Whatever my mood is or whatever

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.380
I'm putting in the little tartlet. Depending
on your filling, how heavy it is, especially

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.890
the vanilla mousse, which we'll make in a
moment, is really light. You don't need a

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.579
really thick shell for that. The Zabaglione
is a little bit heavier, but, I will make

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:47.310
it durable enough to hold up the Zabaglione
as well. These are paper thin so I would use

00:01:47.310 --> 00:02:15.900
four or five sheets. Next sheet. You'll see
that there's some natural cracking in the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.709
sheet. Really not a big deal because it's
all being bound together, as long as you get

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.640
those edges. When you put this in the oven,
it'll cook up very quickly because it is so

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:37.700
thin and again, because the edges will be
the first to crack, so be sure to really spray

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.409
them heavily.
