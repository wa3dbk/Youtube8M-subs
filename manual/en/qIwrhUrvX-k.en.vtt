00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.230
Steps of the translation process:
Initiation : The small ribosomal subunit binds

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:20.650
to the initiator tRNA carrying the initiator
amino acid methionine. This complex then attaches

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.800
to the cap structure at the 5’ end of an
mRNA and scans for the start codon AUG. The

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.220
process is mediated by several initiation
factors. At the start codon, the large ribosomal

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.920
subunit joins the complex and all initiation
factors are released. The ribosome has three

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.640
sites: the A-site is the entry site for new
tRNA charged with amino-acid or aminoacyl-tRNA;

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:02.229
the P-site is occupied by peptidyl-tRNA - the
tRNA that carries the growing polypeptide

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.850
chain; the E-site is the exit site for the
tRNA after it’s done delivering the amino

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.550
acid. The initiator tRNA is positioned in
the P-site.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:25.800
Elongation: A new tRNA carrying an amino acid
enters the A-site of the ribosome. On the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.190
ribosome, the anticodon of the incoming tRNA
is matched against the mRNA codon positioned

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.390
in the A-site. During this proof-reading,
tRNA with incorrect anticodons are rejected

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:49.160
and replaced by new tRNA that are again checked.
When the right aminoacyl-tRNA enters the A-site,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:57.950
a peptide bond is made between the two now-adjacent
amino-acids. As the peptide bond is formed,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.640
the tRNA in the P-site releases the amino-acids
onto the tRNA in the A-site and becomes empty.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.950
At the same time, the ribosome moves one triplet
forward on the mRNA. As a result, the empty

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:23.429
tRNA is now in the E-site and the peptidyl
tRNA is in the P-site. The A-site is now unoccupied

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.090
and is ready to accept a new tRNA. The cycle
is repeated for each codon on the mRNA.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.760
Termination: Termination happens when one
of the three stop codons is positioned in

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.870
the A-site. No tRNA can fit in the A-site
at that point as there are no tRNA that match

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:07.629
the sequence. Instead, these codons are recognized
by a protein, a release factor. Binding of

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.530
the release factor catalyzes the cleavage
of the bond between the polypeptide and the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.930
tRNA. The polypeptide is released from the
ribosome. The ribosome is disassociated into

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.700
subunits and is ready for a new round of translation.
