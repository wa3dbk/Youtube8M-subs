00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.230
Hi, Alan Stratton from As Wood Turns dot com.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.680
The Holy Grail, if you will, for woodturning
is a hollow form or hollow vessel.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.310
Now think of a hollow form as being a hunk
of wood revolving at high speed and you take

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.490
a bent tool and jam it in there and hope to
hollow out the inside.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.380
Now, never mind if you get a catch on the
inside of that and blow up your bowl, blow

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.240
up your shoulder, your arm, whatever.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.620
How about another way to do a hollow form?

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.430
How about a segmented hollow form, complete
with the narrowest opening you could ever

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.300
imagine, or ever want in a hollow form.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.630
So, how about an easy way to do a hollow form.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.100
Let's make it.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.670
For a solid turning, I could simply mount
a hunk of wood on the lathe, start turning,

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.870
and let the shape emerge.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.720
In contrast, segmented turning must start
with a plan.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.920
I'm using powerpoint.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.470
I've drawn a grid on a master layout.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.640
Then on a slide, I draw my shape on top of
the grid.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.780
Having the grid on the master avoids accidently
selecting a grid element when drawing.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.540
After drawing the shape, I overlay rectangles
with my expected segment cross section.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.140
In powerpoint, it is possible to specify the
exact width and height of the rectangle.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.360
From this overlay, I estimate the outer diameter
and segment width that I'll need for the hollow

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.360
form.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.310
This I enter in a worksheet which then calculates
the segment length for each ring.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.070
This one will have five rings each with eight
segments for only forty pieces of wood plus

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.940
one small plug in the base.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.640
The cutting angle is 22.5 degrees.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.290
Then off to the miter saw to cut the segments.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.159
I always use a piece of wood to hold down
the segment instead of a finger.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.530
My fingers are not a renewable resource.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.119
I try to always cut with the long side against
the fence.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.500
This is especially important with very short
segments that may tend to tilt on a very tiny

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.500
side.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.330
To glue the half rings, I lay out a double
layer of masking tape with the sticky side

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.330
up.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.600
After placing the segments on the tape, I
tear off the ends that tend to get in the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.600
way.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.030
Then spread Titebond Original Extend on the
segments and clamp with a band clamp.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.770
I purchased these long band clamps at an automotive
parts store.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.470
These have a screw mechanism that tilts up
for quick adjustment so I can use a long clamp

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.080
for very short pieces.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.840
I'm using small bolts as spacers between the
half rings.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.890
After the glue dries, I'll sand one face of
each half ring slightly so that it will sit

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.960
flat.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.060
No need to be perfectly flat -- I'll do that
later after the ring is complete.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.430
Then with the flat face down, I'll sand the
mating surfaces for the final glue joint.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.670
This eliminates the accumulated error from
cutting angles, the twists, and turns of the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.670
wood.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.970
Finally, I glue the half rings into full rings.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.500
After the glue dries, I'll sand one face perfectly
smooth.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.060
I'll tool the other side flat and parallel
on the lathe since right now, I don't have

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.080
access to a thickness sander.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.260
Now with the top ring mounted to a wood faceplate
with hot melt glue, I'll round it off just

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.580
a little then true the face.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.140
After making sure the face is flat, I can
glue on the next ring.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.680
I've mounted the next ring to another faceplate
with a couple of dabs of hot melt glue.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.340
The faceplate has concentric rings drawn on
its surface to help position the ring on center.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:04:11.130
Then I can use the tail stock to clamp the
two rings together.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.110
With this glue joint dry, I'll rough trim
the top section.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.910
Most importantly, I'll true up the face that
I'll glue to later.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.129
Meanwhile, I followed the same process to
build the bottom section of my hollow form.

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:27.180
This is where I appreciate multiple faceplates.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.000
Since I make and thread my own wood faceplates,
I can have as many as I want in any size that

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I want.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.810
Now I've switched over to the bottom section
of the hollow form.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.280
I'll do a rough hollow now just to get the
interior uniform.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:05:00.560
I don't want to do very much of the interior
until I'm sure of the exterior shape.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.720
At this point, I still have the upper and
lower sections separate.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.520
I'll reverse the top section onto the tail
stock with a cone center on the live center.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.210
I'll tool the two pieces together with only
tail stock pressure while I establish the

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:28.979
exterior profile.

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.699
Now with the exterior completed, I'll hollow
out the bottom section.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:58.780
My gouge works good enough for this task.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:10.250
Then switch to finish hollowing the top section.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:22.080
Finally, I can glue to two sections together.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.480
The tail stock supplies the clamping pressure.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.100
With the hollow form now glued together, I
can refine its exterior.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.760
But, I have to be careful.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.310
I know I have about 3/8" wall thickness on
the sides and a little more on the top.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.500
It will be plenty.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.800
I'll use a gouge both in cutting mode and
shear scraping mode -- Whichever fees right

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:54.710
at the time.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:01.020
With the timber sanded thru 400 grit and walnut
oil applied, I'll part it off from the faceplate

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.350
aiming to be a little concave.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:09.639
By the way, I had glued the base section to
its faceplate with standard yellow glue.

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:15.009
I'll clean up the bottom by mounting a small
sanding disk in a Jacobs chuck and sanding

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:16.800
off any remaining marks.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.630
I usually do this in a drill press which is
safer than using the lathe.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.960
Voila, a completed hollow form without any
catches or shoulder injuries.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.710
No blind tool work.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.389
It has a smaller opening than I've ever seen
in a solid work.

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:40.139
In fact, I drilled it out a little more so
it can receive a flower stem or whatever.

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:43.069
What possibilities do you see?
