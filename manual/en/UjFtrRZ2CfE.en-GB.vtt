Hi, I'm Brodie From Better Music. Today we're
going to have a look at some mini acoustics

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:34.010
- 3 in particular. We've got a Taylor GS Mini,
a Maton EML6 - which is a standard mini guitar,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.210
and the Martin LX1E - this one is the Ed Sheeran.
We'll start on this one today. It's a high-pressure

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.900
laminate back and sides with a solid mahogany
top. It's got a pickup, but today we're not

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.070
going to listen to the pickup, but we'll listen
to the guitar itself. Let's have a play and

00:00:51.070 --> 00:01:26.990
we'll have a listen. So, you can hear it's
a bit flatter - that's due to the high-pressure

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.750
laminate. You've also got a stacked high-pressure
composite neck, which is ridiculously strong,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.260
especially in weird climates like Canberra.
Alright, next we'll move on to Mini Maton

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.830
and we'll have a quick look at that one. Alright,
so now we have the mini Maton, this is the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.060
EML6 - this is their standard version - they
do a 12-string version of this one. They also

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.780
have a Diesel signature in a 6 and a 12 and
they just brought out a solid mahogany version

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.810
in a 6 and a 12 string. This one has a solid
spruce top with a laminate Queensland maple

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.160
back and sides. Let's have a quick listen
to this one and see what it sounds like compared

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:39.790
to the Martin. So, as you can hear, it's a
bit brighter than the Martin. It'll probably

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:56.510
handle... 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.370
Chimey chords up the fretboard, that's the
Queensland maple - it's quite bright. The

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.470
next one we'll listen to is the Taylor GS
Mini. Alright, now we have the Taylor GS Mini,

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.460
this is their standard version. It's got a
solid spruce top with sapele back and sides.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.190
The main difference, and it's a little bit
bigger than the other two, but you've actually

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.879
got an arched back, which adds a lot of resonance
to the sound of the guitar and when you've

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.230
got a mini guitar, having that full body sound
really helps. This is quite popular, this

00:03:25.230 --> 00:04:00.690
is probably my best selling one, but we'll
have a quick listen and see what you think.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.050
And it sustains for days. The tone out of
this Taylor is pretty next-level compared

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:26.610
to the other minis, even with the higher chords
up the top. You can hear every single note

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.810
ringing out and it articulates every single
note really well, but it still sounds full,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.810
you know, not thin or anything. I highly recommend
the Taylor over the other two - it's definitely

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.550
my best seller. But, come in store and check
it out. Don't forget to subscribe and I'll

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.350
see you next time.
