00:00:01.775 --> 00:00:02.796
- Hey guys.

00:00:02.796 --> 00:00:06.721
Today I'm going to be
making a delicious pasta.

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:09.531
It's gonna be like a creamy tomato, pesto,

00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:12.142
and vegetables and some chicken.

00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:16.021
And I'm making quite a lot
because I want to have leftovers.

00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:17.855
So I've got water boiling.

00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:19.306
We're gonna salt that.

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:22.081
I'm gonna throw some
olive oil into the pan,

00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:24.937
put the onions in, put the peppers in,

00:00:24.937 --> 00:00:27.027
and then mushrooms.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.337
Actually gonna cook the chicken separately

00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:32.066
so I think I'll do that before rather,

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.875
and then I'm gonna throw in the sauce.

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:36.118
You can use tomato sauce,

00:00:36.118 --> 00:00:38.463
I'm gonna be using tomato paste

00:00:38.463 --> 00:00:41.156
and some chicken stock,

00:00:41.156 --> 00:00:42.239
and also some

00:00:45.687 --> 00:00:48.354
secret ingredient, coconut milk.

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:51.023
And also some pesto.

00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:55.881
And other veggies, that
I haven't yet prepped,

00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:58.505
gonna do garlic, some avocado,

00:00:58.505 --> 00:00:59.505
and spinach.

00:01:00.696 --> 00:01:02.738
So you don't need to use all this,

00:01:02.738 --> 00:01:06.755
I'm just doing that because I
want to make medley of pasta.

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:09.739
So choose what you want to put in it.

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:12.769
But follow the base,
of basically it's like

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:15.881
a creamy tomato but using
coconut milk instead.

00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:18.017
We're gonna use salt,
we're gonna use spices

00:01:18.017 --> 00:01:22.184
like oregano and basil, and
it is gonna be delicious.

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:36.024
I changed my mind, I'm
just gonna throw it in

00:01:36.024 --> 00:01:37.301
with the chicken.

00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:39.345
The chicken's like one inch squares,

00:01:39.345 --> 00:01:43.512
so it's not gonna over
cook, that's not my concern.

00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:46.775
Everything's gonna be cooked a little raw,

00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:48.692
we're gonna do it fast.

00:01:50.873 --> 00:01:54.123
Well, not the chicken, but the veggies.

00:02:04.306 --> 00:02:08.624
I'm gonna throw in a mixture
of oregano and basil,

00:02:08.624 --> 00:02:09.457
for herbs.

00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:16.520
About a teaspoon,

00:02:18.307 --> 00:02:19.890
maybe a tablespoon.

00:02:21.337 --> 00:02:22.504
And mushrooms.

00:02:29.998 --> 00:02:33.238
Okay at this point I'm
gonna put about a handful,

00:02:33.238 --> 00:02:35.931
I guess that's like 150 milligrams maybe,

00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:37.598
of pasta, raw pasta,

00:02:38.787 --> 00:02:43.013
and this is probably enough
for two, three portions.

00:02:43.013 --> 00:02:45.568
It blows up quite a lot.

00:02:45.568 --> 00:02:47.878
And I prefer having more
sauce and vegetables

00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:49.461
instead of noodles.

00:02:50.514 --> 00:02:54.183
So I'm putting 156
milliliters of tomato paste

00:02:54.183 --> 00:02:55.266
in the pasta.

00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:03.038
400 milliliters of coconut milk.

00:03:19.063 --> 00:03:21.663
I'm cheating and I'm
gonna use about a teaspoon

00:03:21.663 --> 00:03:24.746
of chicken bouillon or chicken stock.

00:03:30.882 --> 00:03:33.180
So I'm going to be cooking it al dente

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.347
and it says on the instructions
appear to be eight minutes.

00:03:38.265 --> 00:03:42.432
So we're gonna do it for
eight minutes or to taste.

00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:48.528
Then I'm gonna throw in about
two tablespoons of pesto.

00:04:00.212 --> 00:04:02.009
You could make your own,
but I love having this stuff

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.509
on hand, always in the fridge.

00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:09.972
It's so good for vinaigrettes
or every pasta I make.

00:04:11.912 --> 00:04:13.162
Put it in last.

00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:18.621
I'll throw in an avocado as well.

00:04:31.068 --> 00:04:33.495
I'm gonna put about two cups of spinach,

00:04:33.495 --> 00:04:34.912
another variable.

00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:49.000
Pasta is done.

00:04:51.073 --> 00:04:52.999
I'm gonna dump out most of the water,

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:54.184
but we're actually gonna be using

00:04:54.184 --> 00:04:55.600
a bit of the water for the sauce.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.690
Just a bit because I
already have it quite saucy.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.357
So based upon how saucy
your pasta sauce is,

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:05.933
but the pasta water
actually has a good flavor,

00:05:05.933 --> 00:05:08.360
it's nice and, it's basically salty water.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.892
Good salty water.

00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:10.725
Starchy.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.873
I'm just gonna dump that.

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:31.615
And something you can do
to really bind it together

00:05:31.615 --> 00:05:34.517
is put in an egg, add some nice nutrition,

00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:36.177
cheap nutrition.

00:05:36.177 --> 00:05:37.927
Free-range of course.

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.466
And just throw it in there.

00:05:51.665 --> 00:05:54.741
Mix it all around, still have some heat

00:05:54.741 --> 00:05:56.704
because you want the egg still to cook,

00:05:56.704 --> 00:05:59.371
it's like you would a carbonara.

00:06:01.777 --> 00:06:05.191
But it'll really thicken up the sauce.

00:06:05.191 --> 00:06:06.108
We're done.

00:06:18.314 --> 00:06:22.064
Give it a taste, could
have done this before.

00:06:24.537 --> 00:06:26.287
See if it needs salt.

00:06:28.252 --> 00:06:29.585
And very little.

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:34.752
A bit of pepper.

00:06:39.862 --> 00:06:42.253
We have about five portions,

00:06:42.253 --> 00:06:45.003
done in approximately 20 minutes.

00:06:47.395 --> 00:06:48.312
Good stuff.

00:07:12.792 --> 00:07:14.554
We're gonna learn lots together,

00:07:14.554 --> 00:07:16.899
so Like and Subscribe.

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:18.899
Please, I'm begging you!
