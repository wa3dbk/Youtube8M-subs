00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.100
Hello! Welcome to Archana's Kitchen.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.000
We make Spinach Chicken, Spinach Cottage Cheese 
or Spinach Potatoes almost regularly.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400
We often make such dishes.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.900
I'm sure you must have never Green Chicken
Biryani with spinach.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.400
So today I shall teach you to make
Green Chicken Biryani.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500
Stay tuned to Archana's Kitchen.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.100
Let's start cooking by putting on the
 gas stove and heating some oil.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.100
I've put on the flame. Let's take
some oil.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.200
We need about 3 - 4 tablespoons of oil.
We require more for this dish.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.700
Actually I'm adding 4 - 5 tablespoons of oil.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Once the oil is hot add 1 tablespoon of
crushed ginger-garlic paste to it.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.200
We've a ground masala here which consists of
green chillies, coriander leaves and onions.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100
Add the mint leaves in the wok.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600
Never chop the mint leaves. Break them
with your hands.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.100
If you cut or chop them with scissors or
knife then they turn black.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Add salt to taste.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Some fried onions as well.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
In goes the spinach paste too.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200
Stir and mix everything nicely.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.100
Add the chicken now. We have taken half
a kilo of chicken.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.700
Give it a nice stir.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The chicken should get coated nicely with
the masala.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.100
Let's cook this for 10 - 15 minutes.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.100
Before that we shall add a tablespoon of 
lemon juice to the chicken.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.100
The chicken is cooked. Time to set the
biryani.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.600
We have taken a vessel for this purpose.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.400
We need to transfer this chicken gravy into 
this vessel.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.100
We will now pour rice over it.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:46.100
We are adding about 400 grams of boiled
rice to the chicken.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Make a proper layer of the rice by
spreading it evenly.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.100
Don't press it to make it compact. Let it
be loosely spread in the vessel.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.100
We have some fried onions with us.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.300
Add these fried onions.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.200
Pour a tablespoon of water on top.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.900
Mix the onions with rice loosely on top.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.200
Cover the vessel with a lid and let it steam
for about 10 minutes.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.200
Put on the gas flame.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.100
Wait for 10 minutes.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.300
Let's check if it is steaming now.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.100
it has steamed really well.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.600
Put off the gas flame now.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.100
It's time for plating.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500
Piping hot green chicken biryani is ready.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.200
We are garnishing it with a few mint leaves.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Decorate it well with mint leaves. The aroma
of mint leaves is just superb.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.300
Fried onions are looking marvellous.
This dish is too tempting.
