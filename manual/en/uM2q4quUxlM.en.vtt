Lim chang jung m/v

00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:27.178
I do the laundries
That's been piling up

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.099
I take a shower as if
I'm washing it away

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:49.659
A friend called me to have
A drink, and I go to empty my mind

00:00:51.589 --> 00:01:04.979
I walk and walk thinking about you
I cry because I miss you so much

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:20.239
The songs on the street sounds
Like my story, story of you and me

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:28.069
This is the most ordinary song
Listen to it

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.878
This is a song sung by everyone

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:46.449
You can't cry no matter how sad
You just need to let it go like a ordinary breakup

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.058
Just like ordinary song lyrics

00:01:58.073 --> 00:02:03.212
Everyone is full of wounds
In front of love

00:02:05.344 --> 00:02:12.143
You left me
With a hurt heart

00:02:12.664 --> 00:02:27.123
That song we used to sang together
It's a story of us, story of you and me

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:34.343
This is the most ordinary song
Listen to it

00:02:34.903 --> 00:02:41.664
This is a song sung by everyone

00:02:42.223 --> 00:02:53.754
You can't cry no matter how sad
You just need to let it go like a ordinary break up

00:02:54.105 --> 00:02:59.066
Just like ordinary song lyrics

00:02:59.605 --> 00:03:06.076
I can't forget about you
I can't let you go

00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:15.436
Come back to me 
after hearing this song

00:03:15.755 --> 00:03:26.826
This is the most ordinary song
(This is the most ordinary song, listen to it)

00:03:27.246 --> 00:03:34.085
Listen to it
(This is a song sung by everyone)

00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:44.575
You can't cry no matter how sad
You just need to let it go like a ordinary breakup

00:03:45.164 --> 00:03:52.395
Just like ordinary song lyrics

00:04:07.655 --> 00:04:12.083
Ordinary song
