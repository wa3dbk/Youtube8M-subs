00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.070
Grand Theft Auto 3 changed the world of video
games.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.040
No longer were just levels good enough but
people wanted to enter a living world.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.390
And it was obvious that other companies besides
Rockstar were more than happy to bring it

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.390
to them.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.100
It was not long before imitations, dubbed
GTA Clones, were popping up all over the place.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.030
And one of the first ones to receive that
title was the True Crime series.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:04.960
But while it took the idea of an open-world,
it does many things differently, some make

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.240
for a better experience while others, not
so much.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.310
Unlike GTA, you play from the other side of
the law.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.730
That’s right, instead of a criminal moving
up the crime ladder, you play as a cop, a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.979
cop named Nick Kang to be more specific.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.490
Nick is a loose cannon cop, wanting to do
things his way rather than by the book.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.470
He returns to LA to right his father’s name
and seek revenge on those who ruined it.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.280
One of the most interesting aspects of True
Crime is the open-world itself and that is

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.060
a true replication of Los Angeles.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.770
Areas like Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and Santa
Monica are yours to explore.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.990
The streets are labeled and appear at the
top of the screen as you drive through the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.990
city.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.920
It’s a nice touch that reminds you these
are real places.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.870
And there are plenty of things to do on the
streets.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.270
Since you are a cop, you will be driving around
when you will hear on your radio about crimes

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.299
happening in your area, which you can then
go to and solve the situation.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.390
Depending on how you handle the situation
will affect your good cop/ bad cop meter.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.209
You can be a good cop if you subdue the criminals
and bring justice, or you can be a bad cop

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:23.820
and bring a different kind of justice, enforced
by your dual pistols.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:31.230
It’s a nice mechanic but gets wonky.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.620
If you accidentally run over a pedestrian,
you will receive bad points.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.690
So if you are trying to be a good cop, that
can be derailed by a couple badly timed turns.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.040
The game also have a much more robust combat
system than GTA.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.840
The shooting is flashy, with dives and dual-wielding,
it is clear to see the Hong Kong action films

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.090
influence.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.220
But also much time has been spent on the Kung-Fu,
with plenty of punches, kicks and finishing

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.480
moves.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:10.349
Criminals should remember, Nick’s Kung-Fu,
is better than theirs.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.600
True Crime Streets of LA gets the title of
GTA clone.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.310
It has everything you could want: a good storyline,
which has Christopher Walken in it, enjoyable

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:29.719
combat, and great soundtrack to listen to
while driving around LA.
