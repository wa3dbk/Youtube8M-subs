MAIRA:
Hi, I'm Maira,
I work at the Blick

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.300
in Lincoln Park in Chicago.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.300
I've been working there
as a sales associate

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.100
for about a year and a half.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.067
I'd say my favorite part about
working at Blick is how much

00:00:15.067 --> 00:00:17.933
you're inspired by
the customers that come in,

00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.300
the questions that they have,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.600
so it's very inspiring
to just see how interested

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.800
people are in the product.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.900
Just looking through
the products that we have

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.467
definitely peaks my curiosity
about them.

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:32.933
We've been getting a ton of
new product in

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:36.533
that has been really interesting

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:41.433
and testing out that product
has really influenced my work.

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:44.767
A lot of my more recent
watercolour work

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:49.033
and illustrations and sculptures
have definitely been effected

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:53.200
by that push
towards abstraction,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.433
so the Winsor &amp; Newton
Watercolour Markers,

00:00:56.433 --> 00:01:00.900
if an artist is used to using
an alcohol based

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.133
illustration marker
like the Primsacolor Markers

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.533
or Copic,

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.200
or the Blick Studio
Illustration Markers,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.633
these are very
comparable to those markers.

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:16.267
The marks that they make,
their blendability,

00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:18.733
but the biggest benefit
is that instead of using

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:22.967
a blender pen you can always
just use water to blend it.

00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:25.167
So the Winsor &amp; Newton
Watercolor Sticks,

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:27.133
they sort of remind me of
a hybrid between

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.700
a water soluble crayon

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.000
and like the pan sets
of watercolours,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.567
so you can either like
wet your brush

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:38.500
and take it
straight to the stick

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.967
and just paint from that,

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:43.900
or you can take it
directly to the paper,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.900
draw whatever
you want on the paper,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.800
and then rewet it
with a brush,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.200
or you could
wet your paper first

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.300
and then draw with it

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.633
and you'll get
a similar effect.

00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:56.167
So with the pool paintings
that I've been working with

00:01:56.167 --> 00:02:00.633
with watercolour,
I sort of dive into it.

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:05.700
I pick a certain type of paper
that I'm interested in.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.300
I've been working
with smoother hot press

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.067
watercolour papers.

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:12.033
As soon as
I picked out the paper,

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:14.100
I dive right into it.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.200
I pick up usually
a fairly large mop brush,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.067
lay down a pool of water
in whatever organic shape

00:02:24.067 --> 00:02:27.433
sort of seems appropriate,

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:30.000
and then as soon as
that pool is laid down

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.700
on top of the paper,
I will dip my watercolour brush,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.567
a smaller brush usually
straight into whatever pigment

00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:42.400
I have on my palette.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.167
The Winsor &amp; Newton paints
have like a high quality

00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:49.533
in pigment
that does go really far.

00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:53.600
The paints are very pigmented
and I can definitely tell now

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.633
with that type of painting
that I'm doing.

00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:01.733
Usually I'll work with
the sort of the same tones

00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:04.200
in one little pool,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.267
and then I'll sort of just
swirl it around in the water,

00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:10.800
let it sort of disperse,
do its own thing,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.200
mix with the other pigments
that I've put into it,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.233
and as soon as
that's over,

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:20.000
as soon as that first pool
has been laid down

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.567
and sort of altered,

00:03:22.567 --> 00:03:26.600
I'll lay down the next one
sort of in shape...

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.633
in sort of a corresponding shape
to the one before it

00:03:32.633 --> 00:03:34.333
so that they all sort of
fit together

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:38.733
in a fluid sort of
cellular fashion.

00:03:38.733 --> 00:03:42.867
