00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.170
How would Jennifer Lawrence introduce a video?

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.879
WHOOSH WHERE’S THE PIZZA?!

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:05.879
Hey guys!

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:23.560
Today I’m going to be doing the Jennifer
Lawrence book tag!

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.510
This tag was originally created by Michael
the book lion, but I’m actually going to

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.230
be doing an altered version of this tag that
was created by Natasha over at tashapolis.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.230
So without further ado let’s jump in to
this derby wonderful tag.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.390
Number one swearing off social media!

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.920
For those of you who don’t know Jennifer
Lawrence does not use social media.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.290
She doesn’t use instagram, twitter, Facebook.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.930
So the question that goes along with this
one, pick a book that you refuse to read.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.310
For this one I’m going with Hush Hush by
Becca Fitzpatrick.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.989
I read Black Ice by Becca Fitzpatrick and
while I actually enjoyed this book, I know

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.040
that a lot of people didn’t like this book,
I personally enjoyed it.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.130
And while I did enjoy this, I didn’t necessarily
like the writing and because of that reason

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.579
I just don’t have any real desire to pick
up the hush hush series.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.479
Number two, the oscar trip!

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.420
For those of you who don’t know, I’d be
surprised if you didn’t know, Jennifer Lawrence

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.259
tripped at the oscars So to go along with
this, we’ve got a book / book series that

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:18.420
hit a snag for you.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.310
This happens to me a lot actually even if
I’m enjoying a book, like really enjoying

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.389
it, loving it, sometimes I just get distracted
by other shiny new books and I will just set

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:27.389
it aside.

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:31.439
And it’s not necessarily that it hits a
snag, but it’s me being like OH SHINY NEW

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.600
BOOK.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.399
For example, I started reading Faking Normal
by Courtney C Stevens, when I was on my way

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.369
back from Book Expo America traveling home.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.810
I started reading it and I loved it, it was
so good!

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.719
I got about 75 pages in and then I was just
traveling home and I had a bunch of books

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.759
with me and I pulled out another book but
I just completely ditched this book for a

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.759
shiny new book.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.020
How terrible of me, I know!

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.149
Another example would be love letters to the
dead I was actually buddy reading this with

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.009
a friend I got about a hundred pages in and
there was just too many similarities to the

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.929
perks of being a wallflower and so that just
mmm I couldn’t continue reading because

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.889
I just couldn’t separate the two in my mind.

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:08.810
I just kept making comparisons and that’s
never a good thing when you’re reading a

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.349
book and it’s just so similar to another
book that you love and you’re just constantly

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.650
making comparisons and so I just had to shove
it aside and I actually ended up getting rid

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.430
of it, because I just couldn’t separate
the two.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.049
Like I just couldn’t do it, it hit a big
snag for me!

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.840
And another one is the scorch trials and this
is one that I actually was able to power through

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.360
and end up finishing, but I had the hardest
time getting through this book and I think

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.780
it’s because it’s so different from the
maze runner.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.329
The characters go in this really weird direction.

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.519
This story really takes a weird turn and I
just wasn’t a huge fan of it and so it took

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.190
me so long to read this.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.370
I would pick it up be like eh not feeling
it, put it down.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.349
Pick it up, eh don’t want to do it!

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.520
I think it took a read a thin for me to actually
plow through this book which I’m glad that

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.230
I finally got through it, because it was driving
me crazy at the fact that I wasn’t able

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.230
to finish it.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.480
Number three, the viral photobomb, the best
photobomb there ever was.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.550
A book / series that you didn’t know would
get so popular.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.609
I’m going to go with Me and Earl and the
Dying Girl I read this a couple years ago

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.900
when Raeleen was like pushing it on everybody
and everybody was reading it and loving it.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.989
There’s now been a movie that has been made
of this book which is awesome. and I just

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.391
never expected this book to blow up in the
way that it did.

00:03:15.391 --> 00:03:19.120
Number four work with David O Russell your
favorite dysfunctional character.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.670
I’m gonna go with Cadence from We Were Liars,
because she’s a very dysfunctional character.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.909
and it’s because of all the things that
she’s going through that makes her dysfunctional

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.590
like she’s going through a very rough time
and that affects her life in a very dysfunctional

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.629
way so Cadence from We Were Liars.

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.030
I don’t want to say too much, because I
don’t want to spoil you, but She’s a very

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.050
dysfunctional character.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.579
Number five Mystique.

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.969
Jennifer Lawrence actually plays Mystique
in the newer versions of x-men.

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:47.130
So this question is a villain who thinks they’re
doing what’s right.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.640
I’m gonna have to go with Light from the
Manga Death Note, because even though he thinks

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.999
he’s doing something right in this story
and he thinks that he is making the world

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:59.060
a better place, he’s becoming a murderer
himself and it’s just really twisted.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.889
He’s a very twisted character.

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.709
Number six, Bradley Cooper!

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.019
Jennifer Lawrence works a lot with Bradley
Cooper they continue to do a lot of films

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.799
together which is awesome because I think
that they work great together.

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.480
So for this one, what author do you continue
to go back to.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.310
Victoria Schwab, hands down, without a doubt,
I continue to go back to her books, because

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.480
she continues to impress me and I continue
to love every book that she puts out.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.560
She’s one of those authors that I trust,
I go into her books trusting that I’m going

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.911
to have my mind completely blown, trusting
that I’m going to love the characters, and

00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:31.560
knowing that I’m going to leave that book
with a very satisfying ending, never really

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.100
leaving you hanging and just constantly feeling
satisfied after leaving her books.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.120
Number seven, spoiler for homeland.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.030
Jennifer Lawrence was doing an interview and
she watches the show homeland and the interviewer

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.100
straight up spoiled something that happens
in homeland and jennifer like freaks out.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.500
I’ll actually leave a link to the video
down below, because it’s hilarious.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.980
Jennifer Lawrence’s reaction - she can’t
even deal with the interviewer she gets so

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.330
ticked off and it’s so funny.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.110
Obviously it’s horrible that she got spoiled,
but her reaction is priceless.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.960
So for this one a plot line that you were
spoiled for.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.110
I was actually spoiled for the beautiful creatures
plot line, but it was my own decision.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.670
I was watching one of Christine Riccio’s
videos and there was actually a spoiler warning

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.720
for the series.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.130
She was like I’m going to go into detail,
I’m going to tell you what happens in the

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.130
end.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.460
But I knew that I was never going to continue
on with the series, so I spoiled myself for

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.490
the ending of that series.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.150
And I can’t believe that it ends in the
way that it does like that just - wow.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.110
Emotional and crazy.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.090
I can’t believe they ended it that way!

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.420
I’m obviously not going to say, but yes,
I spoiled myself for the Beautiful Creatures

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.420
series.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.880
Number eight Ieveryone’s obsession with
being Jennifer Lawrence’s best friend.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.680
I wanna be Jennifer Lawrence’s best friend!

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.290
A character that makes your ultimate best
friend.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.410
Kenji from the Shatter Me trilogy.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.460
He would be the best friend.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.940
I wanna be his best friend, he’s hilarious,
he’s trustworthy, and he’s just down right

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.970
fantastic and he would be the ultimate best
friend to have.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.140
Number nine The Hunger Games - What is your
favorite high profile series?

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.850
I’m gonna go with the mortal instruments
series even though I haven’t completed it,

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.070
I love that series.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.310
That series is just so fun!

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.770
It’s such an interesting series, it’s
got diverse characters, it’s got these crazy

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.010
plot lines and plot twists and I just thoroughly
enjoy that series.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.010
Even though I haven’t finished it, I still
need to read the infernal devices.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.010
I KNOW!

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.620
It’s happening soon, it’s happening soon!

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.150
Number ten, everything Jennifer Lawrence has
ever said, everything, because everything

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.940
she says is perfection, not really, but close
to perfection.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.100
Your favorite snarky / comedic character.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.260
I’m gonna have to go with Lila from A Darker
Shade of Magic.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.240
She’s just a snarky character she doesn’t
put up with anybody’s crap, and she’s

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.090
always got a fantastic comeback when somebody
tries to insult her.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.780
So that was the Jennifer Lawrence book tag!

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.970
I hope that you guys enjoyed this video.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.780
You guys should let me know down below who
your favorite crazy character is, because

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.680
I think Jennifer Lawrence is crazy in the
best way possible!

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.140
So let me know down below who your favorite
crazy character is and I will see you guys

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.990
soon with a new video!

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.990
WHOOSH LATER!

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.990
WHOOSH.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.890
This tag was originally created by Michael
the book lion aweifjwlejfwjf So for that … Another

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.860
example would be love letters to the dead.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.940
I got in woooo She’s always got a comeback
right then and there she’s always - she’s

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.200
really good at comebacks *crazy face*
