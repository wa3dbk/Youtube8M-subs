Getting Started: PlayMaker Basics

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.829
This video provides a quick
introduction to some PlayMaker basics.

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:10.599
Here we have a simple test scene.

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.189
Let's say we want to control this cube
using PlayMaker.

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:15.879
We can select the cube

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.599
and add a State Machine or FSM for short.

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.320
Every state machine has a Start state.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.339
Let's call this state

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.449
Off

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.229
Now let's add an action to the state.

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:35.810
The Action Browser shows all the actions
available.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.750
Let's select a Material action.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.580
Set Material Color

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.540
and add it to the state.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.500
Now we can set the color
to red.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.860
Now if we press play

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.480
we'll see that the off state is active

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.690
and the cube is red.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.790
The graph view here

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.479
is where you add states and transitions.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.520
So let's right click on the canvas

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.760
and add a new state.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.370
Let's call this state: On

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.370
Now we want to add a transition from the
Off state the On state.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.470
So we can right click the Off state

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.010
and add a transition.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.930
Transitions are triggered by events.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.970
If we right click on the transition

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.190
we can see all the built-in events.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.870
Let's use MOUSE DOWN

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.030
which is sent when you click on an object.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.480
and drag a link to the On state.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.770
In the On state

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.770
set the material color to green.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.650
Now if we press play...

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.250
and you click on the box

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.000
the On state becomes active and the
cube is green.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.280
To finish this simple example

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.280
lets add a transition back to the
Off state on MOUSE UP.

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:19.399
Now let's test it...

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Great!
