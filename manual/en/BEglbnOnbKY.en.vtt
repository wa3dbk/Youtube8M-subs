00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:02.968
(tranquil music)

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.947
- Introducing the new and improved

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:12.197
ABC Arbonne Baby Care line.

00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:16.391
Hi, I'm Michael D'Arminio,
Arbonne's Chief Creative Officer.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.442
- And Doctor Peter, the
Chief Scientific Officer.

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:21.464
- So, we're thrilled to be here today

00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:24.970
to actually announce the
launch of our new and improved

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.525
ABC Arbonne Baby Care line.

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:30.474
So, did you know that a third
of parents feel that products

00:00:30.474 --> 00:00:33.666
containing natural or organic ingredients

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.871
are safer for use on their baby or child?

00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:39.727
When it comes to babies
and personal care products,

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:42.060
safety is always number one.

00:00:43.012 --> 00:00:45.613
And moms looking for
safe, beneficial products

00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:49.456
are a great entry point
for the Arbonne business.

00:00:49.456 --> 00:00:52.277
Less is more, fewer ingredients,

00:00:52.277 --> 00:00:54.944
and just more of the good stuff.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.854
- That's why we use only what's needed,

00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:01.405
ingredients working together,

00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:04.357
made with most mild, gentle,

00:01:04.357 --> 00:01:06.663
soothing ingredients from nature,

00:01:06.663 --> 00:01:10.597
safe for the baby's soft, delicate skin.

00:01:10.597 --> 00:01:14.430
- Tested and loved by moms and dads,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.144
pediatrician tested,

00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:18.196
ophthamologist tested,

00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:20.023
and allergy tested.

00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:23.190
And in new, fantastic squeezable tubes

00:01:24.128 --> 00:01:25.795
with a flip top cap,

00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:30.249
makes them more convenient
to use and to store.

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:32.813
Peter, let's share a little
about our ingredients.

00:01:32.813 --> 00:01:33.975
- Okay.

00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:38.758
These key ingredients are
what's behind all ABC products

00:01:38.758 --> 00:01:42.154
working hard to protect your baby.

00:01:42.154 --> 00:01:46.317
Each hand-select
ingredient is multitasking,

00:01:46.317 --> 00:01:49.650
functional, and beneficial to baby skin.

00:01:51.147 --> 00:01:55.314
Vitamin E, moisturizing antioxidant
that calms and hydrates.

00:01:57.863 --> 00:02:00.852
Sunflower oil, because infant skin

00:02:00.852 --> 00:02:04.565
is 20 to 30 percent
thinner than adult skin,

00:02:04.565 --> 00:02:07.342
it loses moisture more quickly.

00:02:07.342 --> 00:02:10.783
So, sunflower oil is used as an emollient.

00:02:10.783 --> 00:02:14.783
It softens skin and helps
it to retain moisture.

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:20.654
Chamomile extract has
natural moisturizing property

00:02:20.654 --> 00:02:22.487
that soothe and calms.

00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:28.088
Calendula extract, gentle,
nourishing botanical.

00:02:28.088 --> 00:02:31.338
And also Aloe barbadensis leaf extract,

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.022
excellent moisturizing, cleansing agent.

00:02:37.637 --> 00:02:40.046
- So, let's now review the entire line

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:42.383
and our really great products.

00:02:42.383 --> 00:02:46.917
First, so our Mineral Sunscreen
Broad Spectrum SPF 30,

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:48.895
mineral sunscreen lotion that promotes

00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:52.097
effective protection from UVA/UVB rays.

00:02:52.097 --> 00:02:54.860
It soothes and moisturizes.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.598
- [Peter] Sunscreen
chemical-free, non-nano zinc oxide

00:02:59.598 --> 00:03:04.184
mineral sunscreen actively
provides a physical barrier

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:08.351
between the skin and
damaging UVA/UVB rays.

00:03:10.164 --> 00:03:12.022
- [Michael] The Hair
and Body Wash is gentle

00:03:12.022 --> 00:03:16.105
but effective cleansing
for face, body, and hair.

00:03:16.948 --> 00:03:20.158
- [Peter] Naturally scented,
also, with an essential oil

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:24.309
made of a blend of cottonseed, vanillin,

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.559
and sandalwood to help calm the senses.

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:29.408
- [Michael] And let's not forget

00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:31.588
the fantastic Diaper Rash Cream,

00:03:31.588 --> 00:03:33.997
which helps treat and prevent diaper rash.

00:03:33.997 --> 00:03:37.306
It protects chafed skin due to diaper rash

00:03:37.306 --> 00:03:39.889
and helps protect from wetness.

00:03:40.818 --> 00:03:43.446
- [ Peter] Non-nano
zinc oxide helps soothe

00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:47.016
and relieve diaper rash discomforts.

00:03:47.016 --> 00:03:50.769
- [Michael] And finally, our ABC Arbonne

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.373
Body Care Baby Lotion,

00:03:53.373 --> 00:03:56.000
clinically proven to
provide 24 hour moisture,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.089
ultra mild, and ultra soothing.

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:00.903
- [Peter] And the key ingredients are

00:04:00.903 --> 00:04:04.052
the combination of soothing
blend of shea butter,

00:04:04.052 --> 00:04:07.363
aloe, vitamin E, and chamomile,

00:04:07.363 --> 00:04:09.451
gently providing moisturization

00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:13.618
through a protective and
natural emollient antioxidant,

00:04:15.053 --> 00:04:17.723
scented with a natural essential oil blend

00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:21.056
of cotton seed, vanillin, and sandalwood

00:04:21.998 --> 00:04:24.712
to help calm the senses.

00:04:24.712 --> 00:04:27.803
- There you have it, ABC Baby Care line.

00:04:27.803 --> 00:04:30.589
And in a clinical study
using the hair and body wash

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:34.126
and 30 sets of parents,
100 percent agreed that

00:04:34.126 --> 00:04:37.304
the baby skin felt clean and soft,

00:04:37.304 --> 00:04:38.584
that the wash is suitable

00:04:38.584 --> 00:04:41.618
for baby's delicate, sensitive skin,

00:04:41.618 --> 00:04:45.560
and that the intent to
purchase was at 100 percent,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.492
meaning they absolutely love it.

00:04:48.492 --> 00:04:52.497
