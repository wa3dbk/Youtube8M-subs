00:00:00.207 --> 00:00:02.069
- So to modify your existing box

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:04.278
for the Three Flow frame light kit,

00:00:04.278 --> 00:00:06.235
it's a simple process of just cutting

00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:07.895
two doorways into a box.

00:00:07.895 --> 00:00:09.575
So if you've got an old box,

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:11.572
you can use it for your flow frames.

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:14.204
The measurements are 147 across,

00:00:14.204 --> 00:00:16.383
and 150 millimeters high.

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.890
Now, you can make it higher if you want.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.223
It's just a doorway, so you
can visually view the frames.

00:00:22.223 --> 00:00:26.682
But the 147 wide is the
important measurement.

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:28.599
The top one is 152 wide

00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:32.220
by 25 millimeters high.

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:35.012
You can use a CD

00:00:36.805 --> 00:00:38.571
to give you a nice rounded corner

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:41.087
to follow with your jigsaw.

00:00:41.087 --> 00:00:43.170
Or anything else rounded.

00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:48.708
(jigsaw sawing)

00:01:03.576 --> 00:01:06.700
I find the metal cutting
blades give a better cut.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.117
Nice, fine teeth.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.201
So, this box will go on
top of your existing box.

00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:24.284
The frames go in like so.

00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:32.256
The doorway for the tools.

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:36.786
The doorway for the visual
and the honey tubes.

00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:39.728
And now all we need is
the finishing touches.

00:01:39.728 --> 00:01:41.369
You need two screws at the back here,

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.702
just to hold these in place.

00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:53.070
That just stops them
rattling around too much.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.670
We will have other frames in here across.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.481
And on the underneath, inside,

00:01:56.481 --> 00:01:58.175
we need another couple of screws.

00:01:58.175 --> 00:02:00.704
So let's put them in as well.

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:04.329
Good, nice, round headed screw for this.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:05.829
Helps it slide in.

00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:18.915
This just helps locate
that frame so they don't

00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:22.665
drift across, and stops
the bees getting out.

00:02:27.837 --> 00:02:29.748
So next we need to make two little blocks

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:32.276
to stop the bees getting
out this little gap here,

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:35.079
when you open that door
to access the frames.

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.246
So, one block needs to be glued there,

00:02:39.168 --> 00:02:43.056
another little block
there, it can be anything.

00:02:43.056 --> 00:02:47.711
So you can use wooden wax
frames for the other frames,

00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:51.294
or plastic ones, whatever
you normally use.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.552
And two on the other side as well.

00:03:01.963 --> 00:03:04.865
So we now have the three
flow frame light kit,

00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:07.616
in a normal eight frame Langstroth box

00:03:07.616 --> 00:03:10.533
with two standard frames either side

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:12.547
of the three flow frames.

00:03:12.547 --> 00:03:14.550
So I've made up another piece of wood here

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.300
for a cover.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.666
This fits inside like so.

00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:20.134
We just need to put a handle on that,

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:22.199
and some little closures.

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.077
Now, the bottom here, depending
on what size your box is,

00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:28.008
you'll end up with a gap.

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:30.446
And, we need need to cover that gap

00:03:30.446 --> 00:03:32.935
so the bees can't get out.

00:03:32.935 --> 00:03:35.802
So this is a piece of corflit.

00:03:35.802 --> 00:03:39.969
And I've cut that and that
can just slip right in here.

00:03:40.937 --> 00:03:43.543
Stop bees getting out there.

00:03:43.543 --> 00:03:45.666
You can also make a hive beetle trap,

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:48.286
which I'll show you on the next video.

00:03:48.286 --> 00:03:50.433
So, because of this piece
we've put down here,

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:51.958
The door is slightly too long.

00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.043
So we're going to have to take off

00:03:54.043 --> 00:03:56.460
a couple of millimeters here.

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:07.332
A simple screw in the
door can be a handle.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.310
You can leave it so you can grab it.

00:04:21.032 --> 00:04:22.583
So I've made some simple
little swing hooks,

00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:25.801
just by bending over an eye-hook.

00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:27.817
But you could use a
nail, or a piece of wood,

00:04:27.817 --> 00:04:30.035
or anything that can just swing across

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:32.368
and hold the doors in place.

00:04:50.298 --> 00:04:51.834
Before you put this on your hive,

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:54.059
make sure the bees
aren't going to get out.

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:55.031
Because the last thing you want

00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:57.957
is to open these covers and
bees flying at your face.

00:04:57.957 --> 00:05:00.753
So make sure, up here
the bees can't get out.

00:05:00.753 --> 00:05:02.948
And make sure they
can't get out down here.

00:05:02.948 --> 00:05:05.331
So I've designed the
flow frames to retrofit

00:05:05.331 --> 00:05:09.498
into a standard box, so
you can enjoy honey on tap.
