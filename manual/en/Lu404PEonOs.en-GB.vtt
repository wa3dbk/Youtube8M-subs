00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.500
When I go to uni, I'm going to be studying
performing arts drama

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.480
which I'm looking forward to.
It's a three year course and I can't wait

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.880
for the journey.
I love drama because I'm allowed to become

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.760
someone else
and feel the reaction of the audience.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.320
I like the fact that when I get on stage and
the audience is interacting with me,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.280
we're feeding off each other's energy
and I know that it's a good play once there's

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.690
smiles,
I see them engage, their faces are horrified

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.609
and there's something bad happening
and when the baddies come in and they go "boo",

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:47.820
I just think that's amazing.
When I was thirteen, I went to Harris Academy,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.659
Bermondsey
and I had a drama teacher called Miss Jean-Baptiste

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.600
and she was the best drama teacher I ever
had.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.030
She kind of pushed you and made you do crazy
things

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.839
and for me, at the time, it was like a lesson
for me to be crazy,

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.110
let everything out.
Thens she was like: "I think you should do

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.270
your Drama GCSE early
because you're really good but I thought "Ah,

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.640
it's nothing".
But then my sister told me that I think you

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.530
should drama.
It wasn't until I was 16 that I thought, maybe

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.310
I should do drama
'cause I did miss it, not doing it, but doing

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.570
it outside.
I chose to go uni instead of drama school

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.450
'cause
I want to have the ultimate uni experience

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.350
to see different people.
I want to hear about different lectures they're

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.680
going to, different subjects.
I didn't want to go to a place where everyone's

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.810
the same.
I wanted to go to a place where I feel more

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.260
free.
Instead of going to a drama school where everyone's

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.840
doing the same thing
and everyone's competitive.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.730
In order to get into the character, you've
got to get into the year they're living in,

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.570
what period they're from, what kind of emotions
they feel at that specific time.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:07.140
I rehearse with other people, especially students
who do drama.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.640
In five years time I would love to open my
own theatre company.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.930
I would love to also be doing drama but I
would love to open my own company

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.569
and work with others as a family.
Because that's what I've learn doing drama

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.680
- we become a family.
You argue but you love it 'cause they're pushing

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.850
into doing,
bring out different emotions, the rehearsal

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.390
is fun, even though it's tiring
but technical rehearsal is the most amazing

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.040
thing for you to do.
I like to see the expressions on others

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.260
and how they feel when they're doing it as
well.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.810
I would like to have the audience come see
stuff that I've done with others.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:03:11.360
You know, I'm responsible for this and 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.450
I like that. So yeah...
