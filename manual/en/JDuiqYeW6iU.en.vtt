Stuffed burgers, stuffed crust pizza, stuffed
cookies. Anything with a surprise center automatically

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.120
makes it that much more special. Today I’m
going to take the classic chocolate chip cookies

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.810
and stuff it with the crowd favorite, nutella.
You’ll have this soft and chewy cookie with

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.470
this warm and gooey center. It’s heaven.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.630
it’s made.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.529
First I’ll preheat my oven to 350 degrees
and then i’ll start with my cookie dough.

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.590
I’m taking 1 stick of melted butter and
mixing it with ¾ cup brown sugar and ¼ cup

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.640
granulated sugar. I’m mixing it by hand
so once it’s all mixed, i’m adding one

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.820
whole egg and then stirring again until it’s
combined. now i’ll add in ½ tsp each of

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.010
vanilla extract, salt, and baking soda. I’ll
mix everything again and then I’m adding

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.670
in 1 ½ cups of all-purpose flour and 2 cups
of chocolate chips. I’ll stir again until

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.810
the dough comes together.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.619
Now here comes the fun part. I’m taking
a scoop of cookie dough and putting it in

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.319
my hand then flattening it out like a small
disk. Then I’m taking a spoonful of chilled

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:22.429
nutella and putting it in the center. If you
want to learn how to make your own homemade

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:27.819
nutella i have a video for that. I’ll wrap
the cookie dough around it and pinch the seams

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:35.010
like a dumpling. I’m rolling it into a ball
and placing it on a baking sheet.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.409
I’ll bake them for 10 minutes until they're
nice and golden brown. The house smells sooooo

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.049
good right now - the sweet smell of freshly
baked chocolate chip cookies is seriously

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.719
the best ever. This recipe will make about
18 large cookies.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:56.409
I’ll let them cool for 5 minutes and they’re
ready to serve. I’m breaking these babies

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:04.399
open to see they gooey hazelnut spread inside.
