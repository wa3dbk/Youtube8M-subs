Hey guys.
I'm going to show you how to put your GoPro

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.599
on a strap around your neck.
It's kind of a neat thing.

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:11.220
It's going to be a super quick build because
there's not much to it and then I'll show

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.060
you some sample footage.
First of all you've got your Gopro in the

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.660
frame mount.
You could use the waterproof case but the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.640
frame is much smaller so I would recommend
that.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.320
Then you need a strap and then you need a
thumb screw that comes with the gopro, and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.760
this is a wingnut that is a 10-32 thread.
So it's super easy.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.760
Just put the ring between the two pieces on
the frame and stick the thumbscrew through,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.789
and thread on the wing nut.
You could use a regular nut if you want but

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.839
the wingnut lets you hold it without any tools.
A regular not would be less noticeable but

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.530
it works well this way.
And that's it.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.789
Now it's attached.
You can use any lanyard that you want really.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.350
This is one that comes with the GoPro remote
accessory kit.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.220
You could use any strap that you might have,
you know sports straps.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.470
You could actually use a shoelace or paracord
if you wanted to do that.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.320
This is just something that looks a little
bit better.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.920
After you've got it on the strap, just set
your gopro to upside down mode and then you

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.600
can film with it around your neck.
It makes a pretty steady platform.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.750
I would recommend using two hands on the camera
and press down just slightly so it stretches

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.890
the strap tight around your neck and adds
more stability.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.590
It's not as steady as a steadicam or anything
like that but it is helpful.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.320
It's also easy to take pictures this way and
just real fast and really easy access.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.090
I would recommend that you use a lens cap
or a clear lens cap with this because the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.720
lens is out there and exposed and easy to
hit things on.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.510
Anyway, that's about it.
Just a quick build.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.060
