Hi, my name is Chris hart and today I'd like to show you how to draw an eye.

00:00:05.862 --> 00:00:07.394
The male eye.

00:00:07.702 --> 00:00:12.985
Start with ... we'll draw it on the inside, where the bridge of the nose is.

00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:15.117
So that will be the bridge of the nose.

00:00:15.117 --> 00:00:24.667
We are going to pull a line here, where the eyes go.

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:31.236
Come down like this. The tear duct is a shorter line. Trail off at the end of the eye with a longer line.

00:00:31.236 --> 00:00:37.681
There is a little bit more room under here, on the outside; and a little less inside, because it goes up to the tear duct.

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:43.274
The bridge of the nose is right in the middle, where the eyes are.

00:00:43.274 --> 00:00:51.419
The iris takes up about a third of the eye.

00:00:51.419 --> 00:01:03.280
One third over to this side is where the eyebrow generally makes its arch toward the end.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.364
You know, the eyebrow comes over a little further, past the eye, here.

00:01:08.364 --> 00:01:12.531
Here is the eyelid. Do you see this little flap over the eye? This is where the eyelid peaks.

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:21.719
We are going to do a little shading over at this end. And also, let's not forget to draw the bottom line here.

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:30.560
Now we're going to draw a shine. The pupil is round and inside of the iris, and we'll draw a little shine here. A light shine on the pupil.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.731
Darken this part. 

00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:39.608
Now we will darken around the shine, pretty darkly.

00:01:39.608 --> 00:01:43.195
I'll show you a little trick that will really help you, and I think you'll really enjoy it.

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:50.024
Darken the eyelids a little bit more. Okay. It's starting to look like something now.

00:01:50.024 --> 00:02:04.033
We will also add a little bit of texture inside. Add a couple of lines over here.. and a bit lighter for the iris, and I'll lightly color that in.

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:08.926
I say "color," but yes, of course it is black and white. The tone I think of as a color. 

00:02:08.926 --> 00:02:11.779
Now I'll take an eraser and lighten it just a touch.

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:17.348
it has a good look to it.

00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:32.589
And now, on the top part, we are going to connect the shadow to the pupil. The reason is that this eyelid catches the shadow from the overhead light.

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:36.155
If you have overhead lighting it will cast a shadow below. And that's important.

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:42.608
That gives it depth. Add a little bit of shading, light shading, very light, on the eyeball itself.

00:02:42.608 --> 00:02:48.533
Now we are going to sort of radiate it down, so it doesn't just suddenly get light

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:50.082
So it's blended in.

00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:55.696
Now we're going to thicken the lower eyelid, here.

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:58.949
Add some more darkness.

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:05.788
And a little bit more shading, here. There's a sort of "pocket" under the eye.

00:03:05.788 --> 00:03:14.614
So there you have a quick tutorial on drawing the male eye, with an overhead light, ceiling light, or the sun.

00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:17.528
I hope that was helpful.

00:03:17.528 --> 00:03:27.192
This is the book I did, which shows you all the principles for drawing people - without having to study anatomy.

00:03:27.192 --> 00:03:33.215
Basic constructions for the figure .. also shows you basic principles that makes sense to you on the got level...

00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:36.118
…Lots of steps…

00:03:36.118 --> 00:03:39.261
…Attractive drawings…

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:47.393
…Things you want to draw, and that you can draw, if you follow the easy principles, step-by-steps, and hints throughout the book.

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:52.065
…Lots of illustrations, like watching one of my videos in slow motion!

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:56.621
Anyway, I thought you might really enjoy it if you liked the videos.

00:03:56.621 --> 00:04:00.867
"Figure It Out! The Beginners Guide to Drawing People."

00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:03.000
Please check it out. See if it appeals to you. Thanks very much! Bye
