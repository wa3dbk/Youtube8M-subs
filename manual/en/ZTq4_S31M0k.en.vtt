00:00:07.628 --> 00:00:09.284
There was a time when I had it all.

00:00:09.818 --> 00:00:12.083
People would ask me
what was it like being untouchable?

00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:18.869
The question
they really should have asked was...

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:21.038
What happens when it's all over?

00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:29.731
You set a good example
by snitching on your friends in the mob.

00:00:29.856 --> 00:00:31.298
We're not in Brooklyn anymore.

00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:34.510
I don't think there's anywhere further
from Brooklyn than this rat hole.

00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:36.720
I'm sick of being
in witness protection.

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:38.931
Welcome to France.
Try to fit in.

00:00:39.097 --> 00:00:42.726
I'm getting tired of finding you
a new place to live every 90 days.

00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:45.771
- So, do we still have the same name?
- No, we are the Blake family.

00:00:45.937 --> 00:00:47.022
Anything to report?

00:00:48.106 --> 00:00:49.107
Kids, school?

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:52.986
Well, you know, they always adjust
better than we do.

00:00:54.173 --> 00:00:55.197
You're a maniac.

00:00:56.072 --> 00:00:56.782
Thank you.

00:00:57.865 --> 00:00:59.952
Let's talk about the complaints
I have received.

00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:00.994
Complaints?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.247
Corruption, theft, bribery...

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:06.583
I want to see my lawyer.

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:08.669
Du beurre de cacahuÃ¨te.

00:01:09.544 --> 00:01:11.755
- Peanut butter.
- On the right, after the dog food.

00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:12.673
Merci.

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:13.841
Stupid Americans.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.636
How was your day?

00:01:20.323 --> 00:01:21.000
Fine.

00:01:23.144 --> 00:01:25.731
You know what's gonna happen to you
and your family when they find you?

00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:28.230
You're here to make sure
that don't happen right?

00:01:29.307 --> 00:01:31.358
Try not to make my job impossible.

00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:33.527
They are somewhere, find them.

00:01:34.804 --> 00:01:37.030
It's a clean up operation.
Get that family out of there.

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:40.450
I confess it's been years
since I went to confession.

00:01:41.617 --> 00:01:43.662
Your family
is the incarnation of evil.

00:01:44.418 --> 00:01:45.956
What is all this grief about?

00:01:46.998 --> 00:01:49.334
- May I use your phone?
- You don't lend your phone...

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:52.170
I got to find my kids.

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:56.216
- You're insane.
- I know.

00:02:07.992 --> 00:02:09.187
How was the first day?

00:02:09.353 --> 00:02:10.901
Nothing special.

00:02:15.864 --> 00:02:18.113
- Why did you kill the plumber?
- I didn't kill him.

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:21.407
- I took him to the hospital.
- Who's gonna fix the pipes now?

00:02:21.532 --> 00:02:24.369
Who's gonna rebuild the supermarket
that burned down the day we got here?
