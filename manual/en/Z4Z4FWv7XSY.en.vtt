00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.830
So I’m going to be showing you how to do
some scalp massage techniques on the deeper

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.830
side.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.850
I like to do one nice stroke up the neck before
I get to the base of that skull.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.230
I’m going to let her scalp rest in my hands
here for a minute.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.869
My fingers are pressed against the occiput,
which is that ridge at the base of the skull.

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.980
And you can actually just rotate the skull
right there in your fingertips so my hand

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.030
is like this.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.880
And then you’re going to want to do nice
strong circles all along the scalp.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.809
You’ll notice I’m not only using my fingers
in the front, but I’m using my thumb in

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.160
the back to massage her at the same time.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.429
This gives you a little bit more pressure
and leverage so that you’re not using all

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:57.650
of your weight with your hands.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.230
I always use a lot of weight from my body
to do this.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.500
Most people think that they just have to use
their hands, but it’s not true.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.680
So you’re going to do that to both sides
of the scalp.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.800
At the same time, work on the scalp.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.170
You’re going to be massaging the top of
the head.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.610
A lot of people have a tendency to skip the
crown.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.110
So you’re going to want to go all the way
back.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.710
Make sure you cover the whole area of the
scalp.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.960
And then when you’re massaging the temple
area, a lot of people think that they massage

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.340
down here lower.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.170
Actually, if you move up just a little bit,
and look for that ridge, you go nice and slow

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.170
over that.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.240
You don’t want to bounce over it.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.470
Just give it nice strong deep pressure.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.470
It feels amazing.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.110
How does that feel, Gina?

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.210
Amazing.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.310
Yeah.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.180
You always want to go a little bit slower.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.700
It just feels much better than if you’re
going too fast.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.200
Now depending on the person that you’re
working with, people actually really like

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.730
hair pulling so I find that a lot of men—you
want to check in with your partner first—like

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.800
to have their hair really strongly pulled.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.880
Some women do, as well.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.140
But a lot of women really just like to have
their hair played with really gently, and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.160
you want to sort of pseudo brush it out.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.000
But of course, if you hit a tangle, don’t
try to pull it out.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.030
Just ignore it, go around it, and this can
be really amazing.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.250
And there are so many nerve endings in the
scalp that this is a great relaxation technique,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.590
and it’s a great way to end the massage.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.530
And so you can complete the whole massage
with a nice pull of all that hair, making

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.140
sure you don’t pull any individual ones.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.620
And that is a scalp massage.
