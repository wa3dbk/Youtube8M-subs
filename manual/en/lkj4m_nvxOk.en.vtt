Tricks of the technology curve drive

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.359
This thought we were out

and me whether can be bent
For that you say

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.119
I think to try to do
This is actually so much

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.560
Is not difficult
The curve drive

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.579
Big big curve to bend
On the left side

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.690
And the like bends and Kuo~tsu is
And me if you can I get

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.820
will be referred to you and your first
Ordinary Fore drive

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.050
There will Fore drive
This is the usual fore drive

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.430
Respect to the upper rotation
The image of the fore drive

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.079
Please have
In in this drive

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.090
In these times
The racket face of this fore side

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.829
Towards more of my stomach
Please

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.539
It is this kind of feeling
To stomach the fore side of the rubber

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.680
Please Towards
As it is in this way

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.590
This remains in the foreground drive
Please hit

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.080
I bend big anymore this
This is the completion of the curve drive

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.120
I say again
Fore drive usual

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.780
Of fore drive thrashing everyone
The racket of surface remains

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.960
Whichever of the fore side
Towards more of my stomach

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.910
Bring
So the fore drive

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.170
Hit
I will bend big anymore this

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.590
Surface of normal fore drive
In curve drive

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.830
What is undulating curve drive
The Fu says

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.420
Surface of the racket is gradually
Enough to roll if this lost to the inside

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.350
And the Tteyuu bend large
It is a feature of the curve drive

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.850
So
The undulating curve drive

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.060
Completely towards their stomach
In raised towards the fore side

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.440
As it is fore drive
Always Fore drive

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.490
When you do to Fu Tteyuu
I bent big

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.740
When can curve drive
I think you

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.890
Also I This is the only
Especially after the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.700
Such as difficult how to catch the
Is do not have to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.390
In feeling hitting point a little
is better to drop was

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.170
I think it more pliable
By dropping the RBI since

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.880
to better attract and their
Towards the surface of the fore side

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.430
To drive
When do I feel it 's in

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.970
Big bend curve drive
It works

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.230
Well anywhere of that ball
Capture Toka rubbing how to

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.980
Toka do not not have to do this
When you think that way

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.070
The extra things a little difficult
Since the ringing would

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.250
Tentatively
And if towards here

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.140
Over here firmly this
Since the turn rotation is born

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.180
Without creating a particularly deep thought
Difficult complex perceptions

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.860
Without conscious
And if it is possible to one consciousness

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.560
The undulating curve drive
You will be able to
