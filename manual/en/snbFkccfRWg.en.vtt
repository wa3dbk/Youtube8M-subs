This video shows how I made this pair of wire and bead wrapped earrings.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The glass beads are threaded onto a piece of wire and then wrapped around the earring hoop.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
To make these you'l need: 22 gauge wire,  silver glass seed beads, colored glass beads, a few shell chip beads...

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and 2 metal bangles.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Start by cutting the bangle to open the circle.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Begin to straighten both ends with your flat nosed pliers.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If you gently squeeze the hoop so that the ends touch - you will have a teardrop shape hoop.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Use your pointy nosed pliers to make a small ring on each end of the hoops.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Squeeze the hoop ends together  one on top of the other to form one small ring.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.900
Start to wrap wire around the base of the ring then thread a bead onto the wire.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.000
So,  you thread a bead then wrap the wire once around the hoop 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:37.000
thread another bead, wrap the wire once around the hoop, etc. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
until you have threaded on all the beads in the order you want them.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
These earrings are a perfect match for

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the wavy wire choker that I made in the previous video.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
One of the earrings could be used as a pendant, if you hang it on the necklace -  choker style, like this! 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.800
