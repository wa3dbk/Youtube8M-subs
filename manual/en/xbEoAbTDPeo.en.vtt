00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.320
One of the problems when it comes to
photographic exposure

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.650
is that the camera sees

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.190
not as much has the human eye. The roughly 16 stop range of the human eye

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.940
the closet the camera can come is about
seven stops - as a result

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.980
when you look through the camera and

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.190
you see the vast exposure range before you as we are about to find out. The fact of the

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.170
matter is the camera cannot record

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.530
that vast exposure range so what's the
solution? You must decide

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.940
if it's highlights or the shadows that you want to expose for.  Adorama TV presents

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.150
you keep shooting with Bryan Petersen

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.590
Hi I'm Bryan Peterson and I am here in
Chandni Chowk market

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.500
in New Delhi India and I have this
wonderful subject right here who's been

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.780
so gracious to give us two minutes of
his time.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.850
To illustrate my point,  you will clearly
see

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.370
behind him an area of darkness where he
is here in the bright

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.440
overcast light, the light progressively
fades to dark behind him - I want to

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.070
exploit that, yet with my own eyes I can
clearly see behind him and a lot of

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.380
machinery going on here

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.729
in this  generator parts little
building. Therefore

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.200
I'm gonna get confused really quick if I
think that's going to show up in the shot.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.860
The fact of the matter is I set my
exposure exclusively for him out here

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.390
and what I mean by that is simply this:
I'm going just zoom

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.820
and set my exposure in this case f/5.6 1/100th sec manual exposure in

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.490
this is with an ISO of 400,

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.910
so with that in mind since I am in manual
exposure.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.180
I'm simply going to frame him up like so

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.340
bring your chin down just a little bit, bring your head forward.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.729
I have to pose him here a little and help
him out, we don't speak the same language

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.420
either.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.130
Just relax your hand right there can
just put it up nice and soft

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.380
perfect. And let me have you bring your
other arm right

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.399
there. That good perfect, okay

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.470
and we're about ready to go, again my
exposure is just for the boy.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.310
Take a look at that, and again notice the
background pitch black

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.430
with his orange clothing that makes a
wonderful contrast

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.410
for that orange to really jump out at you. As a result we've got a really nice

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.190
frame filling portrait of this little young
boy, here in Chandni Chowk market.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.239
Something to keep in mind, the human eye sees

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.299
light and dark simultaneously,  the cameras does not.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.239
So exploit it - set your exposure, here in this
case for the bright

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.739
and subsequently that which is behind
him is going into progressively

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.099
darker light, is gonna go pitch black.
Good idea?

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.810
I think so.  Hey until next time this is
