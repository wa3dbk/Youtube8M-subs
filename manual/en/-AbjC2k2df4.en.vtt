 Hey guys this is Andrew with GY6vids

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.230
Got another cool test for you today
You dont get to see this very often this is

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.200
a tactical knife
Its not like what you think it is some of

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.490
you gamers out there are like
Oh my God, hes got a ballistics knife

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.960
Its not a ballistics knife, this thing is
called the WASP

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.719
Its a tactical knife and its got a air cartridge
inside of it

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:28.910
when you plunge it into something, you push
this nice little button right there 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.910
and it expands and explodes 
We are testing it on a watermelon, but I think

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.850
you can come up with some ideas on what its
meant for

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.600
And what would happen if you stuck it into
something and pushed this button 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.949
ah EWWW!
now picture the watermelon, and we are going

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.749
to stick this in
Im going to put on my eyes because I dont

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:54.629
even know what this is going to do
Lets see what happens when I stick this in

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.760
the watermelon and I hit this button
Lets insert it in first 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.760
Alright then youre going to hit the air
cartridge 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.680
Ok so
It definitely works!

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.000
This was a really hard compressed watermelon
and it just cracked open completely 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.360
The way this process works the air cartridge
goes into the handle 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.480
When you hit this button there is a whole
in the front of this knife and it blows air

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.990
out the top
Let me show you one outside the watermelon

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.540
just so you know how much power is coming
out of this 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.530
Whoa that cracked it pretty well!
So you have the CO2 Container drops right

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.600
into the handle 
Let me speed up the process for ya

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.810
Ok so nice and tight bam just like that
Now we are ready to rock and roll

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.810
So you can imagine if you were going to jam
this into somebody and hit this button

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.200
That would hurt!!! hahaha
And judging by that it definitely does the job

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.540
This is Andrew with GY6vids

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.260
