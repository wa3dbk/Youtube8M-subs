Hello everyone, Michael here with the Daily
Note II/3 YouTube Channel.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.180
So I finally got the Android 4.3 update on
the Galaxy Note 2.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.000
And to be honest, I wasn't expecting anything
after reading about 2 dozen articles before

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.379
I got the update.

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.000
But as it turns out, there's a lot of cool
stuff in there.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.800
I discovered so much in fact that I decided
to put together a series of videos.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:33.520
So this is part 1 of many.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.030
So this is my trusted old friend the Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 with Android 4.3.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.330
Now you may have read that it comes with KNOX
and Galaxy Gear compatibility.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.200
Well, I want to show you everything else you
may have not heard about first.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.250
So I want to show you 3 things today.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.670
One, you get the one handed operation feature.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.280
Second, you get customizable widgets for your
lockscreen.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.820
So this is the one that you get by default.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.100
But I've grown fond of this widget you can
download from Google Play called the Chronus

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.030
lock screen widget.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.810
It's beautiful, customizable, and you get
weather too.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.810
And one more thing today.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.360
I want to show you how to set the light effect
for your lockscreen.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.240
Because that ripple effect is so 2012.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.800
So let me show you how to set that one handed
mode.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:32.550
Go to settings -&gt; Controls -&gt; One handed operation
and check Use for all screens.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.000
And just back out of it, and there you go.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.210
Now to activate it, you have to start on the
edge of the screen.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.320
Swipe to the middle, and then swipe out.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.320
All in one motion.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.440
And now you have something like an iPhone
sized phone inside your galaxy note 2.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.050
Everything works just the same.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.350
You can also resize it, move it.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.380
You can do the same swipe motion to close
it, but now the edge of your screen is contained

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.030
in this white frame.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.940
So you can see it doesn't work here, but you
can do the motion within the white frame.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.230
Or you can just expand with this button.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.950
For you left handers, it works just as well.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.730
And it knows to stick to the left side when
enabled.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.879
Next, let's look at how to set a custom lockscreen
widget.

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.810
Let's first download the widget from Google
Play called Chronus -- Home &amp; Lock Widget.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.599
After you install it, go back to your lockscreen.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.169
Swipe to the right.

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:35.459
This the plus button.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.840
Select Chronus.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.290
Hit the checkmark.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.239
And let's make this the default widget that
you see when you turn on the device.

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.849
To move widgets on the lockscreen, they have
to be expanded first.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.670
It was already expanded but you can see when
it is closed, you cannot long tap on it.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.269
So in it's expanded state, long tap on it,
and drag to the side like you would any other

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.269
widget.

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.599
And there you go.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:08.510
You can delete the default widget, by long
tapping, and dragging it to the top.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.790
Lastly, I want to show you how to enable light
effect.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:22.510
Go settings -&gt; My device -&gt; Lock screen -&gt; Unlock
effect -&gt; Light effect.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.540
So that's it for today.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.379

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.420
Galaxy Note 2, so make sure you subscribe,
