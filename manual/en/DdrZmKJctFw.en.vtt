Hello, friends!
My name is Sergey Polyansky,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.500
today I’ll tell you about this
Schecter Damien Elite-7 FR guitar.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.000
The body of this 7-string guitar
is made of redwood

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.500
with top of flamed maple,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.000
the neck is made of maple, the fretboard
is of rosewood, 24 frets.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.500
The neck is mounted with 4 bolts.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This guitar has 2 active
humbuckers EMG81 and EMG85,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.500
a volume knob, a tone knob
and a 3-way switch.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.500
This guitar has a Floyd Rose Special
tremolo and Grover tuners.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
