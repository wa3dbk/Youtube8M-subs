00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
 

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.500
Hi.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.800
That's me David Cox.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.830
Wait, no,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.180
That's me, on the right, holding
the human brain.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.630
I'm an Assistant Professor of Molecular
and Cellular Biology and of

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.610
Computer Science, at
Harvard University.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.380
We are launching MCB80.1x, the first
section of a full course in

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.860
introductory neuroscience, as
an experiment in what online

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.970
education can be.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.890
There are three key things that will
be different about MCB80x: .

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.590
First, we try and take education out
into the world... to see things you

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.670
can't easily see in a lecture hall.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.190
We're going to go around Harvard and
Boston and beyond, to places where

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.870
science is happening.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:01:17.220
A second key part of our course, is a
new model of interaction that we call

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.900
"guided interactivity".

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.100
In MCB80x, we're working to bring this
interaction model to the internet.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.700
We'll invite you to interact with rich
simulations, seamlessly woven into the

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.260
flow of instruction.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.080
It's like a choose-your-own
adventure story.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.860
The third pillar of our course
is do-it-yourself science.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.870
One of the most important elements of
the internet today is participation.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.690
The internet enables mass creation and
discussion, on a global scale.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.730
Our partners at Backyard Brains have
designed inexpensive hardware that

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.810
allows you to perform easy neuroscience

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.960
experiments in your own home.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.330
You can follow along with our
experiments, but we'll also invite you

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.800
to film your efforts, including variants
on the experiments we perform

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.610
in class,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.760
and we'll post the results
for everyone to see.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.670
It's an experiment in large-scale
participatory science.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.120
We're trying out new stuff.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.470
And we don't know which parts
will work, and which won't.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.880
Sometimes things won't work.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.310
But with your help we'll figure out
what's broken, what's not quite right,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.880
and we'll iterate.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.470
For now, since this is all still just
an experiment, we've focused on

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.510
building just one small section, or
"module", from the full course.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.090
In this section --

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.820
MCB80.1x -- we'll explore the
fundamental electrical inner-workings

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.530
of the neuron, which form the basis
for neuronal signaling.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.960
We'll learn how the machinery of the
neuronal cell membrane gives rise to a

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.440
electrical potential,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.380
how this electrical potential is used
by cells to generate signals,

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.940
and how these signals travel across your
body, enabling you perceive the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.590
world and act upon it.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.680
In future sections, we'll explore how
groups of neurons work together to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.190
form networks How much larger networks
are organized to form the key

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.670
subsystems of the brain

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.160
... and in the final module, we'll
explore neuroscience in the context of

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.960
society, including questions about what
intelligence is, and what the

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.080
future holds.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.320
Explore the mcb80x website and the
content that is available to you.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.810
Join us, we hope it will be an exciting
educational experience.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:38.219
