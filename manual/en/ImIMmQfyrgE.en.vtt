00:00:01.293 --> 00:00:04.857
Hello everyone, my name is Nilsor and welcome to my vault

00:00:08.743 --> 00:00:10.464
Today on Fallout New Vegas 101

00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:12.064
we are going to Hoover Dam

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:23.951
The hydroelectric powerplant of Hoover Dam was built on the Colorado River between 1931 and 1936

00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:24.622
It was

00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:25.426
at the time

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:27.667
the biggest structure of this type in the world with

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:30.351
a height of 1232 feet (376m)

00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:33.447
a length of 1244 feet (379m)

00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:36.339
and a width of 660 feet (200m) at its base

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.896
45 feet at its top (14m)

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.541
It was able to produce up to 4.2 billions Killowatt hour per year which was enough

00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:45.469
before the Great War

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.779
to provide for about 2 million households

00:00:48.223 --> 00:00:52.037
Considering the state of electrical installation in 2281

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:55.694
the Dam should be more than enough to provide for the entire Republic

00:00:55.694 --> 00:00:57.240
During the Sino-American war

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.839
that took place between 2066 and 2077

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.941
 chinese spies tried to destroyed a secret lab inside the Dam but ultimately failed

00:01:06.388 --> 00:01:07.542
During the Great War

00:01:07.542 --> 00:01:11.499
the Dam managed to stay up eventhough it sustained heavy damage

00:01:12.397 --> 00:01:13.618
In 2274

00:01:13.618 --> 00:01:18.318
NCR scoots rediscovered the Dam which alerted Mr House in New Vegas

00:01:18.318 --> 00:01:21.257
He quickly send a dispatch of both his securitrons

00:01:21.257 --> 00:01:25.849
and representatives of the 3 families of New Vegas to greet the NCR soldiers

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:29.435
There they concluded the New Vegas Treaty which stipulated that

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:34.735
95% of its power output will be sent to the Republic and 5% to the Strip

00:01:34.735 --> 00:01:38.961
The NCR repaired the Dam and made its turbines worked once again

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:41.035
In 2277

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:43.295
Caesar’s Legion also discovered the Dam

00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:45.430
Troops Led by Malpais Legate

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.741
later known as Joshua Grahams

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:51.045
took over the installation during the First Battle of Hoover Dam

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:56.530
but were repelled after having been driven into a trap at Boulder City by NCR rangers

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.135
Since then

00:01:57.135 --> 00:02:01.249
Caesar’s Legion established itself on the other side of the Colorado River

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:04.360
and is gathering its troops for the Second Battle of Hoover Dam

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.267
This tense situation is at the heart of the power struggle in the Mojave

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:11.499
with both NCR and Caesar’s Legion at eachother throats

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:16.319
and Mr House securitrons getting ready to take advantage of the outcome

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.370
Inside the facility you will see some NCR troops in charge of defending it

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.069
and numerous civilian contractors in charge of keeping the power plant up and running

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.586
The top of the facility is composed of

00:02:27.586 --> 00:02:28.883
A visitor Center

00:02:29.707 --> 00:02:31.613
4 towers and 4 intake towers

00:02:31.613 --> 00:02:36.032
2 of each located in the NCR side and Legion side of the Dam

00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:40.320
There is also a checkpoint to mark the frontier between the 2 factions

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:46.067
You can acess the inside of the facility through escalators and stairs inside the towers

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:48.324
There the facility is composed of

00:02:48.324 --> 00:02:50.122
A large office space

00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:52.870
The 4 power plants

00:02:56.731 --> 00:03:00.193
And some hallways underneath to connect those power plants

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.720
Inside the Town you will come accross

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.286
Colonel Cassandra Moore

00:03:09.286 --> 00:03:12.477
the NCR officer commanding the troops at Hoover Dam

00:03:12.477 --> 00:03:14.468
In the army since she was 16

00:03:14.468 --> 00:03:18.735
Moore climbed the ladder of command and resentfully left her Rangers camarades

00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:20.154
after having been injured

00:03:20.652 --> 00:03:23.888
Prefering straightforward to diplomatic and cunning approach

00:03:23.888 --> 00:03:27.285
it is no wonder she’s a strong support towards President Kimball

00:03:27.285 --> 00:03:30.570
and his plan for securing NCR presence in the Mojave

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.250
You can find her on the Dam Office floor

00:03:33.927 --> 00:03:35.298
Quatermaster Bardon

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:38.691
he is the one in charge of managing the NCR supplies at the Dam

00:03:38.691 --> 00:03:41.088
Coming from a proud military family

00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:43.605
he has recently been assigned at the facility

00:03:43.605 --> 00:03:50.012
You will be able to trade with him with a speech check of 50 or if you’re reputation with NCR is good enough

00:03:50.012 --> 00:03:53.798
He is located on the lower level of the Dam Office floor

00:03:59.453 --> 00:04:02.239
You can find a snowglobe inside the Visitor center

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.462
that you can exchange for 2000 caps to Mr House

00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:11.576
You can find 2 chinese stealth armor that adds 5 to sneak on the office floor

00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:16.734
They were presumably worn by the spies that tried to blow up the Dam during the Sino-American war

00:04:34.925 --> 00:04:37.902
There is no quest that are directly given at Hoover Dam

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:42.410
However the main quest will lead you here and will require of you different things

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.143
depending on which faction you decide to side with

00:04:45.143 --> 00:04:51.195
All of these quests will be detailed in separate videos focusing on each path and all its related quests

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.612
On the next video we will stop at the REPCONN Headquarters

00:04:55.612 --> 00:04:58.574
And after that we will go to the Crimson Caravan Company

00:05:02.022 --> 00:05:03.917
Thank you for watching, and see you later
