00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.540
OKay, we're going to add a little bit more
to steps. This is when you're going to be

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.589
a little move creative on yourself. So, for
you went side to side, front, inside, across

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:13.480
and back. And, then when you do a little bit
of foot work, now we're going to go with turning.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:20.759
If you go side, side, forward, back, kick
and back. So, what I'm doing is I'm going

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:28.830
basic side, basic side, I'm using my right
forward, yes, I'm going to pivot turn, kick

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.740
with my left and go back to the center. So,
I've added a little bit more. Now, in the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.110
same thing try to add a little bit more of
your own flavor. Yeah, something of yourself,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.360
something that you can feel about it. Right?
So, you add it, a turn this time. Yes. Boom!

00:00:47.360 --> 00:01:00.670
And the last one, side, side, forward, yes,
you went across, across, to the back, to the

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:09.750
back, and then you go across, and using your
footwork, now. Pat poom poom and side, and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.750
side. Pan ah ah, poom, poom, poom, poom. The
last one I'm going to cross with my right

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.070
forward, yes, and from there I'm going to
go all the way around. And that's how we're

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.970
going end the combination. OKay? So, one more
time. So we're going to go, from the top.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:35.780
Side, and side, and forward, and back, across,
across, to the back, to the back, and footwork,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:44.870
and pat, to da doom pa pa, and side, and side,
forward, kick, across, boom, and that's where

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.330
you're going to end it, OKay? OKay, now we're
going to go, this is with the music, yeah,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:00.850
let's try it. From the top, ready? Side, side,
forward, back, across, across, bring it back,

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.130
bring it back, footwork one, two, three, five,
six, seven. And a one, two, three, and a five,

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:14.610
six, seven. And side, and side, around, pa,
kick and boom. Good job! And you just keep

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.779
doing, after you've finished you can repeat
the whole combination from the top. Ready?

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:29.620
And, one, two three, five, three, four, five,
six, seven. You see how the music changed

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:40.019
and we got to change the tempo. Slow, pa,
pa. Depends how the music, we going to switch

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.370
and change my exercise. OKay? If the music
goes fast, and then we're going to go a little

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:57.609
bit more fast. Pa, pa, boom. A little bit
of shimmy, and, good. One, pa, pa, the music's

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:10.999
