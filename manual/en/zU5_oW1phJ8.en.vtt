Hi! I’ve just been time traveling around
the past of the Marvel Universe, like you

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.120
do, and I’m back to tell you all about Marvels’
future past. But first, let me do something

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.500
really important.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.560
There’s a significant lack of indoor plumbing
throughout history.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Hi, I’m Lorraine Cink and you are watching
The Watcher. Last week I visited the future

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.189
and now this week I bring you tidings from
Marvel’s Secret Wars Histories! Verily,

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.809

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.809
Let’s travel back to a time nearly forgotten
by man… 1992. X-Men ‘92 that is. Fans

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.530
of Marvel in the 90’s will love the bubble
gum popping adventures of your favorite Marvel

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.899
mutants in all of their big haired glory.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.690
WWI aviation ace Karl Kaufmann collides with
prehistoric beasts in Where Monsters Dwell.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.379
Get ready for fighter planes, dinosaurs, and
for the history books to be rewritten. I always

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.300
thought WWI was about Archduke Ferdinand,
but nope, dinosaurs.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.390
Get ready to visit the most rootin’ tootin’
Marvel Universe yet, when heroes head West

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.730
in Gerry Duggan and Doc Shaner’s 1872. In
the town of Timely, heroes from Tony Stark,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.530
Bruce Banner and Steve Rogers to Kingpin get
the Western treatment. Ya’ll Assemble!

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.780
Welcome to Elizabethan England! In 1602: Witch
Hunter Angela, the character created by Neil

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.140
Gaiman and Todd McFarlane heads to a world
created by Neil Gaiman. The original story

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.660
of 1602 featured Marvel heroes that arose
earlier than their original timelines. Think

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.810
Marvel meets Renn Faire.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.390
No trip through history is complete without
Devil Dinosaur. the red skinned dinosaur is

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.290
set to play a big part in Planet Hulk. He’ll
be joined by an older Captain America riding

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.090
on his back as they travel a world populated
by Hulks. What do you call a group of Hulks?

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.130
A gaggle? A gamma? I’d call them whatever
they ask me to.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.670
That’s a lot of stories, and we’ve barely
scratched the surface. Check out the Battleworld

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.310

changed.
