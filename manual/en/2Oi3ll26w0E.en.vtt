Hi! In this video I'm gonna show you how to preform a pinch harmonic.

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:19.970
most known as a very "screamy" or "squeezie"
sound for the guitar

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.589
It's often used with music like rock, heavy-metal and metal.

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.439
the sound can be created with every fretting string-instrument, plugged into an amplifier.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.760
the first guitarists that every used this kind of technique, was Eddie Van Halen, and Steve Vai.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.000
so what you'll need is a Guitar pick.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.110
you can preform a pinch harmonic without
a guitar pick,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.250
but that again it's a lot harder without it - so if you don't have one, go to your "guitar store" and buy some -

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.400
it's very cheap and very useful

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.540
okay..

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.670
first I'm gonna show you how to easily put some pinch harmonics in a riff

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.670
the guitar are tuned in D

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.200
it's possible to get different sounds, by changing the spot where you hit the string

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.110
this is because the pinch harmonic are created with a right-hand motion - that I will show you later.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.020
notice that I don't move my left hand to another
fret.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.940
i strongly recommend for all the beginners to set the humbucker and pickup-switch

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.340
and also the toneport to the highest
like this

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.600
to only activate this pickup. I just find it like, really easier

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.150
by doing this.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.420
well now comes the "hard part"

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.420
this is how you preform a pinch harmonic.

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:06.040
as you can see, I only touch the string with my thumb.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.750
this is the actual princip, when making a
pitch harmonic.
