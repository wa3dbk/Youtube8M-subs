(Music playing)

00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:31.068
It started out in around about 2007 and

00:00:31.068 --> 00:00:32.902
in the very first workshops.

00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:36.781
The idea was can they put a horse on stage that's not a real horse.

00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:39.827
And will the audience suspend their disbelief enough in whatever

00:00:39.827 --> 00:00:47.319
they're presenting in order to tell in any way shape or form this incredible book that Michael Morpurgo wrote.

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:56.593
We had a few weeks with Marvin Miller who was the puppetry director, just the horse teams, just to get to know each other.

00:00:56.593 --> 00:01:06.483
Doing lots of pretty basic exercises like breathing together, trying to get in sync with our breath and our bodies

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:11.444
before we got into the horses at all. And then after that, I think there was about a

00:01:11.444 --> 00:01:17.649
two and a half month rehearsal period with the entire cast.

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.829
So it's pretty long, pretty luxurious for a show.

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:29.209
We're always learning, we're always trying to be better and

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:34.548
inhabit these beings. Each performance is different.

00:01:34.548 --> 00:01:36.650
Each production is different.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.764
That's what so exciting about it being a live performance.

00:01:41.764 --> 00:01:50.857
(Music playing)

00:01:50.857 --> 00:01:58.984
It's a real honor to feel like radiating from the audience, the appreciation and the investment in a show like War Horse.

00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:01.951
Where we're really using the bare essentials to tell the story.

00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:08.374
It was really reinforced over and over and over again to never anthropomorphize the horse.

00:02:08.374 --> 00:02:15.006
Don't respond in an emotionally human way. Don't respond to verbal cues.

00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:20.427
Really keep within the life and emotional world of this animal.

00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:30.812
And that's really unique and really requires a lot of sensitivity.

00:02:30.812 --> 00:02:36.567
We're connected and you can see both of us.

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:38.484
I can see you but I can't see you.

00:02:38.484 --> 00:02:42.408
And then you can see me and sometimes, occasionally him.

00:02:42.408 --> 00:02:45.744
And you two are strapped into a piece of machinery. There's no kind of escaping.

00:02:45.744 --> 00:02:52.232
I think there's something about seeing a show where the main character is a horse

00:02:52.232 --> 00:02:57.006
and it's being played by these three people.

00:02:57.006 --> 00:03:04.067
You as an audience member, somehow, begin to empathize with this animal in a way that

00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:06.348
I think will really astound you.

00:03:06.348 --> 00:03:11.019
(Music playing)

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:25.118
(Horse noises)

00:03:25.118 --> 00:03:28.245
War Horse will be in Austin for one week only.

00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:31.622
