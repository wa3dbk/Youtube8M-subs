John Kohler: Alright, this is John Kohler
with Okraw.com.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.630
Today we have another exciting episode for
you.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.090
We're all the way here in Santa Rosa, California
about 1 hour north of San Francisco.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.850
And we're at the True North Health Center.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.890
We're here for one very important reason.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.640
We're here to talk to Dr. Alan Goldhamer who
has been water fasting, and helping patients

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.219
adapt ... help promoting whole plant food
based diet for the last 30 years.

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.370
And we're going to talk to him specifically
about refined food including refined sugar,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.540
oil, and salt, and other highly processed
foods and why they may not be so good for

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.540
you.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.510
So anyways, next let's go in, talk to Dr.
Alan Goldhamer about some of these refined

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.510
foods.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.300
So now I'm here with Dr. Alan Goldhamer and
today we're going to talk to you guys about

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.560
refined foods, whether that's refined flower,
into big goods, or refined corn meal.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.520
Dr. Goldhamer, what's the biggest problem
with refined food?

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.670
Dr. Alan Goldhamer: Well, you know, the title
of our book is the Pleasured Trap, Mastering

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.050
the Hidden Force towards Health and Happiness.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.369
And the reason we said that was because we
believe that the pleasure trap is the hidden

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.079
force towards health and happiness.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:24.830
The fact is, the artificial stimulation of
Dopamine in our brain, that's that pleasure-based

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.520
hormone is a really deceptive trap.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.509
Because we're designed to seek pleasure and
we're designed for an environment where these

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.369
highly processed foods don't exist.

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.200
So the world of ancient ancestors there was
no temptation to be eating sugar or, you know,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.009
highly processed foods.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.869
We had whole natural foods to choose from
and that's how we're designed.

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.369
The problem is, post-industrial revolution,
we've come up with all kinds of ways processing

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.780
food.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.619
Our brains though are still designed for the
world of ancient ancestors and as a consequence

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.099
when we get exposed to these very concentrated
foods, our brain stimulates more Dopamine

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:06.099
secretion.

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:10.380
We're designed for an environment of scarcity
where the biological incurve was to get enough

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.849
to eat and avoid being eaten.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.640
And so our brain rewards us anytime we found
calorically dense foods.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.409
So the higher the caloric density, the more
Dopamine secreted, the more pleasure we experience.

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.530
Well, in the world of ancient ancestors that
mechanism worked well.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.860
It doesn't work as well today, because in
the today with oil, salts and sugars and highly

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.030
processed foods, the problem is we eat those
chemicals.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.970
We liked the way it makes us feel and we tend
to eat more.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.880
The negative effect is we developed the disease
of dietary excess.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.320
So we become fat, we develop high blood pressure,
cardiovascular disease, we develop diabetes,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.760
we develop diseases, conditions that used
to be very rare but now are becoming ubiquitous.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.640
Dr. McDougall talks about these diseases as
the diseases of kings, because it's only the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.239
wealthy and elite that ever got to have those
diseases.

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.170
And now, you know, they're very, very common.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.879
And so the focus is to recognize the pleasure
trap, specifically we're talking now what

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.319
the dietary pleasure trap.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.510
Recognizing the insidious natures of these
chemical in the food and then designing the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.239
diet to eliminate those chemicals.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.959
That's what we talk about a whole foods plant-based
diet that's SOS free.

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.049
SOS stands for the international symbol of
danger; it also stands for sugars, oil, and

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.049
salts.

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.830
So the diets that we put together in our cook
books, in our program don't rely on any highly

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.891
processed chemicals added to the food.

00:03:33.891 --> 00:03:39.040
We don't use sugars in any of its form, whether
it's a gaggy or fruit dozer, any of these

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.310
concentrated sweeteners.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.430
We don't use any concentrated salts, and we
don't use any oils, including coconut oil

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.430
or any other oils.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.629
Now we do get of course our essential fatty
acids from whole foods, and we get sugar from

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.780
whole foods, and we get the sodium and other
minerals we need from whole foods.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.819
But it turns out to make a profound difference.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.450
If your diet is coming from a whole natural
foods, there's the tiny mechanisms in your

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.939
brain, your ability to process is very different
than if you're eating a bunch of highly processed

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:08.939
chemicals.

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.909
The problem is not everybody wants to give
up their addictions.

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.810
They don't want to quit smoking, they don't
want to quit using drugs, and they don't want

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.329
to give us their sugars, oils, and salts.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.630
John Kohler: Wow, so Dr. Goldhamer, would
you say that some of these like could be a

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.690
sugar added, if they're adding sugar to every
meal because they're literally getting a Dopamine

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.140
response and they need to have at least that
much or more because, you know, they're artificially

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.140
stimulated that form.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.310
Dr. Alan Goldhamer: You know when we're dealing
with addicts at the treatment centers.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.370
Whether they're addicted to caffeine, or they're
addicted to alcohol or other drugs, one of

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.980
the whole marks of drug addiction is that
people are using a substance not just to feel

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.170
good, but they have to continue using the
substance to avoid feeling bad.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.250
And you really know when you stop using caffeine,
there isn't any question, you're an addict

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.950
and you can feel ... and the same thing is
true for many people with sugars, with oils.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.310
It's very difficult for them to give these
substances up.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.800
That's where something fast can be helpful
because you can more rapidly allow people

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.260
to free themselves from those addictions.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.470
So it may not be as powerful a drug like effect,
that's cocaine or methamphetamines.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.720
But they're working on the same neuro cascade.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.700
They're the same kind of neurological mechanisms
at play with these highly processed chemicals.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.820
And so yeah, I would treat them and we do
find that managing patients that want to get

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.750
free of these chemicals is very much like
treating addicts in any kind.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.106
John Kohler: So the question I have for you
next is what would you say to somebody that

00:05:33.106 --> 00:05:36.110
likes to eat an SOS free diet and eat, you
know, good fruit and vegetable based diet

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.050
and other whole plant-based foods, but just
can't do it because it doesn't taste good

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.590
unless they add sugar to it?

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.590
I mean, what's the answer for that?

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.590
Dr. Alan Goldhamer: First thing is they have
to get educated enough to know that, yes,

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.460
at first it may, the taste that's swell to
them.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.950
But their taste, their neuro adaptive mechanism
will in time take place and we know even how

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.610
long that takes depending on which substance
we're talking about.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.990
We know that salt can take up to 30 days.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.680
We know with fats, it can take 3 months.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.230
If people are not patient enough and they
don't have the discipline to wait for the

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:09.080
body to adapt, one option would be to undergo
creative medical supervised water only fasting,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.860
because then the process happens much more
quickly.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.540
So if youâ€™re patient and persistent, people
do adapt to health promoting diet.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.630
If you need a little help, then you know,
it's very much like treating alcoholics, if

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.900
you tell an alcoholic, "Oh, it's the alcohol.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.640
Stop drinking."

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.640
Sometimes they can't.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.560
But other times people need a little help
to make that transition.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.660
But ultimately it comes down to the same thing.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.720
Health results from healthful living.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.400
We've got to get people living healthfully.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.290
And adding chemicals to the food like sugar,
and oils, and salts is not what I would define

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.620
as healthful living.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.620
John Kohler: I mean, I definitely agree with
that.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.480
I think one of the cool things about the True
North Health Center besides water fasting

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.050
you which I've actually sent both of my parents
here to help them from some medical conditions.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.330
And when they left here, they are definitely
more healthy than when they came.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.080
But more importantly they got the education
while they're here so that they could sustain

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.400
and live on a plant-based whole food SOS free
diet, and I want to encourage you guys to

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.810
come out and check them out.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.430
So Dr. Goldhamer, how can someone learn more
about the True North Health Center?

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.880
Dr. Alan Goldhamer: Well, they could go to
our website at truenorthhealth.com.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.140
If they're interested, they could fill out
the registration forms and call for a free

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.400
phone consult, where we can talk to them about
whether or not this type of approach might

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.370
be relevant to them.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.280
They can call us at 707-586-5555 and if they're
ambitious, they can read our book the Pleasure

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.280
Trap.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.400
John Kohler: Yeah, I definitely want to encourage
you guys to buy the Pleasure Trap.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.780
It's available on Amazon, also available at
healthpromoting.com, they're website and definitely

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.380
a good read because I think one of the big
challenges in this day in age is actually

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.380
the Pleasure Trap.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.500
I mean, all you guys out there probably watching
this are probably addicted in some form or

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.440
another to the Pleasure Trap and it's best
to just kick the habit.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.860
So hopefully you guys enjoyed this episode.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.220
Once again my name is John Kohler with Okraw.com.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:04.890
We'll see you next time and remember keep
eating your fresh fruits and vegetables.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:05.210
They're always the best.
