Hey fashionistas. One of the things I love most about Downton Abbey is the fashion.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.654
The Granthams had money to burn, and they weren't afraid to spend it on a beautiful beaded dress

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.760
and a big floppy hat to match.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.474
Well here at the Make Your Mark headquarters, we don't have that kind of cash.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.500
So we're taking a pair of basic black pumps and giving it a Downton Abbey makeover.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.940
Spectator pumps appeared in the early 1900s,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.840
but didn't reach their height of popularity until the 1920s.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.834
Just in time for Lady Mary to start wearing them.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.480
Are you ready? Here's what you'll need.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.560
If you're not a fan of wearing pumps, why not paint a pair of white sneakers instead?

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:54.918
This would be a great project for a pair of guys' Vans.

00:03:54.918 --> 00:03:59.822
