00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.190
0:00:00.000,0:00:09.861
Hi, in this video tutorial i will be showing

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.850
you how to add a favicon into your website.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.000
This will cover adding a favicon into a HTML
site as well as a PHP and WordPress site.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.790
0:00:10.367,0:00:29.384
Let me first explain what a favicon is and

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.790
does.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.600
When you visit a website you will notice a
small image next to the title in the tab,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.650
that is the favicon.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.000
Normally a logo but can be anything to identify
that the tab has your website open.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.429
You will also see a favicon when you bookmark
a site or when check the RSS feed.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.009
0:00:29.484,0:00:48.126
To add a favicon to your website you will

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.260
need to get two things.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.611
The image for the favicon and the HTML code
to link to the image.

00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:40.670
To create the favicon you can use any image
editor you like.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.530
Am going to show an example through GIMP as
it is a free software, if you use Photoshop

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.210
there is an extention you will have to download.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.340
0:00:48.628,0:01:67.926
The extention will allow you to save files

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.350
in the ".ico" format.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:07.540
To get the Photoshop extention visit "www.telegraphics.com.au/sw/product/ICOFormat"
then download the version to suit your computer.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.540
0:01:68.926,0:01:100.818
Right lets create the favicon.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.580
First open up GIMP and open a new file.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.130
We want the final image to be 32px by 32px
but for editing an image this can be difficult

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.720
to work with, so lets make the image size
500px by 500px.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.150
Under Advanced options you should set the
resolution is 72px per inch.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.990
The "Color space" should be set to "RGB color"
and "Fill with" should be set to your chosen

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.200
colour.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.700
Click "Ok" once ready, if you need to zoom
in or out hold the "Ctrl" button and scroll.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.391
0:01:102.818,0:02:123.491
Now go to "File - Open" and locate the image

00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:50.490
you want to use as a favicon and once you
have selected it click "Open".

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.670
Then right click the image and go to "Edit
- Copy".

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.430
Then switch back to the document we created
and hit "Ctrl - V" on your keyboard.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.440
Then right click the "Floating Selection"
under the layers panel and click "To New Layer".

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.890
0:02:123.491,0:02:146.977
Now select the "Scale Tool" from the "Toolbox".

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.720
Under the "Tool Options" scroll down and make
sure the "Keep aspect" box is checked.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.400
Then click on the image and you'll see a box
appear, make sure the link is attached between

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.130
"Width" and "Height".

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.770
Now click on the down arrow until the height
is 500px.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.810
If the width of your image was bigger than
the height you would reverse this and hit

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.630
the down arrow on the "Width" box.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.750
0:02:149.485,0:02:164.596
After that click "Scale".

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.060
Next select the "Move Tool" from the "Toolbox"
and centre the image, to be more precise you

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.060
can select the "Alignment Tool" and click
on the image, and under "Tool Options" select

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.300
"Align "Center" and "Align Middle".

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.310
0:02:165.096,0:03:183.207
Before we export the image we have to take

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.270
it down to the appropriate scale.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.170
Under "Image" select "Scale Image", and replace
the 500px value with 32px for both "Width"

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.180
and "Height" and click "Scale".

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.080
Then right click on the image layer and click
"Merge Down".

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.880
0:03:186.156,0:03:206.767
Lets export the file by going to "File - Export".

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.200
Name the flie "favicon.ico" and select "Microsoft
Windows icon" as the "File Type".

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.650
Chose the location you want and click Export.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.840
You'll displayed with a "Windows Icon" box,
am just going to select the default option

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.890
it has giving me and clicking "Export".

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.880
0:03:206.767,0:03:218.128
Open up the folder holding your favicon image.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.500
Single click the image and make sure the image
dimensions are 32 x 32.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.220
If they are not you will have to back to edit
the image.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.520
0:03:219.131,0:03:224.461
We will now move onto the HTML code.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.230
I will first make a basic website directory.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.190
0:03:224.970,0:03:239.175
Here you can 3 pages and 3 folders.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.130
The favicon is inside the images folder.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.150
Lets open the all the files in a editor, am
using Notpad++ which is free and can be downloaded

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.150
"notepad-plus-plus.org/".

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:05.069
0:04:242.617,0:04:266.947
The files don't have much in them but will

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.380
do for showing how to insert the relating
favicon code.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.450
The code will be provided below but lets have
a look at the code on a live website.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.030
Enter "granthynddesigner.co.uk" into the url
bar.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.500
When the page loads right click and "View
page source".

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.840
Highlight the 2 lines we need and click "Ctrl
- C" to copy.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.160
0:04:266.947,0:04:287.402
Then paste the code into the web page your

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.160
using.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.389
Make sure that you paste the code between
the opening HEAD tag and closing HEAD tag.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.630
Hit "Ctrl - S" to save the file and open the
file with a browser.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.740
Notice that the favicon from granthynddesigner.co.uk
is displayed.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.800
To change this all you have to do is change
the href value to match your site.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.550
0:04:294.349,0:05:300.554
You won't see the favicon display until you

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.770
have upload it to the website through your
FTP, I'll show this step later.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.680
0:05:301.558,0:05:307.388
If you are adding the favicon to .html files

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.139
you will have to add the code to the HEAD
of every page.

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.810
0:05:309.888,0:05:324.218
If you are adding the code to a website built

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.500
using PHP and the website is split into sections.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.690
Then you will only have to enter the code
once into the "header.php" file.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.610
The file may be under a different name but
just find the file with the HEAD tags.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.330
0:05:325.724,0:05:334.304
WordPress is built through PHP and will be

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.800
the same concept for adding the code.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.410
I will take you through a live example as
i add a favicon to my tutorial website.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.590
0:05:334.304,0:05:351.290
First thing i'll get you to do is login to

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.590
your chosen FTP.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.340
I am using Filezilla which can be downloaded
for free at "filezilla-project.org".

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.030
Then navigate to the base level of website
you wish to add the favicon to.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:56.729
Then find the favicon from your computer and
double click it to upload to your website.

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.211
0:05:359.172,0:06:378.158
Login to your Wordpress website and click

00:06:01.211 --> 00:06:03.790
on the "Editor" link under the "Appearance"
tab.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.169
Select the "header.php" file from the right.

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:11.210
You can see the opening HEAD tag, and the
closing HEAD tag, just before the closing

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.030
HEAD tag add the lines of code.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:23.440
If not already done so you should now change
the href value to match your domain name.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:30.920
0:06:388.545,0:06:404.031
Look at the front page of your website...

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.110
You might not see the favicon appear straight
away so go into the history of your browser

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.110
and clear the "cache".

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.700
Go back to your website and refresh.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.300
You should now see the favicon you created
display on every page of your website including

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.889
the dashboard.

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:51.419
0:06:408.978,0:06:417.558
And that is it for this video tutorial, if

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:54.370
you have any questions leave a comment and
please like and share the video.
