00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:07.750
Now we move over to a very important part
of the facial, we are now going to give cold

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:16.180
compress into the client's eyes. This is very
essential for the client's relaxation, for

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.930
great facials, if the client falls asleep
in this period, there's an extra amount of

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:32.070
glow that's critically absorb. We're now covering
the complete face, leaving the nose area,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:46.229
facilitating the breathing. We've used ice-chilled
dip cotton for cold compress. During the massage,

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:54.120
the blood circulation of the skin increases
by large amount. This particular step of cold

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.860
compress helps in normalizing and bringing
the blood circulation to an equilibrium position.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:07.300
We could alternatively use a hot compress
according to the weather or the season. We

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:27.360
could alternatively use a soft towel for the
same purpose.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.050
Now we're going to gently wipe out the anti-wrinkle
cream from the face, with the help of the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.670
same cotton.
