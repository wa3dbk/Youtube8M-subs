Welcome, today you will learn the basic controls
in Overgrowth.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.190
So the first thing you have to know is how
to load items. You just do that by pressing

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.270
the load item button.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.620
And then you can select one of these models
here, or you can press the browse button.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.310
Navigate to your Overgrowth folder, go to
data and then objects.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.490
And then select one of these folders or XML
files here. I'm going to select this XML file.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.920
And then I just click there to spawn it.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.159
So, in order to select this you can either
double-click, or you can press both left-

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:37.429
and right-click at the same time and drag
to get a selection box.

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:41.289
To deselect you can either double-click outside
of an item or press Q.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:47.420
So what can you do with this? Well, you can
use left-click in the middle there to move

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.879
it around.

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:55.510
If you use Right-click you will move it along
the plane of the face.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:03.940
And if you hold shift and right-click and
drag you will move it on the third axis.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.320
In order to rotate it, you grab the edge of
the box there.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.400
And with left click you get a freeform transform
there, and if you right click you can rotate

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.590
it on a single axis.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.070
Select the corners in order to scale it, the
first one there was left click and the second

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.930
one was right click, and here is right click
plus shift.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:37.979
Now, you can use control and alt also. If
you hold alt and translate, you will make

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.070
a copy. If you hold control, you will snap
to a grid like that, if you hold both control

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.960
and alt, you can create copies at regular
intervals.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.880
You can select several objects by holding
shift down and double-clicking on them.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.760
