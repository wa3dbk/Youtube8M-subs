00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.910
HTC Magic.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:18.140
The HTC Magic is HTC's second Android-powered
handset after the T-Mobile G1 / HTC Dream.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.949
We first brought you a glimpse of this handset
last month under its codename "HTC Sapphire"

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.850
and assumed (incorrectly) that it would be
heading for T-Mobile.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.050
It seems that Vodafone have snapped up exclusive
rights to the HTC Magic in the UK, Spain,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.100
Germany and in France through SFR.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.680
Vodafone will also be selling it in Italy,
although they don't have exclusive rights

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.300
in that market.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.140
Perhaps best described as the G1 without a
QWERTY keyboard, the HTC Magic has a 3.2"

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:59.100
320 x 480 pixel touch-sensitive display, a
3.2 megapixel camera with autofocus, GPS,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.280
WiFi and 3.5G support.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.440
The controls on the HTC Magic are minimal,
other than the touchscreen display there is

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.850
a trackball and some basic control buttons,
and that's it.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.560
Everything else is done through the screen.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.570
The Android operating system can be thought
of as a work in progress.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.170
One key weakness with the original G1 was
the lack of video playback for anything other

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.050
than YouTube.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.170
This has been improved, and the Magic can
now play back MPEG4 and 3GP clips, which is

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.140
still a pretty poor selection by current standards.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.530
Most major audio formats are supported though,
and always remember that the Android platform

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.630
is still under development and a future upgrade
should bring more features.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.490
Compare this phone to the HTC Touch Diamond2,
LG ARENA or Samsung Omnia HD and it seems

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.700
that the hardware specifications are looking
a bit dated.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.420
But the key selling point with Android is
the quality of the operating system and the

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.530
ease of adding new applications through the
Android Market.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.590
And the "Google" co-branding indicates that
this handset integrates well with Google's

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.270
ever growing suite of web-based applications.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.209
This is a slightly more compact device than
the G1, and at 119 grams it is much lighter

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.349
too.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:27.319
The large 1340 mAh battery provides up to
6.5 hours talktime on 3G and an impressive

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.140
maximum standby time of almost four weeks.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.040
It is looking likely that the HTC Magic will
be the second Android handset to market.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.060
Vodafone say that the Magic should be available
in April.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.629
Rivals Huawei have said that their Android
phone will be out in Q3, and the Kogan Agora

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.680
was recently cancelled, so it could well be
a one-two for HTC.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:59.040
No guidance was given on cost, but as the
G1 is free on T-Mobile's £30 / €45 tariffs,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.560
then expect a similar deal from Vodafone on
the HTC Magic.
