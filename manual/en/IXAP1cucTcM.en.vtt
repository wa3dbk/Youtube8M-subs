Hi! Hi! So what's your name? Junnie, nice to meet you.... Yep, all right..

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:29.329
And what are you here for?

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.219
I'm here to do my N test, I spent all of last night playing Mario Kart

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.460

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.510

Let's check the car first.... Oh . Ok.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.360
(Squeaking sounds)

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I can do this.

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:22.850
Lets' start with some basic...

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.910
some basic stuff. Why don't you show me your
360 degree vision check.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.540
Oh man, how do I do this?

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.450
Where do I start? Maybe if I did actually remember

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.210
and open the book last night

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.390
i got it, I got it, I definitely got it.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.740
Start with the left side... OK

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.000
Now turn to the right side.....

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.000
No, that can't be right.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.150
Hey are you listening?...... Ummm, oh yeah I'm..

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.100
You look to the left

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.900
to the center and to the right.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
.... Oh... I got it...

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:10.000
Ok. So..

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.000
What would you do if a 
pedestrian crosses in front of you illegally

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:17.000
not waiting for you to slow down. ....

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.100
Oh I know that!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.500
Ohh. Stop that!! ......  Ohh sorry. My bad.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.689
Alright. Lets', lets' skip that part.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:39.689
Let's Jump strait into the driving here. OK?

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.659
OK, so I'll get you to pull onto the Thomas road

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.319
I'll tell you the rest of the directions once we're out there, but remember

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:59.319
I can't help you with your driving
abilities..... Ok

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:06.000
Turn that down.... Sorry it's my Mom's car.

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.000

You failed..... If I ever

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.929
ever have another student like you

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:11.359
who learns driving through Mario Kart

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.500
I'll get rid of them all!! You fail!

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
