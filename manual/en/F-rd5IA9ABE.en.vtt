00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.549
This is Fieldsports Britain News.

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.429
The pilot badger cull in Somerset is proving
more scary for the antis than the cullers.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.410
A local man who rides his bicycle to the pub,
shouted at a couple of farm dogs that usually

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.669
run out to chase him, causing a group of badger-cull
protestors hiding in a nearby hedge to scream

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:23.669
in fear.

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.039
The cull itself is "proceeding to plan" and
organisers are "pleased with progress to date",

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.060
according to the Government.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.019

All the money will be donated to Safari Club

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.460
forum on shooting sports.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.370
Staying with good deeds and generosity here
is a shout out to the guys on the stalking

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.370
directory forum.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.120
Fellow member Brian Murphy of Lanarkshire
was desperately in need of help to find the

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.750
funds to build a downstairs bedroom and wetroom
for his 18 year old daughter Leigh who has

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.750
cerebral palsy.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.909
Within hours of mentioning it to a fellow
stalker, the lads on the forum had set up

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:56.909
an auction to raise the cash.

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.100
In all £5,000 was raised.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.180
Brian and his family just wanted to say thank
you.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.629
Back to the ridiculous stuff.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.280
The Mississippi alligator record was broken
not once but twice during the opening weekend

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.290

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.600
Beth Trammell of Madison and her team of five
broke the previous record of 697.5 pounds

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.340
early Saturday morning by reeling in a 723.5
pounder.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.659
Her record was defeated two hours later by
Dustin Bockman, another amateur who managed

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.060
to wrangle in a 272-pound male, his very first
catch.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.140
Antis in California have come up with an ingenious
way of banning hunting.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.659
The California government is looking at banning
all hunting with lead bullets, arguing that

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:27.659
hunters could use lead alternatives.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.909
However, the Federal government has classed
lead-alternative bullets as 'armour piercing'

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:30.909
and has banned them.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.079
So no bullets - no hunting.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.299

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.759

the south of the country.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.679

the problem by allowing bow hunting on its

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:51.869
