00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:12.500
What's going on?

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Little dap.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.970
It's Jared Montz former pro and founder of
OnlineSoccerAcademy.com.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.700
Today we are learning soccer skill a very
advanced turn on a defender.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.700
I don't know if there is a name for this soccer
drill but I learned it almost 10 years ago

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.070
from Jason Kreis.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.720
Jason was a former MLS all time goals scored
record holder and he is now the head coach

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.970
of Real Salt Lake.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.919
Jason is from my hometown of Mandeville, Louisiana
and one day during my college offseason I

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:40.029
was soccer training with him.

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:43.940
He showed me this soccer drills and he said
one day he wanted to do it in a soccer game.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.430
Not sure if he ever did soccer skills but
today I'm going to show it to you so you can

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.430
make it happen!

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.849
Be sure to tweet at him and tell him you love
the move!

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:54.710

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.240
Key Points: Soccer Coaching
1.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.219
As the ball gets to you, angle your foot down
at a 45 degree angle and to the outside.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:39.219
2.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.960
Touch the inside back part of the ball, ever
so slightly with the outside of your foot

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.630
near the base of your toes.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.949
This will be the upper third part of your
foot.

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:59.159
It's more of a push, then a kick.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.159
3.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.479
The ball should appear like you are taking
a touch to the outside.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.050
This causes the defender to step in and try
to win it going to your outside.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.580
4.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.880
Quickly bring your foot to the outside of
the ball and use the inside of your foot in

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:29.970
a Cruyff like fashion to push 
the ball inside.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.029
Push, don't kick it.

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:32.029
5.

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:37.870
Your push of the ball inside should be a few
steps ahead of you so you can accelerate quickly

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.190
away from the defender and get your shot or
pass off.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.690
6.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.960
Do this when the defender is a step or two
behind you.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.029
This way they are not to close to you and
can see the ball going to the outside which

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:56.690
is your fake direction.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.330
If a defender is to close to you, they may
not see the fake so even if you do the best

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.960
turn ever they may not fall for it because
they don't even see it.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.290
Equipment Needed: Youth Soccer Drills
You will need a partner and a ball.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.449
If you don't have a partner you can use a
wall or a fence.

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:16.370
Exercise Player Can Do: How to Coach Soccer
Soccer drills for kids we can do to practice.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.609
Start off practicing this soccer training
drills in a slow motion fashion from a stand

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:21.609
still.

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:27.840
Do this a few times to get a feel for it.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.979
Once comfortable have your partner slowly
pass you the ball from 10 yards away.

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:36.370
As the ball comes to you do your turn and
dribble a few steps.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.200
Then pass it back and repeat.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.009
Do this 10 times and switch with your partner.

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:45.320
As you start to improve increase the speed
at which the ball is passed to you and continue

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.529
the reps cycle.

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:48.139
Do ten reps.

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.970
Repeat until you have mastered it.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.300

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:03.609
[Music]

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.570
Word of advice, if the ball is drilled at
you in a game that is probably not the right

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.309
pass to do this advanced turn.

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:15.160
So don't think you need to be able to do this
move with a ball being passed at you 100 mph!

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.279
To challenge yourself, check your shoulder
prior to receiving the ball so you can see

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.762
where the defender is and if the situation
you are in allows you to do this type of move.

00:04:23.762 --> 00:04:24.762
If you have a goal, then include it in your
exercise by adding a shot after you turn instead

00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:25.762
of just dribbling a few steps.

00:04:25.762 --> 00:04:26.762
For those of you without a partner.

00:04:26.762 --> 00:04:30.990
Pass your ball off the wall and then as it
comes back to you do your advanced turn.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.990
Do 10 reps, rest and then repeat until you
master it.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.130
What Player Could Be Doing Wrong: Coaching
Youth Soccer

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.201
If the defender is always winning it then
the defender is to close to you when you try

00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:40.201
this move.

00:04:40.201 --> 00:04:47.360
You could also be taking your touch inside
directly at the defender instead of to the

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.660
side.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.660
Bonus Tip!

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.260
Youth Soccer
For tips on body positioning when receiving

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.620
a pass with your back to a defender watch
our Online Soccer Academy video titled "Soccer

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.790
Striker -- How to Receive a Pass".

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.730
Be confident when you do this move and don't
over think it.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.420
If you practice enough and get real comfortable
with this move you won't even think on the

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.420
field.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.250
You will just do it when the time is right
and you are in your attacking third.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.370
