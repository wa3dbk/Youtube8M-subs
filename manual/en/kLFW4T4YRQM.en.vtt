Welcome everyone to AC News,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Let's see today's trailer cinema news is coming up!

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Today we will find out who won the Oscar

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
for the best outfit during the long and glamorous Academy Awards night.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
There were numerous divas in the red carpet competition.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Who do you think was the best dressed one?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
First of all we need to say that there were two major categories:

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
red dresses and white dresses.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
These two colors definitely dominated the red carpet!

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
As for red, the lovely Michelle Williams has definitely made the right choice:

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
a beautiful coral vintage dress!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Also, Emma Stone looked great with an elegant red ribbon.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We were not really excited by Colin Firth’s wife,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Livia Giuggioli, with a very classy wide red dress ... too wide!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Definitely disappointing was Natalie Portman’s red dress with no shape at all.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
As for the competitors in the white dress category there is no doubt:

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Gwyneth Paltrow wins, she was just perfect!

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We must also say that Mila Jovovich has done her best,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but when Paltrow is in such a great shape, it’s better to surrender right away.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And what about Angelina Jolie? Some found her black outfit very sexy ... 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
For us the dress was a little too heavy with an exaggerated gap

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that brings to mind the horrible Sanremo evening with our dear Belen that showed too much.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
That's all for today.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
