00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.280
So what are you working
on today, Travis?

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:03.595
I'm Travis Blake.

00:00:03.595 --> 00:00:08.906
I'm a service technician for
Mossy Toyota in San Diego.

00:00:08.906 --> 00:00:13.180
When I got my first car, my old
truck, I had an old '88

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.600
Toyota pickup that like to break
down a lot, and I got

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.940
tired of paying someone
to fix it.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.250
So I got interested in
working on that.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.580
And I wanted more information
once I started working on it.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.750
No one could provide
that to me.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.680
And then I found out about the
T-TEN program, and I started

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.470
that, and liked all the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.910
information that I was learning.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.380
I realized that I could really
do this for a living, make a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.280
career out of it.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.900
The T-TEN program
that I started

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.000
was at Miramar College.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.460
It's a local community college
here in San Diego.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.980
And they have an internship
program.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.800
It's an actual class that you
work at a dealership and you

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.720
gain experience.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.870
So you're getting experience in
the dealership, and you're

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.700
also learning classroom
instruction, learning the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.000
theory behind all of the
automotive principals that are

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.980
applied in the cars.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.060
So you learn theory at night.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.830
And then when you're at work
you're learning the actual

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.782
practical application
of the information

00:01:01.782 --> 00:01:03.060
you learned in class.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.010
If you don't have a job yet it
makes it extremely much more

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.216
easy to find a job, especially
with Toyota,

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:11.470
through the T-TEN program.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.406
But if you don't have a job
and you just want to go to

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:17.200
school, you have a wealth of
knowledge that they've provide

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.420
with you, so that when you get
out of school you can have no

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.120
problem finding a job
after school.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.575
After I got out of the T-TEN
program, and I was hired with

00:01:25.575 --> 00:01:27.970
Toyota, some of my first
duties were doing minor

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.264
services such as oil changes
and tire rotations.

00:01:30.264 --> 00:01:33.950
And then once I got put on a
team, I was able to advance

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.810
and constantly learn more, and
started replacing breaks, and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.210
doing more major services,
and things like that.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.870
And then I eventually got into
learning how to diagnose

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.320
problems with customer cars.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.650
This is the new, brand new, TIS

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.890
techstream diagnostic tool.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.240
It took the place of our old
scan tool, which was in use

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.390
for over 10 years.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.990
Through the T-TEN program,
through the more advanced

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.910
classes they have, like
electrical mastery and

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.580
advanced fuel diagnosis, how
to use more advanced tools

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.335
like this to connect with the
vehicles, and to connect with

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.860
the computers and find out
what's going on electrically,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.729
the problems that we
might encounter.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.670
Where I stand right now is if
you hand me a Toyota vehicle

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.935
with a problem there's a 99.9%
chance that I'll be able to

00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:20.320
know what that problem
is and then fix it.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.630
What I enjoy most about my job
is taking a car that's not

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.630
running right, or that has
a problem-- a customer's

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.080
complaining about a problem with
their car-- figuring out

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.550
if the problem is something
that we can fix, and then

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.470
finding out the solution to
that problem and then

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.800
basically satisfying the
customer, making someone happy

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.840
with their car again that was
unhappy to begin with, and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.135
fixing the car right
the first time.

00:02:43.135 --> 00:02:45.115
It's the most satisfying
thing to me.

00:02:45.115 --> 00:02:49.790
Working on my own car in my
driveway led me to choose this

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.790
as my career.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.290
I haven't even looked back.
