TIM ANDERSON: Hi and welcome
to Tech Tips From Teachers.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.252
On this episode, we'll be
looking at mathematics apps.

00:00:06.252 --> 00:00:07.710
Our guest today is
Melissa Kondrick

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.630
of Pleasanton, California.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.760
Melissa teaches
middle school math,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.470
holds a master's degree in
curriculum and instruction,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.836
and sits on the technology
committee for her district.

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:18.460
Melissa, thanks so
much for joining us.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.550
MELISSA KONDRICK:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.970
TIM ANDERSON: You've been
teaching for a couple of years

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.650
now.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.340
During that time,
what sort of impact

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.882
have you seen technology have
on the way that students learn?

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:27.548
MELISSA KONDRICK:
Well the big buzz word

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:28.950
these days is Common Core.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.159
And it's something about
these different standards that

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.200
aren't just preparing
students for the classroom,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.220
but for everyday life.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.337
And technology's one of
those big parts of it.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:38.920
And you're going to
see in the future,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.220
students aren't going
to have textbooks.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.610
They're going to have
tablets and laptops

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.560
that they're going to be able
to get all their content with.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.230
And so it's really
important for us

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.530
because now these standards
are more student-centric.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.446
Students work with each
other and technology's

00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:51.640
a way for them to be
able to work together,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.669
which is really great.

00:00:52.669 --> 00:00:53.460
TIM ANDERSON: Nice.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.250
And then specifically
with math--

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.550
that's the subject that you
teach-- what sort of impact

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.270
have you seen technology
have on the delivery

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.102
and the consumption of those
specific math standards?

00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:06.310
MELISSA KONDRICK: Technology
makes it so much easier,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.920
especially for differentiation.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.128
I have different students
that are on different parts

00:01:10.128 --> 00:01:11.570
of their math journey.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.110
Some are still a little
shaky on those fractions,

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.260
while others are ready to
move on to the next step.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.000
And the technology
allows them to do

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.590
whatever they need at the pace
that they're comfortable with.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.620
Also we can be able to scaffold
by having them get information

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.190
and feedback immediately,
versus before you would go home,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.190
you'd come back, you
wouldn't know if you did it

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.470
right until the next day.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.535
And technology helps be able
to get that information out

00:01:33.535 --> 00:01:35.110
sooner.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.650
TIM ANDERSON: We've synthesized
feedback for math teachers,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.440
and have identified a few
key components for developers

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.430
to prioritize when
developing math apps.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.720
It's important that these
apps have content that's

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.460
highly scaffolded, that they
have offline functionality,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.040
and that the content is
mapped to the Common Core.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.190
So you mentioned
differentiation earlier.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.000
So why is scaffolded
content something

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.850
that's so crucial for
an app that's going

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.150
to be used in the classroom?

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.120
MELISSA KONDRICK: Well,
even though I only

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.300
teach sixth graders, they
need to know all the content

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.350
from the previous years.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.820
And if students are able
to access that in one app

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.389
without being told,
that's really powerful.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.130
Another thing too is that it
gives instant feedback, so

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.640
that when students are actually
doing the different games

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.540
and stuff in the app, they're
really learning old stuff,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.980
but they're actually also
teaching themselves new stuff.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.060
And let's be honest--
if you actually

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.370
get it from a talking
character besides a teacher,

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.827
you're more likely to be
willing to remember it.

00:02:26.827 --> 00:02:28.410
So it gives students
a little bit more

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.180
of an independence
of their learning,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.480
and they get to know what
they don't know and be

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.713
able to make that stronger.

00:02:33.713 --> 00:02:34.588
TIM ANDERSON: Got it.

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:36.630
And then, with
offline functionality,

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.200
why is that something
that developers

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.200
should be keeping top of
mind when they're going

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.480
through and creating an app?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.480
MELISSA KONDRICK: Well
we live in a digital age,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.010
but not all of our buildings
and structures are at the area

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.009
that we need them to be.

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.670
So personally, our Wi-Fi
works about 80% of the time.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.850
So 20% of the time,
I need a plan B.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.460
And so having offline
capability is super important.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.370
Another thing too is that it
limits distractions sometimes.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.690
Because if students do have
access to the internet,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.230
they're going to
go online and do

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.940
all the other things
besides the math

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.370
that they need to be doing.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.322
And the other thing is if
they can get it anywhere,

00:03:10.322 --> 00:03:12.030
anytime, they're
probably going to use it

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.240
more outside of school
than just in school

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.390
where they have Wi-Fi.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.265
TIM ANDERSON: Got it.

00:03:16.265 --> 00:03:17.090
Makes sense.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.000
And then you mentioned
Common Core earlier.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.170
So from a teacher
adoption standpoint,

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.350
why is it important that
this content is mapped back

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.725
to those Common Core standards?

00:03:25.725 --> 00:03:27.350
MELISSA KONDRICK: We
take, us teachers,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.330
a lot of time trying
to create pacing guides

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.420
and trying to find what's
important to actually be there

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.220
for our students.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.750
We need something that's going
to be efficient and effective

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.960
in a short amount of time.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.820
And so being able to be aligned
to the Common Core standards,

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.740
that right there gets me looking
at that app twice as much

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.000
as something that isn't.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.980
And to be honest,
parents really want

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.230
to be able to know what
they can do at home as well.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.924
And having at school
those standards at home,

00:03:49.924 --> 00:03:52.090
it's really powerful for
parents to feel comfortable

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.100
helping their students
as much as they can.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.100
TIM ANDERSON: Let's take
a look at some exemplar

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.232
apps for math-- Slice
Fractions, Desmos, and Matific.

00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:02.690
Melissa, what makes
Slice Fractions

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.970
such a great app
for the classroom?

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.430
MELISSA KONDRICK: Oh my
gosh, it's so engaging.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.330
Have you seen this?

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.150
There's this little mammoth,
and he's just cute as a button.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.480
All I want to be able
to do is just find a way

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.100
to get him to the next step.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.440
And it teaches students
whole and sliced fractions,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.310
which is great.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.875
It's highly
scaffolded, so students

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:20.250
can feel like they can try
the puzzle over and over again

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.730
and not have fear of failing.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.879
Which means that they're
actually going to learn.

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:24.670
TIM ANDERSON: Nice.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.710
And then what about Desmos?

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.130
What makes that something that's
a good fit for the classroom?

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.255
MELISSA KONDRICK: It's a
great powerful calculator,

00:04:30.255 --> 00:04:32.460
and it has that offline
capability, where students

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.689
can be able to use it
anywhere and any time, which

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:36.480
is really great for
them-- in the classroom

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.220
when we don't have
Wi-Fi and also at home

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.359
if they don't have access.

00:04:39.359 --> 00:04:40.150
TIM ANDERSON: Nice.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.710
And then with Matific.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.850
What makes that an app that's
important for other math

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.849
teachers to consider?

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.640
MELISSA KONDRICK: Well,
it's highly aligned

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.610
with the Common Core standards.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.401
You can actually find
the standard and work

00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:51.950
with it, which is really great.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.400
It's developed by
early age math experts,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.290
so it's coming from math people,
which is really important.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.540
And it also goes with some
of the different curriculum

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.207
programs such as enVision Math,
Everyday Math, and Go Math,

00:05:02.207 --> 00:05:04.540
which is actually a textbook
that we're currently using.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.030
TIM ANDERSON: Very cool.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.613
So something that
could be a huge time

00:05:06.613 --> 00:05:08.080
saver for teachers,
which obviously

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.210
is going to affect adoption.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.040
MELISSA KONDRICK:
Yeah and students

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.873
don't know they're
learning, because they're

00:05:11.873 --> 00:05:12.980
playing a bunch of games.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.160
TIM ANDERSON: So to recap, for
math apps in the classroom,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
it's important the content
is highly scaffolded,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.450
that the app has
offline functionality,

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.380
and the content is aligned
with the Common Core.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.810
