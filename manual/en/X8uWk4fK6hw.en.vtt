00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.790
We're honoring Nicholas Xiarhos
as a team coming out here.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.830
We wanted to do a Tough Mudder
because it's in honor of Nick.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.980
But it's really just in honor
of everyone-- came back,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.020
didn't come back, just
veterans in general.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.600
Being a vet, being a vet,
being a bet, not being a vet,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.530
but we're just big supporters of combat
vets coming back and needing help.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.599
And this type of event helps us.

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.390
It's the camaraderie that you lose
when you get out that comes back

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.026
when you do these type of events.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.660
So Carry the Fallen is an organization
that helps veterans coming back

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.340
suffering from post-traumatic stress.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.910
People need to know about it.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.380
So today, I must've talked
to 25 people, informing them

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.880
what we do as a team to raise money
and awareness for veteran suicide.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.290
We're carrying those that can't do
this with us, so we added 30 pounds.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.610
So we named it Nick in honor of Nick.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.640
In his memory, carrying
the rock along with us,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.306
so we're doing it for those that can't.

00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:08.194
At the end, each of us
will have [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:10.270
So we'll have 10 by the time we're done.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.590
So we carry the fallen.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.230
Today, we found all our weights
[INAUDIBLE] one every mile.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.090
Everyone grabbed an extra one.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.560
By the end, we all had a weight, and we
all carried the fallen through the end.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.970
The ribbons that we
carry today were actually

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.050
of men who've been killed
in action, and also those

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.270
who have lost their battle due to
post post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.172
So each of these ribbons today,
when we carried our rock,

00:01:35.172 --> 00:01:36.630
we carried it for Carry the Fallen.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.755
We carried it for Big Nick.

00:01:37.755 --> 00:01:42.070
We carried it for all those who served,
for those who've been killed in action,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.890
and those who continue to
fight every day [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.140
Leave no man behind.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.140
Leave no man behind.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.680
We all finish together.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.170
Team Big Nick!

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.520
