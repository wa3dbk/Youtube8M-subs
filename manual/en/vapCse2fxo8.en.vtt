00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.719
The backbone of our program is our year long
professional courses. But we also offer numerous

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.480
short courses in different subjects based
on the requirements that we've got from various

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.730
customers.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.410
The National Flight Test Institute is our
degree-granting arm of the Test Pilot School.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.220
We offer two Master of Science degrees. We
have a Master of Science in Flight Test and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.180
Evaluation, and we also have a Master of Science
in Flight Test Engineering.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.880
All our year-long professional course students
are enrolled in our Masters program, assuming

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.660
that they're eligible, and if they successfully
complete the course they are awarded a Masters

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.130
degree.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.200
We also have numerous, anywhere from ten to
30 students who are registered with us strictly

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.120
for the Masters Degree program, because there's
very few universities out there that offer

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.500
a Masters Degree in these fields.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.230
The standard professional course runs twelve
months. You can join in either January or

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.780
June. In January we start the Systems half
of the course, with six months of Systems.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.460
And then we have some people who come just
for the Performance and Flying Qualities,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.780
which starts in the June time frame.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.630
The way we structure everything is that we
break it into modules. So you never have more

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.720
than a week, a week and a half of academics
before you're starting to fly an aircraft.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.729
Each of our Masters degree modules is offered
as an independent academic module that can

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.370
also be taken as a short course.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.580
We do a two week Introduction to Flight Test
course, what we call the fixed wing short

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.900
course. We get a lot of young engineers that
come to this course, from the US Air Force,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.520
some from civilian industry.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.670
Our Operational Test and Evaluation course
- unlike a lot of other ones - is unique because

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.190
we do flying in the course, both simulator
and aircraft. Very intensive, a hard work

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.710
environment for that three weeks.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.630
We also do a two week export version that
we can take on the road. We teach that around

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.010
the world in different places.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.979
We have several On Demand courses that we
do when there's a specific need that's brought

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.440
up by a customer. We will do a two-week technical
or production pilot course when we've got

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.530
a demand for that. We do upset and spin training
for flight test organizations. We do some

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.000
crew resource management and safety training
for different organizations, both here at

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.900
Mojave and other places.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.080
We've been the provider for the FAA for their
test pilot and flight test engineer training

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.460
for about the past nineteen years.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.409
A couple of other things we do at the National
Flight Test Institute, we have a Graduate

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.330
Assistant program. This program was established
a few years ago. We like to have about three

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.640
students in the program at any given time.
They contribute to the school by helping us

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.730
out on various projects, and over that three-year
period of time they earn their Master of Science

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.389
degree in Flight Test Engineering.

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:23.349
National Flight Test Institute also does research
in the flight test arena. One of the programs

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.549
I talked about already is our surrogate UAV
project, which was a student-faculty research

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.569
project that has resulted in us having an
optionally piloted vehicle.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.959
We think we put out a great graduate who goes
home and can really help out their parent

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.849
organization that sent them here to be able
to safely plan, execute and report on flight

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:41.329
test. And that's the main goal that we're
going after.
