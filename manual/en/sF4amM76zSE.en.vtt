00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.289
(peaceful music)

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.897
- Oxford does feel to me to be
a place of nooks and crannies

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:32.300
where people can go and
you can just sort of

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.813
sink down and read, and
that's a beautiful thing.

00:00:34.813 --> 00:00:37.352
I have not traveled outside of the US

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:40.707
at all before this, so I
was really nervous coming,

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.974
I was afraid it would be
completely a culture shock for me,

00:00:43.974 --> 00:00:46.851
and it was at first, but at the same time,

00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:49.036
it's comforting to realize
that in certain sense,

00:00:49.036 --> 00:00:51.312
this feels very much

00:00:51.312 --> 00:00:55.104
sort of a place that I
always wanted to go to.

00:00:55.104 --> 00:00:57.498
My name is Tamara Moellenberg,
I'm from Loveland, Colorado,

00:00:57.498 --> 00:01:01.554
and I'm an English Literature
and Philosophy major.

00:01:01.554 --> 00:01:03.672
There are many American students with me,

00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:05.030
and they're all from my home university,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.492
so we have that shared connection,

00:01:06.492 --> 00:01:09.274
and it has very much helped
me with my experience here.

00:01:09.274 --> 00:01:11.493
It's just wonderful to have
people who are going through

00:01:11.493 --> 00:01:13.822
the same experience, making
the same observations

00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:16.105
that you are about these
people, about this culture,

00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:17.896
so you can sit and talk about who are

00:01:17.896 --> 00:01:19.555
the British really like,

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:22.604
and so in that sense it's
wonderful to have that community

00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:24.057
within a community.

00:01:24.057 --> 00:01:26.357
I've gained so many valuable
insights from these people,

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:28.611
from these students that
I've been with from America,

00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:31.118
and just trying to understand
a different way of learning,

00:01:31.118 --> 00:01:32.555
a different culture altogether,

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:34.482
and at the same time they're
all learning interesting things

00:01:34.482 --> 00:01:37.195
in their tutorials as well,
so can speak not only about

00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:40.362
the tutorial experience
and how we were nervous

00:01:40.362 --> 00:01:42.794
or succeeding in that, but
then also about the ideas

00:01:42.794 --> 00:01:45.258
that they're studying,
and everyone is so excited

00:01:45.258 --> 00:01:46.506
about what they're learning here,

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.272
and that's a beautiful thing,
and that's very exciting

00:01:48.272 --> 00:01:50.827
to be able to go through
this experience with people

00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:53.327
who are that excited about it.

00:02:01.602 --> 00:02:05.090
- Instead Stamford, which
is an all stone town,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.545
about 88 miles from here,

00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:10.090
toward the eastern part of the country.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.703
But the film, of course, is
mainly of a very handsome town.

00:02:14.703 --> 00:02:17.844
- The system of teaching
here, it's one on one,

00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:19.427
and it's beautiful.

00:02:20.746 --> 00:02:23.409
You go, he'll give you a
reading list, he'll go,

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.571
"Read this novel for a week,"

00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:26.987
at least for my primary tutorial,
which is in 19th century

00:02:26.987 --> 00:02:29.325
British novel, so here
I'm held accountable

00:02:29.325 --> 00:02:33.390
to really having let what
I've been reading change me,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.705
let what I've been reading
affect me in some way,

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:38.302
and really having practiced it,

00:02:38.302 --> 00:02:40.508
and as you learn to,

00:02:40.508 --> 00:02:42.948
being held accountable in
that sense, I'm also being

00:02:42.948 --> 00:02:46.183
held accountable to learn
to actually process things,

00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:48.233
which is perhaps the most valuable skill,

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:50.880
and one I think that many
students at Oxford would say

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.539
is something that benefits them
by having an Oxford degree.

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:56.829
The program is very good about taking you

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.194
to different places,

00:02:59.194 --> 00:03:01.677
and it's not just you get
off the bus and here you are,

00:03:01.677 --> 00:03:02.954
we have lectures about them,

00:03:02.954 --> 00:03:05.227
oftentimes beforehand or afterwards.

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:09.171
So for instance we just
toured Stonehenge and Bath,

00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:11.294
and we had a lecture on the
history of these two places

00:03:11.294 --> 00:03:13.853
before we went, so we were able
to see with an informed eye,

00:03:13.853 --> 00:03:16.876
and getting off and seeing
Stonehenge was definitely

00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:18.760
one of the neatest experiences I've had.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.612
It was a lot bigger than I thought it was,

00:03:20.612 --> 00:03:22.112
so I enjoyed that.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.848
And then we went to
Bath, which for all of us

00:03:25.848 --> 00:03:28.074
Jane Austen fans was a
very important place,

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:30.433
because she lived for six years in Bath.

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:32.523
Not only did we get to
see the Roman baths,

00:03:32.523 --> 00:03:35.073
which has significance historically,

00:03:35.073 --> 00:03:38.610
when Britain was
underneath the Roman Empire

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.113
and Roman influence, which
was amazing considering

00:03:41.113 --> 00:03:44.419
it's more ancient history than
I've ever come in contact,

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.100
really walking through these Roman baths,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.215
I've never been in such an ancient place,

00:03:48.215 --> 00:03:49.425
an ancient culture.

00:03:49.425 --> 00:03:52.195
But then, more personally,
to be able to see

00:03:52.195 --> 00:03:54.240
the places of Jane Austen,
that she writes about

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.759
in her novels, which is

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:57.567
very fun, and so, on both levels,

00:03:57.567 --> 00:04:00.341
personally and historically
and educationally,

00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:02.970
it was a wonderful experience.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.802
I have gained so much confidence,

00:04:04.802 --> 00:04:07.783
from first of all having
gone so far from home,

00:04:07.783 --> 00:04:10.682
and especially having had
to learn and prove myself

00:04:10.682 --> 00:04:12.533
in a completely different system of study

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:14.282
than I've ever encountered back home.

00:04:14.282 --> 00:04:17.382
I've gained everything I've learned here,

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.234
all the different ideas,
all the different people,

00:04:19.234 --> 00:04:20.947
all the different experiences I've had

00:04:20.947 --> 00:04:23.176
have augmented who I am in some way.

00:04:23.176 --> 00:04:25.718
And so now I can go home,
and there's a certain

00:04:25.718 --> 00:04:27.077
amount of confidence in the fact

00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:30.455
that I'm able to accept
challenges and learn in new ways

00:04:30.455 --> 00:04:32.574
when confronted with
something that is so new

00:04:32.574 --> 00:04:34.084
and different and that I'm not used to,

00:04:34.084 --> 00:04:36.041
that's okay, I can learn
how to deal with it,

00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:38.532
I can go forward and not only
learn how to deal with it,

00:04:38.532 --> 00:04:40.125
but I can succeed in that system,

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:42.545
and that's a very empowering feeling.

00:04:42.545 --> 00:04:45.128
