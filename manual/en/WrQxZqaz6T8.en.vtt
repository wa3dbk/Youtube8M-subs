00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.300
From this condition
I firmly grab here.

00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.633
There are two variants:

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:45.330
the first one... ok?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.223
or the second one...

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.200
... to strongly remove his grab from the neck.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.400
The work is done by the shoulder.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.000
100 points! [laughs]

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.019
The hand is already there,

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:15.419
you don't have to do nothing.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.200
One... and rises strongly. The elbow.

00:01:26.664 --> 00:01:29.036
One, two, three, four.

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:35.421
The strike is given with the entire body.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.100
And we escape, ok?

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.260
I feel he is pushing me,

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.910
I look back to check the situation.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.260
And then: one... immediately... BAM!

00:02:02.147 --> 00:02:05.330
I study his reaction...

00:02:05.328 --> 00:02:09.490
one, two, three, four...

00:02:09.487 --> 00:02:16.380
...why not? Torsion...
five, I use the wall, I use the environment... ok?

00:02:21.636 --> 00:02:24.400
I have to escape from here.
Suppose that Valerio is coming...

00:02:24.636 --> 00:02:29.300
They blocked me and they are two. What should I do? [Back kick]

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.960
No, because the other one is coming.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.720
You are ready to face Valerio. You have to come out
from the situation of disadvantage, always.

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:43.800
Why don't we strike him? Because he can fall over him.

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.660
If I have to get Alessio out of there... 
 I can't risk him to be "buried"...

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.000
To be safe, we'll do it like this: one, two.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.500
I separed the motions, actually it is a single movement:
one-two, here, close.

00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:04.230
I don't do like this, because he could strike back with the head, ok?

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.170
Genitals: I don't put them here, otherwise I become a boy soprano.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.660
This is a strike, given with the fingertip... the thumb.

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:30.200
One... in this zone... upwards.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.000
Here the most important thing is the position of the hands.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.970
Threat on the forehead. Hands are not here.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.400
Because if I do any movement... he shots me.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:23.000
Hands are always close to the armed threat.
If up, here... here... here.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.900
Why?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.200
Because I'm scared, but I can reach the handgun.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.200
If he lets go the gun, even better.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.900
Otherwise, it would have been like this:

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.100
one... the barrel always... not here, not there... but there, ok?
