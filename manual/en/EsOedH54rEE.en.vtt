Hi my name is Teri Lynne and I'm here on behalf
of Expert Village. I'm here with David O'Donnell.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.349
I'm going to give you some hairstyling tips
for straight hair. So if you want the straight

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.940
haired look, or perhaps even if you have a
bit of wave to your hair but you prefer to

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.210
wear it completely straight, when it's damp
there's a couple of tricks you can do to keep

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.939
it nice and straight all day, is you might
want to use a little bit of product. You don't

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.410
actually need to, but if you are going to
use a product, I recommend a styling cream,

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.949
because it weighs your hair down and it just
gives it that little bit of a wet look all

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.120
day, and actually you can keep refreshing
your hair even with a little bit of water

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.920
spritzing throughout the day and that styling
cream will keep, you can re-use it throughout

00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:03.469
the day. So you want to comb your hair straight
or brush it straight.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.490
And then if you want it to maintain its straightness,
what I recommend is blow drying it while it's

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.320
still slightly damp, that way if you go out
and it's air dried you might start getting

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.619
some of that lift and curl as you're out running
throughout the day, running your errands,

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.430
you might start getting some wave that you
might not want. So once you've combed it straight,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.740
you're just going to take your blow dryer
and you're just going to start at the root

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.499
and follow the brush down with the hair dryer
all the way through so you have a nice straight

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:42.330
look. Do it until your hair is completely
dry if you want the straight look. You can

00:01:42.330 --> 00:02:21.640
do this on low. It doesn't have to be on high.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.409
So just continue with that process until your
hair is completely dry and that will maintain

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.080
the straight look for you.
