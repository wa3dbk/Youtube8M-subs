00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.160
[typing]

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.200
Greetings and I welcome you to
another Lazy Game Reviews Quickie,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.100
this time looking at the newly
released game in the F.E.A.R. series,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.260
F.E.A.R. 3.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.140
Or as the logo implies,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.100
F3AR.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.980
Uh, just to preface this a little bit,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.460
I have played all the F.E.A.R. games.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.860
I've played them all since the very first one by Monolith.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.400
I also played the not-so-great expansion packs

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.480
by, uh, TimeGate Studios,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.340
Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.240
And then there was F.E.A.R. 2,
which was a couple of years ago now,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.680
also released by Monolith,
but then comes this one, F.E.A.R. 3,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.080
which is developed by Day 1 Studios,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.180
the same guys that were responsible
for the console ports of F.E.A.R.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.780
And I will admit that had me a little bit concerned

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.340
because I had no idea how they would take this.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.380
But thankfully, they haven't completely ruined the game.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.020
Another couple of names to throw out there:

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.660
John Carpenter, he worked on
the cinematics this time around,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.160
and also Steve Niles,
who is a comic book writer and such.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.320
So there is a bit more of a noticeable
flair to the cinematics and the story.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.760
In fact, there is sort of a story
that you can follow along now.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.220
I've never really noticed before in the F.E.A.R. games.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.980
That's because I don't play
the F.E.A.R. games for a story.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.220
I play the F.E.A.R. games to blow
away things in ridiculous ways

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.840
with very awesome weapons,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.960
as well as to take advantage of the bullet time,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.860
which is explained as very fast reflexes of Point Man.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.600
It's pretty much brought all of that back except

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.140
it's been extremely consolized.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.800
And what I mean by that is that a
game that was originally a PC title

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.640
has really had a lot of "console-itis"
kind of things thrown in there.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.280
And not just console titles, specifically,
I mean modern shooters in general.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.360
I'm not a big fan of all this stuff like

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.220
an actual cover system.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.300
Basically, it's a shoulder magnet button.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.760
You click on a cover and, augh, you're up against it

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.200
and you can peek out from
behind the edges and shoot people.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.260
The F.E.A.R. games have never had that.
I never thought they needed that

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.880
because you have this bullet time mode
which you can just use at any time,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.260
and blow away all the bad guys
in ridiculously hideous ways.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.660
It was basically a crutch. I don't
know why it needed a cover mechanic.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.960
The game is a lot harder now, I think,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.140
so maybe it's a good thing, maybe it's not.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.080
The big problem that I have with it,
though, is the checkpoint system.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.260
Now there are no longer any kind of

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.860
quick save options or quick load options.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.660
You ONLY have checkpoints.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.500
There IS no other way around it, and I HATE that

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.800
because the checkpoints on this
one don't make any friggin' sense.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.840
If your checkpoint system works, I can get over that.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.060
That just saves me the hassle of having to
press F5 and F7 or whatever on the keyboard.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.440
But if they don't work,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.580
if the checkpoints are in completely illogical places,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.280
then I'm sorry, but that sucks.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.300
I mean, these are long levels.
Think 30 to 50 minutes each,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.620
and there's not exactly a bunch
of save points thrown in there,

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.780
so it really gets annoying.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.200
Because the game can be very unforgiving.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.160
And that's part of the appeal of the game or me,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.900
as well as the overall nastiness of the violence.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.020
Shooting people is just fun.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.260
They've brought back the F.E.A.R.
shotgun, the machine guns,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.020
the rail gun thing that shoots spikes and stuff.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.400
The energy weapons that just zap an enemy
to pieces and blow 'em up and set 'em on fire

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.360
and all that stuff, it's here.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.820
And the great environments have returned from F.E.A.R.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.120
and quite a few of I'm very, very fond of.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.300
I'm liking the fact that there are places

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.160
like a Sam's Club type of big chain store,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.140
a housing development, industrial type of places,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.240
all those kind of really awesome locations
that I love to shoot up in the F.E.A.R. games

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.660
and then see blow up in slow-motion. It's great.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.140
There's also a lot of new enemies now,
some of them are pretty frantic.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.200
It feels like I'm playing Left 4 Dead
or Serious Sam sometimes.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.080
It gets very, very intense,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.460
and I'm very much liking that.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.560
There's a bunch of other little things,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.340
but I'm not really going to go into them
because I haven't explored them.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.040
Things like playing through the game again

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.100
as Point Man's weird demon brother guy, Paxton Fettel.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.820
You have like spirit powers that you can use, I guess.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.620
That doesn't really appeal to me that much.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.600
There's also online multiplayer modes,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.460
which are just kind of take it or leave it for me.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.460
Although there's supposed to
be some interesting additions,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.420
like almost showing up in the middle of the match

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.200
to screw things up and stuff,

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.340
which is kind of cool.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.000
You also have the ability to play with two players

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.740
through the campaign co-op,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.480
which really sounds kind of interesting

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.080
and if I find somebody that would like
to play with it, I'd like to give it a try.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.500
So overall, F.E.A.R. 3 is a pretty solid experience.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.140
It's decent, the graphics look good,
the gameplay is good.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.380
It's not up to the standards of F.E.A.R. 1 in my opinion,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.160
but it's definitely a fun shooting experience

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.920
and it's disgusting,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.600
and I can appreciate that.
