00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.370
Hello Youtube, Technoandrew here

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.129
In this video I'm going to be showing you
behind the scenes of my latest project

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:08.680
The Lego Back to the Future Train Crash Video

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.860
The camera I'm going to be using to shoot
this video is my Casio EX FC100

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.150
The reason I chose to get this camera is because
it can take high speed video

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.960
In otherwords slow motion video

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.550
It has various options as to how slow you
want the video

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.730
But for this project I'm using it at 210 frames
per second

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.480
Which is about 7 times slow than real time

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.790
But it records that at 360p, which is quite
a low resolution

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.390
But believe it or not that's the highest resolution
this camera will take

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.960
At slow motion so that's what I've chosen
to use

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.370
So the 1st thing I had to do was build the
set

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.520
This is what I've built to support the set

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.750
It's basically some wooden planks, and then
loads of books and pieces of furniture

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.870
So the train's going to run up here

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.220
Nice long run up so it can get some good speed

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.590
And then I'm going to build some sort of trestle
bridge thing

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.000
Which will sit on here, with the train going
along here

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.130
And it will go, and fall over the edge down
there

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.920
So now I've put green blanket over the top

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.670
Hopefully it'll make it look a bit more like
a sort of railway embankment

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.139
So I'm building the trestle bridge out of
KNEX

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.060
Because it's good for building large structural
stuff

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.659
And I don't really have the bits to do it
in Lego

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.920
So I'm going to build the sort of main frame
like this

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.479
And then I'm going to put these bits along
the side at an angle

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.260
To make it look like a proper trestle bridge

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.199
And this is the finished bridge

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:23.740
I'm quite pleased with how it's turned out

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.559
I think it'll do its job considering it'll
only be on screen for a few seconds

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:31.919
So at the moment I'm filming shots which don't
require the model to hit the ground and break

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:34.079
So I've set this thing up to sort of cushion
the impact

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.899
It's just a sort of tarpaulin over some chairs
to catch it from up there

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.149
And then over here we've got a pond

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.609
So I've arranged these chairs and cushions
and things

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.479
To stop any Lego bricks going in the pond

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.340
The next thing I needed to do was build the
steam engine model used in the video

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.310
In the original movie the train you see crashing
into the valley is a 1/4 scale model

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.479
Which means it's about 4m long

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.560
But I needed to make mine to fit on the Lego
track so mine's about 1/35 scale

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.990
I built my model using Lego parts I already
had

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.599
And I was looking at pictures of the real
thing as I went on the computer

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:07.649
It's a fairly simple model

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.250
In that it doesn't need to go round any corners
and it's got limited detail

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.480
OK I'm almost ready to go

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.420
I'm just going to show you guys my final set
up

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.200
At the moment I don't have anyone to help
me at home with this project

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.370
So I need to be able to launch the train automatically
whilst being able to film

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.170
I've got this, one of the tenders from my
other engines

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.780
And that's going to propel the train off the
end

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.610
I've got the power for the track here and
that goes via this little switch

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.560
And the little switch is activated by this
motor

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.709
And the motor is connected to this battery
pack and this I.R receiver

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.310
When I flick this remote here

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.959
That switch flicks and turns on the power
for the track

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.870
And then that will send the train zooming
off the end

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.409
Now in order to make sure that thing at the
end doesn't also zoom off

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.500
Right here I've got a break in the track

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.129
So forward of this position there's no power
to the track

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.209
So that green tender will come to a stop before
the end

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.959
I've also got this cable which is attached
to the middle

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.709
And that's a sort of safety measure to stop
this thing hurtling off the edge too

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.599
Right now I'm going to do a test run with
this little truck

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.100
Rather than damaging my steam loco

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.600
So here goes

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.189
So the 1st attempt didn't go too badly

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.749
But the train was definitely going to slowly
as it went off the end

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:28.879
So I've made a few changes

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.489
This connection point here which splits the
track

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.150
I've moved further to the end

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.069
And therefore train will be powered

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.060
For more of the distance so it should be going
faster

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.120
To make doubly sure that this thing doesn't
go off the end

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.819
I've attached a new safety line to it which
is proper string

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.719
That's the prep work done, time to get filming

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.660
Well this is roughly where the model landed
on the ground

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.639
And as you can see the parts have gone absolutely
everywhere.

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.290
That's the cab down there

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.000
Bits of tender

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.320
The chassis's actually remained fairly intact,
which is expected

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.660
And bits of the boiler made it all the way
over here

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.060
So yeah, quite a mess

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.720
So I've rebuilt the model

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.090
And now I'm going to shoot some of the minor
shots for the beginning of the video

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.170
The 1st one's going to be it's going to smash
through this wooden sign

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.620
So I've got the camera set up here

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.290
Because it's on a tripod I don't have to worry
about all the automatic launch system

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.250
I can just shove the train through it with
my hand

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.950
I don't want it going out the window so I've
build this block of Lego here to stop it

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.130
So as you might have heard that didn't really
go according to plan

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.980
So I've rebuilt the engine again

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.560
And this time I've tied the track to the bridge
so that it won't come off

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.590
And also I'm going to push the engine a lot
slower

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.990
Because last time it was definitely too hard

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.330
That was all the filming done, now I just
needed to edit it

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.660
The 1st thing I did was to convert the video

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.190
So that it played back at 25 frames per second
rather than 30

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.070
Therefore slowing it down even further

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.000
I did this using software called avisynth

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.760
After that, I converted the video into wmv
format

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.940
Using Movavi video convertor

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.690
And then I edited the video, using Windows
Movie Maker version 6.1

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.180
And that's it hope you guys enjoyed the video
