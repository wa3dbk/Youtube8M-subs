00:00:01.542 --> 00:00:06.869
[funky guitar and bass music]

00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:13.805
The first step in producing 
our European face frame-less cabinet

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:16.013
is to machine the cabinet parts.

00:00:16.013 --> 00:00:19.371
And we're gonna start 
on this panel saw right here

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:23.780
which is going to allow us 
to cut the parts to a nominal size.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.535
And when I say nominal size 
I mean they're gonna be

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:29.629
a little larger 
than what they actually need to be.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:32.825
We will size them down
over on the table saw

00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:35.091
after I get them cut here.

00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:37.755
So let me tell you just a little bit 
about this saw.

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:41.535
[saw blade spinning]
whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:44.706
There are many different varieties 
of vertical panel saws.

00:00:44.706 --> 00:00:48.173
They range from, oh,
this one's probably $1,500

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:50.387
up to around $80,000.

00:00:50.387 --> 00:00:53.101
So this is on the lower end 
of the price range.

00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:55.251
This would be perfect 
for the small cabinet shop.

00:00:55.251 --> 00:01:00.167
The $80,000 models are digitally 
controlled and very precise.

00:01:00.937 --> 00:01:03.724
Again, remember we're just using this 
to nominally cut

00:01:03.724 --> 00:01:07.958
our pieces of material 
so it doesn't have to be that precise.

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.152
Let me show you some 
of the specifics

00:01:10.152 --> 00:01:12.329
of this piece of equipment.

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.449
Our material is going to sit on a bed.

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:20.126
And the bed is made up 
of rollers that roll along.

00:01:20.126 --> 00:01:22.888
So it's very easy to move your material

00:01:22.888 --> 00:01:24.796
once it's on the bed
back and forth.

00:01:24.796 --> 00:01:28.064
[rollers squeaking and rolling]

00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:33.243
We have a portable saw 
up here that is mounted

00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:37.948
on two bars that are perpendicular
to the bed

00:01:37.948 --> 00:01:42.163
so that we get a nice 90 degree cut.

00:01:42.163 --> 00:01:44.715
Just have a little knob here 
that loosens this

00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:47.160
and allows me
to move it up and down.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.278
And I can run this
up and down and cut my material

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:54.365
[saw moving on bars]

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:58.874
The saw can also be turned 
so that the blade

00:01:58.874 --> 00:02:01.016
is running horizontally.

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:05.284
The problem there is, 
is that you can't move it side to side.

00:02:05.284 --> 00:02:07.478
You have to move the material through it.

00:02:07.478 --> 00:02:12.112
So we don't use it very often 
for that operation.

00:02:12.112 --> 00:02:15.410
The last part that we need 
to talk about is the scale.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.882
It's our measuring scale 
because we have to know where

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:21.192
to put our piece of material 
on the saw to make our cuts.

00:02:21.192 --> 00:02:24.364
As you can see 
we have a scale here in inches

00:02:24.364 --> 00:02:26.433
and we have a scale here
in millimeters.

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:29.191
And on this particular project, 
the European cabinet,

00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:30.562
we're going 
to be working in millimeters

00:02:30.562 --> 00:02:33.531
so we'll be working off
of this bottom scale.

00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:38.046
We have a stop right here 
that we can move along here and put it

00:02:38.046 --> 00:02:43.186
on the exact measurement that we want
to cut on the saw.

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:47.615
So once the stop is set 
we just move our material

00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:52.541
over to the stop

00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:56.087
and make our cut.

00:02:56.087 --> 00:02:58.495
Since we're building this cabinet out 
of melamine

00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:00.674
and it's a solid material

00:03:00.674 --> 00:03:03.525
we don't really need to worry 
about the direction of grain.

00:03:03.525 --> 00:03:06.874
But, if this was wood 
and we had grain

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:10.376
which is usually going
in the long direction,

00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:12.784
we wouldn't be able
to lay our sides out

00:03:12.784 --> 00:03:14.532
like this.

00:03:14.532 --> 00:03:18.141
Because then the grain would be going
horizontally on the sides,

00:03:18.141 --> 00:03:19.782
so we'd have to rethink this.

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:23.756
But because we're using melamine 
we're able to lay it out

00:03:23.756 --> 00:03:26.776
in the best way 
to optimize our material.

00:03:26.776 --> 00:03:29.807
And what I've done here
is I've taken a four by eight

00:03:29.807 --> 00:03:32.271
sheet of melamine
like we have here,

00:03:32.271 --> 00:03:36.062
and blown it up on a piece of paper 
so that you can see how

00:03:36.062 --> 00:03:38.640
I'm gonna cut the cabinet parts out.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.197
And this is a very simple cabinet; 
we just have two sides.

00:03:42.197 --> 00:03:45.446
We have a bottom, a top,
and a shelf.

00:03:45.446 --> 00:03:47.987
And, what I'm trying 
to do is, is cut this

00:03:47.987 --> 00:03:51.716
in such a way that I have 
a minimum amount of waste.

00:03:51.716 --> 00:03:54.143
And you can see these, 
these diagonal lines here

00:03:54.143 --> 00:03:58.200
represent the waste material 
that I'm generating.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.272
To help illustrate how we're going 
to cut our cabinet parts out

00:04:02.272 --> 00:04:04.929
I wanna draw the cabinet parts 
right on this sheet

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:08.519
of melamine 
that we're gonna be cutting.

00:04:09.724 --> 00:04:12.946
So the two lines
that I've marked out in black

00:04:12.946 --> 00:04:15.081
are the two cuts 
that I'm going to make

00:04:15.081 --> 00:04:18.604
on the vertical panel saw.

00:04:18.604 --> 00:04:21.746
To further illustrate
I'm gonna draw dash lines in

00:04:21.746 --> 00:04:25.892
for the cuts that I'm going 
to be making on the table saw.

00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:33.138
Here's my side,
my other side,

00:04:33.138 --> 00:04:38.780
bottom, top,
and a shelf.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.404
[stop clicking into place]
click

00:04:40.404 --> 00:04:43.953
I've set the stop at 390 millimeters.

00:04:43.953 --> 00:04:48.663
If you remember 
our side depth was 374 millimeters.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:51.808
So I've set it oversize 
about sixteen millimeters.

00:04:51.808 --> 00:04:54.702
Remember this is a nominal cut 
that we're making here.

00:04:54.702 --> 00:04:56.239
We're cutting it oversize.

00:04:56.239 --> 00:05:00.517
We're gonna resize it down 
to the actual size on the table saw.

00:05:02.582 --> 00:05:05.994
The vertical panel saw 
is a very safe piece of equipment.

00:05:05.994 --> 00:05:09.399
Ah, most of the cutting action 
is happening behind our material.

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:11.055
But we never want
to forget about

00:05:11.055 --> 00:05:13.593
this blade that's spinning back here.

00:05:13.593 --> 00:05:17.275
Take a look there's a guard on it, 
which helps protect us.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.004
But there's a spinning blade there.

00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:23.644
[saw blade spinning]
whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

00:05:23.644 --> 00:05:27.125
The main safety tip
on the vertical panel saw

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:29.757
is to keep your hands
out of the way of the blade

00:05:29.757 --> 00:05:33.112
as it makes its motion
through the cut.

00:05:33.112 --> 00:05:35.924
And of course you always wanna wear
your safety glasses,

00:05:35.924 --> 00:05:37.867
and hearing protection.

00:05:37.867 --> 00:05:39.964
All right, so let's build a cabinet.

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:44.300
[saw blade spinning]
whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.597
Before we get started
let's review

00:05:46.597 --> 00:05:49.151
the panel saw safety guidelines:

00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:51.141
Make sure your safety glasses are on,

00:05:51.141 --> 00:05:52.698
earplugs are in place,

00:05:52.698 --> 00:05:56.054
and fingers are away
from the path of the blade.

00:05:56.054 --> 00:05:59.973
[saw blade spinning]
whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

00:06:03.131 --> 00:06:06.678
[saw blade spinning to a stop]
whirrrrrrrr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rr

00:06:06.678 --> 00:06:10.198
Even though we're cutting this material
to a nominal size,

00:06:10.198 --> 00:06:12.527
you wanna handle it with care.

00:06:12.537 --> 00:06:16.296
Melamine is very brittle
and it chips very easily.

00:06:16.296 --> 00:06:20.205
And also, I might add that, 
it can cut you very easily

00:06:20.215 --> 00:06:25.109
on the edges, so be careful 
while you're handling it.

00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:29.571
[saw blade spinning]
whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

00:06:39.882 --> 00:06:43.338
[saw blade slowing to a stop]
whirrrrrrrrrrrrrr-rr-rr-rr-rr

00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:54.182
Now we're ready 
to go over to the table saw.
