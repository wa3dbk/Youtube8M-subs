7 Tips on How to Dress Warm When Wearing Formal
Clothing Stay Warm While Dressing Sharp

00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:02.269
[0:00:00]

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:03.269
Hi!

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:04.269
I'm Antonio Centeno.

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:05.269
I'm the founder of Real Men Real Style.

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:08.870
Today, I'm going to be giving you seven tips
on how to dress warm when you're wearing formal

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.820
wear, when you're basically wearing a suit,
when you are wearing nice clothing.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.530
Let's say you're up in Winnipeg, Canada or
you're over in Toronto.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.730
You're in New York City.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.730
It is cold.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.120
In fact, the gentleman who sent me the question,
he's up in Canada.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.660
He's saying, "Antonio, it's 20 below zero
here and it's cold, and I've got to wear a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.660
suit.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.660
I've got to look nice.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.070
How can I dress warmer?" so I'm going to give
him seven tips on how he can do this.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.530
Some of these you guys may have already heard
of and I've put out infographics, but I know

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.970
some of those infographics haven't necessarily
addressed how to dress warm when you've got

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.940
to dress sharp.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.920
Point number one is going to be invest in
a heavy and long jacket.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.440
You may have to have an overcoat custom-made,
but this is going to be your key defense,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.950
that heavy jacket.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.600
Now, most overcoats out there, they're made
for I guess people down in Florida or something,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.929
but you want one that is made from a heavyweight
fabric, that is lined with a windproof material,

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:12.170
and you want it so that it buttons up all
the way that it flaps up or it basically has

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.829
the neck protectors on the side that is longer.

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.029
It should go beyond your knees because that
is going to be a big one.

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:20.070
A lot of guys, they cut it short.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.070
Maybe they go with a pea coat.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.789
Pea coats are cool, but the problem with the
pea coat is they're not very long, the same

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.359
thing with a lot of other types of jackets
out there, is that they don’t cover your

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:29.359
backside.

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:30.740
They don’t cover your thighs.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.999
If you can get a long jacket which goes well
past your knee, this is going to pay dividends

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:39.249
because when you're out there standing on
the corner and you're able to bundle this

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:45.249
thing up, it's going to protect your legs
and do a great job at that, and this is a

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:46.249
really big tip.

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:49.630
I know a lot of you guys are wondering, "Where
can I get a jacket like this?"

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.899
Over at the article at Real Men Real Style,
I'm going to link to a couple of places, but

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.750
in my experience for a lot of guys, they maybe
want to have something custom-made, but I

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.689
will try to link to some vendors who can supply
you with one.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.969
Okay, so point number two is the part that
the jacket doesn’t cover, and that is first

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.509
off, your feet.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.060
Invest in a pair of winter boots.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.720
What do I mean by winter boots?

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.280
There's a wide range out there.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.660
I'm talking a pair of zip-up boots that have
an insulation on the inside, and you should

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.660
tell they're insulated.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.980
I've worked with a company over in Berlin
called Shoepassion and I really like some

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.780
of their insulated boots.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.480
There are other companies out there that will
use different materials.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.110
The other thing to look for in a pair of insulated
boots is that they're a bit higher up off

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.280
the ground, so this may be a small difference.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.920
We're talking in some cases about a quarter
of an inch, but that quarter of an inch to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.290
half an inch can make a big difference in
the sense of distancing you and insulating

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.260
you from the very cold ground.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.900
Anyone that's had to stay at the bus stop
for half an hour, for 25 minutes in cold weather

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.150
can really appreciate this because otherwise,
that cold is going to start to seep up and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.230
you want to make sure that you are properly
insulated from this.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.030
So point number three, you want to protect
your head, you want to protect your neck,

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.820
and you want to protect your hands.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.850
Now, there are going to be some very basic
watch caps out there.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.430
If you're going to go with the watch cap,
make sure it's thicker, that it's knitted,

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.280
that you may even consider having a thinner
one that you wear underneath and then a thicker

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.280
one on top.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.950
I'm a big fan of the full ushanka and really
covering and protecting yourself, being able

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.570
to protect your ears, and having something
that at this point and when it's that cold,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.050
believe me, it's not going to really detract
too much.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.190
There are some other stylish hats and I'll
link to a few other options in the article,

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.120
but guys, this is where it's okay to be mixing
a little bit of casual with the formal jacket.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.920
Now, the other thing -- and this is where
you can keep it actually very sharp and really

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.470
bring it together -- is going for a nice scarf.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.940
Now, I'll link you to my infographic.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.931
I give you 11 ways to tie a scarf, but going
with a nice, long, cashmere scarf that you're

00:03:55.931 --> 00:04:00.250
able to wrap around that's going to really
help and protect your neck as well.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.500
Last thing about the hands, now a lot of the
formal gloves out there, they're not going

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.830
to go very far up.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.180
I'm a big fan of making sure you find a pair
of longer gloves that do a good job of covering

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.180
the wrists.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.640
I'll try to link you to a few vendors at the
article as well.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.949
After that, let's go ahead and go to point
number four, which are thermals.

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.049
There's a wide variety of thermals out there.

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.849
You want to make sure you go with something
that fits you a bit closer to the body.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.249
With casual wear, you can go with a looser
fit because usually the clothing in general

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:33.330
is looser, but with formal clothing, with
suits, you need something that's not going

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.400
to just make the suit look a bit odd because
you're trying to scrunch it in underneath.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.020
For that, I'm going to recommend a lot of
athletic wear.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.470
If you go into an athletic store, a lot of
those bit of clothing that fits really close

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.490
to your body, there are certain things like
Polartec Power Stretch out of Malden Mills.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.570
I'm a big fan of what they do.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.259
There's a company called Canyon that makes
it and I'll link over to some of their products.

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.139
If you get those and you get them to fit closer
to your body, that is going to be an awesome

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.340
insulation layer.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.340
[0:05:01]

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.300
Point number five, let's now focus in on the
core.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.169
What I mean by the core, this is going to
be your upper body and your torso and your

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.349
midsection area or basically in your ground
or your crotch area.

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.740
Some small little things you can do, wear
two pairs of underwear.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:24.300
Wear a pair of boxer briefs maybe with a pair
of briefs underneath instead of wearing boxers.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.990
Instead of wearing just one undershirt, how
about you wear two to even three undershirts?

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.460
Now, you may be saying, "In the office, I'm
going to be incredibly hot."

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.419
Well, the great thing about just focusing
on the core is that you can walk into a bathroom,

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.580
take your shirt off, and strip off one of
the layers, maybe even two of the layers.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.490
I know the double underwear theme may not
be for everybody, but I'm talking about for

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.559
guys that -- yeah, you know what I'm talking
about.

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:52.199
It's really cold and you don’t want to get
frostbite anywhere, so focus in on the core.

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.070
It really is going to keep you a bit warm,
and this is important when you can't go with

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.780
a lot of long thermal underwear because I
know the long johns for a lot of guys, it's

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.810
just too much especially when you're in a
warm office.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.990
Point number six is going to be your suits
and your shirts, maybe go with a winter weight.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.639
What do I mean by that?

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.860
Actually, you can buy suits, you can buy shirts
that are going to be a little bit heavier.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.330
That's actually wearing one of your heavy
duty shirts, one of your suits, maybe going

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.440
with flannels, going with tweets.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.860
By simply bulking up that -- maybe your trousers,
instead of going with the lightweight, why

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.990
don’t you actually invest in some gray flannel
trousers?

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.620
By doing that, if you're going to just simply
bulk up that layer and mix with everything

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.430
else we're talking about, you're really going
to be able to better retain the heat.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:42.939
The last and by far not least, you want to
be paying attention to the various types of

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:45.150
fabrics that you're purchasing.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.389
Understand the cotton.

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:47.620
Cotton is very cheap.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.819
Cotton can be found all over the world, but
cotton does not insulate heat as well as wool

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:58.449
and a number of synthetic materials which
are specifically designed to do that, and

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:02.610
I'm talking more about the thermal underwear,
so make sure you've got the right fabrics.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.919
In addition, make sure you've got the right
weaves.

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.569
There are some weaves out there which are
going to allow air to move through very easily.

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:13.569
You want to be going with twill weaves on
your shirts that are going to better retain

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:17.120
the heat and not allow air to move as easily
between.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.159
Okay, guys, those are my seven tips.

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:20.159
Hopefully you enjoy them.

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:21.371
I'll see you in the next video.

00:07:21.371 --> 00:07:22.371
Take care.

00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:23.371
Bye-bye.
