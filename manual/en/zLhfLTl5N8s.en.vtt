00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.139
One really way to get your finger picking
together is actually start

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.420
involving chords.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.710
Let's take a nice chord progression here,
a very simple

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.730
chord progression, just to work out your patterns
using chords.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.090
Let's pick
the key of D for something a little different

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.090
here today.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.640
The 3 chords that
I'm going to use is going to be D, G, and

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.739
A; those chords.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.899
Let's start off with our first pattern.

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:54.499
It's going to be thumb, index,
middle, ring.

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:58.239
The idea is to practice it with different
chords in a chord

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.359
progression so you can keep that flow going.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:11.729
At first, it may sound like
this, switching to a new chord, then new chord.

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:23.750
The idea is you want to
make it nice 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.750
and smooth.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.240
Then try different patterns.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.630
I'm going to do something a little different
here.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:42.950
I'm going to go thumb,
ring, middle, index.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.330
Then another pattern that we've talked about
before,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:55.539
which is thumb, index, middle, ring, middle,
index, middle, index.

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.130
Sounds
really complicated, but it's not really that

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.130
complicated.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:09.429
I'll play it
slow.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:33.340
Let's try slowly moving through that same
chord progression.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.760
Try out different patterns that maybe involve
. . . a 3-feel would be

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.980
great.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.050
Try exploring and making up your own patterns.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.530
It's a lot of fun.
