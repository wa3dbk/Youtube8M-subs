00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.930
let us discuss some fundamental properties
of image formation by a plane mirror.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.129
the very first property which is important
about plane mirror is here.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.330
image distance.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.500
is equal to.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.830
object distance, from mirror.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:37.260
if we just analyze a situation in which say
if we are given with a plane mirror which

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.850
is polished on 1 face, then in front of it
if we place an object.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.370
when whichever light ray from object incident
on the mirror this is reflected according

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.260
to laws of reflection. and here we can see.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.500
the light rays are reflected.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.590
in diverging manner if object is placed in
front of the mirror. and these reflected rays

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.470
appear to be coming from a point directly
behind the mirror. and say.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.980
this is the point which we can term as image
and here we can see that, this is virtual

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.010
image because.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.281
the reflected rays are diverging and we have
studied in previous section that, corresponding

00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:24.910
to diverging reflected rays these rays appear
to come from a point behind the mirror, and,

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.290
we find the intersection of these rays by
back extension.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.800
and that is considered as virtual image.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.940
now in this situation if we just use the geometry
here we can see.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.300
if this angle is i this will also be i and
correspondingly this is i and this is i. now

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.700
in this situation if this distance, and this
angle is same and both of these triangles.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.020
then we can directly state all other properties
of triangle will remain same, so if object

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.440
is located at a distance.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.369
x in front of the mirror then we can directly
write image will also be located at the same

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.640
distance x behind the mirror.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.440
so these 2 distances will always be equal
that’s why we have written here image distance

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.230
is equal to the object distance from the mirror.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.090
another important property about image formation
by plane mirror is.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.520
image formed.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.400
we are talking about plane mirror is.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.010
laterally inverted.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.620
that means if we are given with a mirror and
front of it, say an object.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.230
with the alphabetical characters a-b and c
is placed.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.519
then at the same distance behind the mirror
the image of a-b-c will be obtained but here,

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.590
c will be first that will be.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.099
the mirror image of c and then it’ll be
b and then it’ll be ay. then you can see

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:02.790
here the image this obtained is latterly,
inverted although distance of.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.749
every character, in front of.

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:06.989
mirror is same.

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.209
at which the image of the character is located
behind the mirror.

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.719
but the order gets different so because of
which the lateral inversion takes place.

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:24.669
here also we can see if. in front of a mirror
we place.

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.700
our lefthand.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.459
lefthand of any person then in that situation.

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.659
the corresponding image produced will be that
of the.

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:39.709
right hand.

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.849
this will be the righthand.

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.430
that is what we call lateral inversion in
a plane mirror.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.980
if right hand is placed on.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.489
the side in front of the mirror then the image
produced behind the mirror which is a virtual

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.779
image will appear to be that of.

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:56.779
lefthand.

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.330
vise versa.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.879
another important property about image formation
which is going to be used in various numerical

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.840
examples also.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.220
that is nature of.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.189
image.

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:14.959
is always.

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.980
opposite to that of.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.240
object.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:30.250
in this situation say if in front of a plane
mirror we place a real object which.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.720
we have already discussed that in case of
real object the incident rays are diverging.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.830
and corresponding to diverging rays.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.660
diverging reflected rays are produced and
on back extension these will produce an image

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.139
behind the mirror.

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.900
so here image produced corresponding, to the
real object will be.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.900
virtual.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.630
so here you can see.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.039
that the nature of image is opposite to that
of object-object is real image is virtual.

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:07.120
if we consider the opposite situation like
if on a plane mirror converging beam of light

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.610
is incident like this.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.970
then for a converging beam of light incident
rays will intersect at a point behind the

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.380
mirror.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.120
that can be written as virtual object.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.340
this we already discussed in the previous
section that if. incident rays are converging

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.099
object is treated as virtual.

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:33.660
now corresponding to these rays according
to laws of reflection if these are reflected,

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.659
here you can see the image this produced will
be by.

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:44.610
real intersection of reflected rays. and these
reflected rays are converging and whenever

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.330
converging rays produced an image by.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.560
real intersection of light rays this image.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.949
obtained we term as. real image.

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:01.780
so here you can see for a real object image
produce virtual and for virtual object image

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.650
produce by plane mirror is real.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.129
that’s why we say nature of image is always
opposite to that of object.
