00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.100
To go along side with the advances in our
riding abilities brought on by really high

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.210
performance suspension, we've had another
really great innovation in the mountain bike

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.910
industry in the last five to six years, which
is tubeless tires. So, just like the tires

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.040
you have on your automobile, which don't have
a tube inside of them -- they just have a

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.570
sealed tire that holds air -- we now have
tubeless bike tires. And what these tubeless

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.180
tires allow us to do, is they allow us to
have basically a more reliable -- to a certain

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.610
extent -- and more supple and efficient ride.
So here is a tubeless rim. You can see there's

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.160
no holes or anything inside of it for air
to leak out or anything like that. So it's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.850
a very efficient little structure. It's got
a valve stem built in, where you put the air

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:00.570
in. And then every manufacturer pretty much
offers both tubed and tubed-type tires. The

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.100
drawbacks of tubeless -- because there have
to be drawbacks or else I wouldn't be talking

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.430
about this -- is the fact that it is somewhat
more reliable. You can have problems with

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.670
tubeless tires that you can have with a tubed
tire, and there's these added disadvantages.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.070
So this big old downhill tire's been setup
tubeless. You can tell because there's a bunch

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.130
of Latex inside of it. What people do is they
add a couple cap fulls of like a Latex mold

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.880
builder or tire sealant -- there's a couple
companies out there that sell it -- that allow

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.100
you to seal any sort of punctures that you
might get. Because I mean -- a nail or thorn

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.220
or whatever can still go right through the
sidewall of one of these tires, rendering

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.610
it unable to hold air. Another problem that
you can have with tubeless tires, is that

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.810
if you're an aggressive rider, an extreme
cornering force can push the bead off the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.780
rim -- what we call burping the tire, and
that can let out air. Another disadvantage

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:09.829
is that a tubeless tire -- for XC use -- a
tubeless tire is going to be heavier than

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:19.129
a tubed-type tire, because you need extra
casing and enforcement, both for the -- this

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.370
has to be some sort of layer of plastic or
butal rubber inside -- that keeps it from

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.511
being porous. And then you need a little bit
more stiffness in the sidewall because you

00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:33.260
don't have a tube in it. So, it's a little
bit heavier, but you take away the weight

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.810
of the tube, and you're pretty much on par.
