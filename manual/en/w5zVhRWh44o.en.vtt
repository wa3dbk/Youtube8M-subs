00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.189
so you're thinking about being a model
actor or both. That's good.

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:09.000
it's a great industry and there are a
lot of opportunities for people who work

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.910
hard and know how to get started

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.170
so you're probably asking help do I get
started

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.810
well the two main ways are the do it
yourself

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.669
spend a bunch of money hope and pray
method or the invest a little for the

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.039
right tools and let other people help
you away

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.470
certainly we think the second option is
better but

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.270
let's not be too hasty we should examine
both this is Lisa

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.579
leases aspiring to get into the industry
so

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.410
let's see her go through the two main
ways of getting started first

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.550
that do it all yourself spend a bunch of
money hope and pray method

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.000
what this method has going for it is it
that you will feel that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.440
you have beaten all the odds when you
finally get through all the up-front

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.710
work

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.399
for success with this method Lisa will
need to

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.800
find a qualified fashion photographer
Not the person who takes the softball team photos

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.390
locate a printer who has experience
creating comp cards

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.840
Acme copy center? Not so much. Get
names and addresses for casting

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.720
directors producers and agencies

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.770
a lot of Google time. She will need to
figure out the best way to get her comp

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710
card and/or headshot delivered

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.430
male email carrier arrange

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.270
and pay for flights hotels and food to
travel to all the major cities in

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.920
follow-up

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.080
on her contacts forget the road trip you'll
look like death after a 12 hour car ride

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.420
subscribe to Facebook, MySpace, Twitter &amp;

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.800
every other networking site in hopes of
meeting someone

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.240
that she can get in audition from. Aunt Lilly's BFF will not cut it in this world

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.300
so method number one needs a lot to
work

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.960
what about the other approach the
invest a little for the right tools and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.580
let other people help you way

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.000
let's call it the One Source Talent way
for short

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.789
why don't we talk it through and see how
things compare

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.259
Lisa fills out an online application
and submits it

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.110
that's not too hard. the professionals at
one source talent

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.780
check out Lisa's application an invite
her in for an appointment

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.090
after the evaluation they decide to have
Lisa come back to the office for a final

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.730
interview

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.290
cool other people are already starting
to help her after the final interview

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.099
the one source talent pros decide that
lisa has what it takes to be in the

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.720
industry

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.940
based upon her personality and drive
they set up for a digital comp card on

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.540
the one source talent website

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.780
Wow now technology is working for Lisa

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.980

comp card and removes ones she no longer

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.750
likes

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.840
also she learns how to change your stats
if needed

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.410
cool current look and current details
beats having a stack of last year's photos

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.370
and a box of envelopes to deal with.
The other thing technology does for Lisa

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.160
is that she can print her comp card
whenever she needs one for an audition

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.200

and lisa has access to a database of
opportunities pulled together from 100's

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.910

so she can be in charge of her own
career remember

here a couple other important extras as
the one source talent member Lisa's

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.109

such as working actors models makeup

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.889

seems pretty clear to me the one source
talent way

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.570
makes a lot of sense you save time money
resources

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.759
energy and you have professionals
working to help you the other method

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.090

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.150
sad scene in a big waste of chips but
before you decide

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.110

know about one source talent one source

model search

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.699
one source talent is a company that
helps people who want to be models and

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:52.240
