Hi! This is Jerry Fishel with Vicious Cycles
in Santa Clara, Utah for Expert Village. Have

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:17.230
you ever tried to start your bike and had
absolutely nothing happen. Well a lot of times

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.079
that problem can be caused by your battery.
What we want to show you today is how to take

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.020
proper care maintenance of your battery. On
most models, your battery is under your seat.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:44.510
The first thing you want to do is take your
seat off and you have your battery. Battery

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.920
carries 12 volts and should be at least 12
volts. What I have here is a simple Ohm meter

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:04.059
or simple volt meter; also, has its own attachments.
Set your meter to DC volts; put your positive;

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:27.720
red to positive, black to negative; a healthy
battery with no load on it, no charge; 12.46

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:36.799
right now. Things that can cause problems
with your battery’s corrosion. So what you

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:57.280
want to do is check your cables for corrosion.
Always disconnect your negative cable first,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.020
make sure you have no corrosion on the end
of your cable or on the battery post. If you

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:12.860
do, take a small wire brush and brush them
off. There are companies out there that make

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:21.180
corrosive cleaners and sealers, but if you
just take regular care of your battery, everything

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.220
should be fine; you won’t need them. Do
the same from the negative as to the positive.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:45.710
To disconnect both cables be sure to tighten
your positive cable first.
