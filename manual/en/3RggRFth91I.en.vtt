On behalf of Expert Village I'm Nicole. This
one here is my chameleon. She requires the

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.230
fresh air habitats which you can purchase
at your local pet store. For a small lizard

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.159
like her, you can easily provide some sort
of habitat which is usually easy to find at

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:23.650
your pet stores. If not they can usually special
order you something like this, they do require

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.009
the fresh air habitats. So you need to make
sure that this is something you are able to

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.250
provide before you purchase a chameleon. Now
what I have in the bottom, there is a moss

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.420
mix. It's a dried moss but it does good for
catching her feces or absorbing any of the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.660
moisture that is coming out. In the back there,
she's got a fountain. Chameleons don't recognize

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.670
still water so they need to have sort of moving
water either by mist that collects on the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.449
leafs of the artificial plants that we keep
in the cage or by a water fill such as that

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.220
one. She also has this stick that she's climbing
on; she spends her next to no time on the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.960
ground. She really likes to be up in the trees
is where they usually spend most of their

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.770
lives in the wild. So I provided her with
that stick and plenty of areas to walk around

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.190
to. And that fake foliage there helps feel
as though she is a little more secure in her

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.180
environment. She also has that little dish
on the bottom of her cage which I put her

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.390
meal worms in. But for the most part she likes
to eat crickets. They also do eat some plants

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.060
so those are some things you can consider
putting in your terrariums such as ficus.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.200
For lighting on top, consist of a strip light
which provides her with UVA and UVB rays which

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.700
I need to supplement her with because she
does not get enough sunlight where she is.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.201
She also doesn't get a lot of supplements
due to the fact that she eats a lot of crickets

00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:58.890
which are a little bit harder to sprinkle
with the powder. She also has the basking

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.630
light because the strip light does not provide
any heat; she has the basking light on during

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.229
the day too which she is sitting under right
now. She likes to be able to warm up for the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.250
good part of the afternoon. She'll sit under
that light and then in the evening time the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.500
strip light and the basking will turn off
and her night light will come on. For her

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.840
I use the moon globe bulbs. They are a blue
ball that mimicks the moonlight so it really

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.506
doesn't disturb her day/night patterns either
but it does provide heat for her to be warm

00:02:29.506 --> 00:02:36.110
enough heat for her to be warm enough during
the cool night hours.
