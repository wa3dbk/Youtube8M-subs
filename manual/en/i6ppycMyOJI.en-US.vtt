Hello
Today I will show how to setup 
chroma key with ease

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.370
1- Use two lights for character and one light
for background if possible

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.850
2- Use also back light for character
3- Try not let any shadows around the green background
 .4- Character must stand in the middle 
between the camera and the background .

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.930
now lets go to video editing :
1-put 
the movie in the time line .

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.230
2- choose effect menu then keying then keylight
.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.620
3- Take 
the screen colour of the green background
.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.230
4- Adjust the movie with 
screen balance 
and gain
5- Adjust the edges with blur and softness
