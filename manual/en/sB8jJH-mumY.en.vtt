00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.500
When you see the Tour of Flanders, Paris Roubaix,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.167
and those classic races with
cobbles and holes and gravel stuff,

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:23.400
they are different because there's something
not like normal road where you can cruising.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.067
There's just something more about those races.

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:39.467
We've been working with Fabian Cancellara specifically
on trying to develop technologies that help him go faster.

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:43.567
He just says, guys, I want to
go smoother over the cobbles.

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:48.534
You know, I want to be able to ride longer, faster,
harder, and I don't want to give anything up.

00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:55.133
The great thing about those things that Fabian
wants is is every cyclist associates with those.

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:59.734
Every cyclist wants to ride smoother, be
more comfortable, have better stability,

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:03.200
and get the best power transfer possible out of their bike.

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:06.534
The Domane is a full-on race bike.

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:09.734
It's the endurance complement to
the Grand Tour winning Madone.

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:17.067
The Trek Domane is really three main technologies.

00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:25.801
Those technologies are IsoSpeed, Power
Transfer Construction, and endurance geometry.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:36.734
What we wanted to focus on was how the body
vibrates on a bicycle, and we saw that, you know,

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:42.334
an eyeball vibrates at 30 to 60 hertz,
and your hands vibrate at 20 hertz.

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:47.267
So when you're out on a ride, you can kind
of feel those bumps and that vibration.

00:01:50.267 --> 00:01:56.968
IsoSpeed is a way to take the energy that
goes into a frame, or into a bicycle at the axle,

00:01:56.968 --> 00:02:00.868
and dissipate it without actually
getting it straight into your body.

00:02:00.868 --> 00:02:06.634
We do that by allowing the seat tube to flex and also
isolate the flex from the frame so you're not affecting

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:11.634
any of the handling characteristics.

00:02:11.634 --> 00:02:15.601
We went through multiple iterations,
and we finally landed on IsoSpeed.

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:21.467
On a decoupler of the seat tube from the rest of
the bike in order to gain some more compliance.

00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:25.500
The amazing thing was when we took it into the lab and
we had some of the first prototypes and we started

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.033
actually doing the measuring, where we put a
load on the saddle and we measured deflection,

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:32.868
similar to what a rider would do if they hit a large bump.

00:02:32.868 --> 00:02:37.534
We found that we had basically doubled that compliance,

00:02:37.534 --> 00:02:40.968
which meant that then you could hit a
bump the same size and feel half as bad,

00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:44.300
or you could hit a bump twice the size and feel no worse.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:52.868
Engineers can get caught up in
analysis and graphs and stuff like that,

00:02:52.868 --> 00:02:58.968
where it's actually important for us to get out there
and test with people to kind of see that

00:02:58.968 --> 00:03:03.334
what we think in our heads actually
translates to what they feel on the bike.

00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:07.200
They bring out the riders, and there's Fabian.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.400
And I'm a cyclist myself, and to be able to meet
Fabian and then talk to him was really kind of a treat.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.234
So you're a little nervous as you hand this bike
off, and he gets on it, and he swings the leg over,

00:03:15.234 --> 00:03:18.067
and he starts riding up and down the cobbles.

00:03:18.067 --> 00:03:20.100
And he's kind of a hard person to tell.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.000
You look at his face, and he doesn't say anything.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.901
And then finally he stops, and he swings a leg off the
bike, and he gets this big smile on his face, and he says,

00:03:26.901 --> 00:03:30.334
you know what, that's the bike
I want to ride in Paris Roubaix.

00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:39.767
We knew we had a great technology in the IsoSpeed,
but we also knew that that's not the whole story.

00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:46.434
We also wanted to see what happens in the front end of
the bike, and that was a much different problem to solve.

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:47.767
We started looking at forks.

00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:51.734
And again, we didn't want to lose some of
the great, crisp handling from the Madone,

00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:55.133
so we kept the E2 oversized headset.

00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:57.667
And we said, okay, what can we
do to the fork to make it better?

00:03:57.667 --> 00:04:04.667
And we actually came up with the IsoSpeed fork, which
has a greater curvature and a little bit more rake.

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:09.367
So you still have the great handling, but
we've been able to put in a larger curvature,

00:04:09.367 --> 00:04:10.934
and that curvature gives you greater compliance.

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:18.801
The second thing that makes the Trek Domane
special is the Power Transfer Construction.

00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:23.067
We were able to leverage a lot of the ideas and concepts.

00:04:23.067 --> 00:04:25.434
We have the BB90, we have E2 system.

00:04:25.434 --> 00:04:29.534
That's a culmination of a lot of technologies
that make sure that every pedal

00:04:29.534 --> 00:04:33.467
stroke that you put into the bike goes directly to the road.

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:41.868
The last thing that really makes the Trek Domane
special is the all new endurance geometry.

00:04:41.868 --> 00:04:44.434
Again, we didn't want to lose the
great handling of a Madone,

00:04:44.434 --> 00:04:47.200
but we really wanted to make the bike even better.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.334
So when you're doing those six-, seven-hour-long, epic
rides, the bike wants to steer for you a little bit better.

00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:57.067
One of the things we did is we added
a little bit of length to the chain stays.

00:04:57.067 --> 00:05:01.834
What this does is it makes the wheel base
a little bit longer, a little more stable.

00:05:04.067 --> 00:05:06.901
We accomplished some of the larger
things that we wanted to accomplish,

00:05:06.901 --> 00:05:11.300
but we knew that developing a really great
bike, we had to focus on the details,

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.467
and that's where the 3S chain keeper was born.

00:05:14.467 --> 00:05:19.300
You know, we knew if we could keep the chain on
in all conditions and really enhance that shifting,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.667
we could keep the rider from having a chain drop
in that key moment that might cost them the win.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.400
When Trek engineers approached Bontrager
with the Domane frame, we thought,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.601
how could we contribute to this project.

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:41.868
So we focused on the contact points and how
we could develop a better riding handlebar.

00:05:41.868 --> 00:05:49.534
The IsoZone bar utilizes integrated pads in both the
tops and the drops that help to maximize comfort,

00:05:49.534 --> 00:05:55.901
minimize that road vibration, without
growing the overall diameter of the bar.

00:05:55.901 --> 00:06:03.267
The end result is a better ride quality and eliminating
the use for gel inserts or having to double wrap the bar.

00:06:05.734 --> 00:06:10.868
If we can produce a product that is
so good that when Fabian says,

00:06:10.868 --> 00:06:13.801
I knew where I wanted to be and now I'm there,

00:06:13.801 --> 00:06:19.367
that experience for him is going to be
ten times better for the consumer.
