00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:06.049
So, now you have a kid entering high school.
Oh, my goodness, can that be scary. I'm Debbie

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.120
Noah, and I'm here to help you with some tips,
on making that transition from middle school,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.870
junior high, to high school. It can be scary,
but it can also be very exciting. First of

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:24.760
all, as always, from kindergarten to college,
talking positively to your child about what's

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.210
getting ready to happen, the new school year,
how exciting it is, all of the changes that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.249
are going to happen, and how they're preparing
for their future. I cannot stress how important

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:39.780
that is, even at this age. Getting ready for
high school, involves a lot more things, than

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.500
the elementary school. They're making huge
transitions. They're entering some classes

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.710
that are college level. They are having to
face peer pressure, learning to deal with

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.769
a schedule, and time maintenance. As always,
when your child enters a new building, it's

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.190
really good to go up there with them. Now,
in high school, they may want to go by themselves.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.500
That's ok, but they need to get familiar with
the lay of the school, find out where their

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.369
locker is, practice their combination. Even
though they've done it in middle school, it's

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.719
still important, finding where their classes
are. You as parents and kids need to go to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.479
their curriculum nights, or their open houses,
that they have usually the first or second

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.790
week of school. You get to meet all their
teachers. You get to see what their curriculum

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.310
is like, and get an idea of what they're doing
every day at school. When you're doing school

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.000
supplies, it's still important to make sure
your child has everything they need, to be

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.619
ready for school. I cannot stress the importance
of that. When you're buying school supplies

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.119
for elementary school, it's a little different.
In high school, more than likely, you're not

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.100
going to buy all of their supplies, until
they've met all their classes, because each

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.820
teacher has something specific, they want
them to buy. A special kind of spiral, a special

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.979
kind of composition book, a special calculator
for math or science class, so it's really

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.399
important. What I would do, and what we did
with our kids, they had a pen, and they had

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.939
a spiral notebook. They took notes on what
they needed to buy, and then we went and bought

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.410
the school supplies. Backpack, super important.
Of course, as they get older, they get bigger,

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.270
and they get very big in high school. A lot
of backpacks are designed for laptops. This

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.380
one is designed for a laptop. A lot of high
schoolers, and especially college bound kids,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.620
are probably going to have a laptop. A great
place to keep it in the backpack, and of course,

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.100
they have books that weigh 5000 pounds, that
they need room for, also. Lunch boxes, most

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.460
of the time kids don't take lunch boxes to
school, but if they want one, I'd suggest

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.400
getting an insulated one. Lots of spiral notebooks,
laptops of course, dictionaries and thesaurus's,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.740
planners and organizers. I can't stress the
importance of that. Kids in high school need

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.450
to learn how to manage their time, and one
of the best ways, is keeping up with their

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.510
assignments, with the organizer. High schooler
can be scary. It can be scary for you as a

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.560
mom and dad, and it can be scary for the kids,
but it doesn't have to be. I'm Debbie Noah,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.950
and that is sure some ways to get your high
school kids started in a positive way.
