00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello everybody this is William Amzallag

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I want to welcome you into our 2nd episode of Jeunesse Longevity TV

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I have some good news for you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Everyday our life is extended by 6 hours more, Yes 6 hours more

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
a 25% increase!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
within 100 years between 1900 and 2000

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
we jumped from 45 years average lifespan to almost 85 years. Why?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600
Because we have better health!

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.600
But what means having a better health?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.599
This word: HEALTH is so important for us

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.599
that we really need to understand his meaning!

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:14.599
Health has always been a major concern of all societies

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:22.599
he ancient Greeks believed that health was the result of a perfect physical balance

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:28.599
For the Indians, being healthy means being in harmony with Nature

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:39.600
The ancient Chinese believe that health is a reflection of vital energy, they call it Chi

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.599
The Western approach focus mainly on diseases and their treatments

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:57.599
and with this concept, based on science and experimentation, millions of lives have been saved and life expectancy has increased drastically

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:03.599
This spectacular increase brought our society to a new way of thinking

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.500
not any more based on treating diseases or on saving life, but more on quality of life.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.180
For most people health means ”No disease”

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.659
"I'm not sick so I'm healthy"

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.740
This is wrong!

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:36.259
All chronic diseases take years to become detectable, and it is our genes, our potential overweight, our eating habits

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:47.099
Our physical, mental and emotional conditions that will affect in a positive or negative way our health status.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:56.900
But this is not enough to define health. Scientists need one more criteria

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.000
How quantifying health?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.539
How defining specific criteria that will allow us to say :

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:07.699
"I ​​am healthy"

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.780
or, "I am in very good health"

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.219
or "I am in perfect health."

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.479
To quantify health, scientists have approached the problem in another way:

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:31.180
they studied how our bodies should react when subjected to changes or to stress

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:42.300
They were looking for our ability and for our speed to return to normal after change or after stress

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.780
They called this ability: "homeostasis"

00:03:48.259 --> 00:04:00.899
Homeostasis is defined as the “ability of our body to maintain a state of stability, despite the constant changes within his environment"

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.039
This is the scientific definition.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.840
In order to understand this fundamental concept let our imagination wander

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:23.800
Suppose we all born ... on a steel cable stretched between two tower buildings;

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:35.300
our parents and their parents were acrobats and live permanently, twenty-four hours a day, on this cable.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:48.819
To avoid falling, they must constantly reach a dynamic balance which will involve not only hundreds of muscles

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:55.439
in their body, but also all their functions and their five senses.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:03.620
Their brain will evaluate their strategic choices and their emotions

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:11.840
should be managed if danger threatens them …..And this is permanent ... twenty-four hours a day, with no break!

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.300
This is homeostasis

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:24.479
Life is an ongoing battle between two opposite but complementary forces,

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:35.020
on one hand, we have activating forces which facilitate biochemical reactions, stimulate energy expenditure,

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:46.180
and on the other hand we have sleeping forces, which will slow down all biochemical reactions and energy expenditures.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:52.479
The objective is to reach a state of alternation between rest and activity

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.160
Homeostasis is the appropriate response to permanent change;

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.960
and permanent change is the core of life.

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:10.259
Our body is faced with thousands of changes per second

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.800
and quickly regain its balance.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:20.080
Losing this adaptability will lead to diseases and to aging.

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.500
So, finally, how can we define health?

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:31.899
Health today is defined by the adaptability of our body to permanent changes.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:39.779
This adaptability is achieved through a complex but coherent organizational system,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.600
which results in a dynamic, but constantly challenged, equilibrium.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:57.900
The progressive decline of this delicate balance will lead to the slowdown in our body performances

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:04.800
and consequently to the onset of diseases, including aging.

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:11.039
Jeunesse understand the importance of homeostasis

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:19.220
and is targeting every product on its ability to contribute in reestablishing the balance

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:26.160
For instance Reserve will help DNA to repair counterbalancing DNA damages

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:34.479
Finiti will contribute to relenghten telomeres to counterbalance telomere shortening…

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.879
This is Jeunesse Generation Young!

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.200
My name is William Amzallag ….and I am Generation Young!

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:46.379
Thank you and see you for our next episode
