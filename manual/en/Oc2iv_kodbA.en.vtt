00:00:00.108 --> 00:00:04.999
For today's video, I'm gonna share how I give
myself a nice little glow using makeup.

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:08.678
So, the first thing I do is apply a bronzer
all over the face.

00:00:08.678 --> 00:00:10.138
I just want to warm up my face.

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:12.609
I haven't been into contouring lately.

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.119
I'm just kind of over it.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.939
So, I've been just bronzing up the face and
bringing back from color.

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.559
So, I'm just applying this to the sides of
my cheeks, around my temples, my forehead

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:23.559
and around the jawline.

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:30.899
Then I went ahead applied a little bit of
that same bronzer to my nose area.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.029
I'm not really trying to contour much, I just
want to add a little bit of definition to

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:37.029
my nose.

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:40.169
Just because around the bridge area, its kind
of flat.

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:44.669
And then, I'm going to take a blush, it's
either between this one in the color papaya

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:50.109
or guava — and I like to use the same brush
that I used for the bronzer onto the apples

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.899
of my cheeks.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.389
I also went ahead and put that color around
my forehead and at the tip of my nose just

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:01.529
to blend everything together.

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:03.379
And then I wanted to share two different highlights.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.849
So my first one is from city color cosmetics,
this is the sunlight trio collection 1.

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:13.429
And I'm taking a blush brush from elf and
i'm applying this on the high points of my

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:19.019
cheekbones and i'm going to take it above
my brow, just to lift my face a little bit.

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:24.209
But this is the first highlight that I like
to use and I've been using this a lot in my

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.209
videos.

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:26.209
And you guys seem to like it.

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:27.209
That's the first one…

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.629
And the second one, I just acquired not to
long ago.

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:36.438
This is a diamond glow powder; I'm just going
to apply this with another blush brush.

00:01:36.438 --> 00:01:39.979
And at the high points of the cheeks and of
course, above the brow.

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.719
And this has more of a pink type of rose gold
tone, rather than the sunlight trio, it's

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.819
more of a gold tone.

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.179
And then, I'm gonna make sure that I apply
it to the tip of my nose, to lift my nose

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.649
a little bit and to the cupids bow.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.258
