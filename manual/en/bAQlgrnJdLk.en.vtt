What is this John Boehner lawsuit? John Boehner
is trying to do something that has never been

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.459
done before. He's trying to have the House
of Representatives institutionally sue President

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:16.650
Obama. What's weird is that the particular
nature of the suit is John Boehner demanding

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.380
that Obama enforce a law that John Boehner
doesn't like more stringently. John Boehner

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.919
wants to repeal all of Obamacare. He wants
to repeal pretty much every part of Obamacare

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.999
and there's one part of Obamacare that Barack
Obama delayed for a year, this employer mandate

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:34.550
-- the part where employers would have to
insure their employees or pay a penalty, at

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.190
least if they have enough workers who aren't
ensured. If John Boehner won his lawsuit,

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.510
the outcome of that would be that President
Obama would have to more quickly implement

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.719
a part of a law that John Boehner does not
want implemented at all. Does that seem weird

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:56.719
to you. What could it be about? John Boehner
was a member of Congress in 1998. He watched

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.859
Republicans lose an election they were supposed
to win because they hated Clinton so much

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.970
that they impeached him over the objections
of the American people. They made themselves

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.720
look crazy. He watched Speaker Newt Gingrich
resign because of that loss. John Boehner

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.430
knows impeachment fever is rising in the Republican
party. There are books being written about

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.940
why Barack Obama should be impeached. Calls
coming from conservative activists. Sarah

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.150
Palin. So maybe John Boehner is giving them
a way to safely release a little bit of tension,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.550
a way to get it all out. What's interesting
about this lawsuit is he is not just bringing

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.890
it. He's bringing it to the House. He wants
to have a long drawn-out process where the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.780
House of Representatives decides whether or
not to join his lawsuit against President

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.560
Obama. It's almost like an impeachment process
where they come down on the floor and they

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.380
go on every TV show and they make the case,
except at the end of making that case what

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.130
happens is not impeachment. What happens at
the end of making that case is not that Republicans

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.030
do something extremely stupid, it's that they
do something that is just kind of probably a waste of time.
