00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.080
Today we are going to make a sweet dish - "Thor"

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:21.220
For that we need 250 gms of Maida - roasted with 3 TBSP of Ghee

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.340
Water

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.760
and Sesame - 1 TSP

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.020
First knead dough for making Thor

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:59.120
Add little water at a time and  knead medium dough using these ingredients

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.920
Dough is ready

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.500
Now we will make small &amp; thick puries from this dough like this

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.540
prick it with the help of fingers so that Thor do not puff up

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.460
now we will fry thors in ghee

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.300
fry on low flame until they get light pink in color

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.040
Now we will prepare sugar syrup for Thor

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:00.160
Add 1 bowl of Sugar and 1/2 bowl of water(as per need) in pan

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.420
Cook until it gets three thread consistency

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.160
Now sugar syrup is ready

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:00.220
Now dip Thors in syrup and take them out in greased plate

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:24.860
After taking them out, instantly sprinkle Cardamom powder and finely chopped dry fruits on Thors

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.400
