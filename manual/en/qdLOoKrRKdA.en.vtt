00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:06.110
Alright today I’m going to show you how
to replace the volume, mute and power button

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.660
flex cable for the iPhone 5.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.900
All the parts and tools will be listed in
the video description below.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.840
Take out the bottom two screws on the phone.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.270
They’re a pentalobe screw.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.390
And then most of the time you can use suction
cup to pull away the screen from the rest

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.390
of the body.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.770
My suction cup sucked at sucking so I’m
going to show you how to do it a different

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.770
way.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.140
Take a metal pry tool and slip it between
the frame and the screen of your phone.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.430
Only pry up on the plastic frame of the phone
or else you will crack your screen and destroy

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.430
everything.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.000
So be very very careful with that.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.139
Pry up very gently and then when you open
up your phone, don’t open it past 90 degrees

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:47.899
or else you’ll rip some ribbon cables which
I’ll show you in a second.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.839
Take these three screws out and then remove
the metal bracket.

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:58.690
And then these ribbon cables right here just
unclip like Legos and there are three of them.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.989
Unsnap them all and your screen can be removed
from the rest of the phone.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.850
There are two screws holding on your battery
cable.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.869
Remove that bracket.

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.400
And the most important piece of advice I can
give you during this is keep organized.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.630
Make sure all of your screws stay next to
the brackets that they came from.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.329
And, you know, maybe put them on a piece of
paper and write down where they came from

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.320
as well so you don’t lose them.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.210
The battery is a doosy to get out.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.259
The longer you’ve had your phone, the more
time the glue has had to stick it to the back

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.979
of the phone.

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.149
So it’s getting pretty hard now that the
phone’s been out for a while.

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.950
I took my pry tool and just kind of slid it
underneath and popped the battery out.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.799
And then this is the part that we’re replacing.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.329
It’s very easy to unsnap from the motherboard.

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.119
The only unfortunate part is there’s still
a piece of it underneath the motherboard,

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.920
so the motherboard has to come out.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.549
We’re going to start over here in the corner
though with the vibrating motor.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.140
There are two screws holding on a little bracket.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.969
Take those screws out and then remove the
bracket.

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:59.969
Once again, stay organized.

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.090
Keep the screws next to the little holes that
they came out of.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.030
I put mine on another piece of paper and kind
of label it.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.440
There’s a screw holding the vibrator itself
into the top edge of the phone.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.510
And then this is the vibrator.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.670
You can see every time you get a text message
or a phone call, this little guy spins around

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.480
alerting you that you have a notification.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.840
Then there’s another screw holding down
another little metal bracket on the motherboard.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.069
Put that on your little piece of paper.

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:34.560
And then the flex cable for the charging port
can come undone as well as the little wire

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.569
cable for the cellular antenna.

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.060
Pull those out of your way and then there
are these two tiny little wire cables which

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.069
I’m still not exactly sure what they do.

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.709
They seem kind of pointless cuz they are going
from the same board to the same board.

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.590
I guess Apple just ran out of room for things
actually on the board.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.480
Anyway, 5 screws holding on the motherboard
and then there are two screws up by the camera

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.519
bracket.

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.780
Remove the camera bracket.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.780
Stay organized.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.890
Keep those screws next to the bracket itself.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.340
And remove the SIM card.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.960
You can also do this before you take apart
your phone; I would actually recommend doing

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.680
that.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.230
Then there are two screws, kind of grounding
screws holding the motherboard in place as

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.230
well.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.120
Make sure you undo those before you try to
move the motherboard or else you’ll rip

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.170
them.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.560
Then the wifi antenna is actually attached
to the back of the motherboard; unclip that

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.819
and the motherboard is free to go.

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.140
You can see both sides of it there.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.550
And the wifi antenna is what I’m removing
right now.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.439
There’s a little metal bracket that just
kind of sits on the back of the phone.

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.939
I’m going to lift it up and then I’m going
to use my pry tool to kind of get underneath

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.700
it so I don’t rip it.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:07.380
Just going to separate the glue from the actual
ribbon cable itself, and pull it up away from

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.380
the phone.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.040
And that’s what it looks like; pretty simple
little part.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.260
Then there are two screws holding on another
little bracket up by the power cable.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.660
Get that little guy out of your way.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.830
And then there’s one screw holding the power
button bracket closed to the top of the frame.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.380
You can see that it doesn’t open up all
the way because our little ribbon cable that

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.690
we’re replacing is in the way.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.660
But basically unpeel it from the back of the
power button itself and then you can pull

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.430
it out from underneath the power button door.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.390
Then there’s also two little brackets holding
on the volume and the mute buttons.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.610
So take off those three screws and then peel
the brackets away from the edge of the phone.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.670
And then you can lift up the actual ribbon
cable itself; the little flex cable.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.850
That little part up at the top there is what
controls the vibrating motor.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.480
Pull those away from the edge of the phone
itself and then you have to pull off the ribbon

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.100
cable from the little brackets.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.290
Remember the orientation of the ribbon cable
from the brackets as well so you can put it

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.740
back on the same way that it came off.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.090
You can see the buttons right there.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.280
And you can see how the ribbon cable is stuck
to the bracket itself.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.190
The mute button was a little bit harder; I
ended up using a little razor to kind of pop

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.640
that out and away from the metal bracket.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.710
And then you can see on the part itself that
it has a bunch of new little sticky tabs so

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.720
you can use those to stick it back to the
metal bracket and put your phone back together.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.560
Anyway, if I helped you the best thing you
can do for me is just subscribe to my channel.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.350
I enjoy making videos and I hope this video
helped you.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.990
Thanks for watching!
