00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.219
Hi, Robin here, with another practice tip.
This tip is for anybody who's really struggling

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.420
striking their iron shots solid. Perhaps you're
hanging back on your right foot or you're

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.000
releasing the club early scooping at impact.
You're getting contacts which are inconsistent,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.769
heavy shots, thin shots. When you do happen
to strike the ball well you'll get a high

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.280
ball flight, not much penetration, you'll
lose a lot of distance.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.100
So if this is you, what I want you to do is
get yourself in a fairway bunker, hopefully

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.620
your driving range has got a fairway bunker
to practice from. If not, get out on the golf

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.329
course late at night, drop some balls in the
bunker, do a few practice swings like I'm

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.920
going to show you.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.219
What I want you to do is draw a line in the
sand, addressing the line where your normal

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.730
ball position would be. Now simply what I
want you to do is make some practice swings,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:10.490
practicing striking the sand after the line.
To do that you'll have to be moving differently

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.180
to what you have been. You'll automatically
be shifting your weight to your left foot,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.729
you'll be maintaining the slag angle coming
down, with your hands more in front of the

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.990
ball at impact or in front of the line at
impact. Become sensitive to the pressure in

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.340
your hand. As you're holding the slag angle
you'll feel more pressure on the inside of

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:41.650
your index finger for longer. So try to become
sensitive to what you're doing to strike the

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.270
sand after the line.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.939
Now simply when you become comfortable with
that, go ahead, put a ball in the sand on

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:01.380
the same line, and just again try to focus
on striking the sand after the golf ball.
