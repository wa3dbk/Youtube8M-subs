Yeah I know Rokform came onboard...

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.220
A great group of guys down there, coming out with some really innovative products, with the iPhone and iPad and stuff.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.580
And this is a great fit.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.400

We got a new addition.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.780
We got Brendan Davids who's going to be our U 23 riders.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.540
Kind of a protege of Bernie Standar, former our U23 world champ.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.739
We have Monique Pua Mata

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.149
She's the 24 hour women's solo champ and she's the current marathon women's pro champ.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.929
Actually just came by here today to pick some stuff up, and, really killer little headset mount there,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.440
that taps into the top of your stem, right there and yeah the guys want me to put it through the paces.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.480
Time to get serious now.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.940
I'm in the middle of testing some Rokform stuff.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Can you hear me?

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.000
You could make the video bro.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.760
Hold on.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.940
What are you doing?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.760
You'll see

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.720
Rokform makes cases for the iPhones.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.440
Look up Rokform, R-O-K-F-O-R-M

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.960
Alright buddy, I hear you...

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.080
I'm talking to you on the iPhone.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.880
While riding.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.980
Alright catch you bud.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.440
Rokform holding up good.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.460
Built Rock Solid

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.700
