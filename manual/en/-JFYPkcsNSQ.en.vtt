Hi, I'm KC from G free foodie, and I'm
going to show you how to make an

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.769
incredibly delicious and really easy mixed
berry crumble using Schar's gluten free

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.750
honey Grahams. You're gonna love it.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.470
First, I've got a pint, maybe a little
more, of blueberries, and I've taken some

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.820
fresh strawberries and cleaned
them, you can use whatever kind of

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.790
berries you want to use. You also need to
taste your berries and if they aren't

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.070
really sweet, if you're not in the prime
of summer, maybe throw like 2 teaspoons

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.190
of sugar in here. Then I'm going to take
some tapioca starch, you could use corn

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.840
starch if you want to, but I just think
tapioca tastes cleaner, and the juice of

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:09.270
half of an orange and the zest of that
whole orange, no white, so we don't want

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.580
any of the orange pith, just the zest, and
we're gonna mix this all together

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.020
and to get it fully incorporated. And you
want to make sure that all the sliced

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:27.330
sides of the strawberries have been
touched by the mix, as the berries start

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.080
to give off their juice, that tapioca
starch is gonna help that all jell

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.759
together and it's gonna be delish.

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:44.459
Totally easy. Now I'm just gonna take
this berry mixture and put it into

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.539
ramekins that I've sprayed with a little
bit of pan spray, or you can use coconut

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:55.649
oil if you wanted to, if you have the
taller ramekins that will work too just

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.200
as well. So you just want like a 10 ounce
ramekin.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.120
Okay, now if you didn't already, you want
to preheat the oven to 350, and I've got

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.690
the same bowl that I mixed the berries
in. You'll see there's a little bit of

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.860
the orange juice with the tapioca starch
and the rind left in here, that's cool,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.070
that's what we want. So, I've taken the
Schar honey grams and I beat them up, you

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.910
can work out your kitchen aggression
doing that, there's eight, you want

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.920
eight or nine crackers, and then I've
added... I have some chopped pecans, if you

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.610
don't want to use nuts, that's totally
cool, or if you want to use pumpkin seeds,

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.320
that will work as well. Then I'm going to
take the juice of the other half of the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.850
orange, and this is some coconut oil. You
could use butter if you want to, I

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.790
actually like the flavor of coconut oil
in this and it makes it dairy free, and

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.480
we're just gonna mix that all together
and try to get in those little bits of

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:22.870
orange. This is gonna become the topping
for our crumble, and then I'm just gonna

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:33.250
space the crumble topping evenly among
each of the dishes. So easy. These are going

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.299
into a 350 degree oven for 30 to 35
minutes, you want the crumble topping to

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.400
start to brown and the fruit to get all
bubbly and delicious.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.480
Okay, the berry crumble is out of the
oven and it's cooled, Of course, so I can

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:56.860
pick it up. This is amazing with whipped
cream or a little bit of vanilla bean

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.380
ice cream. Can't wait to try it!

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.220
So delicious. This is the other way to
eat graham crackers, the first way being

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.260
s'mores of course. See you later!

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.239
