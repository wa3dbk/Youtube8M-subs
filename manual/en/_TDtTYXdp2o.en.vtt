00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.080
Kevin Weiss from Body Performance.net this
is the last deadlift variation I am going

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.700
to film and then I will move onto

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.599
other exercises and exercise variations.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.539
So this is deadlift from blocks... we have
done deadlift from deficit where you

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.609
are standing on the blocks to raise you up
so the bar is lower then it normally would

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.119
be so this is esentially the

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:32.670
opposite where I have set the barbell up on
some platforms so it's about 4 inches up off

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.870
the ground and that puts the bar

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.640
at about mid shin level or just below the
knee level as opposed to if you were in the

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.210
regular bottom position that puts

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.380
you about mid shin or slightly below.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.390
So you use this variation with people that
are maybe just starting learn the deadlift

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.640
or are having flexibility issues and they
can't get themselves down into the proper

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.530
position when they try and get down

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.960
to the bar and if they're not flexible enough
in the hamstrings and stuff they'll start

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.670
to round as they try and get down into

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.190
that position and so by bringing the bar up
a little bit higher for them to get them started

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.690
off you can get them pulling

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.450
from a proper position and you then as you
increase their strength and flexibility you

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.280
can get them down to the proper

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.210
position and it usually doesn't take very
long to do that progession.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.210
So that would be for someone just starting
out or

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.650
has limited mobility for whatever reason maybe
coming back from an injury... you use whatever

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.990
tools you need at the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.990
time.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.090
For those of us trying to build strength some
of us would have the misconception as this

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.380
is up higher off the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.610
ground it's actually going to be easier and
for some people it will be they'll be able

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.159
to pull more weight off the ground in

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.120
this position but there's going to be a lot
of people too that find they can pull less

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.270
from this position because when the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.910
bar is started on the ground where it normally
is your legs are much more bent and that allows

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.390
you to get more leg drive

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.020
off of the floor and then continue that momentum
through.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.900
So if someone is a good fast puller off the
floor and can drive

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.240
hard with their legs they can get through
that mid sticking point right around the knee

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.450
region.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.140
Other people if they are

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.110
not particularly fast off the floor or they
don't push as hard as they could with their

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.150
legs, they're going to find when they

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.280
get into that position that they're not as
strong through the middle there either so

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.990
when you pick the bar off the floor like

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.930
this and put it on the blocks and then they
try and pull it then their leg drive momentum

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.849
is basically been taken away so

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:01.349
instead of having the bar down here and being
able to drive it with the legs more, now it's

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.890
here so your legs are much

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.720
straighter right off the very start.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:15.050
So the lower back and the hips take a lot
more of the strain so if someone gets to this

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.860
position and lifts it up on the blocks like
this and realizes that they're a lot weaker

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.270
in this position then that's a weak link

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.900
in their chain they can work on.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.319
If they could strengthen up the upper part
of the lift and they will get a good carry

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.319
over

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.960
for pulling off the floor.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.400
It might be something worth while giving a
try if you're a beginner and you need that

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.260
extra bit of

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.640
mobility work on that to get yourself down
to the floor if you're someone who has been

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.319
doing deadlifts for awhile and

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.720
maybe come to a little bit of a plateau and
you're looking for something to push you through,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.290
maybe set it up like this

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.849
and then try the ones where you're pulling
from a defict where you're standing on the

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.220
block see how your strength level

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.760
is there then get the bar up a little bit
and see how your strength level is there you

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.250
might find you're weaker in that

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.590
position then you think.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.150
Use all the tools that you can to ge the most
out of every lift that you can.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.349
I hope that this helps

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.600
you out and I will talk to you soon.
