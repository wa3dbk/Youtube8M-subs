00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.210
All right guys.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.370
In this video we are going to be talking about
good nutrition exercise.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.431
It is the part of the memory and the brain
that I overlooked for a really long time.

00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:21.770
I was just hard core about, here is the filing
system, you have touched up in the picture

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.900
you see action, emotion.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.680
I have totally overlooked good nutrition and
exercise and may be part of that was because

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.369
the first 10 years I was in this businesses
I was I was I my 20s and good nutrition and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.500
exercise wasn't as important.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.219
As I got older my body started slowing down
and as it started slowing down I had to work

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.280
harder to keep my body in shape but the theory
is that if your body is in shape your brain

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.280
is in shape.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.320
If you've got good circulation, good blood
flow, more oxygen is going into your brain

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.030
and that is going to keep your brain more
alert and alive and that is what [inaudible

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.649
0:00:55.4].

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.710
Really that just kind of increases your blood
circulation.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.710
So there is some truth to good nutrition exercise,
there are brain foods, there are foods you

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.250
should avoid and there are foods that you
should eat to help your memory.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.630
One good thing for your memory is that it
is water drinking, plenty of water.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.570
If you have a dehydrated brain you are going
to have a brain that is not able to focus.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.610
When I was training for the 2009 USA memory
championship I lost 20 pounds.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.869
People were like dude are you training for
a memory tournament or a marathon and I say

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.580
it is a memory tournament but the better fit
your body is the better fit your brain is.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.490
I lost 20 pound, I won and I became king of
the nerds.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.540
2010 the next year training for that tournament
I lost another 20 pounds.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.840
People were like man that is amazing.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.340
You lost 40 pounds in a year?

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.189
I didn't it was the same 20 pounds.

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.289
I was celebrating a lot and I gained it back.

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.430
But I am serious about it now, I do not eat
sweets, I have cut everything out.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.580
I am very strict on diet and I only eat stuff
that is going to help my brain.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.462
I totally ignore any thing else if it is not.

00:02:05.462 --> 00:02:07.410
I eat apples and how about them apples?

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.750
Apples are good for your memory.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.250
I was on a show with this doctor.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.720
You may know him and let us see what he and
I talked about as far as foods that are good

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.720
for your memory.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.440
While you all watch that.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.290
So watch this video.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.290
All right guys.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.640
I can't show you that footage because I don't
own the rights to.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.950
So I can't show it here on YouTube.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.810
So let me just give you a few good things
that we talked about.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.440
Great brain foods are apples.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.380
You have heard and apple a day keeps the doctor
away.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.110
It is going to help your brain and help your
ability to focus.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.620
Omega3, fish oil pills are great for your
memory.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.110
I am allergic to fish, so I take the Omega-3
oil pills.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.340
But may be eating a lot of fish is also good
for you.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.210
Pumpkin seeds re good.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.700
You even get the pumpkin seed oil.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.680
So it is more of a concentrate, you don't
have to eat the whole bowlful of pumpkin seeds.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.910
Blueberries are great for your memory.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.790
What we talked about in that show was getting
blueberry concentrate.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.720
Go to Google and type in blueberry concentrate,
that way you don't have to eat a thousand

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.820
blueberries a day.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.970
I am a big fan of curd.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.570
I became a big fan of it a few years ago and
I love how it tastes.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.640
Lucky for me curd has [inaudible 0:03:16.7]
in it and _______ is good for your memory.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.030
Walnuts, that is good for your memory.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.030
Drinking plenty of water.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.550
A dehydrated brain is an unhealthy brain.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.890
Red [inaudible 0:03:29.3] are good for your
memory.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.730
Onions are good for your memory.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.680
So these are some great brain foods.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.190
Remember what you put into your body does
matter and it does affect your brain.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.210
So those are some brain foods.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.100
Now I will skip back to our regularly scheduled
program.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.495
What the heck, I will show you a SHORT clip
from show but don't tell any one I showed

00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:48.495
you this....

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:51.030
What you may not know is that apples are actually
good for your memory.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.570
When ever we age the neurotransmitters in
our brain will tend to decline.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.980
Well apples have something called acetylcholine
and acetylcholine is going to help to protect

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.430
against those neurotransmitters [inaudible
0:04:03.4] and it is also going to help protect

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.360
against things like alzheimers.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.850
So these are easy things you can get.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:19.479
We are currently experiencing technical difficulties.

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.290
Please stand by

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.900
Ok.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.050
So good nutrition, exercise.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.090
It is going to make an impact on your memory.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.139
I would encourage you just to drink some water,
go for a walk.

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.540
If you get that blood flow to your body, the
cardiovascular exercise is going to help you,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.250
go ride a bicycle.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.250
But the important thing is like me you always
want to be healthy.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.180
And if you want it mix that good exercise
too and avoid things that are bad for your

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.180
memory.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.289
You don't want things that have a lot of sugar
in them, you don't want a lot of things that

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:01.949
have over carbs.

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.479
Low corn is good, don't do no carb, your brain
does need some carbs.

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:08.830
But bottom-line.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.270
We talked today about how good nutrition and
exercise helps your memory.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.319
It is something I think seriously and I hope
that you do as well.

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:25.020
I will see you on the next video.
