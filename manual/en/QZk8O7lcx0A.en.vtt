00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:04.640
this is a ballister from an eighteenth
century building this is a blonde sandstone type

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.559
from a building from Aryshire, quite a significant building

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.039
called Dumfries House.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:14.659
This ballister was from a bridge, and it's just the bottom half and it was

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:16.650
really badly vandalized

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.550
and that's, that's all that's left
of it

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.670
and so we can

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.850
match the stone to this for an
existing stone type, which can be

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.790
used to either reconstruct the
ballisters or repair if there's enough

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.710
stone left.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.840
...and put them back in place and
restore them.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.300
my name is Emily Tracey, I'm an
architectural historian who is a

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.300
research fellow placed on the BGS stone team in Edinburgh.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.270
What we do with the building stone team

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.380
is we try and match historic stone types

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.080
with stone that is currently available today.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.920
If you're using stone which is of
different compatibilites or

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.969
different characters

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.210
 different compositions

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.820
for restoration work

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.970
it actually enhance decay.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.930
So we're trying to raise awareness and
ensure that people know that there are

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.830
different stone types.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.810
These are a bunch of samples that we have in
our collection

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.030
which helps us with matching

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.170
so that we can identify

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.830
a possible match

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.490
for restoration work

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.060
in historic buildings. The Geological
diversity of the British Isles is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.399
extremely diverse

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.220
one of the most diverse in the world in
fact

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.980
And the building blocks of our
society of our towns, our villages, our cities

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.470
is basically just beneath our feet

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.550
so you can begin to create a historical timeline

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.870
if you know of

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.030
our architectural heritage according to stone types.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.010
This process also helps us

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.139
provide stone matching

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:03.000
for new builds as well as construction
sites that are in very historic areas

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.790
that would like to

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.790
not necessarily blend in but just maintain that local character and that sense of place.

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.040
This is the block that we obtained and we will be doing c-section analysis

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.069
to try to find our stone very valuable stone that will match.

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.350
This is a sample that we took earlier from the site

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.070
it's a masonry block, right, directly out of the wall.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.019
We can take it out of the wall, turn it over,

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.349
take a core from the rear of the
sample

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.579
but it back into the wall so that no
one even notices that we took the sample.

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.489
We then take it back to the lab,

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.180
we cut the sample right in half

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.029
we get a thin section from the sample
which we then analyze with a microscope

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:15.029
and that tells us the DNA of the stone type

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:19.999
for future matching with existing stone types today

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:24.629
historically our stone types were
exported around the world to

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.969
the United States, to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa etc.

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:33.459
so a recent surprise would be we were just looking at a statue of Robert Burns

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.039
which is carved by Green Shields, a sculptor in the

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:39.719
eighteenth century in Scotland

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.859
and that statue was exported with
the family when they moved to Australia

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.680
we were able to reopen the historic
quarry that was used  to carve that stone,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.910
that statue,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.719
and is now being shipped to Australia to
fix it

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:57.110
I think the most rewarding part really
is just talking to people

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.730
who are completely unaware of how local,
where their house came from you know

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.910
where that school came from, where their
church was built out of and how

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.289
locally sourced it used to be

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:11.559
so it's really just getting involved with local communities and teaching them about their heritage

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.359
and raising awareness as to how special
it is

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.799
because it's so close to where they were brought up.

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.820
The scale of quarrying as an industry
in the industrial heritage behind that

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.180
no one else is really investigating that
and looking into that as much as the

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.660
building stone team at BGS is
doing so it's very crucial work that's

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.390
going on here and is raising awareness
and making people that aware the information

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.280
is out there that we're trying to
provide that to them.
