Hi! I'm Robin with trees-mom.com. We're making
a video for Expert Village today. We're crocheting

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:12.530
wire to make a Christmas bracelet. This is
what we've gotten so far. We have our bracelet

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.890
all the way crocheted and we have our 2 tails.
We're going to take the really long tail that

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:28.230
we made, and we're going to fold it into three
2 inch sections. We're putting the wire down

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.320
through the bracelet, the end of the bracelet,
leaving a loop. We're going to do the same

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:50.390
thing again through the bracelet. Leave a
loop. Now we have 2 great big loops. Do it

00:00:50.390 --> 00:01:03.510
again. Take it through the bracelet. We have
a loop and we're going to do one more loop.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:18.159
Through the bracelet with the wire.
We're folding this one back down. Now, we

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:30.939
have 4 or 5 loops here, and we're just going
to twist them together.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:37.159
When we get them all twisted, nice and twisted
like that, we're going to wrap it around the

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.539
crochet hook so it'll make a nice curve and
curve it back down to the bracelet. We have

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:53.859
a little bit of wire extra right here. We're
going to weave that one in to secure the button

00:01:53.859 --> 00:02:16.049
loop. Then we're going to get a little more
wire, cut it off with our wire cutters. You

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:26.349
are squishing the wire at the base of the
loop. We're just going to wrap this wire around

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:38.040
about 4 or 5 times just to give it a finished
look. If you still have wire leftover, that's

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.579
fine. We'll use that to attach some of the
beads.
