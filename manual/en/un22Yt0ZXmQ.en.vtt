seven seventy nine tax is brought to you by
net

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.170
you know i a m

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.090
in florida are now turning away overweight
women

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.460
uh... because they say that baby come alive
bility

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.520
and they also say that their equipment is
not strong enough to withhold their way

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.279
now this isn't discussing ok tablet

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.050
there at the sun sentinel sentinel did uh...
eighty

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.180
survey

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.199
of one hundred and five uh... ob-gyn skin
staff south florida

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.200
and they found out that fifteen of them probably

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.580
okay some of them as low as two hundred pounds
so if you're a woman who is two hundred

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.870
there're some uh... clinics are some doctors
that you'll go to all be g lands you'll go

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.990
to and i'll turn you away because he simply
to overweight

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.250
the look is the problem with our society like
the insurance company started this

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.860
light we can discriminate against person except
for some line persons the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.380
based on whether you know and beginning it
makes some sense the small they announced

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.369
or that became either fatter than on saturday

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.390
on healthier than on unhealthy rivets enough
enough

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.799
whatever users readiness for it

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.670
announced revelations come respectful doctors
and its c_n_n_'s like perfectly okay how were

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.350
course we discriminate people

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.770
and so uh... you know it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.350
and in the plains of the thing on the fat
people writers are on the treasure for two

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.990
seasons on a one c

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.460
and then the government's is in the company
started saying

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.050
on the charging more for your insurance

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.500
that employees paid insuring right if you're
overweight and now it's gone the point where

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.720
doctors if you're pregnant want you because
you're overweight

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.020
all along i said don't do it don't do it it's
gonna leaking stuff like this

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.950
it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.190
yet not the slippery slope argument for some
reason or another i don't like it doesn't

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.530
usually hold water but in this case it does

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.249
now when it comes to com flights and how they
sometimes strike job these people for two

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:56.049
seats

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.799
and when it comes to insurance companies charging
more for obesity at people there's at least

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.770
some sort of reasoning behind it you know
he even if you don't agree with that reasoning

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.219
but in this case there's no reasoning a two
hundred-pound woman

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:12.639
you can't turn away if she's coming in and
she's pregnant she needs care now let me get

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.340
a little

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.089
your doctor and

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.250
you're not supposed to say to people and that
they treat you

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.459
as a they think you're overweight or you know

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.299
europe break my quit app dot says that

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.560
and only for god what this is about

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.009
now profit is everything okay

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:35.329
alive i don't like that because i might did
might result in this or that or whatever i

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.119
don't give a damn about the victory

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:43.919
it's grotesque and they're worried that because
of their uh... obesity related illnesses or

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.240
illnesses that are related to them being overweight

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.370
that you know they face uh... losses and things
like that not sweaty two-minute ever doctor

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.669
alley dot their skills revenues quality losses
of their losses

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:59.299
does so if somebody with heart disease comes
to you in any can you get it turned them away

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.669
because they could possibly have a heart attack
and i ended my their family members like so

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.669
you is that how it's going to work out well
the point of being a doctor is to help people

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:09.659
who might be in trouble

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.819
into a that's all for compliance but there

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.089
they come to you in my help problems

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:20.449
if you throw everybody was no problems that
you're not a prick and dr

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.559
who can go to another job

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:23.909
you know

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.679
whatever you want to be sanitation worker
plumber

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:29.319
okay but there will be a doctor

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.399
now the net that's not but i'm done things

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:35.709
dot

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.919
this discrimination against overweight people

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.639
totally out of control

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.819
and run lines that at the plane okay

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.569
the plan was to do it again like look

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.430
hardwood for example mine

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.159
about squishing until a few again it mandates
that day for me i might favor

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.289
but all the other bullshit about no way man

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.649
so interests for more for practical

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:02.299
bucknell

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:02.990
date

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.799
at that same is are more

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:05.779
okay

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.769
you know me and and i

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.019
i don't have that problem now in its entirety
i'm not overweight ok this will affect me

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.750
in any way shape or form but anderson that
this is not right okay that's acting at that

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.549
at the call

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.419
if you are doctor you are back i'd think

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.740
you should be by law uh... required to take
care of people who come to you and they need

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.470
help

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.069
that's your job at your job requirement okay
you can turn people away from being and it's

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.870
not even all of these women

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.009
if you're two hundred pounds you're not considered
obese in all cases okay so to tara and i i
