Hi, I'm Eldad Sameach - Dr. Fix It Yourself.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.360
In this video I want to show you how to fix a noisy refrigerator.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.580
We assume that the outer noise is its only problem.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.100
That's the refrigerator, manufactured by "Amcor".

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.400
The refrigerator is unplugged now, to avoid the noise it makes.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.080
We'll plug it in, so you can hear the noise.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.460
That's the noise made by the refrigerator, we don't know why, yet.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.620
We'll unplug it and continue.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:06.620
The refrigerator is out of its niche, and we'll turn it around, facing its rear, to allow easy access.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.240
Now we'll plug it in again, to see the problem's source.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.120
OK,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:23.940
We assume that the noise is caused by something external, rather than internal,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:34.440
That kind of noise is usually caused by the motor not tightened firmly to its place.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.640
So, first we'll check the motor.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.840
These bolts mount the motor to the refrigerator's chassis,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.380
And they seem to be tight.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.860
This tray, or basin, hold the excess water from the refrigerator,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.720
And maybe this is the cause for the noise. Let's see...

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.380
If we press this tray down, the noise stops.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.640
Probably there's a loose bolt or nut,

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.480
That mounts the tray to the compressor,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.600
And the noise is caused because of the vibrations.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.920
If we look here we can see a bolt,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.680
We'll try to tighten the bolt and see if the problem is solved.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.400
To make it easy, we'll unplug the refrigerator again.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.040
OK,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.740
We'll use an adjustable wrench to tighten this bolt.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.500
This bolt it totally loose.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.960
The tray is rattling all over the place...

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.340
And that the reason for the noise. We'll tighten the bolt.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.960
We'll turn it 1-2 more turns with the adjustable wrench.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.180
The bolt is tightened.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:27.080
We don't need to tighten the bolt too much, just to mount the tray firmly.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.780
To make sure the problem is solved,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.300
We'll plug the refrigerator in again.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.820
The refrigerator is plugged in,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.980
Silence is all we hear :)

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.140
No noise or vibrations, nothing :)

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.560
That bolt was to blame...

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.720
Just to make extra sure, we place a hand here,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.520
Feeling small vibrations from the compressor, indicating it's working.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.920
The bolt is tight, the tray mounts firmly, no noise.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.960
