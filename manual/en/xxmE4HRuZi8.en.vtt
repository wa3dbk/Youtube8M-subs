WATERMELON PIZZA (How To Make, simple video recipe, vegan pizza recipe, diy) Inspire To Cook

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.717
Hey guys! Welcome to Inspire to Cook!

00:00:01.717 --> 00:00:05.625
Summer heat is hear so today I am going to show you a recipe to help you cool off

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:07.399
Of course with a watermelon

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:09.150
We are going to do some watermelon fruit pizza

00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:10.108
Let's do it!

00:00:10.108 --> 00:00:13.017
The main ingredient we are going to need is the watermelon of course

00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:16.090
And any fruits that you have. I am going to use some strawberries

00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:17.525
Some Kiwis

00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:18.957
And of course blueberries

00:00:18.957 --> 00:00:20.184
Ripen blueberries

00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:24.158
The first step is to cut a slice of a watermelon

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:27.166
You just need to cut off the end of the watermelon

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.579
You can use any part of the watermelon

00:00:30.358 --> 00:00:32.518
I just like to cut them into 1 inch

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:33.574
or so

00:00:34.142 --> 00:00:35.102
just like that

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:39.230
As you can imagine, this recipe is super simple and anyone can do it

00:00:39.257 --> 00:00:42.057
The next step is to cut it into pizza slices

00:00:42.486 --> 00:00:43.526
From the middle

00:00:49.812 --> 00:00:52.052
The next step is to cup up the fruit

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.436
And again you can use any fruit

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:55.287
And you can cut them into different shapes

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:58.553
But uh, you can normally cut the strawberries into halves

00:00:58.553 --> 00:01:03.055
But since my strawberries are pretty big, I am going to cut mine into four pieces

00:01:03.574 --> 00:01:04.214
like that

00:01:04.214 --> 00:01:06.201
Of course we need to remove the green part

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:10.599
Next up is the kiwi fruit, you can peel it different ways

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:13.381
Today, I am going to peel it just as a regular potato

00:01:13.547 --> 00:01:14.507
just like that

00:01:15.712 --> 00:01:18.432
My watermelon pizza size is pretty small

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:21.705
So I just need 1 nice slice of kiwi

00:01:21.705 --> 00:01:22.953
And I am going to show you why

00:01:22.953 --> 00:01:25.050
So I am going to put it right on top of the pizza

00:01:25.942 --> 00:01:29.222
And I am going to cut it just the way pizza is sliced

00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:33.955
There you go, so each individual pizza slice will have a piece of kiwi

00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:36.172
But yet it looks like one solid pizza

00:01:36.172 --> 00:01:39.090
And finally, we are going to make it rain with some blueberrries

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.550
Just like that

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.294
Doesn't our watermelon pizza look like a beautiful, beautiful flower

00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:49.846
Just inviting you to eat it. Look at that!

00:01:49.898 --> 00:01:52.618
Well and it is my favorite part of the show

00:01:52.618 --> 00:01:53.556
Tasting time!

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.610
Umm

00:01:56.733 --> 00:02:00.253
The kiwi definitely gives a little bit more sourness

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:02.479
And blueberries complete this pizza

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.979
Beautiful

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.197
