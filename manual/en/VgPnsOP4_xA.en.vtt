How to Get Album Artwork on an iPod.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.349
You can easily identify the album of the song
you're listening to on your iPod, iPod nano,

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.520
or iPod touch by adding cover art to your
portable music player.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:26.200
You will need iTunes iTunes Store membership
Internet access and saved images.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.460
Step 1.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.790
Join the Apple iTunes Store.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.230
Once you're a member, you can select all of
your songs from List View in iTunes, right-click

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.980
on the selection, and then select Get Album
Artwork.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.950
If you want to add artwork for a full album
in your playlist, go to Album View, right-click

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.200
on the first song, and select Get Album Artwork.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.530
Since iTunes will likely not carry every album
in your collection, you may get a message

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.149
saying "Could not get artwork for some albums."

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.540
Step 2.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.000

View from the View menu in iTunes or by clicking

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.750
on the farthest right button of the three

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.259
Step 3.

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.330
Select all of the songs in which you'd like
artwork.

The bottom left area of the screen shows a
box titled "Selected Item" over a white field

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.950
that says, "Drag Album Artwork Here."

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.380
If you don't see the "Drag Artwork Here" box,
click the far right button in the lower left

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.200
corner of the screen.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.210
The button's icon is a box with an up arrow
in it and activates the "Show or hide artwork

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.650
or video viewer."

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.130
Step 4.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.049
Enter the name of the album and artist into
a search engine and find images of the album

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.119

Right-click on the album image and select
Copy Image.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.510
Then go to iTunes and right-click on the Drag

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.520
Select Paste, and the cover art will be pasted
to the Drag Artwork Here field and into the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.180
blank field above the album title and artist
in the Cover Flow.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.770
Step 6.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.189
Use images on your computer by highlighting
the first song of the album, right-clicking

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.129
on the highlighted area, and selecting Get
Info.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.390
Then click on the Artwork tab, click Add,
and find the artwork you want to use.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:23.090
Select the image, click OK, and the image
will appear as the album artwork.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.280
Step 7.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.950
Copy your music from iTunes to your iPod -- or
sync your iPod -- and all of your album artwork

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.670
will be visible on your iPod screen.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:41.720
Did you know As of early 2010, the Black Eyed
Peas pop hit "I Gotta Feeling" was the top-selling

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.980
digital song in history.
