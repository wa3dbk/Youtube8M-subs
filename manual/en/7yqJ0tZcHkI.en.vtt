00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.990
So it's your first year at McGill and
you're going to be living in one of 12

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.240
amazing residences.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.879
Can't be too hard right? Just a new home, new
classes,

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.769
new friends, new opportunities. Woah. Maybe it's a bit
more than you think.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.990
But not to worry! Here's a list of the do's

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.270
and don'ts to moving into rest have you feeling comfortable

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.240
faster than you can say SEEYA parents
and/or guardians!

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.710
Let's get started! Do: get your student card at Service Point immediately.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.710
You need your student number, a piece of government
issued photo ID, and documents proving your

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.880
citizen status in Canada.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.149
Don't: wait until the last minute! Your
student card is your myCard, which is

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.070
both your official identification at
McGill

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.840
and a debit card for services on campus,
doing laundry in Rez,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.469
and getting into your building. Do:
contact the front desk or office should

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.629
you want to move in early.

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.989
Look in the "about" section below for a
link! Don't:

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.120
try and scale the building before
moving weekend in an attempt to get a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.050
room with a good view.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.149
Do: pick up your  Rez Wars t-shirt,

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.970
lease, keys, and room condition survey
when checking in with the floor fellows

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.560
from your residence.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.189
Don't: miss out on orientation activities
like Rez Fest 1 and 2 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.170
where you'll get a chance to hang out with 
students of yours and eleven other

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.580
residences.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.490
Do: use the elevator to bring heavier
items to your room.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.530
Don't: use elevator to ride back down to the
lobby

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.640
empty handed. Do: take advantage of the
free meal offered to those on the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.780
mandatory meal plan at your respective
dining hall the day you move in.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.400
Don't: forget to use your clam shell if
you have leftovers.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.310
Do: bring alarm clock, bedding, a fan, and
some posters and pictures

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.740
that make your room feel personal. Don't:

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.220
invite all of your new friends to create a
mosh pit- in your room.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.720
See? It's not too hard once you get the hang of it. And now that
you're a pro

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.280
you can use your newfound knowledge to
give others a helping hand.
