00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:25.839
Water levels, am I right?

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.739
You're going along, enjoying your platformer-like
substance, and then WHAM.

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.620
All of a sudden you're in a dense fluid medium,
and physics just don't work the same way.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.399
Friction starts doing weird things.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.410
It wasn't too bad in Super Mario Bros. and
the like, but just mention the damn pod section

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.570
of Earthworm Jim and older gamers start getting
PTSD flashbacks.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.470
Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians, I should
warn you, is nothing but underwater levels.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.390
However, rather than just being a strange
distortion of a platformer, it is in fact

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.770
its own beat... erm, beast... some kind of
psychedelic action puzzle game with an intense

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.449
rhythmic leaning.

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.770
Think of it as some strange hybrid of Toejam
&amp; Earl, Harmoknight, Fez, and...

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.840
The Fish Fillets 2, and I can't believe I'm
pulling that out as a reference point but

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.340
it kinda gets us there.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.700
So as this kinda amorphous blob of rhythmic
being, your task is to assist this old dude

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.490
Clef - who, it should be mentioned, narrates
the entire opening sequence while scratching

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.560
his own vocals - in protecting the music from
the evil forces what are trying to lock it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.560
up.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.630
Because music should be free for everyone,
man, and other sayings.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.159
Point is, he's an inept codger so it's up
to you to actually facilitate things by swimming

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.170
throughout massive stages, advancing from
one area to the next by solving puzzles, moving

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.939
swiftly, and facing the danger all by your
lonesome.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.689
This being a planet full of rhythm - not unlike
the Funkotron we're all familiar with, just

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.619
wetter - every element of every section is
a musical instrument of some flavor, and these

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.060
combinations of elements mean that every chunk
is its own little riff on the already-excellent

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.539
baseline track.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.560
Your basic controls include swimming in any
direction, boosting your speed, picking up

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.019
objects, and on occasion using some more specialized
commands like searching for hidden elements

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.370
and firing this funk vehicle's turret.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.410
Yes, sometimes you're not really puzzling
around, you're just cruising in this spherical

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.819
craft, which, yes, controls just as shaky
as you're seeing.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.990
That's because it's moving on the beat, and
can accelerate if you time hitting A just

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.990
right.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.230
It breaks up the monotony of the hardcore
puzzling a bit, while introducing a new set

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.230
of challenges.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.569
For what is ostensibly a puzzle game, there's
certainly plenty of action, like trying to

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.290
grab a key and then hit five rebounds to fling
you through a distant gate before it closes,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.690
or making it through a gauntlet of spike-laden
snails while the high-hat crab is in hiding.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.960
That's right.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.510
High-hat crab.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.879
There's so much style and effort put into
the craft of Beatbuddy that I kinda just want

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.870
to shut up and let you watch.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.049
Let you see the absolutely gorgeous stages,
detailed character animation, and even the

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.800
distorting effects of taking damage or going
into sound-search mode.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.330
Combined with a story that's just crazy enough
to be entertaining while still being totally

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.090
engaging, and plenty of replay value in finding
and collecting the hundreds of gems in each

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.379
stage, not to mention the speedrunning possibilities...
it's a hell of a package.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.151
I realize there's a great depth of PC games
you probably need to get around to, but this

00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:32.040
one belongs at the top of your list.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.180
No, honestly.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.620
I realize you probably hear that a lot about
every game that comes along.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.340
But this time it's true.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:53.640
You absolutely need more strange, blobby,
beatboxing NPCs in your life.
