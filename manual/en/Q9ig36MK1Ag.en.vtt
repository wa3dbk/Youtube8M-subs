00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:02.120
Hi Everyone

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.670
Today I would like to show you the 
Nanogen Scalp roller

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.249
I have got this this morning

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:13.289
I ordered it online

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:19.560
So the nanogen scalp roller claims 
to improve blood circulation to the hair

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.750
see this

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.089
This is how the packing looks like

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.550
It says

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.300
Scalp treatment enhancer

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.440
Titanium micro needles

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:39.440
and it has got lot of features

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.410
It has got 4 benefits

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.400
The first one says it penetrates

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.510
improves the penetration of 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.110
your medicines the minoxidil  or what ever may be that 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.600
you are applying for the hair

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.250
to improve hair growth

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.320
it improves the penetration of such medicines

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.810
and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.750
it says it activates PRP treatment

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.840
and heals donor scars

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.510
increases scalp repair and 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.460
hair growth mechanisms

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.120
so thats what this scalp roller benefits

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.690
so basically got this to improve

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.960
my

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.170
blood circulation to the hair

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.970
and i will be applying 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.150
mintop or minoxidil after this so 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.830
that would improve the minoxidil absorption  

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.700
and thus

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.910
hair growth would be faster

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.820
I've just opened the pack

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.310
this is how it looks inside

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.710
its exciting

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.150
i ordered actually 0.5mm roller

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.060
the roller is 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.550
packed safely inside 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.400
a plastic container

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.580
so that the needles dont get damaged

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.519
so if you place it properly inside the container after use

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.239
the needles should not get 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.529
hurt nor damaged

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.679
i'll just open this in a moment

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:25.569
here we go

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.469
so we have plastic container in which we have the 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:34.779
scalp roller

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.829
without wasting much time I will open this out

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.719
so be careful while we are opening this

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.609
plastic container because

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.899
sometimes when u opening it too fast

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.739
you may tend to touch the needles

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.829
with this

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.989
so the needles may get damaged

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.159
I am just opening it too slowly 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.049
making sure that I'm pushig it 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.469
towards the end so that I take it out very carefully

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:04.529
and then

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:06.790
I am taking out

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.799
the scalp roller

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.499
as I said it is 0.5 mm

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:18.350
i dont actually feel 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.409
that the needles be very long

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.219
they are thin 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:24.989
and tiny needles

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.599
i'm sure that they don't hurt me

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.349
even if you rub it vigorously on the scalp

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.289
but most of the times it is recommended to rub it moderately

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:36.209
so that it allows the circulation 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.119
and at the same time you don't

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:39.930
over-do the things. So that

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.649
it wont hurt you

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:48.149
so this is the scalp roller, i can touch it and feel the 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:51.339
prickling sensation

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:55.039
I will be using it on the scalp

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:58.849
ther are some recommendations and 
some precautions

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.899
i am just placing it back

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:08.679
quite safely

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:11.229
in the box

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:14.069
there are some standard precautions like

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.339
Donot share this scalp roller with any one

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.159
and Donot use it more than once a day, an important recommendation

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.249
If you are using it more than once 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:28.040
you may tend to damage your scalp

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.669
Don't use it when u r pregnant

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.409
store it in a safe place out of reach of children

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:36.590
not to be used by people of age under 18

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:42.210
so those are the common recommendations and 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.330
its not mentioned here, but we should not use this roller
on the skin

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.080
Derma roller is same as the scalp roller 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.490
but this one is specifically for the saclp

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.479
so not to be used on the skin

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.560
even if you are using Derma roller, you dont want to use

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.289
on the scalp and the skin at the same time

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.740
I got my scalp roller and will be using it soon

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.449
i will come back if possible on how to
 use this on scalp 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.479
to improve

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.270
blood circulation and to promote

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.539
faster hair growth

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:24.080
thanks everyone
