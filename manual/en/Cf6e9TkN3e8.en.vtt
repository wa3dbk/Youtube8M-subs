TIM: Hi, and welcome to
Tech Tips From Teachers.

00:00:02.956 --> 00:00:04.330
On this episode,
we'll be looking

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.480
at apps that are great
for formative assessment

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.696
in the classroom.

00:00:07.696 --> 00:00:09.445
Our guest for this
episode is Emily Tombes

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:11.850
from San Jose, California.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.380
Emily has a master's degree
in elementary education

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.440
from the University of Virginia,
and is currently a second grade

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.810
teacher.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.710
As part of her role, she
helps to lead the curriculum

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.150
and assessment design programs
for her entire school,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.000
and previously she
taught third grade

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.560
at a charter school that adhered
to an adaptive learning model.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.020
So Emily, tell us a little
bit about why technology's

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.400
important in the classroom.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.233
EMILY TOMBES: Technology
makes collaborating

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:37.550
with my coworkers really easy.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.570
I use Google Docs
for planning, and I

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.240
am able to communicate what I'm
working on with my coworkers,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.610
and we're able to share a lot
of that information online.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.050
It helps out with
planning, and making sure

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.490
that we are able to share
data regarding the students,

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.690
and how they've scored on tests,
how they're doing on projects,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.400
and we're able to communicate
with one another about that.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.880
So technology makes
it a lot easier

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.120
for me to work with my
coworkers and collaborate

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.842
with them, and also to plan.

00:01:02.842 --> 00:01:03.342
TIM: Cool.

00:01:03.342 --> 00:01:05.019
And what about
formative assessment?

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.430
Why is that something that's
critical in the classroom?

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.221
EMILY TOMBES: Yeah, so
formative assessment

00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:11.540
is really important for
two key reasons for me.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.660
It's a planning tool.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.400
When I give my kids a test
or a quick little check

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.810
for understanding, I'm
able to tell really quickly

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.030
whether they're understanding
what I'm giving them.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.960
So I'm able to use
it for planning

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.610
and make sure that I know what
my next steps are as a teacher.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.510
And also so that
can differentiate

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.042
for the specific needs of
my students in my class.

00:01:29.042 --> 00:01:30.750
TIM: In speaking with
teachers about apps

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.416
that are great for
formative assessment,

00:01:32.416 --> 00:01:34.734
we came upon a few major themes.

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:36.150
It's important
that these apps are

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.930
easy to manage and
implement, that they

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.640
have strong reporting, and that
they help to foster discussion

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.850
among students.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.290
So Emily, why is it so
critical that an app is

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.122
easy for a teacher to manage?

00:01:47.122 --> 00:01:49.330
EMILY TOMBES: As a teacher,
my time is really sacred.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
There's a lot that I
need to do in the day.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.350
When I have an app
that is easy to manage,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.480
I can use that app to help
me create quick formative

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.609
assessments and quick
checks for understanding,

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.650
so that I don't have to
spend a whole lot of time

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.146
creating those things on my own.

00:02:03.146 --> 00:02:04.645
TIM: And what about
that data piece.

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:06.187
Why is reporting so important?

00:02:06.187 --> 00:02:08.020
EMILY TOMBES: When I
have really solid data,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.759
I can use it for two purposes.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.810
I use it for planning.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.802
I can use it to see what my
students did really well with,

00:02:13.802 --> 00:02:16.010
what they need a little bit
of support and review on,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.470
and if I need to go back and
totally re-teach something.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.420
So when I get data back
from those students,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.470
I can tell what I need
to do as a teacher.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.060
I can also look at it for
differentiation purposes.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.210
So I can tell which
kids in my class

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.141
did really well on a certain
skill, which kids might need

00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:33.070
a little-- just a little
bit of extra support,

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.400
and which kids need to be
in a small group with me

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.945
or with an intervention
specialist.

00:02:36.945 --> 00:02:38.041
TIM: Gotcha.

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:39.540
And then what about
with discussion?

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.630
Why is that something that you'd
want to include in your class?

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.005
EMILY TOMBES: Yeah, this is
one of my favorite components

00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:46.180
of really building a solid
formative assessment.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.570
Because when I see the
discussion piece of an answer,

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.430
I'm able to look at the gray
area of where a kid was-- what

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.430
their thought process was
as they were coming up

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.650
with an answer.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.230
So when I see
their discussion, I

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.130
can tell how they got
to their answer, maybe

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.380
some misconceptions
that they might have,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.560
and what I can
target my instruction

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.830
towards the next time I
review a certain skill.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.800
So if I have the students
discussing something,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.770
it's a lot easier for me to tell
what their thought process was,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.064
and what I can be
reviewing as a teacher.

00:03:16.064 --> 00:03:18.480
TIM: Emily, let's take a look
at some apps that are really

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.180
great for formative assessment.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.580
EMILY TOMBES: Yeah, so the
first one I want to look at

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.490
is Socrative.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.490
And Socrative is great
because it's really easy

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.140
to implement and to manage.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.960
As a teacher, one of
my favorite things

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.770
is that there's no
student logins needed.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.850
Students can just join
the teacher's classroom

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.297
based on the unique code
that I receive as a teacher.

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:35.880
The other thing I
really like about it

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.060
is that I can create
formative assessments

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.710
in a lot of different ways.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.590
They also have some
games that can really

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.040
engage the kids in
the process of doing

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.190
this formative assessment.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.120
They can sort of compete
with one another.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.450
TIM: Tell us about Exit Ticket.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.650
EMILY TOMBES: Yeah,
so Exit Ticket's

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.358
great because it gives
me the opportunity

00:03:51.358 --> 00:03:53.000
to use that strong reporting.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.330
I get to look at the
Exit Ticket formats

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.500
to decide how my kids
did on their assessments.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.160
I can look at very
different dashboards

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.010
and tell how they're being
successful with certain things,

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.880
and what they still
need to review.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.694
It gives me a chance to
give assessments either

00:04:07.694 --> 00:04:08.860
in the middle of the lesson.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.750
I can do something called
a check for understanding,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.810
where I look to see if
the kids are understanding

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.580
my teaching as I'm going
through the lesson.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.890
But I can also build more
traditional Exit Tickets

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.760
at the end of the lesson,
and give them a final chance

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.390
to show me what they learned.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.094
TIM: And what's
valuable about Verso?

00:04:25.094 --> 00:04:27.010
EMILY TOMBES: It gives
students an opportunity

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.500
to watch a video,
or look at a task

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.740
and respond to a task
in a discussion format.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.940
So they log in and they
write their responses

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.717
in more conversational tone.

00:04:36.717 --> 00:04:38.300
They can "like" each
other's comments.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.980
They can comment on
one another's comments,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.700
and it just allows that
discussion piece to continue.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.690
It does offer me
accountability as a teacher

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.280
so I can log in and
see which students

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.560
are posting the discussions.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.710
And I get a chance to see which
students are participating,

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.830
which students might need
a little push in class

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.290
to participate more.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.960
In the formative
assessment component,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.900
it allows me, as
the teacher, to see

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.980
what parts are very present
in their discussions,

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.290
and what components I
need to go back and really

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.760
push them to be thinking
about, as they're

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.900
posting their answers and
posting their comments.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.660
TIM: Emily, thanks so
much for joining us today.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.310
EMILY TOMBES: Thanks
for having me.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.410
It was great to be here.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.550
TIM: And to recap, a few
things to keep in mind

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.125
for formative assessment apps.

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:18.500
It's important that they're
easy to manage and implement,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.416
that they have strong
reporting, and that they

00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:22.850
help to foster discussion
among students.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.000
