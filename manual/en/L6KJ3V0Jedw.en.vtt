00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.120
Angie's log, stardate 2013528--
We're being invaded by aliens.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.090
I'm recording this so in
case anything happens to me,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.228
there'll be a record of
the stuff that's happened.

00:00:22.228 --> 00:00:24.668
Mom and Dad, if you're
seeing this video,

00:00:24.668 --> 00:00:28.572
it may mean that I'm either dead
or have been taken by invaders.

00:00:28.572 --> 00:00:31.020
If I've been
captured, don't worry.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.979
Somehow, I'll make it back home.

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:36.334
And if I do, I'd like a
Malibu Barbie for my birthday.

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:38.829
The Beyonce one with
a removable weave.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.823
A half hour ago, I was
recording another episode

00:00:41.823 --> 00:00:45.408
of my show, The Angie
Show, when they arrived.

00:00:45.408 --> 00:00:46.316
Hello.

00:00:46.316 --> 00:00:50.786
And welcome to another episode
of my show, The Angie Show.

00:00:50.786 --> 00:00:56.265
I'm Angie Martinez, and this
is my cohost, Mister Snuggles.

00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:57.890
Say hello to everyone,
Mister Snuggles.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.716
 

00:01:00.716 --> 00:01:02.056
Uh oh, Mister Snuggles.

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:04.500
It looks like Mom tripped
a circus breaker again

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.898
by using her hair dryer.

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:07.296
 

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:11.640
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're in for a real treat.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.860
We have a fireworks show
we are about to start

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.339
with our special guests,
Thunder and Lighting.

00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:23.800
 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.310
Wow, Mister Snuggles.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.470
Did you see that?

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.890
 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.028
We should go investigate.

00:01:29.028 --> 00:01:40.980
 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.462
Mister Snu-- Mister
Snug-- where'd you go?

00:01:45.462 --> 00:01:50.940
 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.932
This isn't a democracy.

00:01:52.932 --> 00:01:53.928
You don't get a vote.

00:01:53.928 --> 00:01:55.680
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.280
Kids.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.430
What are you gonna do?

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:35.154
