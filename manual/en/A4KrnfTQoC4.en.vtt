Hi, my name is Jan Cuni, I'm a professional
hairstylist and hair colorist. I work for

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:15.769
Plaza Salon in Paramus. I'm here on behalf
of Expert Village. I'm taking hair section

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:22.520
by section because it's going to help me make
it easier for me to make sure I'm curling

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:30.050
everything nice and evenly, because you cannot
leave the hair down, that's not curling. You

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:39.680
got to make section by section starting from
the bottom going up. You have to make sure

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:57.180
the ends, you start always in end and start
curling. You got to grab the end this way

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.129
you get nice beautiful curls. Make sure you
place the thin comb underneath the curling

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:52.020
iron otherwise you're going to get burned.
You heat it for like, it takes only a couple

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:03.630
of minutes cause it's a very hot curling iron.
