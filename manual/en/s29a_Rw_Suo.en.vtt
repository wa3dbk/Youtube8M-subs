00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.040
Hi, we're going to talk about paints because
if you're going to be a face painter, the

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.010
first thing you're going to need are the proper
paints to use. Now it's been told that you

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.740
could go to a craft supply store or an art
supply store and pretty much buy any paint

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.599
in a bottle or tube that?s labeled "Nontoxic".
This actually is not recommended for face

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:28.229
painting. Unfortunately nontoxic just means
that it's safe to eat or won't really harm

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:33.980
you if you eat it. It doesn't necessarily
mean that it's safe to be put on the skin.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.160
Paint that's safe to be put on the skin will
be labeled makeup. That means that it has

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:47.230
ingredients that have been tested and approved
by the government, by the FDA for use on skin.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.720
Craft paints might have ingredients such as
dyes or preservatives such as formaldehyde

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.510
that is not something that you would want
to put on your own face, let alone a child's

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.790
sensitive skin. It's really important to find
something that has FDA approved ingredients.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.360
Luckily, they're widely available. You can
find them on the Internet, you can also find

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.109
them in makeup and beauty supply stores, and
they come in many, many different forms. You

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:16.429
can experiment and find out what form you
like best. This is a liquid paint, like I

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:22.859
said it says makeup right on it, this one
right here is a powder form. It can be used

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:30.770
either dry, goes on very smoothly or you can
wet it to make more of a paste form. These

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.429
right here are a paste form of paint, you
just wet your brush with a little bit of water,

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.499
it goes on nice and smoothly. This is probably
the most popular form of face paint, and there

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:45.420
are several different brands you can choose
from that are all safe to use and widely available.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.039
Here is another example of a pallet that's
in a cake form. There's also some that are

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:01.009
in kind of a gel form that can squeeze on.
There are also paints that come in a crayon

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.079
or a stick form, which are great for beginners
and also great if you happen to be trying

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.230
to face paint in a large costume. You have
a little bit more control over it. What I

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.470
would suggest is go out, I wouldn't spend
a lot of money. Buy one, maybe two colors

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.360
of each type of paint, get your brush out
and just practice on your arm or your leg

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.510
and see what form you're most comfortable
with. Then you can stock up in that form and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.230
you'll be ready to go.
