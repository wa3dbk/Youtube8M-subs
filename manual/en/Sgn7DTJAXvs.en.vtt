00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.409
Dani, Marcão and Andy!

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:04.831
How does "Quick Change" works?
Every time I say 'change',

00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:08.408
they'll have to change the last
thing they have done or said,

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:10.861
and I'll ask this lady
here, what's your name?

00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:16.047
- Mariana. - Mariana. Give me
something with M from Mariana.

00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:21.975
'Mala'! "Quick Change", the theme
is 'suitcase', starting now!

00:00:28.482 --> 00:00:31.512
You have to check this suitcase, Josias.
You have to find the owner.

00:00:31.512 --> 00:00:34.877
- This suitcase? It was going there and
it's here? - The monitor is inverted.

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:38.090
Sir, can you open the suitcase, please?

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.759
Sir, we know that you
are inside the suitcase.

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:44.447
Excuse me, did you see
something in this suitcase?

00:00:44.447 --> 00:00:46.437
I was looking here, it seems
there's some metal inside.

00:00:46.437 --> 00:00:48.952
- Can you please unzip it, I can't
touch the suitcase. - Change!

00:00:48.952 --> 00:00:53.322
Can you please perform the
opening, because I think it's gross.

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:00.123
- There's a human being in there!
- Change!

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:03.117
- There's a person in there.
- Change!

00:01:03.117 --> 00:01:08.668
- It's in use!
- So it's occupied...

00:01:09.827 --> 00:01:14.744
Sir, we must check if this
user has more than 3.4 oz.

00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:17.468
It can't...

00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:22.958
- Happy birthday to you...
- Oh, no!

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.082
Change!

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:30.254
Change!

00:01:31.456 --> 00:01:37.243
- Make three wishes...
- Gases are not allowed inside the plane.

00:01:37.243 --> 00:01:40.180
This is very strange,
these two have some key...

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.304
I'll dissipate him from here...

00:01:43.304 --> 00:01:45.484
- I'm gone!
- More!

00:01:45.484 --> 00:01:50.165
- I'm totally desintegrated!
- More!

00:01:51.052 --> 00:01:56.258
He's gone, what a shame!
I'm sorry, I didn't know...

00:01:56.258 --> 00:01:57.962
You'll have to pass
the suitcase again, sir!

00:01:57.962 --> 00:01:59.489
- No problem!
- Change!

00:02:00.084 --> 00:02:03.357
- There, pass it!
- Change!

00:02:03.897 --> 00:02:05.326
Suitcase, what suitcase?

00:02:09.107 --> 00:02:15.748
- We've never had a magician in the airport!
- All right, people, see ya, thanks!

00:02:15.748 --> 00:02:19.214
How come you let
The Great Rufino escape?

00:02:19.214 --> 00:02:22.284
- We didn't let him, he just disappeared!
- That's right!

00:02:22.284 --> 00:02:25.862
First he made the suitcase disappear,
then the boy, and then himself!

00:02:25.862 --> 00:02:29.102
- Interpol is searching for this
man in 180 countries! - More!

00:02:29.102 --> 00:02:33.650
- Interpol is searching for this
man all over the planet! - More!

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.980
Interpol doesn't know his name and
doesn't know if he's in the Milky Way!

00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:42.864
- We're sorry, sir, but we followed the
procedure, and... - The procedure!

00:02:42.864 --> 00:02:45.609
- He circumvented the procedure!
- He left his ID behind!

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.033
- You had it?
- Change!

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:49.577
- Get out!
- Change!

00:02:49.577 --> 00:02:51.855
- Smart boy...
- Cut it out!

00:02:51.855 --> 00:02:53.871
Pass me this ID!

00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:57.420
- This ID is probably fake!
- Probably fake!

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.492
My house has a 'probably' tree
and it doesn't bear any fruits!

00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:05.578
I can see the ID...
Looks like it's not his ID!

00:03:05.783 --> 00:03:07.708
- Whose ID is it?
- It's mine!

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:10.055
It's time...

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:14.683
- This man is playing with our
corporation! - This man?

00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:17.999
It's time for my greatest trick!

00:03:21.888 --> 00:03:23.222
Rufino!

00:03:23.717 --> 00:03:27.537
- Exactly!
- Where's Sérgio?

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.514
- You're playing with us!
- Sérgio?

00:03:32.514 --> 00:03:35.152
- How did you get my ID?
- Sérgio?

00:03:36.226 --> 00:03:38.615
- I've been...
- Junqueira, forget about Sérgio!

00:03:38.615 --> 00:03:40.848
I've been playing with
you for a long time!

00:03:40.848 --> 00:03:47.069
- Sérgio!
- Sérgio is actually my assistant!

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.084
I knew it, those pants
were too tight for him!

00:03:52.717 --> 00:03:54.272
Change!

00:03:59.084 --> 00:04:00.825
More!

00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:08.238
More!

00:04:20.037 --> 00:04:22.639
That was "Quick Change",
ladies and gentlemen!

00:04:22.741 --> 00:04:26.037
You know the best part? When you
said 'change' and Dani was like...

00:04:26.037 --> 00:04:31.822
'More! More'! And at the third one, with
everybody, there was this look: 'Shall we'?

00:04:32.223 --> 00:04:34.823
