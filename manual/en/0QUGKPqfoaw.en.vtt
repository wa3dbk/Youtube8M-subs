Nice to meet you, thanks for coming.

And I think Christopher is going to get here at four.

00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:58.351
We’ll just work...we’ll work just with you solo if that’s okay. Just do a couple moves and shapes and whatever.

[At Mika's Studio]

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:25.915
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:28.947 --> 00:01:43.137
Well basically, you know how a lot of the themes in the show is like about how the body is being controlled by the environment or sort of different elements, modern elements.

00:01:43.184 --> 00:01:45.238
[Mika is talking to her gallery]

00:01:45.284 --> 00:01:48.504
So there’s like these ergonomic chairs that are going to be part of the installation.

00:01:48.504 --> 00:02:02.116
So... that got me thinking about what you know the body can do and whatever and so I started thinking like oh, it would be really cool if there’s a...a salon where there was like a yoga person and a contortionist.

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:07.649
Sort of like doing sort of dance type thing, and I was looking online.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:16.228
There are these different websites for like contortionists united, and people who are amateurs that just want to like showcase their flexibility.

00:02:17.598 --> 00:02:27.477
I think that could be kind of a cool performance idea but I first wanted to run it by you guys and see if that’s a possibility.

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:29.210
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:30.102 --> 00:02:31.749
Do you want to put your coat in here.

00:02:35.982 --> 00:02:38.644
Should we try a little sort of dry run rehearsal thing?

[OMINOUS DRUM BEAT]

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:18.691
Yeah, when you see some of the poses, they really look like the chairs. You know the chairs I have?

00:03:18.691 --> 00:03:22.540
So I like that they’ve become like almost like a sculptural element to the show.

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:32.290
So I think it’ll be cool, but you know like budget wise, is that something that seems feasible? Possible?

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:35.146
Come in, come in.

00:03:39.956 --> 00:03:40.857

Contortionists United social networking site.

00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:48.687
I mean I...I’m confident about installation and the work itself but just to insert one small gesture of like this performative element in the show I think is important.

00:05:48.687 --> 00:05:54.995
So it’s...this is really simple like half hour performance, I think. So that’s the idea.

00:05:57.594 --> 00:06:03.535
Mmm hmm, yeah. Yeah, cool.
