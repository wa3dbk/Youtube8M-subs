00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.930

offered in the family sedan segment but

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.130
Nissan's continuing to offer one with
this

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.380
redesigned all tomorrow both engines
work with a continuously variable

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.890
automatic transmission what was back
seat is actually pretty comfortable for

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.470
adult passengers and it's partly because
ovett elevated seating position

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.720
which gives good I support for taller
people as a couple into the leg room to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.210

a family to get the Ultima benefited
from supply issues from so its

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.510
