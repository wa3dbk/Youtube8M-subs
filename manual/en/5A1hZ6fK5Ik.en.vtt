00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.180
Hi !  Today, a test of the Ditto Looper from TC Electronic.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.180
That costs about 100 euros.  It's a little and simple looper.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.890
5 minutes looping, unlimited overdubs.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.190
It's 24 bits, quite transparent.  Let's try it together...

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.790
It's a little format compared to a classical pedal.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.890
A volume potentiometer, a switch and that's all.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.290
No place enough for a 9v battery

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:58.490
but you can easily find it a place on your pedalboard.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.290
For the technical specifications,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.290
5 minutes looping (it's a very simple pedal

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.590
and the goal is not to record hours),

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.790
unlimited overdubs (you can add as much takes as

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.690
you want), there's a True Bypass

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.890
(when the pedal is not in use, the guitar signal

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.680
is not altered).  There's no latency,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.190
when you hit the switch, the recording or the playback

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.690
begins instantly.  About connectors,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.790
you'll find jack plugs, USB for the updates,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.780
and a 9v connector for power supply.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.390
To make a loop, hit the switch and the recording begins.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.790
Hit the switch again and the loop will be played.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:39.090
As said before, that's a very simple pedal...

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.890
The volume potentiometer works on the loop volume

00:02:43.890 --> 00:03:07.790
and do not modify the guitar volume.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.190
To make an overdub, hit the switch again and

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.780
play over the loop.  You can do that

00:03:17.780 --> 00:04:04.790
with no limits.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.390
There's nothing else to say about the Ditto Looper

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.190
but now, we have a loop so,

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.790
let's play a little guitar impro.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.123
