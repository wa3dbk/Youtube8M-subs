00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
Today we're making a honey ravioli with roquefort cheese.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.380
One of my favorite desserts.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.000
There are so many different things you can make with honey,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.429
but one of my favorite desserts is the honey ravioli with roquefort cheese.

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.470
How do you start? It's fairly easy, don't freak out.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.419
We've got 300 grams of honey that's we are going to caramelise in our pan.

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.649
Then we will cool it down with 200 grams of warm water.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.859
It's very important you take hot water,

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.420
because otherwise the shock is too big.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.379
Your caramel is too hot, the water's too cold and it immediately cools down

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.420
which leads to clumps and we don't want that.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.890
While our honey is melting,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.019
I'm going to put 5 gelatine sheets in cold water.

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.809
To caramelise our honey, we need a temperature of 135 degrees.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.350
You can tell it starts to caramelise when the color starts to turn golden brown.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.609
Be very careful when you're making caramel

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.449
I can tell you: one drop of this and you've got a tattoo for the rest of your life.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.880
134,5... exciting...

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.720
Okay, 135. Now I'm going to pour in the hot water.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.970
Perfect.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.619
There. Now I'm going to add something to keep our jelly together.

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:22.439
I'm using two binding agents:

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.750
Of course our gelatine sheets, but also a bit of agar agar.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.850
I think that when you only use gelatine,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.329
the jelly is too firm and you get clumps.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.740
While agar agar brings a nice balance between the two binding agents.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.039
1,5 grams of agar agar goes in.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.840
And we're mixing that in a bit.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.899
There we go.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.320
Then we have the gelatine sheets going in.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:48.799
Make sure you squeeze the water out.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.430
And you can add them to the warm mass.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.979
You can see the gelatine melts very nicely.

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.880
Now we're pouring the mixture onto some plastic that I covered in some oil.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.520
Don't put too much oil on, though.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.410
So we pour it onto our tray.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.200
I do try to avoid too many air bubbles.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.460
Woops.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.660
And now we're going to let this set in the fridge. Okay?

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.020
Beebedeebabedeeboom.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.140
The next step is the filling of our ravioli.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.900
I'm using roquefort cheese now, but I also like to put in some crunch.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.520
I prefer walnuts. We're not going to put too much in.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.970
Let's chop these into pieces.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.570
Not too small, we don't want the walnuts to become a powder.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.660
I always take 50-50

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.010
So I have 100 grams of cream and 100 grams of roquefort cheese.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.400
I'm cutting it in to small chunks and they go into the cream.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.020
Let's mix this until it's half stiff

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.500
And now I just have to add the walnuts.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.760
Let's put this aside for a moment

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.340
Because in the meantime our gelatine of honey has had the time to set.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.620
Now we already have to bottom part.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.300
Look at what a wonderful cream this is.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.680
And now we just have to close our ravioli.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.920
The color can use some extra pimping

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.270
So I brought edible violets

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.340
and then we have the link

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.200
between the lovely nectar of the flowers and the honey.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.220
A wonderful combination: sweet honey and hearty cheese.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.080
