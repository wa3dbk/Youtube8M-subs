John: Hey, guys.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.920
John here, with Real Truck Garage.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.300
Today we're
going to be installing a K&amp;N air intake system

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.700
onto a 2013
F-150, with the eco-boost engine.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.010
This kit comes with
everything you need, the couplers, clamp kit,

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.190
mass airflow sensors,
adapters, the air box, the intake tube, and

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.740
of course, your air
filter.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.030
So what we're going to do now is, we're going
to go

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.260
ahead and start getting that old system out
of that truck

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.590
to make room for our new K&amp;N system.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.030
The first thing that we're going to do is,
we're going to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.720
go ahead and unplug our mass airflow sensor
from the

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.940
air box.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.790
The next thing that we're going to do is go
ahead and loosen up our clamps.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.400
Now that we've got our clamps loose we can
go ahead and get this tubing out of our way.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.080
And then we can
just take and lay this to the side, because

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.320
we won't
need this anymore.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.650
The next thing we want to do is go ahead and
take our mass

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.540
airflow sensor, that uses an inside torque-type
of

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.000
socket, right on top of the head of the bolt.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.579
What
you want to do is you want to just kind of

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.860
work it back and forth and
wiggle it a little bit, but we have to be

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.030
careful
with these because they're all plastic and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.720
we don't
want to break these.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.350
The next thing is, we go ahead and get the
air box cover

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.720
off and the air filter out.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.860
And what we want to do next is
go ahead and put our mass airflow sensor plate

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.800
onto our
air tube, take this foam gasket and peel the

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.460
backing off it, take the foam
backing and we'll go ahead and put it onto

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.010
the back of our
plate that we're going to be using.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.640
Make sure that
you put it on so that the notches are cut

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.130
out for your
holes.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.590
So the next thing we're going to do is go
ahead and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.250
install this onto our tube.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.860
And once we have that on, what I
like to do to make it a little easier is just

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.010
go ahead
and spray a little carb clean on this rubber

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.600
bushing and then we can go
ahead and install our mass airflow sensor

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.600
into our plate.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.170
The
one thing you want to keep in mind is, when

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.570
you're
tightening up this bolt that holds this sensor

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.800
in place, do not
over tighten this.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.610
The next thing we want to do is go ahead and
take this

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.319
small 1/16th inch tube and cut it into equal
9-inch lengths.

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.450
Now we'll take these pieces and we'll go ahead
and

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.239
attach these to the edges of our air box.

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.099
Now that we've got those on,
we'll go ahead and turn this over and we'll

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.700
attach the larger
one to the top of our box.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.030
And then when you get to the end,
as you can see, you'll have a little excess,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.700
you can go
ahead and just cut that off.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.389
The next thing we want to do is go ahead and
install our

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.480
air tube to air filter connector.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.469
What we want to
make sure is that we put the large end to

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:46.670
the inside.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.540
And we'll go ahead and bolt this on here.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.730
We're going to go ahead and install our air
filter into

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.209
our air box.

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.880
Once you have that tightened down, it's all
ready to go, so what we want to do is just

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.599
go ahead
and take those tabs and slide them back into

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.819
the slots in our air box.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.580
And
go ahead and kind of just push down on it

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.459
a little bit,
use our factory clips.

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.569
The next step is to go ahead and install our
couplers.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.830
With this coupler here, you can see it differs
by the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.059
fact that this one has this bulge in the center.

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:35.840
This
particular coupler is the one that we want

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.059
to attach to air box.

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.739
So I'll go
ahead and slip that one on there.

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.160
Now the smaller one then
will go onto our air intake tube, and then

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.659
the last
one goes down onto our turbo tube.

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:55.159
Then we'll just go ahead and
lay our clamps in here, where we need them.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:06.110
So now we're going to go ahead
and put this tube in here.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.650
Okay, once we get our tube all installed,
then the next

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.799
step is to go ahead and tighten up our clamps.

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.750
The
last step, and it's very important and one

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.859
that we don't
forget, and that is to remember to plug in

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.340
this sensor.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.340
And there you have it.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.590
That's how you put a K&amp;N air intake
system into a 2013 F-150, with the 3.5 eco-boost

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:46.840
turbo
engine.
