Hi my name is David Cantieni and on behalf
of Expert Village. I would like to share with

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.490
you some techniques for learning Irish tunes
by ear. I like to call this segment the more

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:23.460
you learn the easier it gets. I want to start
out very basically...learning any kind of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:32.789
traditional tune is a physical event and we
start with something that you would be intimately.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:46.780
Something like this. You'll notice that I
only using my left hand and there is this

00:00:46.780 --> 00:01:05.960
pattern which is 1,2,3,1,2,3, we can get a
little bit more complicated and go.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:19.270
Okay so you notice in that tune there is some
jumps. So you have to learn how it feels.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.810
And if you are just starting out learning
tunes by ear I would suggest that you pick

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.270
out some tunes that you know very well or
at less in your head and try to find them

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:45.659
on your instrument. Another good one is. Remember
that one. You also might discover that you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:53.091
can start tunes on different notes in other
ways in other words different places on the

00:01:53.091 --> 00:02:06.759
instrument. For instance you can start here.
We can also start here.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:17.120
Right. So try that out on your instrument
and see how it goes.
