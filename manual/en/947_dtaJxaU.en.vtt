This is Randall Powell with Expert Village
and in this clip, I am going to show you how

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.320
to throw a loop, a head loop. To make your
head loop just like I instructed in the previous

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.130
clip, you start out with your loop regular
and just kind of whirl it around there and

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.720
when you run out of room, take another coil.
Your head loop is going to be quite a bit

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.950
smaller so you want to shorten it up and then
you swing your rope from right to left. When

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.820
you swing over, you want to be able to kiss
your hand swinging your rope. So I just swing

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.910
it and pretend you can kiss your hand and
that is going to keep your loop open. That

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.781
is the most important thing is having an open
loop when you are roping. So when you are

00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:46.740
practicing at home, just practice coming around
with your hand and kissing your hand every

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:53.230
time whenever you are coming around. That
really over does it quite a bit but the principal

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.370
is keeping your loop really opened. Whenever
you are throwing a head loop, you come out

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.949
of the box whenever your horse's shoulder
is parallel to the steers hip, you will be

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.610
on the left side of the steer. You start swinging
your rope as you are riding up to the steer

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.499
and then as your head horse gets right to
the steer where his shoulder is parallel with

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:19.889
the steers hip, you deliver your loop. Swinging
the head rope, you are swinging out here in

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:25.590
front and kind of pulling it towards your
target and when you get to your delivery point,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.130
you just release and point your finger at
at the steers right horn and this will send

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.159
your rope around your right to left motion
will naturally send the rope around the steers

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.229
horns. So when you deliver, it is very important
to really enthuse the follow through of the

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.340
rope there as you are coming to the horns
there. So you swing your rope out here in

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.580
the front, aim right at your target and then
right at your delivery you throw right at

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.189
the base of that right horn and like I said,
the right to left flow of the loop will just

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.739
naturally kind of zing it around the horns
there and that is how you throw a head loop.
