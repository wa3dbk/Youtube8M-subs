00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.867
This little model by

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:14.667
Jean Baptiste Carpeaux of his family,

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:22.200
it’s just inches tall, whipped out at a rapid pace; doubt it took him even ten minutes. What may initially look like a few blobs, upon contemplation turns into be a family story.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.367
What may initially

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:22.533
look like a few blobs,

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:22.667
upon contemplation

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.000
turns into be a family story.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.634
Le Trait d’Union is a

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:40.634
French term for hyphen, the healing of the breach between two words.

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:46.433
The child is healing a very difficult relationship between Carpeaux and his wife.

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:52.200
She was charming, everybody loved her. He was rather a beast of a husband.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.233
He set detectives on her tracks because he was jealous.

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:59.867
His little son, who was gravely sick,

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:01.500
when he survived

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.667
brought them back together.

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.333
And Carpeaux let out a stream of mementos

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:10.166
in gratitude for his recovery.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:15.533
I think it would look kitschy as a marble. By being small,

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:20.667
and also by being clay-- which has the most uncanny ability

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:25.266
to evoke human flesh--it’s gotta stay modest and intimate.

00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:29.867
Only the wife is in a very thin little shift,

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:32.000
so that you can read every limb

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.100
unobstructed by clothing. It’s the most expressive way of laying bare a figure’s emotions.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.334
These are made with just pinches of clay.

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:44.667
It’s got his fingerprints on it.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:48.767
He just gouges it out in terribly short order.

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:50.600
From certain points of view,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.634
it doesn’t even make total sense.

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:55.634
You start to feel

00:01:55.634 --> 00:01:58.266
his hands,

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:01.667
and you come to look for it more and more.

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:08.265
I’m fascinated by his relationship with his family; this passionate regard even when he was being a meanie.

00:02:08.265 --> 00:02:16.334
And I think just an impression of the vigor and the economy with which he can express himself.

00:02:16.334 --> 00:02:27.367
The quick sketch can be the most passionate revelation of talent and intimate feelings.
