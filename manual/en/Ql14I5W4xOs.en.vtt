00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.980
How to Eat to Prevent Cancer.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.710
You don't need supplements to prevent cancer
— look to the food you eat every day to

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.501
pack in all the healthy nutrients you need.

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:23.850
You will need Berries Spices Sources of isothiocyanate
Watercress Green tea Sources of folate Brazil

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:35.070
nuts Omega-3-rich fish Garlic Asian mushrooms
Apples Flaxseed Broccoli sprouts and macadamia

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.160
nuts.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.160
Step 1.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.960
Pick up some blackberries; they contain twice
the antioxidant content of blueberries.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.080
Strawberries, cranberries, and raspberries
are cancer-fighters, too.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.080
Step 2.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.680
Curry lovers, rejoice!

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.780
Turmeric, the spice that gives the popular
Indian dish its yellow hue, inhibits the development

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.780
of cancer.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.120
Ginger runs a close second, followed by cinnamon.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.600
Step 3.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.160
Eat your broccoli.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.750
It contains isothiocyanate, a compound that
fights several cancers.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.240
While Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage,
and arugula also have ITCs, broccoli is king

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.549
because it has a particularly potent kind
called sulforaphane.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.899
Broccoli _sprouts_ have the highest concentration
of sulforaphane.

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:20.899
Step 4.

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.850
Munch on watercress and drink green tea.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.670
Both increase the amount of cancer-fighting
antioxidants in your blood, and watercress

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.950
protects your DNA from changes that can trigger
cancer.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.979
Step 5.

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.119
Enjoy a bunch of asparagus; it contains the
B vitamin folate, which may reduce the risk

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.710
of several cancers.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.649
Other good sources of folate are orange juice,
lentils, spinach, peanuts, and broccoli.

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:45.649
Step 6.

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.429
Go nuts — as long as they're Brazil nuts.

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.509
They contain selenium, which fights cancer
cells.

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.509
Go for the unshelled ones, which have more
selenium.

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.420
But limit yourself to one large or two small
freshly-shelled nuts per day, as too much

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.700
selenium is toxic.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.959
Macadamia nuts contain almost as much selenium
as Brazil nuts.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:07.959
Step 7.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.069
Eat fish a few of times a week.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.940
An Italian study found that people who eat
fish twice a week reduce their risk of developing

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.630
several cancers by 30% to 50%.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.080
Go with Omega-3-rich fish like salmon, sardines,
mackerel, and tuna.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.100
Step 8.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.610
Indulge in garlicky foods.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.080
Fans of this pungent bulb have a lower risk
of stomach and colon cancer because cooked

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.140
garlic inhibits cancer cells from growing.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.140
Step 9.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.780
Consume more Asian mushrooms -- in lab tests,
shitakes repressed cancer cell growth.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.890
Also try maitake, zhu ling, enoki, and red
reishi mushrooms.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.920
Step 10.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.020
An apple a day may keep the _oncologist_ away.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.300
Studies have found that when pulverized apple
skins were placed in a petri dish with colon

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.780
cancer cells, the cells' growth was inhibited
by an impressive 43%.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.130
So don't peel before eating!

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.310
Step 11.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.480
Incorporate flaxseed into your diet.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.230
In a Canadian study, women diagnosed with
breast cancer who ate a daily flaxseed muffin

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.410
for 40 days showed a statistically significant
reduction in the size of their tumor compared

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.840
with a control group.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.240
Did you know The lowest rates of cancer in
the world are in the Japanese regions Uji

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.620
and Shizuoka, where most of that country's
green tea is harvested.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.220
People in those areas drink more high quality
green tea per capita than residents of any

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.319
other area of Japan.
