00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.100
TSB's banking model is simple: customers deposit money with them

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.279
and TSB pays those people

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.660
interest in return. That interest is a 'cost'
to the bank.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.150
TSB uses the vast majority of those deposits
to lend money to other customers in the form

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.010
of mortgages, personal and small business
loans, credit cards and overdrafts.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.400
The interest rates they charge customers for
loans are typically higher than the interest

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.480
rates they pay to their savings customers.
The difference in these rates creates an income

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.769
and currently makes up most of the total income
from which TSB runs the bank.

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.559
They also generate some income from fees,
charges and other products they provide, like

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.739
Home Insurance.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.749
Charges are also made to customers who fail
to repay their loans on time or go over their

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.579
overdraft limits.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.889
As well as the interest they pay to their
customers there are other costs the bank has

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:03.329
to bear. A key one is employing their 8,500
staff throughout Britain who are working to

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.270
meet the needs of their customers.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.840
To develop and maintain services TSB provides,
including the essential security of their

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.789
systems, also requires a significant investment
each year.

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:20.109
And there will also be occasions when, due
to changing personal circumstances, some of

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:25.409
their customers are unable to pay back what's
been lent to them. So the bank must be prepared

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.180
for that cost.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.049
Finally it's imperative that TSB has sufficient
capital and liquidity, so that it can continue

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.359
to meet customers' needs should the economy
hit difficult times again.

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:42.530
Any profits the bank makes after these costs
are taken into consideration are either retained

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.350
for future investment or returned to shareholders.
The bank's board decides which.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.799
So. That's it.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.060
You won't find TSB doing a lot of the 'funny
stuff' that other banks do, like investment banking,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.969
overseas speculation or big corporate
finance.

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.549
They spend their time doing things that directly
help the people in the local communities they

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.859
operate in, right across the country.

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.340
That's what they mean by 'Local banking for
Britain'.
