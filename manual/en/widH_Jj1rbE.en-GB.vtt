00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.180
Hello, my name is Rebecca,

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.156
that's me and today, I'm going to Draw My Life for you.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.420
I was born on the 4th of December 1992 to my parents, Julia and Colin.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.120
I was shortly followed by my siblings, Eleanor and Gregory.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.120
Due to being so close in age, we were more like Triplets, dubbed "The Terrible Trio".

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.360
Right up until our late teens, I was the tallest and the bossiest!

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.100
I would force them to partake in my homemade films, short plays music concerts and later YT videos.

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:38.494
Oh and I should mention our cats.

00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:40.613
My cats have been a huge part of my life

00:00:40.613 --> 00:00:43.394
and my family and I are massive cat lovers.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.020
*MEOWS*

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.460
I think that when I'm older, I'm going to be a cat lady (of sorts!).

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.860
They're so cute.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.700
In 1999 my family and I moved to Maldon

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.100
and although I wasn't born there, I consider it to be my hometown.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.021
In my teens I would ride out to the sea and stand by Byrthnorth.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.220
The smell of the sea will always remind me of home.

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.773
Primary school was difficult at first.

00:01:06.773 --> 00:01:09.274
I was terrified of my monster teachers.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.620
I spent my lunch times with the school choir and discovered a passion for singing and acting.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.060
I played the leads in our school productions such as "Oliver" and later "Mary Poppins".

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.620
I was less confident when I was away from the stage.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.160
My head teacher once said that I should be allowed to enter my exams as Miss Poppins

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.834
as when performing, my confidence soared.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.040
Oh I wish!

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.020
It's here that I should tell you that I have a condition called Trichotillomania.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.280
To summarise: it means I lose the majority of my hair on a regular basis.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.420
Around the age of ten the hair loss became noticable

00:01:42.454 --> 00:01:45.414
and has increased in severity as I've grown.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.240
So I have been through a variety of hairstyles.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.600
At eighteen, I started wearing wigs.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.500
Although I don't depend on my wigs

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.687
they're just there if I need them.

00:01:54.687 --> 00:01:56.433
Baldness doesn't scare me.

00:01:56.953 --> 00:01:58.873
Secondary school was tough.

00:01:58.873 --> 00:02:02.720
It's difficult to summarise several complicated years into a few seconds.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.254
My crooked teeth, half-missing hair, unpopular interests,

00:02:06.254 --> 00:02:07.753
and social awkwardness

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.640
provoked bullies and strong isolation.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.100
I struggled really hard just trying to make friends and

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.260
that caused so many problems.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.700
I hated school, tremendously.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.120
How we ever made it through our GCSE's I will never know.

00:02:22.373 --> 00:02:23.860
Maths was my worst nightmare.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.391
The only subjects I looked forward to were Art, Drama and English.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.040
In 2005, I discovered YT

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.947
and I've continued posting videos online for nearly a decade!

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.040
Blimey!

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.780
At the start, it was a completely different world that offered me a place to escape from my reality.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.980
I could log on, find people from all over the world just like me and express myself through my photos and videos.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.300
I felt like I had a home.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.140
College wasn't great.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.120
I spent two years with my headphones practically glued to my ears

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.062
in an attempt to motivate myself

00:02:58.062 --> 00:03:00.494
whilst producing uninteresting work for deadlines 

00:03:00.494 --> 00:03:02.014
and meeting specifications.

00:03:03.075 --> 00:03:05.795
I was diagnosed with Depression in 2010.

00:03:05.795 --> 00:03:08.494
I guess I'd suffered with Depression somewhat since I was a child...

00:03:08.494 --> 00:03:10.940
...however things hit a whole new level at 18.

00:03:10.973 --> 00:03:13.633
I spent days then weeks, months

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:15.035
locked away in my room

00:03:15.035 --> 00:03:16.140
blaring Coldplay (Band),

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.074
creating videos, ranting online and

00:03:18.074 --> 00:03:21.154
tearing out my hair to point of being completely bald.

00:03:21.154 --> 00:03:22.974
My college studies plummeted,

00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:25.194
Universities declined my applications,

00:03:25.194 --> 00:03:26.533
I was even hospitalised.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.900
And I couldn't smile or laugh.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.949
The stars were going out, one by one,

00:03:31.114 --> 00:03:33.194
and I felt trapped in darkness.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.000
I wanted to kill myself or die in my sleep.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.520
And I NEVER want to feel that amount of pain again.

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:42.227
*Breathes*. Deep breath.

00:03:42.934 --> 00:03:45.494
In 2009, I met a man who changed my life.

00:03:45.774 --> 00:03:49.774
Not only was he my friend but he was my sparkle in my darkness.

00:03:49.994 --> 00:03:54.874
He held my hand as world came crumbling down and he helped me stand back up.

00:03:55.574 --> 00:03:59.494
I truly believe that he is the reason I'm still alive today.

00:04:00.054 --> 00:04:03.174
At the start of 2013, he vanished unexpectedly

00:04:03.174 --> 00:04:06.360
and it's been hard adapting to my life without him.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.720
It's been a painful part of my life but I feel much better now,

00:04:10.594 --> 00:04:11.394
I'm "okay".

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.400
Anyway, back to education.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.895
I managed to get into University (Horray!)

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.960
And I took the chance to break free from home.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.160
UNI provided me with a little freedom and independence.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.320
However it was clear early on that the whole experience was not for me.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.694
The extrovert, spare-time, weird schedule, drunk, sex, party, study - lifestyle and I clashed

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.680
violently.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.400
Apart from attending my lectures and lessons, 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.814
I spent the year I was at UNI, locked in my cell-of-a-room.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.660
Spiralling back into suicidal feelings once again, just watching the world out of my window.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.240
Truthfully, education overall has been a bit of a frustrating and crushing experience.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.715
Especially as a student that favours artistic and creative subjects.

00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:59.293
University was a truly damaging period for me and I feel it crushed my creativity and aspirations.

00:04:59.293 --> 00:05:02.396
I walked of UNI, after completing the first year

00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:06.033
and I waltzed straight into a summer film school in NY.

00:05:06.033 --> 00:05:11.094
That summer was both hard work and liberating in more ways than I can express!

00:05:11.094 --> 00:05:16.973
I'm currently on my last year of a BA in Practical Filmmaking and I cannot wait to graduate.

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:24.133
I've lost the fire I once had and wish to return to the passions I had before my disorders controlled my life choices.

00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:26.980
I feel lost in regards to what direction to move forward with my life

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.940
and whether or not I actually have the chance or the skill to be able to do the things I wish to do.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.854
On a lighter note: I've had some amazing opportunities and experiences

00:05:34.854 --> 00:05:37.268
some of which would not have occurred without you guys.

00:05:37.268 --> 00:05:38.253
Which reminds me, 

00:05:38.253 --> 00:05:41.693
THANK YOU for love and support over the last decade online.

00:05:41.693 --> 00:05:44.067
You have no idea of the impact you have in my life

00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:46.014
and how much I appreciate your support.

00:05:46.014 --> 00:05:48.000
Okay, well that's the end of the video

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.333
but not the journey.

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:51.034
'Not all who wander are lost'

00:05:51.373 --> 00:05:54.013
And I have my entire life to find myself,

00:05:54.013 --> 00:05:56.100
with you guys helping me through.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.020
BOO!

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.840
Yay, I finally did it!

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.133
It's taken a year and a half to put this together.

00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:08.374
It's so difficult trying to summarise your life into a couple of minutes.

00:06:08.374 --> 00:06:11.654
Oooh, and thank you to CMA for allowing me to use the music.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.860
Badabooom!

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.340
Thank you for watching, guys.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.800
And I shall see you all soon.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.800
Bye!
