00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.360
Let's talk about playing bass notes on the
accordion.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.620
One thing that I would say that's really important
is that you stand in front of a mirror.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.090
Not only is it important to be able to see
what you're doing, but you need to feel it

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.750
and see it at the same time until you get
a handle of what goes on with the left hand.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.910
Something that's helped my left hand playing
has been to run scales with my left hand in

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.240
every position possible.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.860
Let's start with a basic C scale, starting
on the fundamental bass note line with the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.670
C. Then, circle of fifths, the next note up
in the line would be G.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.110
We're going to skip that to go to the D. Moving
to the counter bass row, the first row just

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:06.100
above the C, there's your E. Back to the fundamental
bass note line F. Skipping over the C to the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:25.510
G. Counter bass row to the A. To the B. Back
to the C.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.640
I think if you just keep running those scales
over and over it really will help your left

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.980
hand playing, even saying them as you go,
C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. Just doing them over

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.820
and over.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.159
What's great is because the accordion is set
up in the circle of fifths you can do that

00:01:48.159 --> 00:02:06.500
anywhere on the instrument, even at the other
end.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.670
I think by going over these scales you can
really begin to have a grasp of what needs

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.360
to happen with the left hand in your playing.
