00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.070
BETH HOYT: Hey, you guys.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.550
Welcome back.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.230
Look who's here.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.390
It's Steve Rannazzisi.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.660
STEVE RANNAZZISI: I'm
here in the flesh.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.220
That's right.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.900
And I want to apologize for
the other day because I

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.700
thought that we were just going
to do an interview.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.370
And then when I realized that
you were just trying to mike

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.365
me up, then I realized
we probably should

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:20.640
have just had sex.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.990
BETH HOYT: OK.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.600
STEVE RANNAZZISI:
With each other.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.390
BETH HOYT: Yeah.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.020
STEVE RANNAZZISI: That's good.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.750
BETH HOYT: So that's
out there.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.590
STEVE RANNAZZISI: Mm-hm.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.250
BETH HOYT: We missed
our opportunity.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.370
I just have regular questions.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.270
I mean, we're just going to
talk through it today.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.630
STEVE RANNAZZISI: OK.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.650
Are they about sex?

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.000
Or--

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.320
BETH HOYT: Well, the
first one kind of.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.630
So you have two young boys?

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.430
Children?

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.405
STEVE RANNAZZISI: Yes.

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:36.780
Yes, I do have two young boys.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.660
BETH HOYT: I'm very comfortable
with the children.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.010
I know how to bring
up this issue.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.310
STEVE RANNAZZISI:
I can see that.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.530
BETH HOYT: So you've birthed--

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.540
STEVE RANNAZZISI: I have not
given birth to two young-- but

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.440
I have been part of--

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.360
BETH HOYT: Been partnered--

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.970
STEVE RANNAZZISI: I've been
partnered with a person that

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.000
gave birth to two children.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.138
BETH HOYT: Sure.

00:00:49.138 --> 00:00:50.220
OK, now I understand
how that works.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.900
OK.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.290
Kind of.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.740
STEVE RANNAZZISI: OK.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.190
BETH HOYT: Sure.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.870
STEVE RANNAZZISI: I'll explain
the rest later.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.346
BETH HOYT: Yeah.

00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:56.480
We don't have time.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.790
Anyway, so you have two--

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.370
STEVE RANNAZZISI: I have
two boys, yes.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.280
BETH HOYT: And one
is very new.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.080
STEVE RANNAZZISI: One
is two weeks old.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.530
BETH HOYT: Wow.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.900
STEVE RANNAZZISI: He's
still very fresh.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.303
BETH HOYT:Really?

00:01:02.303 --> 00:01:03.110
STEVE RANNAZZISI: Yeah.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.400
BETH HOYT: Just a little red--

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.239
STEVE RANNAZZISI: He still
has his umbilical

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.530
cord attached to him.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.490
You know how that works?

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.380
No, you don't.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.200
It's--

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.050
BETH HOYT: See, that is one of
those things where I don't

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.785
know if that's a joke or not.

00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:14.260
STEVE RANNAZZISI: I would be
like, oh, here's my baby.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.960
And you'd be like, what?

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.440
No, I swear to you, there's like
a little nubbin of the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.715
umbilical cord that falls off.

00:01:18.715 --> 00:01:20.600
BETH HOYT: Didn't some celebrity
recently also keep

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.000
the bellybutton on
for a long time?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.460
STEVE RANNAZZISI: Some people
keep parts and things that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.890
happen in the birth, and
they make soups.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.530
BETH HOYT: Oh, yes.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.290
STEVE RANNAZZISI:
That's all true.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.735
BETH HOYT: Yeah.

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:31.340
STEVE RANNAZZISI: And we
didn't do any of that.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.740
BETH HOYT: She looks--

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.310
I mean, yeah.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.790
OK.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.300
That's good.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.810
STEVE RANNAZZISI: We
didn't do-- there's

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.020
no soup in my house.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.350
BETH HOYT: Yeah.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.367
STEVE RANNAZZISI: No umbilical
soup for me.

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:37.201
BETH HOYT: Oh.

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:38.190
No soup for you.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.120
No baby soup.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.300
Are you not sleeping then
because you have this newborn?

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.170
STEVE RANNAZZISI: I sleep
great because my

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.720
three-year-old comes
into the room.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.480
And then he can't sleep
at night so I bring

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.520
him back to his room.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.640
And then I sleep in
his room with him.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.060
BETH HOYT: You're sneaky.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.430
STEVE RANNAZZISI: Eight and
a half hours straight.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.120
So I think--

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.980
BETH HOYT: So you're like,
oh, honey, don't worry.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.165
I'll take care of him.

00:01:57.165 --> 00:01:57.460
STEVE RANNAZZISI: Yeah,
yeah, babe.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.980
I got him.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.090
Don't worry about it.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.730
But meanwhile, it's all a game
to go to my own place to sleep

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.820
for awhile.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.310
BETH HOYT: That's good.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.360
But then you have to deal with
being in a little bed with--

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.680
STEVE RANNAZZISI: No.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.285
BETH HOYT: But it's a good
bonding time for you and--

00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:07.740
STEVE RANNAZZISI: No.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.240
No, no, no, no.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.240
Because I bring him into
the room and then I

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.690
have him fall asleep.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.520
And then I go to the guest
bedroom and go to the big bed

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.740
and fall asleep.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.040
And then in the morning,
I go back--

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.190
BETH HOYT: You've completely won
the new parent situation.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.670
STEVE RANNAZZISI: Yeah.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.790
No, it's called figuring
out the system.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.882
And if you're not smart enough
to do that, well, then you

00:02:24.882 --> 00:02:25.430
don't get any sleep.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.710
BETH HOYT: Yeah.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.930
STEVE RANNAZZISI: No
sleep for you.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.180
BETH HOYT: No sleep.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.470
You are your character,
kind of.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.540
Then I guess you're
a little bit.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.970
I mean, not--

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.200
STEVE RANNAZZISI: No,
not that bad.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.150
I mean I--

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.410
my character's--

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.230
yeah, I'm a little bit
like my character.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.710
BETH HOYT: But you did use your
son in Daddy Knows Best.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.160
STEVE RANNAZZISI: I did.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.710
Well, yes.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.230
I used my son-- my real son--
for a couple of them.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.480
And then my real son
was unavailable.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.190
BETH HOYT: That's him in
the shark tank, right?

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.290
STEVE RANNAZZISI: Him
in the shark tank.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.440
BETH HOYT: He's crazy cute.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.460
STEVE RANNAZZISI: And then
in the swim class.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.900
And then the rest of the time,
it's another baby.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.600
BETH HOYT: You just switched
out the babies.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.810
STEVE RANNAZZISI: My son
wasn't available.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.810
He got too expensive.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.250
And he's booking a lot
of things now.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.570
So what are you going to do?

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.620
BETH HOYT: In with the next.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.990
STEVE RANNAZZISI: Yep.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.550
BETH HOYT: Next.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.170
How different is it filming an
internet show versus being on

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.830
a TV show [INAUDIBLE] process?

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.820
STEVE RANNAZZISI: Well, for me,
it's not that different

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.320
because The League, we get to
kind of mess around and say

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.370
what we want to say.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.690
And--

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.820
but I brought that to this.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.150
It's very kind of
semi-improvised.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.960
There's a script, but
there's not--

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.030
we can kind of [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.060
BETH HOYT: Do you enjoy that,
improvising [INAUDIBLE]?

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.500
STEVE RANNAZZISI: I do.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.720
I do enjoy that.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.890
BETH HOYT: Do you ever wish that
it was just written out

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.280
for you, and you could come
in and just do your job?

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.810
STEVE RANNAZZISI: Yeah,
I've done that.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.550
And it's great.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.900
And when you have great writers,
it's awesome to do

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.510
that material.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.600
But it's also-- there's
something fun about talking

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.850
the way people really talk.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.010
I don't know when you're
going to talk.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.390
You don't know when I'm
going to stop talking.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.960
BETH HOYT: Exactly.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.190
STEVE RANNAZZISI: So we may
interrupt each other.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.610
We may step on each
other's words.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.310
But it happens.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.710
BETH HOYT: Right.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.440
Are you done?

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.170
I was just making sure.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.630
Just kidding.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.090
STEVE RANNAZZISI: Ooh.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.550
Awkward.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.670
BETH HOYT: God.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.400
No, it's not.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.880
It's just we're completely
shrouded in awkwardness.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.940
STEVE RANNAZZISI: It's still
just a lot of sexual tension.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.410
BETH HOYT: We have this
really weird--

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.990
I don't know if you
guys saw it.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.930
I don't know if we caught
footage and played the video.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.720
But we had an incident
on Monday.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.490
STEVE RANNAZZISI: We did.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.255
BETH HOYT: You guys, we're
going to cut to

00:03:59.255 --> 00:04:00.150
a video right now.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.190
We'll get back to you with your
Twitter questions and

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.380
YouTube questions.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.070
We're going to play a video.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.820
And the treat right now is that
you get to throw to it,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.032
because it's yours.

00:04:07.032 --> 00:04:09.150
STEVE RANNAZZISI: Oh, I get to--
yeah, this is my-- this

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.820
