00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.430
The Rio Pro Printer by Ultra Electronics
Card Systems is a powerful tool 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.400
for creating ID badges.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.550
To keep your Rio Pro working properly,
you should clean the printer every time

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.689
you change the dye-film ribbon.

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.759
to do this, you will need your Rio Pro
turned on,

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.289
a new clean card and cleaning pen

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.789
as well as the new blue sticky-roller
that comes in every package of dye-film.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.090
First, remove the card hopper

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.190
and open the printer to remove
the dye-film ribbon

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.420
and the blue sticky-roller underneath it.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.730
Remove the metal bar from this blue roller
and set it aside in a safe place.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.909
Use the menu on the front of the printer

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.480
and navigate to the 
'Clean Rollers' option.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.760
Use the keys to work through the
guidance messages,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.470
ensuring your printer is ready for cleaning.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.470
Open the pouch containing the new 
cleaning card and remove the card.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.280
Select 'Yes' on the printer

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.060
and insert the small end
of the cleaning card

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.360
into the slot on the front

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.370
of the Rio Pro.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.340
While the card is in the printer

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.180
deposits left by the printing process are
being removed with the alcohol in the card.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.659
I recommend flipping the card
and repeating this process

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.450
at least two to four times

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.450
in order to get everything really clean.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.940
The cleaning process takes only a few
seconds and when it's done you can

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.990
clearly see the result.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.790
Sometimes, the Rio Pro's
rollers may be really dirty.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.570
In this case, you will need
to manually clean them

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.240
Leave the automatic cleaning mode
and select move card from the main menu.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.480
Fold the cleaning card in half
and press it onto the main middle roller

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.410
while holding down one 
of the move card buttons.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.899
Move the cleaning card back and forth
for around fifteen to twenty seconds.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.849
When you are done, you can 
clearly see the dirt and debris

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.849
removed by this process.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.900
You may also wish to clean 
the rear intake roller.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.420
Turn the printer around and hold the
upward move card button

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.420
while pressing the cleaning card onto
the rear roller for fifteen to twenty seconds.

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:29.910
Again,

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.589
this cleaning process
leaves a clear result.

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.959
Finally, it is important to clean
the printhead on the Rio Pro

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.059
Gently move the pen across the 
printhead's Teflon surface to remove

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:43.339
any dust or residue.

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:47.879
After cleaning, you will install a
new blue sticky-roller into the printer.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.079
Remove the blue roller from the 
dye-film box and insert the metal bar

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.199
which was set aside earlier.

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:58.679
Unwrap the roller and snap it into
place directly above the orange roller

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.719
towards the back of the unit.

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:09.719
Remove the new roll of dye-film
from the box and unwrap it.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.099
Place the dye-film into the printer
exactly as shown.

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.839
Gently close the lid of the printer and
replace the card hopper in the back of

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:23.219
the unit.

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:26.409
Your Rio Pro is clean
and ready to print.

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.339
