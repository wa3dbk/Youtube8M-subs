00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.380
Welcome at the start of the Africa Eco Race 2014.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.460
The Africa Eco Race follows up the thirty-year tradition of African racing, mostly known as the Paris-Dakar.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.660
This race doesn’t begin in Paris, but in a nice seaside resort of St.Cyprien.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.720
Our team - Tomáš Tomeček’s Livescore - is now going through the scrutineering.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:30.320
During next 14 days, both of us will be in charge of updating you with the latest news and photos from the race.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.900
Every day, you will find videos and travelogue from the race on youtube or T.Tomeček’s website.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.860
You can also watch the videos on the Czech channel Sport 5.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:53.520
During next 2 weeks, we will visit Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, and finish in Senegal near its capital city, Dakar.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.060
Our team contains 11 people: I and Honza are the press guys, and this is the rest…

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.000
Hi, I’m Tomáš Tomeček, I’m a racer and drive a Tatra.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.680
I team with Vojta Morávek and we are heading for the next Africa Eco Race.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.640
I’m Vojtěch Morávek and I’m a navigator of the racing truck no.400 piloted by Tomáš Tomeček.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.480
I’m Jaroslav Žerdík and I’m in charge of service.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.520
I’m Pavel Kletenský and I take care of Tomáš’s Tatra.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.780
I’m Petr Foltýn and I’m a balai driver.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.840
I’m Theodor Tzonov and I’m a navigator of a balai truck.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.280
I’m Petr Kostelník and I’m a driver of the truck Balai 2.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.540
I’m Patrik Pavlačík and I navigate a balai truck.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.260
I’m Ján Baumgartner and I’m a press car driver.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:58.020
As you can see, our large team includes the racing team, service team, but also two crews of the balai trucks.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.660
These crews get into the stage as the last and help those in troubles.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.380
They are also called “sweeping trucks”.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.660
They are prepared by our team, but fall under full control of the organisers.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.040
Scrutineering is followed by a ceremonial start at 6 pm.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.140
Then, we’ll move 1200 km further to a Spanish port and cross the Mediterranean to Morocco.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.100
It means that there won’t be any video tomorrow.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.240
We’ll be looking forward to you from the first Moroccan stage.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.620
Keep your fingers crossed for Tomáš and his Tatra.
