Hi. I'm Eric Fingerhut. I'm incredibly honored
by the decision of Hillel's Board of Directors

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.889
to appoint me as President. I want to thank
the Board, especially the search committee,

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.219
for their confidence in me. For nearly 90
years, Hillel has been a crown jewel of the

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.720
Jewish community. It's entrusted with our
most precious resource, our young people,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.599
and with our most solemn duty to build a future
of the Jewish people and Israel. Hillel does

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.310
this by engaging, inspiring and supporting
young Jewish adults and Jewish life on campuses

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.180
across the United States and across the world.
Hillel does what I love to do most. It works

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.630
within higher education, in the world of ideas
and debate and exploration. It supports public

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.130
service and advances social action, so the
Jewish values come alive every day. It creates

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.910
confident Jewish leaders, so they can contribute
to the Jewish people their entire lives. And

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.760
it inspires students to embrace Israel, and to connect with their heritage here and around

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.140
the world.
While my professional career has prepared

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.970
me to lead this dynamic and complex global
organization, it's my Jewish upbringing that

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.720
drives my passion for Hillel. My parents were
first generation in this country. I was raised

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.720
in a loving Jewish home and community. I've
been President of a Conservative congregation,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.020
and I have two sisters who are active in their
congregations, one Orthodox and the other

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.170
Reform. And so I love the energy and diversity
of Jewish life. And I believe it's leading

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.780
us to new heights of learning and achievement
as a people.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.850
Rabbi Joseph Telushkin wrote that Hillel the
Elder, after whom our organization was named,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.850
was not only arguably Judaism's greatest Rabbinic
sage, but also its most fearlessly inclusive

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.890
one. Hillel the man believed in bringing people
together, in welcoming people, and in listening

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.100
carefully to each other's points of view,
what today we sometimes call the big tent.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.010
He did these things out of his love for the
Jewish people, and out of his desire to see

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.190
our ethical and spiritual values embraced
and carried forward by future generations.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.190
And that's what Hillel the organization does
every day, on more than 550 campuses all around

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.670
the world.
As Hillel's President, I will strive to follow

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.400
Hillel's teachings and bring his love of the
Jewish people and Israel to the Hillel movement.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.280
Now I'll spend the next few months getting
to know the organization in detail, meeting

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.760
its professional leaders and partners, learning
about their challenges and successes. I hope

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.700
that as part of this process, I'll get to
know also the millions of people who have

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.630
supported Hillel so generously and whose lives
have been shaped by Hillel, because Hillel

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.520
is not just for the campus. It's for the community,
and it's for all of us, the entire Jewish

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.480
people. And so it has to represent who we
are as a people, where we've been, where we're

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.849
going, what we believe, and what matters to
us. So that's my goal, and I hope we'll achieve

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:09.220
it together. Follow me on Twitter. I'll be
reaching out to you, but please don't waitto

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.550
share with me your ideas, your hopes and dreams
for Hillel. I want and I need to hear from

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.099
you. Thanks for watching.
