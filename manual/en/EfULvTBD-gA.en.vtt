00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.940

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.720

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.180

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.430
...for a while...

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.500
then....

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.020
..when..the...

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.900
...when the Beast try to attack the familiars..

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.840
...as you see...

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.780
he get blocked there

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.720
and

00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:02.461
he can't move so you can

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.800
easily

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.220
take he down

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.360
as you see

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.640
for the items

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.660
we don't have

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.480
many items...

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.240
just the Drow Ranger

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.280
and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.320
Visage

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.300
late........had buyed some Dedalus and

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.940
Butterfly

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.680
so....

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.820
in this way you can do

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.800
all the damage that you need for

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.260
