00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.080
In this video, I'll show you how to

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.700
create this really easy Halloween bride look.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.920
Start by applying a light grey face

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.980
paint all over the face.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.880
Use a dark grey face paint to go

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.840
underneath the cheekbones and around the

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.080
forehead to add dimension.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.000
Next, use a black face paint underneath

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.060
the cheekbones to make your face look

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.840
really hollow and gaunt.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.240
Line your waterline with a black eyeliner and then

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.300
apply it really roughly on the eyelids

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.000
and underneath the eye.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.710
Use a wet cotton bud to distress the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.270
makeup around the eyes even further.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.310
Next, take a black eye shadow through the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.880
eye socket.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.600
Use the wet cotton bud again to drag

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.060
down the black makeup, to make it look

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.620
like you've been crying. You could also apply some

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.320
lip gloss over the top to keep them

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.080
looking wet, like fresh tears.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.300
I'm applying the grey lipstick to make my

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.600
lips look smaller and pale, and then I'm

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.640
applying a purple lipstick just in the centre.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.800
Then just finish off the look

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.200
with some white contacts and a corpse

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.200
bride bouquet.
