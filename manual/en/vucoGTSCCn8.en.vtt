00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.360
Hi, how are you?

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.340
Today we're going to test one of those called 'casual games'

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.040
Name is Smash and it's looking for funding on Kickstarter

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.590
and it can be played with the Oculus Rift and the Razer Hydra

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.539
The goal is to destroy various pieces of fruit thrown to us

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.600
using our own hands, and we'll also have some weapons

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.069
Take look at the game mechanics

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.989
Well, this is Smash

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.350
You can see

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.970
it starts slowly

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.130
A little fruit from time to time

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.020
I must say that I've tried it before on my monitor instead of the Rift

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.640
and I found it much more difficult

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.090
because with the Oculus, being in 3D

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.040
It's easier to tell the exact spatial position of the fruits

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.080
With the monitor you see it bigger and bigger

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.360
but with the Oculus you really can tell when it's about to hit you

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.680
So, this is a casual game that can really benefit from the Oculus

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.920
We won't be always shooting bullets in Doom!

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.080
This is fun for the whole family

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.480
Now I'm waiting to get some kind of weapon

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.320
Using our hands gets old easily

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.320
Their number is already increasing, so it's getting more complicated

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.960
The 3D perception of the fruits works really well here

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.280
A katana!

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.280
Now I only need the Kill Bill costume

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.620
But it would look better in Uma Thurman's body!

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.620
This is

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.680
This is easy

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.680
The 3D effect works really well

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.380
I couldn't grab it, I think it was a lightsaber

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.149
from Star Wars

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.669
A baseball bat over here

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.669
This one?

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:15.719
Almost

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:22.599
I got it!

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.719
Dual handed now!

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.009
It's starting to get stifling...

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:33.829
They come really fast!

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.669
But it's a game that can be quite addictive

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:41.049
Especially with the family

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.739
I don't know if it will have some kind of mode...

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.739
Let's see if I can grab... yeah, firearms

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.529
Aiming is not bad at all

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:04.079
But I still prefer the katana

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:07.159
A baseball bat

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.429
I hope the Kickstarter goes well

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.429
It's a fun game

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.849
Bullets are depleted so soon

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.719
Now I don't know what hit me! Lots of fruit corpses around me

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.079
Time's running out, running out!

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.229
779500 points, not bad!

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:59.269
So

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:07.529
I guess the final version will have more scenarios

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:12.259
and more game modes, it can be a fun and entertaining game

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:14.169
Anyone can play it

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:20.529
The 3D effect helps to hit the fruit

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:26.479
Come down!

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.019
Yes, it came down

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:36.909
Ok, see you soon!
