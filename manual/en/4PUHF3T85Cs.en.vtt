Hi, I'm Nathan Turner, here at my store in Los Angeles, 
and I wanted to talk about mood boards.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.060
When I'm approaching a room, I will often times start with a color,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.739
or a piece of tile, or even an image of something that 
I saw on a trip, 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:35.029
and so I like to lay it out, and put it on a board, 
and then start building upon that image, 

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:39.680
or images that I've started with. 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.430
Mood boards are a really good way to edit your process,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.430
because one of the hardest things, I think, 
about decorating is anticipating what things are going to look like,

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:57.620
I find this so often with my clients that they love a color, 
or they really like a fabric,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.470
but they just can't visualize what it's going 
to look like when it's splashed all over a room.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.050
Mood boards are also a really great way for you to 
play with ideas, and

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.050
to have time to see what things are going to look like, and

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.980
there's no rush with a mood board, you don't have 
to do this in an afternoon.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.970
A really important aspect of doing a mood board is 
bringing in the fabric and color and

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.210
textures that you want to implement into the room,  

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.490
and Pottery Barn's design services are fantastic because 
they have Benjamin Moore paint samples, 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.780
they have carpet samples, and fabric swatches. You can even 
get a wood finish, so you can see how it relates to wood, 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.610
and existing pieces that you may have. 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.690
It's always great to start with an electronic layout of the room. 
This is really important for

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.510
furniture placement and furniture scale, which is something 
that a lot of people get wrong.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.000
It's fantastic because you can do it at home with Pottery barn's room planner, 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.930
it's going to keep you really organized and 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.930
it's also a way to keep you really focused on the scale and layout of the furniture. 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.290
And then you print it out and put it on the board so 
it relates back to everything, 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.850
and you can kind of have an idea of which fabrics 
are going to go on which pieces,

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.729
and it's all laid out right there for you. 
It's kind of the most important step.

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:36.740
Color is so difficult for most people, it's one of the most common questions 
I'm asked as a decorator,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.770
is how do you anticipate what a color is going to look like?

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.200
I think mood boards are a great tool for this because you 
can see color in relation to other things,  

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.760
your existing furniture, furniture that you are going to be purchasing, 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.730
you can see what color is going to look like on a big scale.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.890
So I'm doing this living room mood board, and I 
started with two things, 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.040
a photograph of me in Mexico City in front an amazing tiled wall,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.460
that I just could never get out of my head, and then,  

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.449
these African beads, which I really love the color combination.

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:16.290
So these are a unique item that you usually wouldn't associate 
with an interior, 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.809
but they inspired me. The beads have this great blue with 
a little splash of red,

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.519
and I love the pattern on them. I was inspired by 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.649
images of Greece and southern Italy with those  

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:33.379
tan and white buildings with those bits of blue painted on the roof,

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.309
and the blue ocean. They, oddly, really relate well together, and

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:47.499
I like the idea of this room, even though it has an ethnic 
flare, it can still be American feeling,

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:50.059
because what is more American feeling than the color scheme 
red, white, and blue?

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:54.059
And that's what we basically have here in a really 
chic, sophisticated kind of way.

00:03:54.059 --> 00:04:01.059
These are things that made me happy, so by starting that way, 
you're going to layer on that,

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:04.059
and every time you walk into that room, 
it's going to give you the same feeling, 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:11.059
you're going to have colors and textures and things that 
are pleasing to you aesthetically.

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:18.059
So the most exciting part is when the mood board is finished, and 
now it's time to actually execute this room.

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:21.059
You have your guide, and now you're able to start the room, 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:26.059
everything's chosen and laid out for you, and that's the fun part.
