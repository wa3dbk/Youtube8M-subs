00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.870
Hi there! It's been a while hasn't it?
I've been busy with the team at The Review

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.189
Room, lots of exciting stuff happening over
there and more on that later.

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.730
Late last year, we touted Samsung's Tab
7.7 as the best 7 inch tablet in the market.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.970
A year later, I still love it's design,
the look and feel of the hardware. Way back

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.239
then, it really didn't have that much competition.
Of course, this year has been the year of

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.070
7 inch tablets, culminating in the release
of the iPad mini last week.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.429
Now, I wondered, what if the Tab 7.7 had just
been released? How would it stack up against

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.480
the new iPad mini? Let's have a look and
see how this years old model does against

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.550
Apple's latest tablet.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.519
Both tablets are designed to be held naturally
in portrait mode and the front camera is positioned

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.769
accordingly on both devices. Because they're
both manufactured with such precision and

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.129
with high quality materials, it's actually
quite hard to tell them apart. Truth be told,

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.269
the Tab 7.7 is a little easier to hold because
it is a little narrower.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.530
The iPad is 7 point 2 millimeters thin compared
to the 7.8 millimeters of the Tab 7.7, so

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.270
we're splitting hairs there. The iPad mini
weighs in at three hundred and eight grams

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.230
and the Tab 7.7 is only 25 grams more - not
even noticeable given the dimensions are so

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.930
similar.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.850
The iPad Mini has a 5 megapixel camera on
the back, where the Tab 7.7 has a 3 megapixel

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.000
camera. However, the Tab 7.7 fights back with
a 2 megapixel camera on front which gives

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.240
it a small advantage for video calls compared
with the iPad Mini's 1.2 megapixel camera.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.490
Display wise, the iPad Mini has a ten twenty
four by seven sixty eight pixel resolution

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.110
which delivers a hundred and sixty three pixels
per inch density, compared to the Tab 7.7

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.450
which has a twelve eighty by eight hundred
pixel resolution that provides a one hundred

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.160
and ninety six pixels per inch density. The
iPad Mini uses an IPS screen for bright, clear

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.430
colours and wide viewing angles. However the
Tab 7.7 has a Super AMOLED Plus display which,

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.950
even to this day, stands out as one of the
finest small tablet displays I've ever seen.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.569
The iPad mini is run by an A5 dual core processor
with half a gig of RAM, versus the Tab 7.7

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.940
which is also powered by a dual core processor.
When we ran some benchmarking, we got some

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.140
interesting results. For Geekbench computational
scoring, the iPad Mini scored 758, and the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.140
Tab 7.7 ????. In GLBenchmark, the 720p onscreen
test gave the iPad Mini a fifty nine frames

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.650
a second versus the Tab 7.7 fifty one frames
a second.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.349
In browsing, the iPad mini scored one hundred
and twenty thousand on Browsermark, compared

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.549
to one hundred and thirty three thousand for
the Tab 7.7. And finally on Sunspider, the

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.319
iPad mini posted a time of fourteen ninety
eight milliseconds compared to the Tab 7.7

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.170
eleven seventy four milliseconds.
Speaking of browsing, the tab 7.7 shows a

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.609
little bit more information in portrait mode,
but the iPad Mini covers a lot more of a webpage

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:56.909
in landscape.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:02.540
So the tab 7.7 is actually superior in most
of the tests, and it's pretty old as far

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.299
as tablets go having been released almost
a year ago.

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.999
Unfortunately in Australia, the Tab 7.7 never
got past Android 3.2, and upgrades have been

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:16.219
sporadic around the world. However, I have
flashed a custom ROM based on Cyanogen Mod

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:21.349
10 and it works extremely well, providing
all the features of Jelly Bean OS. The iPad

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.230
Mini on the other hand, came out with iOS
6 on the day of launch and will continue to

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.269
get updates as part of Apple's global delivery.

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.400
I won't repeat the content and app comparison
between iOS and Android but there are issues

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.329
facing tablet-specific apps for Android, which
probably stifled the 7.7 back when it was

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.909
launched. But the fact is this - from a design
and hardware perspective, the 7.7 led the

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.930
way for Android tablets back then, and as
we just showed, it can still go toe to toe

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.489
today and in many cases surpass Apple's
latest product when it comes to benchmarking.

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.969
So that's our comparison of the iPad mini
versus the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7. If you

Great to see you again, and you know what?
You haven't changed a bit.
