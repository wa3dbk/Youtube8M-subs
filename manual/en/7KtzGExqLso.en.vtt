Hi, Tim, here again with Day 14, my Day 14 update

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:09.309
I am still going on with this juice fasting plan. 
 I am still managing to keep on track

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.801
And I had a bit of temptation yesterday: drumroll, look away, 
 look away now! Look at this picture if you dare

00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:20.138
This is what was in front of my eyes last night, this picture

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:25.744
And I was able to resist that. I had a feeling 
 that there was going to be lots of nice

00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:29.981
well, I say nice but it’s actually not nice because it 
 is very unhealthy for you, not healthy at all

00:00:45.982 --> 00:00:49.136
So there you go. Goes to show you 
 the power of this fat burning diet

00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:53.807
Being able to really resist. It’s a fasting plan, a 
 juice fasting plan is what I am saying

00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:07.472
Overnight my weight since yesterday has changed by .3 kg. 
 I lost .3 which is .66 of the pound

00:01:08.507 --> 00:01:15.180
Overall I have now lost 8.3 kg in 
 13 full days which is 18.3 pounds

00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:18.401
Earlier today when I weighed myself – shock, horror! 

00:01:18.735 --> 00:01:20.803
The weight loss was zero. I had not gone up nor gone down

00:01:21.637 --> 00:01:24.507
But then I did weigh myself after my 
 walk again and I had lost .3kg

00:01:29.712 --> 00:01:33.767
What I do do is, I am not silly about it, is I 
 don’t weigh myself at different times in the day or anything

00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:38.272
I would always be within an hour or so in the 
 morning, which is the time that I actually do it

00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:52.870
Overall losing again .3 kg – and that is every single day of 
 this diet so far (well I am saying ‘diet’ – wrong word!)

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.070
I have actually managed to lose weight, which is fantastic

00:01:57.342 --> 00:02:02.610
In terms of my measurements, my waist is now 
 down to 106 cm, which is 41.7 inches

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:04.870
Now that is still probably on the larger side

00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:11.340
But, look, just two weeks ago it was 120 cm, which is 47.25 inches

00:02:20.668 --> 00:02:23.070
One thing I did do was I ate more fruits and vegetables yesterday

00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:31.380
I am just wondering how much vegetable you actually need on this. I am conscious of 
 the amount of sugar that is in these vegetables, ah, sorry in these fruits

00:03:04.114 --> 00:03:06.100
Because quite frankly I like fruits a lot more than vegetables

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:15.080
Even though I am… tolerating, I guess is the word… fruits and vegetables, I would 
 much rather be having fruits, if I had the chance, and only fruits

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:26.970
So, I will look into that and see how I go

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.910
And just a word on goals

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:33.680
If you are actually looking to follow this, or if you are following 
 this, I think it is important for you to have a goal

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:37.430
So is your goal: you are just trying to lose 
 weight? Or do you have a specific amount?

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:46.810
If you recall when I started with this on Day One I actually had a 
 clear goal, which was to lose 32 kg around 70 pounds in 56 days

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.950
And that has remained my constant goal every day

00:03:59.907 --> 00:04:07.180
So, if you’re doing this, have you got a goal? If not I suggest you 
 do have a goal. And really the goal is is not to lose weight

00:04:07.782 --> 00:04:08.970
but it is to become healthy and thin, isn’t it

00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:32.080
I think that is important because I do see a lot around 
 the traps people saying ‘I am sick of being overweight’

00:04:33.243 --> 00:04:37.880
And I think their focus is more on being overweight. So, you know, interesting

00:04:40.168 --> 00:04:44.240
Not a lot else to report today. I am 
 still trying to figure out about juicing beets

00:04:44.606 --> 00:04:46.370
Interesting enough in Australia we call them beetroot

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.940
I do love to hear all your comments and I try and enter all of 
 them. So if you are looking at this video please feel free to comment

00:05:06.612 --> 00:05:12.600
Any questions and comments, encouragements, motivation, criticism whatever

00:05:21.545 --> 00:05:28.900
And just in relation to beets: if anyone knows anything about beets 
 juice side-effects, I would also be interested to know as well

00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:36.540
The other interesting thing that I saw on the Internet, and I haven’t actually found 
 the link for it, is people looking for a substitute for apple juice

00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:44.040
And I found that quite surprising for people doing this fasting plan because apple 
 is for me: apple juice is the main part of the plan

00:05:44.804 --> 00:05:46.470
So it’s something where I don’t know if that would be possible

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.540
Okay. With that said I think I will 
 get out of here for another day

00:06:00.437 --> 00:06:05.780
Tomorrow will be Day 15 which will give me my complete two week score

00:06:06.143 --> 00:06:12.770
Because I will have been on this plan for 14 days 
 as of tomorrow, 14 full days of being on it

00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:25.480
So, still feeling pretty good, and I look 
 forward to catching up with you tomorrow

00:06:26.014 --> 00:06:26.150
Thanks for watching

00:06:26.448 --> 00:06:27.820
Cheers for now
