00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.759
The state of our earth can be defined by

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.890
how much climate change it experiences

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.760
and by the total amount of food that is

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.800
available through agriculture and trade.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.840
The world has increased its agricultural

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.900
production over the past centuries.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.500
At the same time it is undergone climate change,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.439
partly as a result of activities

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.140
related to agriculture.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.680
In 1850 the climate had not yet begun to change due

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.820
to human activities, and food production was low.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.100
After 1950 world food production

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.309
rose dramatically. Before 2000 we began

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.400
to see evidence of human induced climate change,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.899
our climate will continue to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.730
change, given the greatly increased

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.640
levels of greenhouse gases already in our atmosphere.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.920
Extreme events such as

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.140
high temperatures, droughts and floods

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.120
are already more frequent and severe.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.440
faced with growing demand for food

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.940
fodder and bioenergy crops,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.020
many agriculture systems deplete soil

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.100
fertility, biodiversity and water resources.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.340
Many regions exhibit large

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.540
gaps between potential and actual crop yields.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.439
The path our world takes in the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.160
future depends on the choices we make.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.440
to be sustainable in the long term,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.660
the world must stay within certain limits

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.710
this frontier curve represents the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.990
maximum amount of food we can grow under

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.150
a given climate. If we do the best we can

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.270
on every bit of land. It declined steeply

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.549
under extreme climate change, which will

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.170
have an adverse overall effect on

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.000
agricultural production in the next few

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.030
decades. Climate change will bring us

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.520
toward and perhaps over critical food

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.920
security thresholds in many regions.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.380
Areas currently suffering from food

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.840
insecurity will be hit worst.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.240
This curve represents how much food we need to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.020
ensure everyone on earth has adequate nutrition.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.820
The world's population will increase to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.540
around 9 billion by mid-century.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.720
It curves up under high climate change as

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.560
we will need more food to make up for

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.660
greater crop losses due to climate

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.160
variability and pest outbreaks.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.200
This curve represents the effect of

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.940
increasing food production on climate change.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.480
As we clear more land for crops,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.000
apply more artificial fertilizer, and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.150
have larger livestock herds, the climate

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.790
impact already nearly a third of current

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.180
climate change increases.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.020
A sustainable future must be located within the space

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.720
defined by these three limits.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.640
This is the safe space. Today on a planet that

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.200
grows sufficient food for all; a billion

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.709
people go hungry. Another billion over

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.080
consume increasing risks of chronic

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.040
diseases. One third of all food harvested

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.610
is lost or wasted. Food waste in

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.860
industrialized countries is almost as

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.680
high as total net food production in sub-saharan Africa.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.700
We are not in a safe space.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.580
This is where the world is heading

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.820
by mid-century, unless we make some big changes.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.920
Hundreds of millions will remain

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.110
undernourished, and we will be perilously

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.709
close to the limits of food production.

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.040
We can take actions to enlarge the safe space,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.500
and move the planet within its boundaries.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.280
First, by eliminating waste in the food chain,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.720
increasing equity and access to food,

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.500
and shifting to vegetable rich

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.320
diets that demand fewer resources,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.860
we can reduce the amount of food we need,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.440
by investing in agricultural research and

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.460
development, we can increase the amount

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.520
of food we grow; we can also expand the

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.980
safe space, by adapting cropping systems

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.170
to hotter climates through innovations

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.140
such as improved crop genetics, and

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.220
careful matching of crops to environments.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.100
Ever higher average global temperatures

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.260
will result in less greenhouse gas

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.840
emissions are drastically reduced across

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.830
a wide range of human activities.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.860
Agriculture must do its share.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.780
By carefully intensifying production on

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.430
existing agricultural land, we can reduce

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.040
on-site emissions and reduce deforestation.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.580
Sustainable intensification will help close the food

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.960
yield gap, while reducing emissions per

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.340
unit of food produced.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.500
By reducing greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.900
not only agriculture and forestry,

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.040
we can slow down the onset and

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.960
potential impacts of climate change.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.080
By implementing all these actions together,

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.810
it is possible for Earth to survive and

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.300
prosper in the long term; even the

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.430
substantially larger human population

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.300
that it will carry in 40 years time.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.950
We must transition the world into the

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.380
safe operating space, through collective

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.600
decisions and actions.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.180
Our most powerful actions for meeting food security needs

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.680
while reducing environmental impacts

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.700
include improving crop yields, reducing waste,

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.860
changing diets, adapting to climate change,

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.760
and reducing agricultural

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.000
greenhouse gas emissions.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.300
We can achieve food security in the face of climate change,

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.380
learn about key actions for

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.600
moving into the safe space, and explore

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.660
successful innovations from around the world.
