Warner Bros.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.370
Interactive Entertainment has officially announced
that Batman: Arkham Knight will be coming

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.109
to PS4, Xbox One and PC this year.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.949
The next in the Arkham series will take place
in a larger Gotham city and sits in the timeline

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.560
a year after Batman: Arkham City.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.869
Some exciting news is theres going to be a
drivable batmobile and you'll even get to

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.489
play as Harley Quinn if you pre-order the
game.

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.420
The Scarecrow returns to join the ranks of
super villains including Two Face and Penguin.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.579
Arkham Knight is set to be the explosive finale
to the series.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.160
We interviewed Batman voice actor Roger Craig
Smith and Joker Troy Baker so check that out

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.160
here.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.280
I'll stick the whole trailer in the description
below.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.000
Today marks the day that Battlefield 4 gets
itself an update.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.579
Developer EA DICE has announced the updates
will be identical across PS3, PS4 and Xbox

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.250
360 and will fix a bunch of crashs and bugs
as well as some tweaks on some of the ways

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.250
the weapons behave.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.700
A massive list of what the update will include
can be found on the Battlelog forum so I've

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.650
stuck it in the description below too along
with the Batman trailer.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.720
Dubbed by its creators as the worlds dumbest
game, if you don't know what I'm on about

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.720
already it is of course Goat Simulator and
it's got itself a release date of April Fools

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.110
Day, of course.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.190
The game, created by Coffee Stain Studios
will have you flinging around the screen,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.320
wrecking stuff and just general being a bit
of a weirdo.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.490
I'm not sure what to make of this game really.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.130
Will you be playing it?

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:55.670
Let me know in the comments.
