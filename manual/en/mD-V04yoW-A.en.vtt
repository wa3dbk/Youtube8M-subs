00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:28.720
Man, I’ve played a lot of Lynx games this
week, but…

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.950
Holy crap, this one’s just…

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.820
It’s, like…it’s like Metroid, only without
the hot chick.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.670
You know what, that makes it seem less good,
um…alright, think of a side-scroller where

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.850
you’re walking through a slime world, but
the controls are a bit clunky, so…it feels

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.130
like…you are walking through slime.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.760
Okay, that’s not…flattering, look…imagine
this huge labyrinth, but without Jennifer

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.760
Connelly.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.319
Actually, now we’re losing the hot chick
again.

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:07.070
Look, I’m coming up with awful comparisons.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.180
Point is, this is Todd’s Adventures In Slime
World, and it’s probably my favorite Lynx

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.220
game.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.900
Even if it doesn’t sound like it.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.180
Even without hot chicks.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:37.560
Anyway, you play as Tood.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.780
Who is anything but a hot chick, he’s a
guy who flies around the galaxy and finds

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.410
slime planets, and like a kid with a salt
shaker and a sidewalk full of garden slugs,

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:55.370
he goes inside with a squirt gun and sprays
every last native species he sees for no reason

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.970
other than to watch them explode.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.850
So Todd’s an asshole.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.830
But you’ve also got to give it to him, ‘cause
his adventures are pretty enjoyable.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.640
Even if his reasoning is, again…somewhat
murderous, and at the very least, naturalistically

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.640
insensitive.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.079
Either way, Todd’s the man, deal with it.

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.470
And his Lynx game is the best Lynx game.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.150
And you know the coolest thing about it?

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.379
His Lynx game…is kind of multiplayer focused…but
on a system that, like…seven people actually

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:25.379
had.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.560
So Todd was literally like, “What’s that,
only seven people bought a Lynx?”

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.670
“Sounds good, let’s add eight-player multiplayer.”

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:49.150
Because Todd’s the man, deal with it.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.160
So if you have friends, who are as weird as
you are, and have both an Atari Lynx and Todd’s

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:05.760
Adventures In Slime World…well, I guess
there’s someone for everyone.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.549
Also that means you can play Todd’s multiplayer.

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:15.220
The only more fun than exploring these strange
alien planets, is exploring them with a friend.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.560
Like, other than Todd, Todd’s the man.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.329
And if not, hey…the game’s still awesome.

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.329
And it really is a lot like Metroid.

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.080
You land on a planet, you end up inside it…and
all you know is, there’s an exit somewhere.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.280
The question, obviously, is where that exit
is, and how you’re gonna get there.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.319
Also, why is Todd…

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.400
Is he doing what it looks like he’s…you
know what, forget it, Todd’s the man.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.220
You know what’s so cool about this game?

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.819
Besides Todd, and his behavior?

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.519
It’s, like…it’s a game that has atmosphere,
you know?

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.249
Not to the extent of Metroid, but…it’s
got atmosphere, nonetheless.

00:03:54.249 --> 00:04:00.010
You’re going deeper and deeper into these
dark tunnels, and things just keep getting

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.650
more and more disgusting…and there’s slime,
everywhere.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.999
It’s dripping from the ceilings, it’s
oozing from the walls…it’s forming into

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:10.090
little pools, at your feet…

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.280
So when you see a pool of water, to clean
yourself off, it’s a huge relief…

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.079
It just does a really good job of creating
a creepy, gross, alien vibe.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.310
Again, not as well as Metroid, but…still,
pretty freaking good.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.569
And also, a bit more cartoony, a bit less
dark…

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.940
It’s just a cool-looking game, and the sound’s
good, too.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.240
Now, I mentioned earlier that the controls
are a bit clunky?

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.340
Well, that’s because the controls are a
bit clunky.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.950
Like, it’s a bit floaty, a bit imprecise…jumping,
especially.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:52.389
It can be hard to jump with any precision,
or to land where you want to sometimes.

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:59.759
Which is sort of a pet peeve of mine.

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.720
Like, having grown up with platformers on
the NES, and Super NES…

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.470
I mean, my bar for how a platformer should
control is, like…Mario.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.150
Mega Man.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.990
Just really responsive, very tight…and Todd’s
not that responsive, or tight.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.490
I mean, he’s tight, but…

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.879
I mean that in the way rappers say it.

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:32.289
Because Todd’s the man, deal with it.

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.159
So listen, does it play perfectly?

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.349
No, no it doesn’t, and that’s kind of
a big deal.

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.120
But if you can get used to it…man, this
is just a cool game.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.139
Like, there’s a few different missions,
each one’s slightly different, and has its

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.060
own rules…and they just drop you off.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.150
No direction, just a bunch of…exploring.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.810
And it’s a fun place to explore, it’s
twisted, and windy, and…

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.699
And gross, it’s very gross, it’s Todd’s
Adventures In Slime World.

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:10.120
It’s, like…imagine Castlevania, but combined
with Ghostbusters II.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.840
Hey, a good comparison!

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.889
Ha.

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:25.190
Nailed it.
