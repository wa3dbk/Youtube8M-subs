00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.009
what's up fishtank people will sup dog
Dustin's fishtanks bring it to you on a

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.099
sunday baby how's everybody doing hope
you're doing well

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.809
yo your boy D last week talked about the
Genoa player but apparently white boi

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.299
rebel Bayless won't understand the word
ghetto

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.480
so I'm going to refrain from using the
term ghetto this entire video and I'm

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.859
instead I'm going to supplement it with
the word push so much just had a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.330
maintain because in a way so here we go
I want to talk about maintenance on a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.289
boat aquarium we have behind us here
this video right here on resort spa how

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.440
you don't have to use deep floor last
week I talked about how you can step

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.190
water out of buckets but I've got a good
alternative for you head down to your

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.260
local 7-eleven Speedway whatever and
grab yourself not one but two big gulp

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.160
cups these are 32 ounce whatever I
prefer them to be the 64 ounce or but

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.379
these are work take one drink and enjoy
it take the other one and share it with

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.460
a friend and once we have consumed our
tasty Slurpees or whatever we have in

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.399
our big golf we're going to take them
and we're going to thoroughly rinse them

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.789
out and we are going to fill one of them
with water leaving the other one empty

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.689
we're then going to set them aside like
so we're going to wait one day to let

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.619
the chlorine dissipate from the water
then we're going to take it we're going

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.810
to take our currently empty one right
here we're going to take a big scoop of

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.490
water out like so and we're going to
replace it slowly with the new water

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.440
that's right another alternative for
justice

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.010
gallon jug you can kind of like zones'
actually sing before out sir I recommend

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.190
a whole gallon you want to cut it so you
have the structural integrity of the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.110
scooping back in place and while we're
working to maintain our hood aquarium

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.710
obviously water changes are our number
one thing but the number two thing we

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.119
want to do is want to make sure our
plants can work for us than a nice cheap

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.300
hard-working plant right here that can
be grown above the water in the back of

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.659
your filter or even floating off
potentially on top of the tank if you

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.530
could attach some atlases both those
I've also got these rolling over here

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.210
and I've got the lucky bamboo I believe
the pole toast grows a little bit faster

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.920
than the lucky bamboo but this is doing
a nice job stuck with me in the back of

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.030
a hang on bathroom filter floating
plants I like I showed you with the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.570
water hyacinth will be a lot of it as
well and speaking of following plants

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.280
here in the above the rim tank which is
rolling along quite nicely I have the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.810
herpes of the planet aquarium now this
can be used well in your hood aquarium

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.549
because this stuff grows like it's
floating so it'll be on the surface and

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.290
it'll work for you what we do is we take
our friend mr. duckweed over here and we

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.390
want to have a high amount of duck weed
that grows as a faster rate than our

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.579
friend mr. ghetto goldfish can eat it so
we've got the duck leaf floating in here

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.500
and we want it so he's eating it but
it's also working hard for us and I feel

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.060
just scoop out a bunch of the duckweed
or if you wanna put you can simply

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.000
overflow the tank and all the ducks we
will float out

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.920
speaking of goldfish this is our ghetto
goldfish we got for 27 cents you'll note

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.800
he is digging but he's not able to get
down into the dirt substrate which is a

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.300
good thing these typically come from
very piss-poor conditions so you're

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.530
going to want to do an Epsom salt dip on
these with that with any goldfish you

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.550
get because they generally come loaded
with parasites or intestinal stuff just

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.640
to clean them out right when you get it
they can handle them so that's what I've

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.120
got off what other thing that I wanted
to tell you guys about if you're buying

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.370
cheap tanks use tanks or anything like
that

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.420
before you put down a dime have the
person you're buying it from fill that

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.360
sucker up I think that will save you a
lot of heart you can get a cheap tank

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.550
fill that sucker up watch them doing so
if you like what I'm doing subscribe let

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.989

are up to with your tank I love here in

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.860
