00:00:01.305 --> 00:00:05.000
Prep, style, finish.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.899
Product plus technique
gets results.

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:09.865
Aveda men.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.900
Men scalps can produce twice
as much oil as women's and dirt

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.930
and dead cells can build
up in the leftover sebum,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.720
so let's use Aveda Men's
Pure-formance Shampoo

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.180
and Conditioner together
to soothe the scalp

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.660
and get clean, conditioned,
healthy looking hair.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.480
They're great for daily use.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.910
Moisture content matters.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.880
If hair is too dry, it's hard to
apply styling products evenly.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.270
But if hair is too wet,
it dilutes the products

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.830
and compromises performance.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.090
It's also important to choose
the right styling product

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.610
for your hair's length, texture,
pigment, and your styling

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.080
objective.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.740
Ask your Aveda
stylist for advice.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.500
To shape hair and add shine,
use of Aveda Men's Pure-formance

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.790
Pomade, which gives firm,
pliable hold and high

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.370
shine to the hair for
a more formal finish

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.670
that you can shape and re-shape.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.650
With concentrated
Aveda products,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.160
a little goes a long way.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.420
Vigorously emulsify the
pomade between your hands,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.350
then massage it into
the hair from roots

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.220
to ends, starting in the back
where the hair is thickest.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.830
If you have longer hair,
you can brush the pomade

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.650
through the hair to
ensure even application--

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.890
just don't over brush, or
you'll flatten the hair.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.290
Shape the hair with your
hands until you get the look

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.490
you want.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.820
If you want more shine, you
can comb through the hair.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.530
You'll end up with
the high shine

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.690
and hold of a
traditional pomade,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.630
without the paraffin
or petroleum base.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.860
Because this is water-based,
it's much gentler on the scalp,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.620
and it also washes
out more easily.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.610
To finish, use of Aveda Men's
Pure-formance Aroma Spray

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.630
with certified organic essential
oils of spearmint, vetiver,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.090
and lavender.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.250
You can mist it on
or spray a little

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.900
on to the chest or forearms,
wherever you prefer.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.240
Prep, style, finish
with Aveda men.
