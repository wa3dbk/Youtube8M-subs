00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.480
hi everyone its Jon and bin and it's
time for more my little pony now if

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.900
you've been following our channel you
can go back to our older videos and

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.460
we've reviewed pretty much all of the My
Little Pony pop sets we just didn't

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.210
review all of the starter sets of the
mane 6 we got the ones that were in sets

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.650
today we're gonna be reviewing two brand
new starters that suggest came out we

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.570
got them off of amazon.com and these are
exciting because they're coming out with

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.090
more characters instead of just
variations on the mane 6 yeah so we have

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.399
cheerily and we also have Lyra now there
were a few non main six before they were

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.070
the core you could see her back there
there's Luna and Renee didn't yet so

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.980
they're doing more background ponies now
which is exciting so these just came out

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.300
hopefully they come out with more soon
now these are the starter sets so these

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.350
don't cost very much if you see these at
Walmart he's only like five or six

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.770
dollars get basically at the pony body
and hair and tail and a sticker sheet

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.759
and that's pretty much it yeah you don't
get any extra accessories or anything

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.900
but these are kind of cool just to build
your collection up without having to buy

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.979
a gazillion other things with it here's
what the back of Lyra's package look

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.560
like there's layer right there same say
variations on the mane six that we saw

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.450
on the other packaging and I'm sure
Carolis packaging is pretty much the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.640
same ride down in the corner there she
is there she is I guess we should

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.820
explain just in case you haven't seen
any of our other pop videos or aren't

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.409
familiar what pop is they're kind of
like the My Little Pony version of mr.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.549
Potato Head yeah I know you can mix and
match the hairstyles and accessories and

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.350
wings and whatnot with all the different
ponies and you can even mix pony with

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.990
pony which we can demonstrate again yeah
we'll show the head again later cuz

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.810
that's fun
yeah these are a lot of fun and they're

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.930
pretty affordable too you'd find them at
Walmart they're showing up all over the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.500
place now Target
now and targets supposed to be getting

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.660
an exclusive Cutie Mark Crusaders pop
set to go they're wild rainbow and we

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.270
have cheerily to teach them perfect so
I'm gonna put together Lyra I'm gonna

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.240
put together Cheerilee here's what
everything looks like out of the package

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.670
you get both sides of the pony in the
little frame

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:42.390
there's Lyra's hair Jane and tail the
sticker sheet looks really cool

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.010
check out that Lyra sticker that's
awesome the Cheerilee sticker she's cute

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.250
too they're all school oriented this is
perfect for back-to-school are you guys

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.920
back to school yet you got to leave a
comment down below let us know when you

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.540
started now for the funnest part of the
pop ponies in my opinion popping them

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:10.530
out and it says on the package to let an
adult do this and you should because it

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.150
can get a little little sharp sometimes

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.130
they do come out fairly easy they do you
shouldn't need a tool or anything but

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.530
still if you have little hands you might
need some assistance and the edges of

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.980
this can get is sharp so be careful so
after you pop them out you have two

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.209
sides the pony and they snap right
together check this out

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.610
there's Lyra there's Cheerilee now you
can see she has holes all throughout her

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.780
body and her head you'd even put wings
on anypony doesn't matter if they're an

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.280
earth pony or not you can stick Wings in
there if you want to these ones you

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.549
can't really customize to too much
because they only come with hair and a

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.360
rail because mother pop ponies back
there will show you how you can mix and

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.840
match theirs cheerily her hair was her
mane was giving me a hard time but I got

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:24.240
her and there's Lyra let's do a mix of
pony okay so this one looks kind of

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.430
funny because I'm just older she has a
hole in her head but you get the idea so

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:40.190
then if we put Shirley's hair gone wait
how we put

00:04:45.620 --> 00:05:01.650
Myra's hair and cheerilee's and you can
customize them with stickers check that

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.490
out our pop Ponyville is growing and
that's not all the problems we have no

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.939
we have more next time they come out of
the big pop playset whoo let's do a

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:12.810
