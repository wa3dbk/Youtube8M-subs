PERSPECTIVES OF PERFECTION
ERIC HEEREMA: IN HIS OWN WORDS

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:13.319
I grew up in a family where wine wasn't really
a popular drink. My father didn't like wine

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.980
at all. And when I was around seventeen, I
started to be interested in reading about

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.439
wine. My mother was telling everyone, like
'Eric is so serious, he goes upstairs and

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.530
he works for three hours', and it was true,
I did go upstairs, but actually I would read

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.710
about wine for at least two and a half hours.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.710
I always hoped that one day I would start,
or would be involved with a vineyard. Some

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.059
ten years ago, when I lived in the countryside
in West Sussex, I picked up the trend of sparkling

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.300
wine. I was convinced that English sparkling
wine had a future because outside of Champagne,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.720
there are only a few places in the whole world
that have the potential of producing the very

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.430
best sparkling wines. You need a good climate,
there are lots of criteria; like the soil,

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.430
and at best, all of these qualities come together
in the south of England 
Nyetimber as an estate has a very long history,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.380
it was first mentioned in the Doomsday book.
And the estate as a vineyard dates back twenty-five

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.250
years, so we're celebrating that this year.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:03.689
Walking through the vineyard chatting, it's
always interesting to hear what they've experienced

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.170
and what their ideas are. Cherie is our wine
maker, and actually it's a couple of wine

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.440
makers; Cherie Spriggs and Brad Greatrix, her
husband. From the first moment when they arrived,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.850
it really clicked, and they're still with
us, and I hope they stay a long, long time.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.480
Pascal comes from France; he's a viticulturist,
trained in France. Pascal shares the passion

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.350
that Cherie and I have about creating the
very best possible sparkling wine.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.230
Wine has always played an important part in
my life since I was seventeen years old. My

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:57.230
partner Hannah and I love drinking wine together.
We go to our wine cellar; we pick a wine for

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:05.669
the evening. It's wonderful to live here throughout
the seasons and walk through the vineyards,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.190
and seeing how they develop through the season.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.190
This house and this life is for us what it's
all about, it's our life, we love it, and

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.879
yes, we're here to stay.
