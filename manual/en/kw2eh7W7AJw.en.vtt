00:00:00.746 --> 00:00:01.432
Hi everybody.

00:00:02.275 --> 00:00:08.562
Here I introduce you to the Nomad, also called
"Sega Genesis Nomad", why ?

00:00:09.178 --> 00:00:17.993
Simply because it's one. It was distributed by Sega
and came out in 1994 only in USA,

00:00:18.587 --> 00:00:26.251
which is a shame... It didn't have any success,
it was sold only for a few months,

00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:31.693
And it was over after that.
Now we can find it on ebay for about $140...

00:00:32.035 --> 00:00:37.234
If you're a collector or you like to play
classic Genesis games, I give your my recommandation.

00:00:38.447 --> 00:00:41.546
So, what can I say on this portable genesis...

00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:50.581
See here, a SCART socket... Which means that
you can play on your TV using the connector

00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:53.838
from your real Genenis, that's good.

00:00:54.276 --> 00:01:02.812
Here you can wire a cable, so you don't have to use
the battery block, here, which needs

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:13.931
Six AA batteries, for a 3 to 4 hours autonomy,
which is really short for a handheld console...

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:17.330
What else can we say...

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.695
Here, that's a socket for a Genesis control pad,
it allows 2 player games...

00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:30.231
Either directly on the screen, or directly on a TV, via the SCART.

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:36.813
Specifications are exactly the same as the Genesis,
nothing changes.

00:01:37.703 --> 00:01:44.132
The screen is a LCD that can display 512 colors, 16 simultaneously.

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:53.256
It was really good, for the time.
I think it was the only 16 bits portable console,

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.245
Sure there were PC Engines GT and LT, but
it wasn't the same price category...

00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:02.960
You really needed to be Croesus to afford one.

00:02:04.426 --> 00:02:08.627
What else can I say ? I think
that's it for the console itself...

00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:15.064
You can see that's it's pretty big.
I brought the PSP, to compare...

00:02:16.127 --> 00:02:22.852
It's most impressive, seen from here.
Look how thick the Nomad is !

00:02:23.052 --> 00:02:28.450
It works for me because I have big hands,
but it can become a problem if you have small ones.

00:02:30.468 --> 00:02:35.534
So, Genesis games are to be put here...
Let's try one !

00:02:35.534 --> 00:02:39.792
Sonic 2, a classic and one of the best Genesis games.

00:02:41.847 --> 00:02:43.514
We'll turn the light off...

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:47.144
Get closer...

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.714
So the sound is exactly the same as the Genesis',
it's really a portable Genesis,

00:02:54.714 --> 00:02:57.439
It was really impressive back then.

00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:02.170
All right... Sonic 2, I'll show you a bit.

00:03:02.962 --> 00:03:10.735
I hope you all know Sonic 2, it's one of
the best speed platform games of all time...

00:03:11.937 --> 00:03:16.586
You can see the display is really good,
nothing to say.

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.682
Wait I'll try to get a better angle...

00:03:25.166 --> 00:03:30.799
What can I say... I mainly made the video
to show you the console, because it's

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.184
not very known, even though it's incredible for me...

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:43.963
Well... Sonic 2, you sure know it...
Overall that's it. If you want I'll

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:47.332
put another game, before you're bored...

00:03:50.218 --> 00:03:53.993
I'll show you Ecco the Dolphin, a very good game too...

00:03:55.493 --> 00:04:08.189
It will soon be re-released, I think on the PS2...
with about ten other Genesis games...

00:04:09.688 --> 00:04:14.400
I don't know if you can see well... because
I don't see from the same angle...

00:04:14.665 --> 00:04:16.684
I hope you can, I'm not sure.

00:04:17.394 --> 00:04:24.241
So that's Ecco...
Because the console only came out in USA,

00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:30.701
It doesn't play all french versions, well it depends...

00:04:30.906 --> 00:04:37.534
Some games are originately zoned, and others arn't.
For example, Sonic 2 and Ecco arn't.

00:04:38.596 --> 00:04:45.586
But other games like the Streets of Rages,
or RPGs like Beyond Oasis or Landstalker

00:04:45.586 --> 00:04:49.630
won't play. Simply because they were originately zoned.

00:04:53.007 --> 00:04:55.817
So... you can see...
I can move back...

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:59.110
It's a really good LCD screen...

00:05:00.813 --> 00:05:08.653
So here you can see a couple of vertical lines,
this is due to the use...

00:05:10.094 --> 00:05:12.558
It appeared at a point, I don't know exactly why...

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:17.167
Well, eventually you don't see them anymore...

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:26.976
I hope I made you discover this console, that deserved
to be seen, and if you're a collector to be bought.

00:05:28.115 --> 00:05:29.705
And I say you 'later'.
