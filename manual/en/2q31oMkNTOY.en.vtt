Hi! I’m Anne Beckett with Anne’s Embroidery
in Austin, Texas. Now I’m going to the center

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.200
of the design because you want to start at
the center, by starting in the center I’m

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.650
going to run through it just a running stitch
so that when I go to embroidery it’ll tack

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:28.789
down the fabric or the garment to what we
call backing or under lay. To it to a point

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:38.420
where you have plenty of stitches to hold
it down because he has a little thin line

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:47.190
here, need to pay a little more attention
at this point and come out to the edge of

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.890
this color. Now the yellow on this area of
yellow doesn’t really have any texture as

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:05.039
far as crayon or pencil or any type of drawing
so I’m going to use what we call a fill

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:12.640
or tagamey stitch it’s a flat stitch or
a flat group of stitching and you’ll see

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.869
the major difference when it comes time to
actually sew it out. Okay so this is what

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.100
they call a fill, I’ll show you what I can
do with it, anytime you turn the corner to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:36.490
you have to go with the straight line and
even the little that looks like mistakes I

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.430
think you need to put them in cause it’s
important, so okay this the shape of what

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.430
I’m going to fill in there where I’m going
to start is here…I’m going to end up here….and

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.670
I’m just going to plot my stitches this
way, stitches are plotted.
