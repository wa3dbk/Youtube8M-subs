Hi! I’m Dr. Adrienne Mulligan and I am the
owner of Camp Verde Veterinary Clinic and

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:15.190
I am here on behalf of Expert Village.com
to talk to you today about caring for kittens.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:25.420
Okay, this is a very common problem in cats
and so I’ve saved it for last on this part.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:36.660
Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease is a syndrome
in cats of which there are very little known.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.440
We know that we can manage it but we don’t
know how to cure it nor do we know what causes

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:50.789
it. There are many theories. If you culture
it, it rarely causes any kind of bacterial

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.020
growth so it is not believed in most cases
to be a bladder infection. Those changes with

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.540
older cats but this is really a young cat
problem in most cases but if you get an older

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.762
cat with the symptoms, then yes a bladder
infection gets on the list. But most of the

00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:15.950
time it is a young cat and it is not an infection
as far as bacteria goes. There are some theories

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.720
that it is an inflammatory condition compared
to one in women called interstitial cystitis.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.060
There is one camp of people who believe it
is viral and it is caused by that same herpes

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.960
virus that cat’s carry from birth and part
of the reason for that is that it seems to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:44.140
come and go with stressful situations and
so many people have different views on it

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.950
and we have been working in trying to figure
out what the best treatment is. You almost

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:56.670
have to individualize it to every cat. So
the symptoms are urinating blood and urinating

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.340
places outside the box and maybe painful urination
and the very worst thing that can happen is

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.280
male cats can get plugged because in this
condition they make crystals and the crystals

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.420
turn into plugs with the mucus and plug up
the urethra so they cannot urinate. That is

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.340
a condition that leads to death within a few
days. If you see your cat laying around and

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.070
meowing in pain, take him to the vet if it’s
a male because that is a very common cause

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.420
of death.
