yeah

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.189
whether you're a seasoned pro or just a
beginner in the field of welding and

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.920
fabricating there's a few essential
items

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.520
everybody needs when melting metal today
we're going to show you a few of our

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.660
favorites

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.020
let's face it welding on the ground is
never fun

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.859
neither is kicking your tools around on
the floor that's why it suggests first

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.879
getting a good welding cart a good
welding car is going to hold your welder

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.920
for gas bottle and are frequently used
wedding accessories a great project for

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.750
a beginner is to weld up your own car
from scratch but you can buy a car like

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.280
this from eastwood that cost the amount
of the role supplies another essential

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.260
item that everybody needs around the
garage is a good sturdy workbench metal

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.309
work benches help you safely weld and
also again get you up off the ground

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.259
when you're working work benches go from
mild to wild with plans be available on

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.130
the web it's another great project for
beginners to help you get some more

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.899
torch time by building something
tangible space is at a premium where you

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.709
only do white occasional welding and
this table right here is just what you

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:17.399
need

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.959
it features adjustable welding slots
clamps and magnets to help you

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:30.030
accurately fit your work pieces together
while welding is oftentimes glamorized

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.959
on the web and social media sites these
days we can't forget that it is a

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.759
dangerous process and the necessary
safety precautions need to be taken in

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.970
front of me are some of the essential
safety items that you're going to need

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.160
every time you fire your welderup matter
your skill level any welder can benefit

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.830
from having an auto-dimming welding
helmet

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.970
unlike a traditional fixed lens helmet
these mass work by quickly dimming the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.289
winds when they sense a bright light
just not only helped save your eyes but

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.130
also helps you find your weld joint
easier when the mask is down most

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.149
quality auto dim helmets like these have
a few different adjustment knobs that

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.349
what you dial in how the lens reacts
minus well do yourself a favor and get a

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.069
quality auto dimming welding helmet you
can spend more time improving your

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.190
welding skills and not your head banging
skills

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.600
walden is the act of melting metal
together and that creates a lot of heat

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.290
be sure you pick up a pair of quality
welding gloves so that you can protect

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.370
yourself from the harmful UV rays and
the high heat that's produced when

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.210
welding there are many different styles
of welding gloves that are designed for

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.250
different types of welding for instance
big wedding gloves maybe thinner and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.570
made of a different type of material to
help with dexterity and field while make

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.310
an arc welding gloves are going to be
progressively thicker and larger to help

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.430
protect from the sparks and spatter
that's produced by those types of

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.540
welding well there are many different
types of welding gloves out there a good

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.900
set of MIG welding gloves like these
will give you the protection you need

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.660
while mig and arc welding but still have
moderate flexibility for TIG weld as we

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.350
mentioned earlier welding creates a lot
of heat and harmful UV rays

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.310
that's why we suggest getting a quality
welding jacket like this

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.050
eastwood jacket that is both flame
resistant and anti-static plus it's

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.470
going to keep your favorite t-shirts
from getting tiny pin holes in them the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.140
worst damage can be done when you least
expect it

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.380
wearing a pair of safety glasses
underneath of your welding helmet can be

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.040
the difference between a trip to the eye
doctor and a day of trouble-free welding

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.700
I'd suggest picking up a set of safety
glasses like these that are both

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.570
flexible and low profile so they can
easily fit underneath your welding

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.830
helmet another great tip is to keep a
few sets of these around in key spots in

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.310
your shop so they're always an
arm's-length your eyes will thank you

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.210
there's an endless list of tools and
accessories that will help your welding

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.320
projects go smoothly one of the most
important tools that you can have around

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.060
your shop is a good angle grinder by
changing the disks on the angle grinder

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.930
you can perform a lot of different tasks
or welding it's good to use the angle

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.920
grinder to smooth proud welds Queen the
weld seam or cut metal

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.360
I like to keep two of these angle
grinders on hand one with a flap discs

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.380
and one with a cutting wheel to save
time when working on a project unless

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.220
you have a helper on hand at all times
you're going to need welding clamps and

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.799
magnets

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.430
Warren Quentin magnets will allow you to
set up your workpiece and keep your

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.150
hands-free while you well they're also
great to hold your work piece together

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.409
as you weld up a long scene there are a
number of different types of welding

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:34.389
clamps and magnets available you can
never have too many of these on hand my

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.560
favorites include the large locking c
clamp pliers for holding together large

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.060
workpieces the smaller many pinch weld
clamps for holding together intricate

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.069
parts and the corner magnets for holding
together 60 and 90 degree angles when it

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.490
comes to metal fabrication and welding
corrosion is the enemy

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.080
this is why skilled fabricators will
clean and protect their work area before

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.199
and after they well to accomplish this

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.699
eastwood offers are pre and stainless
steel brushes to clean the weld area

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:09.159
before you weld Eastwood after well then
seals up the area to prevent future

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.870
corrosion ideally all of your well join
should be as tight of a fit as possible

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.219
but we all know that that isn't always
the case using copper welder backing

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:21.849
plates will allow you to backup
less-than-ideal gaps in your well joint

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.630
and they also act as a safety net for
any beginners that may have problems

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.440
with burning through thinner gauge metal
Eastwood offers a number of different

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.969
shapes and sizes of the copper backing
plates as well as a magnetic version for

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:38.560
hands-free use you work on filling your
shop with these essential items you can

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.849
be sure that you can tackle almost any
DIY project that you decide to take on

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.139
