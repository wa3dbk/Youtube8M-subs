00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.200
Normally, I wouldn't remember much about a
game like Spider-Man. Nothing against that

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.400
game in particular. It's just that...I wouldn't
remember much about any movie game from that

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:00.600
long ago. Except GoldenEye. I'll always remember
GoldenEye. Freaking Oddjob. Anyway, but normally,

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:00.800
yeah...a game like that wouldn't stick with
me.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.000
And yet Spider-Man is surprisingly fresh in
my mind. In fact, we just reviewed the GameCube

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.200
version, like, two months ago...thanks to
Kevin, from Jersey City, New Jersey. And now,

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:01.400
Kevin strikes again. Only this time, he sent
us Spider-Man 2. The only video game in history...with

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:01.600
Kirsten Dunst billboards.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:01.800
Which is fine, because...I mean, Crazy/Beautiful
was a long time ago, but...

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.000
I still would.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.200
Anyway, memories 
of rainy scenes and thin pink tops aside...Spider-Man
was actually better than I remembered it being.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.400
Sure, it was far from perfect, but...at least
when you were outside, swinging through the

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:02.600
city...that was actually kind of fun. And
it seems the team at Treyarch realized it,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:02.800
because Spider-Man 2 goes all in...on swinging
through the city.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.000
Spider-Man 2 takes the same basic gameplay
of the first game...and it makes a few changes.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.200
First, it makes the city bigger. Like, way
bigger. Like, for 2004, it was actually kind

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.400
of ridiculous how big it was. And with that
bigger city came a change in the game's structure.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.600
Now, you can sort of pick and choose where
to go and what to do.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:03.800
Which is brilliant. I mean, people loved swinging
around in Spider-Man, so...give them more

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.000
room to do it, and give them the freedom to
go wherever they want. So I mean, Spider-Man

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.200
2 really had a smart approach in terms of
its design.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.400
And actually...more than just "smart," it
was also impressive. Spider-Man 2 was kind

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:04.600
of a technical feat back then. Ten years ago,
to have a game world this massive and seamless,

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.800
with no loading times or anything...that was
a big deal. And it was also a big part of

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.000
Spider-Man 2's appeal. But...the thing about
a game going for technical appeal, is that

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.200
technical appeal is inherently short-lived.
And to be honest, playing this game now...

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.400
Let's just say we've come a long way since
2004.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:05.600
And Spider-Man 2, which once was so impressive...now
feels kind of dated.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:05.800
Of course, part of that is the graphics. I
mean, the city may be huge, but...it doesn't

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.000
look very good. There's a lot of texture pop-in,
simple shapes, things like that. So the size

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:06.200
came at a cost, for sure. But more importantly,
and what really holds Spider-Man 2 back, in

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.400
retrospect...is the gameplay. I mean, it may
be an open world, but...your progression is

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:06.600
still linear.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.800
You have to complete certain objectives to
progress the story. And actually, it's less

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.000
of a problem that the missions are still kinda
linear...than it is that the missions still

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.200
suck.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.400
See, once you've had your fill of swinging
around and you want to actually play the game,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:07.600
you realize that the core gameplay isn't all
that great. The combat is still button-mashy

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.800
and simple to the point of feeling pointless...and
the missions start to repeat themselves almost

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.000
immediately. There are only about six types
of missions, but you do them about six hundred

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.200
times.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:08.400
And for the same people. The character models
repeat themselves, too. Which only makes things

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.600
feel even more repetitive. Deja poo.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.800
Fortunately, you 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.000
can upgrade Spidey's abilities, which is nice.
And the otherwise repetitive combat is livened

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.200
up a bit by a decent counter system. And to
the game's credit, it is absolutely massive.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.400
There's no multiplayer or anything, but...it's
such a big game, you'll have more than enough

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.600
to do on your own. But again, the only issue
is...that stuff you do?

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.800
It's basically the same stuff, over and over.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.000
The presentation is sort of a mixed bag, too.
It's a technically stunning game for its time,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.200
in some respects. But it's also artistically
hollow...kind of like the gameplay, actually.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:10.400
Hollow. And I mean, the voice acting is just...holy
crap. Bruce Campbell is fine, but...everyone

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.600
else sucks. And the music isn't much better.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.800
Spider-Man 2's hook was its size, and the
freedom of exploring the city. On the other

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.000
hand, the gameplay was spread so thin...it
was like having a 30-foot slice of bread and

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.200
only a spoonful of peanut butter. It may be
impressive, but...doesn't mean you're gonna

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:11.400
eat much of it. There's a lot to like about
Spider-Man 2, and a lot of stuff to do.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.600
But unless someone from New Jersey sends it
to you...

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.800
You won't remember any 
of it.
