00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.933
- Since you're all here, we
thought it would be fun to play

00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.133
one of our new favorite games.

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.000
It's called
Cards Against Humanity.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.700
Here's how it works:
I've picked a category,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.433
you have to pick the card
that's in your hand

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:10.900
that best completes the thought.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.833
I'll pick the answer
that I think is best.

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.833
If I pick your card,
you get a point,

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:17.033
and the person with the most
points wins...

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:19.400
nothing, but you'll win.
[laughter]

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.700
There's absolutely no gift.
Um, all right.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.700
Let's see what the first one is.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.500
"I get by with a little help
from..."

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.500
[suspenseful music]

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.600
And then you put them up
on there.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.100
- Okay.
- And you can mix them up,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.366
so I don't know whose is who.

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.566
- Oh, God!

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.266
[all chatting indistinctly]
- Ready?

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.566
Okay?
All right.

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:56.000
"I get by with a little help
from..."

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.833
First one is:

00:00:57.833 --> 00:00:58.833
"My sex life."

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:01.233
[laughter]

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.233
"Bill Nye the Science Guy."

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:07.500
[laughter]
[cheers]

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.733
"The Chinese gymnastics team."

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.866
[laughter]

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.966
"Batman."
[cheers]

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:18.033
And "tasteful sideboob."

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:20.000
[laughter and applause]

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.666
[laughter]

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.666
Uh...

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:27.933
This is a tough one.
I'm gonna--

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.233
I'm gonna pick the
"Bill Nye the Science Guy."

00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:33.033
[cheers and applause]

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:34.233
[bell dings]

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:40.500
It's hard to say who's who.
I was gonna guess, but...

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.400
- That's a game in itself.
- All right.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.066
The next one is...

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:47.233
"I got 99 problems but blank
ain't one."

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:48.366
[laughter]

00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:52.200
[suspenseful music]

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.200
- [giggles]

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:05.533
[squeals]

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:10.600
- Good?

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.600
All right.
"Got 99 problems but"...

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.000
"A tiny horse" ain't one.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.900
[laughter]

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.866
Already I think that's
the winner.

00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:21.266
"Judge Judy" ain't one.

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.866
[laughter]

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:25.233
"Balls" ain't one.

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:27.000
[laughter and applause]
- Who did that?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.533
You did that, Chord.

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:32.200
[laughter]

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.066
"Inappropriate yodeling"
ain't one.

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:38.333
"Her Majesty,
Queen Elizabeth II."

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:40.333
- No, I wish that was mine.
- Oh.

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:43.066
I'm gonna say--
oh, "balls" is gonna win.

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:44.366
[cheers and applause]
- "Balls."

00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:46.300
- "Balls" is gonna win!
[bell dings]

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.600
- Oh, my God!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.533
[applause]

00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:52.800
- Although I really like
the tiny horse!

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.533
- Who did "a tiny horse"?
- That was mine.

00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:56.000
- Oh...
- It's okay.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.966
- Let's see the next one.

00:02:57.966 --> 00:03:00.300
"What's my secret power?"

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.300
[suspenseful music]

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:22.466
[laughter]

00:03:22.466 --> 00:03:24.900
[louder laughter]

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.433
[indistinct chatting]

00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:29.900
- All right.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.733
"What's my secret power?"

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:32.933
"Powerful thighs."

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:34.766
- Ooh!
[laughter]

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:35.966
- Always good.

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.366
"Seeing Grandma naked."

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:39.600
[laughter]

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.033
"Pretending to care."

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:42.633
[loud laughter]

00:03:42.633 --> 00:03:43.933
- I've heard that's--
I've heard that's a good one.

00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:47.300
"Licking things to claim them
as your own."

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.166
[laughter]

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:50.633
"Waiting till marriage."

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:52.333
[laughter]

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:55.166
I think "pretending to care"!
- Yeah!

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:57.700
You won!
- Oh, good job, Lea.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.666
- Thank you.
- Good job, good job.

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:01.500
[applause]

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.533
- Aw, they're all good.
That was good, though.

00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:06.333
All right, the next one is:

00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:08.666
"What are my parents hiding
from me?"

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:10.366
[laughter]
[suspenseful music]

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:13.366
[suspenseful music]

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.166
[indistinct chatting]

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:21.233
- Oh, are you thinking placing
is what's getting you

00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:22.933
the right answers,
is that your trick?

00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:23.966
- No, I just wanted the...
- Proper placement?

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:25.100
- [indistinct] space.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.133
- "What are my parents hiding
from me?"

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:28.133
"The milkman."

00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:30.866
[laughter]

00:04:30.866 --> 00:04:32.766
- "Women in yogurt commercials."

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:35.066
[laughter]

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.066
"The Amish."

00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:38.533
[laughter]

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:39.933
"Children on leashes."

00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:42.600
[loud laughter]

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.433
"Full frontal nudity."
[laughter and reaction]

00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:45.833
And the winner is
"full frontal nudity."

00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:46.866
- Yes!

00:04:46.866 --> 00:04:47.866
[cheers and applause]
[bell dings]

00:04:47.866 --> 00:04:49.800
I am back in this game!

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.466
- It's rigged.
- I am coming for you, Chord.

00:04:52.466 --> 00:04:53.700
- That's how you play that game,

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.633
and we'll be right back,
everybody.
