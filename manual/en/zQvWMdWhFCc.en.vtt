00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.900
Every week, We're asked the question:

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.960
This is an incredibly complicated question.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.200
One that James has had to
wrestle with both vocationally,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.920
and pedago....

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.340
This word.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.240
But this week,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.620
We're gonna try to give you the best answer
we've been able to come up with.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.360
So, What should you learn
if you want to be a game designer?

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.420
You ready?

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.400
Seriously, Game Design is
the art of crafting experiences.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.940
And you'll find yourself
drawing on everything you have.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.080
To a great game designer,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.540
There is NO useless knowledge.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.940
But, not all of us have the time to
learn everything that ever was or will be,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.600
before starting to design experiences.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.140
So, what should you focus on?

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.500
Well, First, you can start with the
game designer's single, most core skill.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.180
As you start to build games,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.120
most of you would find that

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.020
you have to work with
interdisciplinary teams.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.660
Teams formed of people with
radically different skill sets,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.620
and backgrounds from you.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.320
If you work on video games,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.480
you'll have to work with artists,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.180
programmers,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.880
designers,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.740
producers,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.660
sound guys,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.140
marketers,
and business people.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.180
If you can't communicate the experience

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.860
you're trying to design to each of these groups,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.820
the quality of your ideas would not matter

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.040
because these are the people
that translate those ideas

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.480
into an experience that reaches the world.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.240
The tricky part here is
how different all these people are.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.940
I know it's a horrible generalization,
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.420
Artists and Programmers have

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.900
a totally opposite, diametrically
opposed way of approaching problem.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.060
And it's your job to make both of those
people share the same vision.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.840
Which brings us to our next point.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.160
And this is extremely important.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.800
A game designer is not
the same as a director.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.700
Your job is not to be a dictator:

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.900
demanding people to implement
your brilliant ideas.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.740
Everyone who touches a game
influences its design.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.080
Even if you don't intent from them to.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.320
When your programmer
writes a physics system,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.580
the choices he makes are gonna
impact the design of the game.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.060
Anyone out there who thinks that

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.720
the designer is the guy who gets
to decide what the game is,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.160
has some serious desolution with ahead of them
before they can excel at this job.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.100
Speaking of common misconceptions,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.440
here's another important tip.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.740
Game design is not the job of
creating fabulous stories,

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.440
or coming up with concepts for games.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.980
Concepts are cheap.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.540
Every one of you budding designers

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.820
probably have 5 or 6
you can pull out right now.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.120
Even if you don't want to
get into game design,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.320
probably come up with
1 or 2 game ideas over the years.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.440
Hell, I'd be a terrible game designer but,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.940
even I can come up with 2 or 3.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.060
Not only your game concepts cheap,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.400
but they're also pretty meaningless.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.220
At the end of the day,
the best selling franchise of all time

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.860
is about an Italian stereotype
in hallucinogens.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.920
One of the most lotted concepts of
the last few years was,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.820
First Person Shooter,

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.660
Anne Ran,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.280
underwater.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.920
Go.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.000
Real game design is a lot of
hard-wrote work.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.380
creating systems, mechanics and levels,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.660
Concepts are great,

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.660
but if that's what you want to do,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.500
you probably better find another field.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.100
There isn't just any room in the game studio
for a specialized, idea guy.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.740
Every game studio is full of idea guys.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.500
And everyone who works there has ideas.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.380
Good ones.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.740
What studios are looking for

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.820
are people who can make
those concepts to reality.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.340
Another important thing that every
game designer has to learn eventually,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.940
is that you are the worst judge of your games.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.860
Especially early on, when you can justify away the flaws,

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.580
It's easy to fall into the trap of saying

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.480
that people just don't get it because
they haven't seen the finished product.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.220
This is almost never true.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.160
Introspection and the ability to take
criticism are core designer skills.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.520
Don't let yourself get
too attached to your ideas.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.080
Because you'll always be wrong.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.420
No great game has ever, ever sprung
fully-formed from a game designer's head.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.020
Games need players.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.600
Players themselves design
half the experiences of their play.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.120
Being able to accept that
your idea didn't work.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.820
To be willing to give upon
that idea you loved so much

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.300
because it just isn't working,

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.560
and try something else.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.760
These are the hallmarks of
a great game designer.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.280
Next, game design is a disciplint.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.280
Just because you played a lot of games or

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.700
a whole lot of a specific game

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.900
does not mean you're
prepared to design games.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.300
Most of the time, designers don't play games.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.300
They study them, and analyze them.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.660
They deconstruct their systems
and test all their break points.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.620
A designer who figure out where
all the triggers are located,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.320
and then try to figure out why.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.900
They'll reverse engineer the math
behind the principle systems.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.300
Designers are as fascinated by
what makes an experience unfun,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.480
as by what makes it fun.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.420
Additionally, a game designer must understand
the cost of the decisions they make.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.420
Whenever you make a decision as a designer,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.420
what you're really doing is
asking people to do work.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.660
That work represents time and money.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.800
And you have a finite amount of work
that will ever be done on your project.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.380
Your job as a designer

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.380
is to ensure the most bang for your buck.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.180
I know this may not seem like
that big of deal but,

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.620
this is the number one
cause of failed games.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.640
From the giants of the AAA industry

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.300
to the small fry hobbyist motors,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.440
more game projects fail because of
teams with the poor sense of scope

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.580
than any other reason.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.340
As a corollary of that point,
understand that no game has ever done.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.100
Never.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.380
During the process of
putting your game together,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.780
I guarantee you'll find things
you should've done differently,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.400
and discover countless other
amazing things you could do.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.140
File those ideas away.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.080
Or, at least realize how incredibly expensive usually is

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.140
to expand the scope of your game mid-stream.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.220
Remember. At some point, you must ship.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.860
You can't work on your game forever.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.860
And you haven't made a game
unless people are playing it.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.400
On top of all that stuff,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.600
here's a list of many practical skills you'll
need if you want to be a game designer.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.220
#1. A high level of technical writing skill.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.420
That's technical, not creative writing skill.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.880
I'm talking about grammar,
spelling, and punctuation here.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.060
I'm sure that this isn't a problem
for most of you but,

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.000
For some of you...

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Nah, like I said,
we do read the e-mails.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.620
#2. A solid grounding of logic,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.880
#3. Some basic psychology,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.740
#4. Understanding the
medium you're working in.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.720
You're gonna be building an electronic game, so

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.160
learning the fundamentals of
how a computer works would be a good idea.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.680
#5. A solid grasp of mathematics.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.980
At least through advanced algebra.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.860
Those skills will prepare you
to be decent game designer.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.260
Now. You want to be a
really good game designer,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.480
you'll also need...

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.720
#1. A thorough knowledge of
literature, philosophy, and myth.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.640
#2. An understanding of world religions.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.760
#3. Basic scripting and programming ability.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.700
#4 An understanding of art principles.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.280
You don't have to be a great artist, but

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.720
you do need to understand art.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.720
If you happen to be able to sketch,
or throw together a collage on Photoshops,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.620
so much the better.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.980
#5. An understanding of basic
audio design and musical principals.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.940
If you have it already,
go pick up an instrument.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.340
It's good for the soul, anyway.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.280
#6. A practical knowledge of graphic design.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.100
#7. A thorough internal library
of games to reference.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.300
This is where having played
a lot of games will help you.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.340
The more games in genres
you've experienced,

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.560
the more you'll have to draw from.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.220
But most of all, you'll need life experience.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.720
As a designer, your crafting experiences.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.920
You cannot do this without having some yourself.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.980
Knowing all about video games,

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.980
anime, or Star Wars expanded universe

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.860
isn't gonna cut it.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.800
Go live.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.360
A well balanced, well examined life
will make you a great designer.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.660
Last and most obvious of all,

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.720
Make games.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.420
If you weren't sure where to begin,
you can always start with pen and paper games.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.860
Things you could put together
out of chip and poster board.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.700
or, if you're dead set on jumping
right into electronic games,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.040
We recommend Gamemaker
for the PC owners,

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.760
or Gamesalad if you got a Mac.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.780
Both of these programs are free,

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.280
have a lower barrier to entry,

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.980
and will teach you the logic of a computer

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.420
without expecting you to already
have a lot of programming knowledge.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.880
Be Brave.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.660
Be Bold.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.440
Create.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.920
Bring us new experiences, and
help to expand the language of games.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.980
Good Luck.
and See you next week.
