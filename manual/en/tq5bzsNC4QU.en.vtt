00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.910
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.590
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.450
All the king’s horses and king’s men

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.080
Couldn’t put Humpty together again

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.090
The depths of her cold eyes filled with a grief deeper than any other’s

00:00:48.780 --> 00:01:00.540
With her gaze she asked, “Are you going somewhere? Are you leaving me behind?”

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.850
Dear my sis

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.450
Dear my sis

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.660
It seemed to me – What a miserable destiny!

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.970
I couldn’t even turn to face

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.520
the gates, firmly shut…

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.950
I wonder, are things this way because you want them to be…?

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.190
So we’ve been living, just you and me since we were born.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.030
Just us two, sisters…

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.450
So we’d be living like this forever I thought.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.070
I so wanted to live beside you…

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.390
Gimme a proof.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.190
Let me believe in you…

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.270
Please!

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.200
Let me know that you love me!

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.910
Take my hand like you once did

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.020
and look straight at me!

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.530
Call my name!

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.090
I’m still in love with you.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.800
Can’t I “continue” anymore…?

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.170
I keep searching through the darkness

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.310
For the exit out of this labyrinth of forbidden love

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.060
Oh my sis…

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.220
If I’m going to be all alone until the very end

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.910
Then why shouldn’t I just die before you?

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.650
Then when you went as well

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.020
Right? In the end, there would be none.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.440
I still have no way of knowing what it’s like for two people to be happy together

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:28.250
Just like those at the end of fairy tales we were so used to listening to

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.260
Dear my sis

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.570
Dear my sis

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.010
I wonder if there’s a way we’ll somehow meet again.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.880
But I may lose hope..

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:07.280
Perhaps I’m losing my interest in the world beyond this gate.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.810
So we might be too innocent to know each other.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.330
But if that’s just a little misunderstanding…

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.860
So we might be too awkward, I thought..

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.410
But I have no way of knowing…

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.820
Give me some proof.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.490
Let me believe in you…

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.620
Please!

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.610
Let me out beyond this gate!

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.230
For this play in a world of mirrors

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.370
Where is the audience!?

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.820
Call my name!

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.440
I’m still in love with you.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.280
Perhaps I’m just afraid of the other side

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.170
and I just can’t bring myself to step forward..

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.110
I just want courage.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.170
Obviously,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.750
There’s nothin’ too late.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.640
I wish I become conscious of it.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.640
Now I’m goin’ to bloom,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.040
against to deep gloom,

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.700
So my sis, never let me alone,

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.700
CALL MY NAME!

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.560
I’ve got a proof.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.250
Then I will cross the line.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.980
From the very beginning to the very end

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.590
I want to be alone together with you

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.020
Now I’ll make myself smile

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.430
The very best I can

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.430
I’ve got a proof.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.240
From a great fall.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.130
I won’t need a “continue” anymore will I?

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.490
What made it clear to me

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.480
Was a small misunderstanding, both fleeting and foolish

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.370
Since the very beginning there were only us two.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.030
If I want only us two to be there ’til the very end,

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.100
Then I’ll just leave this room behind me

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.030
And afterward – then there will be none.
