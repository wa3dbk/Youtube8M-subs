Give a woman a Chocolate Éclair and she'll stuff her face for 20 seconds.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.280
Teach a woman how to make Chocolate Éclairs and she'll stuff her face for a lifetime!

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:19.130
[Intro music]

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.050
So I'm gonna show you how to make these une Profiteroles and first thing we have to do is to make

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.150
some choux pastry.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
I've no idea why it's called choux pastry.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.509
I mean, you can't wear it on your feet!

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.000
So let's start by making the choux pastry. I've got 65 g of plain or all-purpose flour,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.950
2 beaten eggs and 50 g of butter.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.680
Put a 150 ml of water in a pan,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.260
drop in the butter

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.880
and very gently bring it up to the boil.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.140
The moment it comes to the boil, turn off the heat,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.370
dump in the flour and mix it really vigorously.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.080
It will go all horrible and clunky at the start but stick with it.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.050
And eventually goes to this kind of smooth paste.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.480
Now add in the egg, a little bit at a time.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.300
Beat it in.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.150
A little bit more.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.310
Beat that in.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.750
There will come a point at which this paste becomes thick and glossy

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.470
and drops, kind of reluctantly, off the spoon.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.370
Yeah. It's going. Doesn't want to but it will.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.070
I haven't used all the egg but it's fine. This is what I want.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.610
Our next step is much easier if you've got something to pipe this stuff with.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.479
I'm using my piping syringe.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.450
I'll put the pastry into the syringe.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.340
OK. My syringe is now full and I'm gonna leave this nozzle wide open.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.520
On this baking tray I've got some lightly buttered baking paper

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.690
and I'm gonna squeeze out

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.019
some walnut-sized blobs onto the paper.

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:16.579
Come on! Out you come.

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.499
Space them apart 'cos these things are gonna puff up in the oven.

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:25.980
And over here I'm gonna pipe out

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.209
a sausage

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.239
just to show you

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.260
that you can use this dough to make an Éclair as well.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.509
I'll pop these in the oven at 200 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes.

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:43.759
Then after 15 minutes turn the temperature down to 170 degrees Celsius

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:47.239
and cook for a further 10 minutes.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.559
After 10 minutes remove from the oven and just

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:56.909
poke a little hole in the bottom to let any steam out.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:03.379
And with the Éclair, just drive a skewer right the way through the middle.

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.209
Now pop these back in the oven for just 5 more minutes.

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:15.079
After another 5 minutes we can pop them onto a baking tray to cool. Looking nice and crispy.

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.809
Now leave them to cool.

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:21.779
Sorry, I can't resist it!

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:25.949
Now to finish off these delight we need some chocolate. It's about 100 g here.

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:32.639
200 ml of double cream or thick cream and 4 tablespoons of icing sugar.

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:40.229
Whisk together the cream and the icing sugar.

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.619
Alrighty. That needed a couple of minutes of whipping.

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:48.269
Load up your piping bag or syringe with the cream

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.339
and using the hole that you made in the bottom of your Profiteroles and the nozzle

00:03:53.339 --> 00:04:05.209
insert the nozzle and inject in some cream.

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.209
I reckon that one's full.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.949
Just wipe off any excess.

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.119
Pop it on a plate.

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:16.489
And the next.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.159
And it's exactly the same with the Éclair.

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.600
Just go squirrrrrt!

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.639
Well, that's the cream done. Now for the chocolate.

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.250
Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a pan of boiling water.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.560
Once your chocolate's melted you can take a Profiterole

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.979
and you can either just dip it in.

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.830
Hmmm.... Put it to one side

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.809
or you can just brush the chocolate on.

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:47.889
Brushing works particularly well for the Éclair if you can't

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.090
get it into your bowl which I obviously can't,

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.369
Now I'd definitely recommend popping these in the fridge for a little while to get the chocolate to harden.

00:04:57.369 --> 00:05:00.430
Chocolate Éclairs and Profiteroles.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.780
To die for!

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.860
So... Can I eat this now? Thank you!

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.259
Join me next time in Titli's Busy Kitchen with me Titli Nihaan.

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:14.599
Until next time... Hmmm....

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:21.599
Khuda hafiz.
