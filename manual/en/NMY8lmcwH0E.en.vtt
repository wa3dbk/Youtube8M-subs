00:00:05.403 --> 00:00:08.642
Hi, this is Howtechs with another peripheral review.

00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:12.114
Phonejoy is a Bluetooth Game Controller

00:00:12.114 --> 00:00:13.978
that works with Android and iCade.

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:18.809
The Phonejoy controller features a unique EasySlider expansion mechanism

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:21.550
that allows Phonejoy to expand to nearly triple its length.

00:00:21.815 --> 00:00:24.821
This allows Phonejoy to wrap around almost any Android smartphone

00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:27.897
up to and including the Samsung Galaxy Note III.

00:00:27.897 --> 00:00:32.291
Phonejoy's free Android and iOS app keeps your whole experience hassle-free,

00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:35.362
putting hundreds of cool games right at your fingertips.

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:37.942
It's the ultimate feel of console gaming in pocket sized,

00:00:37.942 --> 00:00:40.371
full-featured and unmatched portability.

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:42.872
Whether in portrait or landscape

00:00:42.872 --> 00:00:46.857
Phonejoy fits almost any smartphone thanks to the EasySlider™ mechanism.

00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:49.268
Phonejoy has been designed to grow with you,

00:00:49.268 --> 00:00:52.279
so when you decide to upgrade your phone it will still fit.

00:00:52.764 --> 00:00:57.060
The EasySlider feature lets Phonejoy expand up to 3 times its original size.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.071
The rubber bumpers on the inside will prevent

00:00:59.072 --> 00:01:02.029
scratching and accidental pressing of power buttons.

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:06.099
Phonejoy truly takes gaming on the go by offering a full set of controls,

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:09.829
such as the L1/R1 shoulder buttons, four front action buttons,

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.927
a D-pad, and analog thumbsticks.

00:01:11.928 --> 00:01:14.534
Every button and thumbstick has been placed based on

00:01:14.534 --> 00:01:17.914
frequency of use, best precision and ergonomic comfort.

00:01:17.914 --> 00:01:22.733
The controller also has low latency that offers almost instantaneous reaction.

00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:25.678
It's easy to set up Phonejoy for use with your device.

00:01:25.678 --> 00:01:30.247
Using both hands as pictured, softly pull both sides, expanding the EasySlider.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.540
With one hand, press your middle ﬁnger against the opposite surface.

00:01:39.524 --> 00:01:40.854
Release the other hand.

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:43.031
With the slider expanded by your middle ﬁnger,

00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:46.339
use your free hand to grab your device &amp; put it into the gap.

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:49.771
Then softly push the device against the slider’s right rubber pad.

00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:51.748
Use the left hand to expand further,

00:01:51.748 --> 00:01:55.351
while your right hand ﬁrmly places the device ﬂat onto the slider.

00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:57.930
Now, smoothly collapse both sides.

00:02:01.243 --> 00:02:03.064
To pair your device with Phonejoy,

00:02:03.064 --> 00:02:04.252
turn Phonejoy on,

00:02:04.252 --> 00:02:06.006
pushing its Power Button to the left.

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:07.961
Start-up may take a few seconds.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.286
To enter Gamepad mode for Android device,

00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:14.885
press and hold the BACK and X button until the Status LED turns to blue.

00:02:15.727 --> 00:02:18.054
To enter iCade mode for iOS device,

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:22.526
press and hold the BACK and B button until the Status LED turns to red.

00:02:23.617 --> 00:02:25.473
To enter TV/Navigation mode,

00:02:25.473 --> 00:02:29.904
press and hold the BACK and Y button until the Status LED turns to yellow.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.491
Then, pair Phonejoy and your device via Bluetooth via your phone's settings.

00:02:34.824 --> 00:02:36.670
To use the Phonejoy's dedicated app,

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.549
go to your device's app store and search for “Phonejoy”.

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.696
Download the app to find games made for and compatible with Phonejoy.

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:45.974
Let's compare Phonejoy with

00:02:45.974 --> 00:02:48.866
MOGA Hero Power, MOGA Pro Power, MOGA Pivot,

00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:52.944
Nyko PlayPad, Nyko PlayPad Pro, Gametel, and iPega.

00:02:52.944 --> 00:02:55.770
Phonejoy is more expensive than others by at least 30 dollars,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.834
and the battery life is a bit shorter compared to its competitors.

00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:00.455
Phonejoy's major pro is that

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:04.788
it is not only Android but also iOS, TV and even computers,

00:03:04.788 --> 00:03:07.202
so you can game with it no matter what your device.

00:03:07.202 --> 00:03:11.103
It is small and light while offering direct support for the largest phones;

00:03:11.103 --> 00:03:14.428
the MOGAs are heavier and don't offer the same flexibility,

00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:16.605
nor the sturdiness of the mechanism.

00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:19.421
Phonejoy had its own Companion App listed more than

00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:24.192
250 compatible games in Android and 300 iCade game in iOS.

00:03:24.192 --> 00:03:25.797
For the Device compatibility,

00:03:25.797 --> 00:03:30.378
EasySlider mechanism let device up to 6.1” long attached

00:03:30.378 --> 00:03:34.080
but others can only let device up to 3.2” wide attached

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.083
or no attachment functionality.

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.511
Phonejoy Basic Bundle with only the Controller cost $69.90.

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:42.726
Advanced Bundle with the Controller, pouch,

00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:46.485
audio adapter, USB cable and power adapter cost $79.90.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.695
Pro Bundle with the Controller, pouch, audio adapter,

00:03:49.695 --> 00:03:54.627
USB cable, power adapter, kickstand and travel case cost $89.90.

00:03:54.847 --> 00:03:57.160
Although it is more expensive than other controllers,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.307
we believe it's worth paying $30 more

00:03:59.307 --> 00:04:01.593
for a more flexible and versatile controller

00:04:01.593 --> 00:04:06.975
that's compatible with Android, iOS, TV(Apple TV is not supported) or a computer.

00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:09.865
For the best compatibility across the most platforms,

00:04:09.865 --> 00:04:12.986
as well as the most secure fit with the widest variety of devices,

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:15.632
take a look at Phonejoy very carefully.
