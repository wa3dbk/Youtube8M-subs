00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:09.459
Oh look, another zombie apocalypse game.

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:10.459
What?

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.960
It's an endless runner as well, that has a
store to upgrade your chances of survival

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.360
and the length of the game?

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.320
Gee, we haven't seen anything like this before,
he said sarcastically.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.710
With all this being the case, Into the Dead
does something astonishing.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.280
It offers a breathtakingly gorgeous engaging
gaming experience.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.849
Load the game up, and you'll start right near
a crashed helicopter.

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.250
Turning around, there's nothing but fields
and the undead all around you.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.930
There's only one course of action... run!

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.330
You can choose your method of flight, but
the tilt controls work excellently and you'll

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.340
be weaving through zombies in no time.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.170
You can brush past them, and any other obstacles
that get in your way, but come into a head-on

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.100
collision, and you've just become that zombie's
dinner.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.480
The coins you obtain for your run and completing
the game's missions are used in the store

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.692
to unlock weapons, but they're also used for
perks.

00:00:53.692 --> 00:00:56.260
Perks are equipped at the start of the game.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.620
Each perk cost one hundred coins, and you
can equip the whole gamut if you have the

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.320
cash and the desire to (which funnily enough
is one the missions that becomes available).

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.400
The whole store aspect isn't really that intrusive
either.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.640
The only problem is that the game... well
it's not the most difficult experience out

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.850
there, and chances are any gamer with an intermediate
level of skill shall reach some of the new

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.970
locations, but the missions that are completed
for reaching these locations come along a

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.080
little later.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.920
What we're saying is that some balancing is
this area might need to happen.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.140
Now the presentation is one reason the experience
is so enjoyable.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.840
Atmosphere is the key word here, with the
camera angle, the fog, the color palette,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.640
and the lighting all coming together to create
something visually rich, especially on a mobile

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.640
device.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.030
On older phones, performance is a problem,
with some frame rate loss, but nothing that

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.890
shouldn't sort itself out a few seconds into
your run.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.409
So while the actual game isn't that complex
and the difficulty curve takes a little while

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.260
to kick in, Into the Dead is a joy to play,
and an easy recommend, even for those who

00:01:51.260 --> 00:02:00.680
are sick of both zombies and endless runners.
