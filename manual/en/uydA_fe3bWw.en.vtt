00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.995
So, the two of us went to TED

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:32.713
because we wanted to learn
and develop and have new ideas.

00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:39.507
For example, people who
dropped out of law school

00:00:39.508 --> 00:00:42.122
to ride a bike; I saw that and thought

00:00:42.123 --> 00:00:43.346
‘Wow, that’s so cool,

00:00:43.347 --> 00:00:46.019
let's leave everything behind
and ride our bikes too.’

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.252
I think that I have
learned more than Raquel,

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.905
because she loses a little
with my interpretation.

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:01.335
I was born normal, hearing,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.858
and I lost my hearing
when I was 2 years old

00:01:03.887 --> 00:01:05.964
because I had some very strong antibiotics.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.777
I studied at normal schools

00:01:07.778 --> 00:01:11.418
and also at schools
specialized in the deaf, and so

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:12.740
I have learned to
communicate with the deaf

00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:15.480
and also with the
hearing, by oralism.

00:01:17.093 --> 00:01:21.872
I met Raquel back
in 2004, at college,

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:25.653
we started dating and
we’ve been together ever since,

00:01:25.654 --> 00:01:32.491
working together;
our website, sur10.net

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:38.150
was actually her project at college.

00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:43.689
So, last year it happened that

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.173
there was the project ‘Vamos
em sinais 2009’ and the two of us,

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:50.371
along with four Germans,

00:01:50.372 --> 00:01:53.796
we participated, riding our bikes
together for this project.

00:01:53.797 --> 00:02:00.327
We left São Paulo and we cycled
to Rio de Janeiro in 26 days,

00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:05.043
we cycled a total of
1,200 km to spread and

00:02:05.044 --> 00:02:08.797
show sign language at
schools for the deaf,

00:02:08.798 --> 00:02:11.094
inclusive schools and normal schools.

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:18.485
This t-shirt I’m wearing here

00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:21.409
has the German sign alphabet

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.210
and the ‘Vamonos em señas 2009’
is in Spanish

00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:28.988
because the entire project took place

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.018
throughout Latin America and
South America.

00:02:32.573 --> 00:02:37.762
Now, we will continue with
project ‘Vamos em sinais 2010’.

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:42.129
What’s the objective now?

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.175
To visit more pedagogy
courses at universities,

00:02:45.176 --> 00:02:48.717
because teachers must
learn and develop their

00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:52.159
knowledge of Brazilian
sign language,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.916
because they’ll have
deaf students in the future,

00:02:53.917 --> 00:02:57.022
today, in Brazil, there’s inclusion,

00:02:57.023 --> 00:03:01.004
and the deaf must study
together with the hearing.

00:03:02.822 --> 00:03:06.036
So, the teacher must know,
they must know sign language.

00:03:09.993 --> 00:03:16.888
I have learned...
Raquel has taught me the basics.

00:03:20.573 --> 00:03:23.033
My family has always forced
me to oralism,

00:03:26.727 --> 00:03:29.712
and I also took Diego to
all the parties

00:03:29.713 --> 00:03:31.449
to meet many of my deaf friends

00:03:34.225 --> 00:03:36.947
so he learned how to
communicate with the community,

00:03:36.948 --> 00:03:39.130
he learned each sign
and memorized it.

00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:40.049
Yes, that was it,

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.195
it was out of love, a lot of love,
a lot of tenderness.

00:03:50.842 --> 00:03:53.237
Wanted:

00:03:53.473 --> 00:03:55.425
new ways to move things;

00:03:55.975 --> 00:03:57.659
brighter houses;

00:03:58.122 --> 00:04:00.490
Jobs that have not yet been invented.

00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.162
business that generate more than profits;

00:04:04.548 --> 00:04:07.040
simple people discovering their importance;

00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:09.964
a better world for our children,

00:04:10.244 --> 00:04:12.206
and better children for our world.

00:04:12.616 --> 00:04:15.033
In 2010, we can make all of that happen.

00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:16.561
Let’s do it together?

00:04:16.562 --> 00:04:18.186
Santander Group Brazil

00:04:18.187 --> 00:04:20.590
Valuing ideas for a better life.
