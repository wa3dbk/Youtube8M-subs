00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.360
Oh hello! Oooooh, I need to sort out my face

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.760
There we go!

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.380
Today I'm going to tell you about my swanky new pad!

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.980
Ooooooh fruit!

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.760
Grocery!!!

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.580
What's that about!?

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.080
Granolaaaaaa

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.310
After arriving in Tokyo I was fortunate
enough to have been put up in a

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.720
temporary apartment for a couple of
weeks by my employer

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.989
What I hadn't taken into account however,
was just how difficult it is to find an

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.860
apartment in Tokyo in just two weeks

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.920
I was also grossly unprepared for all of the
up-front costs associated with finding

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.190
accommodation in Tokyo

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.990
Firstly there's 'reikin' which is like a finder's
fee otherwise known as key money

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.879
Then there's 'shikikin', which is like
a security deposit

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.000
and is often about two months worth of the
rent but in many cases

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.600
isn't actually a deposit and is just an
upfront cost under the guise of a deposit

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.230
Then on top of those there are cleaning fees, insurance fees

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.489
agency fees if you use an agent. Which I
did...

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.649
So all in all new apartment means poor,
penniless Stu

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.360
But that aside, I am pretty happy
with my new place

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.400
Home sweet home!

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.610
So I just moved into my new apartment.
Actually my apartment and not a temporary one.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.060
It's pretty nice! I've got my stuff with me.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.539
Got my guitar, a big ass blue suitcase

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.059
my bags, my cracked Mac...yaaaayyy

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.200
As soon as I moved in I realised I
was missing some essentials

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.749
so I went straight out to a department
store to get them!

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:38.110
All of this stuff

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.880
Got a whole duvet set, pillows, a rice cooker and some rice

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.270
and a box of tissues

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.780
Like, everything I need. It's great.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.700
Then I noticed I'd done something
really stupid

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.700
Oh crap...

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.720
I forgot to hand in the key
to my old apartment

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.020
I'm going to have to go there now 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.840
[Moans and groans]

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.820
I need a wee

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.580
After getting the train
back to my old apartment

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.300
I then handed the key back like I was
originally supposed to

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.020
and then got the train back to my new place

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.060
So I've settled into my new place

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.720
and I gotta say It's actually pretty nice. I'm liking it.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.480
Let me show you it!

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.480
So this is the main living space  

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.840
got my bed here,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.010
this wonderful space for...stuff

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.460
Ha! Hey...

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.100
Got this super low table with no
chair. Which is comfortable...

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.200
Got a TV,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.700
A wonderful view! Look at this view!

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.880
Ho hoooooo, things

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.320
Main entrance and hallway

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.340
with a bit of a kitchen area

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.340
This is a rice cooker that a bought. It's amazing!  

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.280
Got a bathroom here

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.280
Oh, hey you

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.790
Got my toilet and sink, cupboard space

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.540
and a bit of a shower room

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.590
Aaahhh yeah!

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.430
But I still felt there were many things that
I needed before it felt like home

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.190
for example a clothes horse to dry my
clothes on

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.150
because there's a washing machine but no where to dry my stuff

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.640
Except I guess here...but it's pretty cold

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.820
So I think my clothes will just freeze there

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.800
Because as the famous saying goes

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.720
"It ain't a home, if there ain't no clothes horse"

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.720
[Horse neigh sound]

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.140
After buying some basic things for my apartment

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.370
I then went to meet an old friend of mine who I actually met during my time teaching

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.560
English in Southern Japan

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.860
but who now lives in Tokyo

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.880
[A wild Maddy appears!]

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.660
Stuuuuuu! Stu Stu Stu Stu!

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.580
As I had originally met Maddy
over three years ago in Kyushu

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.360
We reminisced about the old times whilst
doing some shopping

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.780
The cat food

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.100
The cat food!? [laughs]

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.300
POW!

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.980
We then went to karaoke, which is always
interesting with Maddy given her broad

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.099
musical tastes

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.000
here's one for you Marilyn Manson fans out there

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.540
[Marilyn Manson's song playing]

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.370
and for fans of Youkai Watch I give you...

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:18.490
[Youkai Watch theme tune]

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.040
Next time I talk about Christmas in
Japan

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.260
which although may not be relevant right now

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.380
Will be relevant once a year, every year

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.900
