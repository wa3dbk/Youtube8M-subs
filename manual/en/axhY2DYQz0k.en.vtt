00:00:06.453 --> 00:00:09.310
&gt;&gt; Dracula: We will not
sigh in the castle, Silus.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.656
We silently brew.

00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:15.890
&gt;&gt; Silus: But Dad, I want to rule
San Fransisco and the X Men won't let me.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.900
&gt;&gt; Dracula: Then we'll just have
to turn the X Men to our side.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.077
&gt;&gt; Silus: How?

00:00:21.077 --> 00:00:22.912
&gt;&gt; Dracula: It's quite simple.

00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:24.631
[MUSIC]

00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:29.865
We send the X-Men an invitation to
a weekend at the castle in their honor.

00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:32.349
[MUSIC]

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.248
&gt;&gt; Gambit: Zoinks, y'all,
it sure is spooky around this house, yeah.

00:00:38.248 --> 00:00:39.547
&gt;&gt; Wolverine: Don't worry, Cajun.
[LAUGH]

00:00:39.547 --> 00:00:42.288
&gt;&gt; Wolverine: I'm the best there
is at what I do-be-do-be-do!

00:00:42.288 --> 00:00:43.704
[LAUGH]

00:00:43.704 --> 00:00:46.093
&gt;&gt; Dracula: Dracula, blah, blah!

00:00:46.093 --> 00:00:49.368
&gt;&gt; [NOISE]

00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:54.179
&gt;&gt; Silus: Lame, the X Men aren't
gonna fall for that old-timey junk.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.381
They need to be enticed with
a little irresistible vampire charm.

00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:01.865
[NOISE]

00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:05.162
[MUSIC]

00:01:05.162 --> 00:01:09.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Hey, I've seen you around.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.410
&gt;&gt; Silus: Yeah.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.160
But you best stay away.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.370
For mine is a dangerous,
tortured existence.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Oh, okay.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.609
&gt;&gt; Silus: No, my world is not for you.

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.025
What with its perils and blood and tre-.

00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:22.369
[SOUND] Dad

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.741
&gt;&gt; Dracula: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:25.906
All that mopey, pointless dialogue and

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:28.524
the formulamatic tension
put me right to sleep.

00:01:28.524 --> 00:01:30.822
&gt;&gt; Silus: Ugh!

00:01:30.822 --> 00:01:34.032
Were vampires ever cool?

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:35.542
[MUSIC]

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:37.005
&gt;&gt; Vampire: Hell yeah we were!

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:41.325
If you want to bite the X Mens' faces off,
first you've got to rock their faces off.

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:44.063
1987 style!

00:01:44.063 --> 00:01:47.367
[NOISE]

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:52.654

Your universe.
