Hi, I am Monica, an Optical Engineer here
at Edmund Optics.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.260
Today, I want to talk about the definition
of collimated light and how you can use it

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.240
to determine the focal length of a lens.
Collimated light occurs when light rays are

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.420
travelling parallel to each other,
as opposed to converging to a focus or diverging

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.480
away from the center.
Essentially, you can consider collimated light

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.400
to be focused at infinity.
To collimate a diverging light source with a

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.920
lens, you can place the lens a distance away
from the source, equal to the focal length

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.980
of the lens.
Here, we have a diverging beam of light and

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.940
a positive lens at a distance equal to the focal
length away.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.360
As you can see, the light spot stays about
the same size at any distance away from the lens.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.920
Alternatively, if collimated light enters

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.700
a lens, it focuses at a distance equal to
one focal length.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.960
So if you have a lens with an unknown focal
length, you can use collimated light to determine

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.710
its focal length.
We can assume that light is collimated or

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.780
coming from infinity,
if the light source is greater than a distance

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.570
equal to 10x the focal length of the lens
away.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.500
An easy way to determine the approximate focal
length of a lens is to use the overhead lights

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.989
in a room,
which are a distance much greater than 10x the

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:29.640
focal length of common lenses.
The distance from the lens to the table when

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.830
the light is in focus is approximately the
focal length of the lens.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.000
Another way to measure this in a lab setup
is to use collimated light source like this

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.920
laser.
The distance between the lens and the focus

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.820
spot is equal to the focal length.
I hope this answers your questions about collimation

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.119
and the focal length of a single lens.
