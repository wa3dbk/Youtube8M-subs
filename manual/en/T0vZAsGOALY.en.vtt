00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.100
Hi, my name is Paul Jones. I'm at driver development
here at Bison Transport. We are here today

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.180
to look at our new 2015 Volvo Tractor Unit.
Bison has been involved with Volvo for a number

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.509
of years. And this is our latest addition
for 2015.

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.490
We're going to begin our tour with our new
LED headlights. As you can see here, the drivers

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.550
are going to love these LED headlights. They
give off a much wider beam and they have maximum

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.070
visibility at night-time. The old halogen
headlights were rated for approximately 300

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.690
hours. These new LED headlights are rated
for 30,000 hours.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.730
We'll move on and we can see we have fender
mirrors on both sides. Aerodynamic fender

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.130
mirrors for maximum fuel efficiency. On our
door mirrors, you can see we have an extra

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.380
guard here. This helps protect the side window
from excess rain and snow entering onto the

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.240
side window.
So as we look down the side of our 2015 Volvo,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.629
you will see we have our steps and side-skirts
for maximum fuel efficiency and good aerodynamics.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.740
We're now going to open our steps. The first
thing we're going to look at is our battery

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.980
isolator valve, which is situated above our
battery cover. We're going to remove our battery

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.140
cover. Very simple. And underneath you will
see your batteries. And underneath that is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.400
our air tanks with drain valves with the cables
attached. Very easy to drain your air tanks

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.130
at the end of the day. Steps close very easy
and just snap into place.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.250
So underneath the driver's door you can see
we have a plug-in for our block heater for

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.940
the engine block here to aid at winter-time.
Next to this, we have our air-supply valve.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.890
This will switch the air supply from our glad-hands
to the back to the sleeper to the glad-hands

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.420
to the back of the frame. This is used for
our turnpike drivers when they're hooking

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.640
up to converters. And on here we have our
diesel exhaust fluid filler cap.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.440
OK, so next, we have an additional plug. As
you can see, this is for the drivers to find

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.630
an electrical supply they can plug in here
and they can get air conditioning for their

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.529
sleeper cabin. So let's take a look around
the back of the sleeper. Underneath our catwalk

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:15.540
here, we have a separate compartment for our
APU batteries. And looking at our fifth wheel,

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.010
we do have a sliding fifth wheel. It is air-operated
and the switch can be found on the dashboard.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.709
So in the back of the tractor now, you can
see we have the extra glad-hands, the electric

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.889
plug-in socket and our pintle hitch. These
are used for hooking up to our converters

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.230
for our turnpike drivers.
So let's take a look under the hood of this

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.230
Volvo. The hood-catch is situated under the
steering column. Very easy to operate. You

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.620
just pull down and you can walk around and
open the hood. So let's open the hood of this

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.310
Vovlo. It is very lightweight, very simple
to pull off. You just pull from the front,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.359
it comes up very easy.
And underneath we have our Volvo D13 engine.

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:04.079
We have our 270 high-output alternator. We
have our oil filler cap, our power steering

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.230
fluid filler cap, our washer fluid filler
cap; our coolant header tank is at the top

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.370
of the radiator with the filler cap on the
other side.

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.669
So let's take a look inside this 2015 Volvo
Tractor Unit. The first thing we're going

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.629
to see is our stereo. This is blue-tooth enabled
for our drivers, so they can drive hands-free.

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.040
It is a lot safer. We have a switch here.
We talked about this earlier. This is for

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.900
our sliding fifth wheel. And we have an additional
switch here. This is new to our Vovlos this

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.040
year. This is air and in-cab air release,
fifth wheel.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.430
So we're in the sleeper now. Underneath the
sleeper, you will find your plug-ins. These

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.670
are 115-volt plug-in sockets. These are for
your microwave and your fridges and to charge

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.599
your iPhones. Up here, we have a TV bracket.
This is for the guys so they can watch some

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.389
TV in the evenings.
This is a nice new feature in our sleeper.

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:03.510
This is our in-cab, Climacab, heater and
air condition unit. Very simple to operate.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.839
You just turn the switch on. The display will
light up, but it's all touch-screen. And it's

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:14.159
very simple. You touch the symbol you want.
For example, air-conditioning. When the screen

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:20.199
changes all you do is push on the arrows up
or down to adjust your temperature. Very effective.

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:26.819
That concludes our tour of our new 2015 Volvo
Tractor. Bison takes pride in specâ€™ing our

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:31.830
new equipment for the latest industry features
to maximize fuel efficiency, add comfort on

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.919
the road, and ensure the safety of our drivers.
Thanks for watching, keep on trucking, and

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:37.360
stay safe.
