How about a recipe for a natural odor eliminator?

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.640
You know, we've all had to deal with odors
in our home.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.020
It can be a problem.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.019
And you can buy these commercial air fresheners
and odor eliminators, but if you read some

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.590
of the chemicals that go in them, well, they're
hardly organic or natural.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.040
So if you're looking for something that's
natural and safe that you can actually make

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.400
at home, here is a really simple idea.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.040
It's basically using alcohol -- you can use
vodka, if you like.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.870
You can also use isopropyl alcohol, or rubbing
alcohol, and water.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.600
And if you want it to have a certain aroma,
you can add an essential oil.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.600
And, basically, what you're doing is you're
just going to take a cup of water to 1 cup

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.820
of alcohol and just put it in a spray bottle
like this.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.170
If you want it to be scented and you'd like
for it to have a citrus aroma, you could take

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.180
the essential oil of lemon or lime, or orange,
even (which is very nice), or lavender or

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.180
rosemary.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.440
Just something to think about.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.960
With the essential oils it only takes about
10 to 20 drops.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.690
It just depends on how strong you'd like for
it to be.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.440
And now I'm adding 1 cup of vodka.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.240
You may go, "What a waste to use vodka!"

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.800
But I will say is that if you start drinking
this while you're cleaning the house, it could

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.060
be hazardous to your health and to your home.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.450
Here's where you would add the essential oils
of whatever fragrance you like.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.709
And then you just shake this up after you've
screwed this on.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:45.920
And then you can begin to spray the fabrics,
this draperies, the upholstery, the carpeting

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.209
-- whatever -- in your home.

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:50.160
