00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:08.220
Founded in 1793, Williams College is one of
the oldest colleges in the country.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.309
The school’s 450-acre campus is located
in Williamstown, Massachusetts near the Berkshire

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:13.379
Mountains.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.140
The rural setting allows for the small undergraduate
population of 2,000 students to become quite

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.580
bonded during their four years.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.730
Williams College is responsible for many firsts
in college traditions: it was the first to

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.570
create a society for alumni and the first
to wear caps and gowns at graduation.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.230
The academic programs at Williams are divided
into three sections: humanities, sciences

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.270
and social sciences.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.030
There are more than 30 majors, and students
can choose to participate in 12 other academic

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.210
areas that are not offered as majors.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.500
The courses are laid out into two semesters,
separated by a winter term in January.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.340
During this month, students can choose to
take a course for pass or fail status.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.280
Some of the past subjects have included Learn
to Play Chess, Inside Jury Deliberations and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.950
Shaping Your Life After Williams.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.460
Others decide to use the winter term to study
abroad or participate in research projects.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.799
Class sizes have remained very small at Williams;
more than 75 percent of classes have fewer

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.530
than 20 students.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.939
There are many student organizations.

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.880
Although fraternities were banned in the 1960s,
many students are still able to connect through

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.869
the various groups available on campus.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.740
The Williams Record is the longest-running
student newspaper on campus and was founded

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.130
in 1887.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.630
Students can also participate in multiple
kinds of music ensembles, choirs and a cappella

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.630
groups.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.029
The school’s teams compete in the Division
III New England Small College Athletic Conference.

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:54.450
There are also more than 14 intramural sports
teams; more than half of the students at Williams

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.490
participate in one of these leagues.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.000
There are more than 30,000 Williams alumni
who can aid students after they finish their

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.250
undergraduate experience.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.330
This dedicated group helps place students
in internships and jobs; the connection is

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.390
a valuable one.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.260
Students interested in demanding academics
combined with fun extracurricular activities

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.310
