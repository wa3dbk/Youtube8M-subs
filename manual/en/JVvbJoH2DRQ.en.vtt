00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:06.460
This part is for a vehicle to vehicle towing
kit.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.670
What this basically does is, say you have
an RV or motor home or pickup truck and youre

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.020
going to towing another vehicle on all four
wheels youre going to need this wiring harness

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.780
to make the lights on the towed vehicle work
with the towing vehicle.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.570
Well start by showing you the different components
of this kit, its really pretty simple if you

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.570
break it down.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.420
First the connection here is a traditional
four pole flat.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.610
So you have your four basic signals, your
ground, running lights, left turn and right

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.610
turn.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.960
You also have plenty of harness to attach
this on the towed vehicle.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.890
When you make your connections on the towed
vehicle itself, you have to install these

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.510
diodes here.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.120
At the point where you make your connections
on your vehicle whether it be your left or

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.290
right turn or the running light circuit you
will have to install these diodes.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.720
To give you a couple of quick notes about
these, what happens is they do go in a specific

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.570
direction in the wiring harness. to keep it
simple basically the single prong here is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.750
listed as out, that goes onto the taillight
itself out to the bulb.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.270
Then you get the two inputs here, one of the
inputs is going to be the wire you just cut

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.682
because youre going to splice this in between
the two.

00:01:17.682 --> 00:01:24.880
It does not matter which one, the wire is
going to come in one side and out the other.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.080
This other pin here is going to provide input
from your trailer harness coming from the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.060
towing vehicle itself.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.900
So for instance you would take your green
wire here and run it to the other open end

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.060
and it will go out and power your taillight
being towed down the road by the RV.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.150
As you can see theres 4 diodes and theres
a reason for that.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:54.159
Theres going to be one for the left and right
turns, and both turn signals are going to

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.950
have there accompanying running lights.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.100
So youre going to need a diode for each of
the running lights.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:07.380
Now weve opened up a small bag of parts which
contains all the spade connectors needed to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.439
do the install.

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.999
Basically what these are, you cut your wire
that you need and you splice the wire back

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:17.230
and expose about a quarter inch or so of it
and these get crimped on.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.251
Be sure you have the right tool to do that
with because it makes all the difference in

00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:23.050
the world with a tight connection and loose
connection.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.669
Once you do that, it just slides onto the
diode prong itself.

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:34.469
You may also want to invest in some dielectric
grease that will protect it and keep things

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:41.639
out that would cause corrosion which would
eventually cause an open circuit.

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:46.249
As one final note you may want to take into
account, if your towed vehicle has the same

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:50.169
turn signal and brake light bulb, this kit
is for you.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:55.099
If you have separate stop lights and turn
signals, say for example your turn signals

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.909
are amber that means theres going to be a
different box to achieve that so you have

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:05.459
your separate turn signals and stop lights
still the same.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.949
That covers part # 38955.
