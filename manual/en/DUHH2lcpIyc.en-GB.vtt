Time for another random Morning Make Up video

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.519
in which I do my make up and we chat.
Today is a very dark black and red to match

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:29.609
the tartan dress I was wearing.
Foundation first as usual and then I started

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.520
with some mascara.
I'm so tired.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.440
I applied a wing of black shadow to the outer
corners of my eyes.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:53.160
I haven't been sleeping well at all.
I brought the black down to the lower lash

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.640
line.
I keep having the worst nightmares and they

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:07.829
keep me up all night
Next I added a bright red over the black and

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.620
brought it in to cover the middle of the lid.
It's so frustrating because I can't work out

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.280
what's causing them!
Do you guys have nightmares much? It really

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:25.549
sucks.
I hurt my shoulder a while ago too which makes

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:40.130
it awkward to sleep on so maybe that's what's
waking me up too.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.500
I filled in the rest of the lid in using a
peach shade.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.820
Being tired all the time makes me very grumpy
and snappy.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.950
After that it was time for a hell of a lot
of blending.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:14.319
James has nightmares too sometimes but his
are about taking tests at school!

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.080
Next was a little highlighter which also softened
the edges a bit.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.310
My nightmares tend to be completely ridiculous
situations.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.810
I applied black pencil liner to the bottom
waterline.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.710
They are usually funny when I wake up but
scary while I'm still asleep!

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.750
Then I applied a thick winged line of liquid
liner to the top.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.069
I brought it down to the lower lash line a
little too.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:53.370
Any tops for getting rid of nightmares? I
could really use some.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:03.560
Then I repeated it on the other side.
I can't live on this little sleep!

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:14.409
Then I added some false lashes.
Or maybe I'll just start drinking lots and

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:26.640
lots of coffee and never sleep! I'll be vibrating
off the walls.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.209
This is such a bold look that I just used
a little nude lipstick and gloss on top.

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:39.870
If face in this video, I kind of look like
I'm falling asleep a bit now.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.150
All done! I look pretty tired because I haven't
been sleeping well but it's a really pretty

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.680
look and I'd like to try it again when my
eyes are a bit less puffy.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.250
I hope this was a useful video, please check
out the blog post linked in the description

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.489
for more information and tutorials.
Thanks so much for watching!

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:58.279
Night night!
