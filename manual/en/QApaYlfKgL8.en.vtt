00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.710
Architecture is about questioning.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.820
It's about understanding
how we solve problems and how we relate ourselves

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.110
to the future.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.310
It's helping a student find
their

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.970
future role for themselves in the world.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.710
Many of the faculty are working professionals,
and they're engaged in these problems that

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.120
students will be
addressing in the studio.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.390
And this provides us a greater opportunity
to deliver content to the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.070
students in a
more

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.900
cohesive, comprehensive way;
and also to integrate that content into the

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.690
studio
courses that the students will be simultaneously

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.550
taking
with their lecture material.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.739
Our architecture program is consisted of
consecutive studio courses.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.050
So basically it's a very design oriented program.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.370
Starting from first year, you really get the
basic techniques of the line of work; how

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.340
to draw, how to shade, how to shadow how to
delineate.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.920
And you go on to second year where you start
developing your concepts, and third year where

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.020
you really start to look at building
systems and how long span structures work.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.650
And applying all that fouth year,
it's really a comprehensive year and you combined

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.110
all that together to create
outdoor urban environments.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.440
Every student is assigned their own design
studio space,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.740
they have access to that space twenty four
seven.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.160
Over here and I have a lot of my tool chest
where I keep

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.560
kind of like my wood, my glue.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.330
This is kind of a work desk where I put together
models

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.880
and over here is really where I’d put together
all my projects, cutting mat

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.959
always on the computer.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.970
Computer is
incredibly essential to what we're working

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.070
on.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.780
So they're able to come in and pursue their
work,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.000
their ideas round-the-clock, whenever it's
most convenient for them.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.920
It's just a lot of freedom to be able to experiment,
and do what you want to do.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.700
This school has strong emphases
on sustainability.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.910
Especially in today's
environment, I think

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.090
how they operate as sustainable citizens,
considering all the environmental implications

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.610
that architecture brings to
the environment.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.530
We need teach our students to manifest sustainability
in

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.170
every aspect of their designs.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.810
And to work with students to solve those kinds
of problems, and to find

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.950
their role and their place
in that society that addresses those things,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.510
is to me one of the most creative things you
could do.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.040
The immeasurable point
is the point that arouses

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.590
everybody’s
feelings.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.600
This is a major improvement.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.810
I think that one of the most important things
that NewSchool offers a student

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.990
is the notion of professionalism.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.870
We're focused on
helping them enter the profession.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.520
I really feel like if I were
to be given a commission,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.240
I feel like I have the knowledge,
and the experience to really begin working

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.620
on the
programmatic functions of the building, the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.790
concepts of the building.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.730
I have the confidence that I need to
to begin working

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.260
these kind of firms, and on those kind of
projects.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.180
Architecture is not just about
building buildings,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.230
it's about a broader mission.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.530
It really is about strategizing how we plan
our lives in the future,

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.790
and to me that's really exciting.
