00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.800
(T): I'm Tirta Pane

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.820
(I): I'm Ita Purnamasari

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.700
(I&amp;T): Back again with us on, Masak.Tv!

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.695
(T): In this webisode, I'm accompanied by Ita

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:24.975
(I): Hello, my name is Ita, Ita Purnamasari,
and I am from Lintas.me

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:27.635
(T): So we are going to teach you on how 
to make Soto Betawi (Betawi's coconut milk stew)

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.300
Soto Betawi was invented in 1977.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.020
Long before that, in Batavia (Jakarta) people only known of Soto Tangkar

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.360
Which is also known as Soto Iga
(Ribs Stew)

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:44.777
So I got the broth here, which consists
of meat, lungs and tripe

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.080
I have boiled them beforehand, 
only with garlic and ginger

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:57.400
For the dry ingredients, I have cloves,
cinnamon, nutmeg, star anise, bay leaves,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.940
Kaffir lime leaves, spring onion, tomato, celery,
and also fried potato

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.780
And also for the soup, I have 
coconut milk and regular milk

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.140
Ok, let's start cooking

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.600
I need Ita to help me stir frying

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.120
Add cooking oil,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.180
We can lower the heat

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.560
The water is about 2 and a half litres

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:37.311
For the seasoning, I use 11 cloves of shallots, 5 cloves of garlics, 3 candlenut, 3 red chillies,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.800
I've got rid of the seed. And also 
half a tomato, no seed

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.800
And then ginger and galangal, 
1 cm each

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.620
So we sautÃ© all of them

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.560
We'll add the dry seasonings later

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.210
(I): How long do we cook this?

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.840
(T): Until they are well cooked. 
It'll taste weird not be as good

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.520
(I): Oh I see

00:01:55.673 --> 00:02:01.793
(T): So next I will put in 5 cloves, 
and then half of a nutmeg

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.640
1 star anise, and 1 cinnamon, cut into half

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.240
1 lemongrass, 2 bay leaves, and 1 kaffir 
lime leaf

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.200
Okay

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.060
Now it's starting to cook,
I'm going to add turmeric about half a spoon

00:02:32.244 --> 00:02:36.544
Now we can turn off the heat, and
we can put the seasoning into the broth.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.720
I keep the stove on, on a lower heat. Now we raise the heat

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.599
To make sure the meat absorbing the seasonings, we should wait for 10-15 minutes

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.599
After that we can put it aside and 
do the finishing touches,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.780
which is adding the seasoning and the coconut milk

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.080
Now we should fry the meat

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.820
There are lung, tripe,
and beef shank

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.700
(I): What is beef shank?

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.220
(T): It's the calf part of cow

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.020
(I): Oh I see, it's cow calf

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.340
We can add the seasoning to the broth

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.160
Make sure the heat is low to prevent
the coconut milk from breaking apart

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.080
Add one cup, about 125ml

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.980
(I): So we add in gradually?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.500
(T): Yes

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.940
I also use 1 cup of milk

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.640
So it will be delicious

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.660
For the coconut milk, I use half a cup,
about 125ml

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.220
While the milk is 250ml

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.800
I haven't add the last seasonings, so I'll add salt now

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.100
A little bit of pepper,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.680
And then sugar

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.340
We don't have to put too much sugar,
because it usually served with

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.600
sweet soy sauce

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.560
Fry the meat

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.320
The calf,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.040
Lung,

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.660
And also tripe.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.120
It doesn't need to be crispy,
just fry them until they have a charred

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.820
Lower the heat

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.720
When we fry the innards the oil usually fight back

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.140
(Crew): Just like relationships?

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.000
(T): Yes

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.120
(Crew): Turns out, the most visited segment in 
Lintas.me is about relationship.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.780
(T): Oh is that so?

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:45.340
(I): Yes, in Lintas.me, we have  Channel Woman, ladies.co which is specialised for women.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.780
There you can find articles about
relationship, fashion, beauty, and also recipes

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.560
But the relationship segment gets the
most visited

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.880
(T): So in Lintas.me, there are many categories?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.760
(I): Of course

00:04:57.883 --> 00:05:02.013
(T): And you handle the female-related
articles?

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.740
(I): Yes

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.380
(T): Now it's finished, and we can turn off
the heat

00:05:05.383 --> 00:05:06.243
(Crew): Oh so it doens't take a long time?

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.160
(T): Yes, just for a while

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.240
Now we just cut them into pieces

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.540
We'll use half of the meat

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.540
(I): Isn't it still hot?

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.480
(T): Yes it is

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.880
And then the lung

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.940
And the tripe

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.400
Then we can put in the fried potato

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.900
Then, tomato

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.720
Green onions,

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.640
(I): It's very special

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.700
(T): We are just using the leaves of the celery

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.720
Then we can pour the soup

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.540
I also have some fried shallots, then add
some emping (melinjo chips)

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.320
And also squeeze some kaffir lime juice

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.260
Now you should try some first

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.560
To prove that this is real, not fake

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.900
Just scramble it, it's okay

00:06:09.907 --> 00:06:11.347
(I): I want to try the soup

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.050
Hmm Yummy!
