00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.520
Ships are weird.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.890
At sufficiently large sizes, they can act
like self-contained little cities, floating

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.030
around in the open seas.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.980
Well, if a ship can be city, then The Ship
is its Grand Theft Auto.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.390
And, rather, its Quake.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.050
And a little splash of Nine Hours Nine Persons
Nine Doors but that was on a boat already.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.550
But rather than full-scale slaughter and violence,
you're playing a much more subtle game of

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.390
subterfuge, disguise, and following your quarry
into the bathroom where you can dispatch them

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:59.280
far from the prying eyes of guards, cameras,
and your fellow passengers.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.040
The devious Mr. X (REALLY ORIGINAL) has taken
control of this vessel, and is pitting everyone

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.950
onboard (save for staff, for whatever reason)
against each other in a cloak-and-dagger murder

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.250
mystery, where you don't know your killer
but they know you.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.910
In multiplayer, it's a big server-wide chain
of stab-or-be-bludgeoned, while in the single-player

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.590
mode there's a more coherent story to follow
that takes you through plenty of the game's

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.080
wrinkles, like disguise and making sure no
one's watching.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.230
Unfortunately, though, this single-player
feels more like an afterthought, despite a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:39.030
quality vocal performance.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.130
The real marvel of The Ship, though, is the
level of depth it adds to everything you do.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.679
Unlike most crime games where your mission
is first and foremost... here, you're a human

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.759
being, dammit, and you have needs.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.500
Needs like food and drink, and bathroom use,
and entertainment.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.260
So in between knifing foes and pulling clandestine
shenanigans, you've gotta find time to settle

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.509
your base urges by pounding down energy drinks,
chocolate bars, perhaps raiding the fridge

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.150
in the kitchen and making off with a sandwich,
and squeezing in a quick rack of nine-ball

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.700
just to keep the fingers limber... before,
y'know, bludgeoning someone to death with

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.209
the pool cue.

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.430
Or a wrench.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.770
Or taking a katana to them all Kill Bill Vol.
1 style, or channelling your inner Maxwell

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.890
Edison and giving them the hammer, or blasting
them with a flare gun.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.080
And here's where it gets janky.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.439
While there's a heck of a lot to interact
with onboard The Ship, some elements just

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.350
don't work as well as you'd expect them to.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.620
Ping someone with a flare gun and their model
goes all screwy, in a kind of delightful appreciation

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.560
of gaming bugs.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.010
So it might not be completely solid... but
man, what is here is really freakin' fun.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.459
All the way down to the musak that flows from
every speaker, changing with each segment

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.851
of the ship you enter, giving way to natural
sounds of the waves... only for you to get

00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:59.720
caught brandishing a deadly weapon, thrown
in the slammer and forced to pay a fine and

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.990
wait around for a while.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.329
(Significantly more of a barrier in multiplayer,
it would seem, as it's time you could be spending

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.909
hunting down your foes.)

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:13.970
Hell, I think there's some old-timey bit with
Harry Morgan playing in the security office.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.319
Col. Potter, you are an inspiration.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.840
The Ship might not be the best first-person
experience you've ever had, but its sheer

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.160
level of detail serves to make it absolutely
immersive.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.109
Besides, you never know when you're gonna
be accosted by some dude with a crowbar who

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.590
thinks your number's up.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.959
Especially when you're just trying to take
a dump and DAMN if some schmoe with a piece

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:47.849
of hardware is getting between you and that
porcelain convenience.
