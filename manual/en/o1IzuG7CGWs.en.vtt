Is that all it says?

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:26.683

00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:35.744

the riding on a pig baby monkey song.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:40.414
No, I think Mikey just thought you would think
it was really fun.

00:00:40.414 --> 00:00:41.994
Well it is fun.

00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:44.374
But, yeah.

00:00:44.374 --> 00:00:45.564
It is fun.

00:00:45.564 --> 00:01:00.623
I'm not going to play it right now, I'll be
playing that song all night in my brain.

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:04.823
Just try to get to the flying witches.

00:01:04.823 --> 00:01:10.324
Yeah, whatever, you just want that song stuck
in my head.

00:01:10.324 --> 00:01:13.784
Turn it on mute then.

00:01:13.784 --> 00:01:15.064
I don't know how to mute it.

00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:16.064
Flying witches, for reals?

00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:17.064
Are you lying to me?

00:01:17.064 --> 00:01:18.064
I'm not lying.

00:01:18.064 --> 00:01:19.064
Okay, um, how do you mute this honey?

00:01:19.064 --> 00:01:20.064
You turn the volume down.

00:01:20.064 --> 00:01:21.064
I don't know where the volume is.

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:22.064
Its on the side.

00:01:22.064 --> 00:01:24.024
Okay, Quit laughing at me.

00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:26.543
You're all laughing at me.

00:01:26.543 --> 00:01:29.574
Oh, Wait, JUMP, get your banana.

00:01:29.574 --> 00:01:32.484
Oh my gosh, stuff is getting in my way.

00:01:32.484 --> 00:01:38.084
How do you get away from the, UGHMM
Oh my gosh, theres more stuff he runs into.

00:01:38.084 --> 00:01:39.084
Huh.

00:01:39.084 --> 00:01:44.254
I don't think i'm ever going to get to the
flying witches.

00:01:44.254 --> 00:01:47.014
Are you serious, is there really witches?

00:01:47.014 --> 00:01:50.933
Oh, I forgot to jump my pig.

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:54.654
So busy jumping my monkey, I forgot to jump
the pig.

00:01:54.654 --> 00:01:58.354
Oh, he fell in the pit, DANG IT.

00:01:58.354 --> 00:02:00.814
Okay, i'm done, i'm turning it off.

00:02:00.814 --> 00:02:02.344
It is so complicated.

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:04.913
Thats why I don't play those
games of adventure.

00:02:04.913 --> 00:02:21.094
Because I can never remember how to do things,
and then I get stuck and frustrated.
