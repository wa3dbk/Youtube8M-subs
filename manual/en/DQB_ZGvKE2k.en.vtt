00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:10.830
Hey, this is Mike1013 for Flop Turn River.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.639
What I want to discuss today is defending
your big blind.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.880
For some reason, whenever I've seen anything
or read any strategy about defending your

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.520
big blind, the great majority of the time
it's about defending your blind against a

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.539
butt-in or a cutoff steal.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:38.510
Actually, I think defending against an open
by the small blind is a really favorable situation

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.120
and is one which is often ignored.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.440
If you just think about it for a little bit,
when the small blind opens ... let's say he

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:55.960
opens to a standard 3x raise ... you're getting
two to one odds to call.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.360
You're going to have position for the remainder
of the hand, which is very different from

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.280
when the butt-in or the cutoff opens where
you're going to be out of position for the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.180
whole hand.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.200
When you're getting two to one odds that means
you only need 33 percent equity to break even

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.170
if you're going to call.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.500
What I did was, in order to get kind of a
basic starting point for what kind of ranges

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.500
we should be looking to defend, I made up
an opening range for the small blind when

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.070
it folds to him.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.070
I decided we're just going to give him a 35
percent range, kind of a reasonable range.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.370
Here, we can see that range there that I made
up for the small blind.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:55.860
It's basically broadways any ace, any pair,
and a few suited connectors.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.890
Once I had that 35 percent range, I decided
to see which hands had the 33 percent equity

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.030
we need against that range when we're getting
two to one odds.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.000
The answer is amazing.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.940
That's the range there that I got.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.450
As you can see, it's a 79 percent range that
has enough equity to continue against the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.550
35 percent range.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.620
It's basically anything suited except seven-deuce
suited and pretty much anything offsuit, except

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.069
the very worst offsuit cards.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.560
That's what you have enough equity to continue
with, which is a lot.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.030
In reality, you probably don't want to be
defending something like King-deuce offsuit

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.520
or ten-six off despite their having enough
hot and cold equity for you to make the call

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.700
simply because the post flop playability is
not very good.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.010
You might not want to be defending quite as
high as 80 percent of the time, but certainly

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.780
you should be defending your big blind against
the small blind open well over half the time.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.270
Let's take a look at some example hands now.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.910
Let me explain the stats that I have up here.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:21.349
First line: VPIP/PFR/three-bet percent, second
line: c-bet, full to c-bet, and aggression

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.819
percent.

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.930
Our first hand here, the small blind opens
into us and we have ace-four offsuit.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.940
If you look at his sizing, that's not even
3x.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.290
It's a big mistake to fold any ace here unless
you know your opponent is the nittiest guy

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.540
in the world.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.520
This is a super standard call.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.849
Next hand, we have Jack-ten off and we're
facing a min open.

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.810
We're certainly getting the odds we need to
call here, actually with almost any two cards

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.920
getting three to one.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.390
Our hand's going to play very well post-flop,
especially if you look at our opponent's tendencies.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.570
His c-bets percent is only 37 percent, so
he's going to be checking the flop to us a

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.849
lot and we can either check behind or we can
bet and take it down on a lot of flops here.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.579
Next hand, King-ten offsuit; this is what
they call a trouble hand, the hand that gets

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.940
you into a lot of trouble.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.830
You should not play it facing a raise.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:30.030
In this unusually beneficial situation, you
absolutely have to play it facing a raise.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:37.139
It's plenty good enough getting two to one
and facing a fishy player to call here.

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.039
You keep yourself out of trouble by not making
dumb decisions post-flop.

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:48.020
If he pot, pot, pots it and you have third
pair don't feel obligated to call.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.210
You're getting such a good price here that
you don't need to feel at all like you have

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.020
to go to showdown every single time.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.490
Just play smart when you make second pair,
top pair, get a little bit of value; otherwise,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.490
fold.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:13.159
Next hand, six-four offsuit; this one is very
weak.

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:16.129
I think this is a hand you can fold.

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.509
Look at our opponent's c-betting percent.

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:23.050
He's going to just keep firing into us on
the flop.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.889
Unless we have some really good read about
what his tendencies are, I think we can let

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.009
this one go.

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.020
That wraps it up.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.680
I hope you guys have learned something here
and especially don't give up your big blind

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.710
when the small blind opens.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.020
You have position, you're closing the action,
you're getting great odds.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.289
This is a very favorable situation and you
should certain take advantage of it.

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.779
Take care guys.
