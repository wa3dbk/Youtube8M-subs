00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.880
but what was remarkable about the stadium was it actually changed the way 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.619
football was played in America

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.290
because in the early nineteen hundred's it was a brutal and violent game

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.790
and President roosevelt who was actually a harvard
grad and had watched a lot of the games here

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.370
wanted to get the game safer
and

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.720
the two options were widen the field or authorize the forward pass

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.830
and at that time Harvard had just built the stadium
and you couldn't literally

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.530
go

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.760
east or west on it

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.980
so they authorised the forward pass and 
the joke was that it took Harvard another forty years

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.220
to actually use it

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.620
because it only seats thirty thousand there are not
many bad seats there

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.570
so the first time I got inside was probably
nineteen sixty two

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.990
and what was amazing then for many many games was
it was either at least twenty to twenty five

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.640
thousand or 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.760
for the most part it was full

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.630
I think one of the things that

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.930
the people like about it is there's an intimacy to it

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.690
that you don't find for example at Yale

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.740
which which is

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.950
much more probably sixty eight thousand

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.740
and of course back then the Dartmouth game was always here

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.960
so

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.960
it was just a great way to spend a Saturday

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.380
John powers class of nineteen seventy
