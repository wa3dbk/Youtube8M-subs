00:00:00.735 --> 00:00:02.419
- Hi, we're Rainy Day Dreamers.

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:03.893
- And have you ever wanted
to tell someone a secret

00:00:03.893 --> 00:00:06.134
so badly, but you're
afraid they'll blab it

00:00:06.134 --> 00:00:07.051
all over the place?

00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:09.141
Well, Monster High has you covered

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:11.196
with their Secret Creeper Pets.

00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:12.613
You can tell them the secret,

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:15.063
and they'll never tell a soul.

00:00:15.063 --> 00:00:18.940
- [Voiceover] Rainy Day Dreamers.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.761
Rainy Day Dreamers.

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:24.338
This Monster High Secret Creepers Pet

00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:26.021
is Sir Hoots A Lot.

00:00:26.021 --> 00:00:27.681
In case you couldn't tell, it's an owl.

00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:30.840
We picked it up over at
Wal-Mart for about 12 dollars.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.405
Looks interesting, you can
tell your secrets to it,

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:36.144
and it will keep them
and only repeat them back

00:00:36.144 --> 00:00:38.303
under certain circumstances.

00:00:38.303 --> 00:00:40.823
Or you can get two of
these Secret Creeper Pets

00:00:40.823 --> 00:00:43.145
and let them share their secrets.

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:44.771
Let's see what's in the box.

00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:47.987
(package tearing)

00:00:47.987 --> 00:00:49.625
OK, those--

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:50.087
- Sorry!

00:00:50.087 --> 00:00:53.409
- A leash that turns into a bracelet.

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.157
And I think this is key
in keeping the secrets.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:00.387
(package tearing)

00:01:00.387 --> 00:01:02.371
- Oh, that's funny, it works both ways.

00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:05.203
You were like, this is key
in keeping the secrets,

00:01:05.203 --> 00:01:07.770
as in, it's important, and it's a key.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.500
- There you go.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.746
- That's smart. (package tearing)

00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:12.529
- Instruction manual.

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:13.469
- OK.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:14.352
- Importante.

00:01:14.352 --> 00:01:17.730
- And I got a bird with
the brains showing.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.631
(package crinkling)

00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:21.526
I can't get his skull to
close. (package crinkling)

00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:22.768
I don't wanna pop his brain out.

00:01:22.768 --> 00:01:25.416
- I think you do that afterwards.

00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:27.702
- Catch him then.

00:01:27.702 --> 00:01:29.930
- Oooh.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.737
This makes me feel just like
that Doctor Who episode,

00:01:32.737 --> 00:01:34.229
where they go into the future.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:34.818
- Yep.

00:01:34.818 --> 00:01:37.304
- And there's a weird worm on the ceiling,

00:01:37.304 --> 00:01:40.171
and then it's like (snaps fingers),

00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:41.762
whenever I snap their fingers,

00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:43.106
and the little thingy
(indistinct) through the brain.

00:01:43.106 --> 00:01:44.240
- Ohh.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.619
- This totally reminds me of that.

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.897
- Oh, yes. Where they had
the little satellite dish.

00:01:50.897 --> 00:01:52.733
- Yeah. No.

00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:54.743
- Kinda like.
- Kinda.

00:01:54.743 --> 00:01:56.634
- Oh, there's a dog, there's an owl,

00:01:56.634 --> 00:01:59.350
and there's, what in the world? (laughs)

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.859
Half-horse, half-sheep.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:01.798
Well, it is Monster High,

00:02:01.798 --> 00:02:03.878
so I guess you got interesting creations.

00:02:03.878 --> 00:02:06.257
Leash must stay on pet's body at all times

00:02:06.257 --> 00:02:09.451
in order to record, play
back, and transfer message.

00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:12.875
Keep leash in the hole on back.

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:14.454
Keep leash in the hole.

00:02:14.454 --> 00:02:15.879
- There's a thingy right here.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.330
- I think they key is what
goes in to activate it.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.982
- Oh, that works, too.
(owl hoots)

00:02:22.982 --> 00:02:25.989
- Owl sounds, hey, cool.
I'm gonna pull that out.

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:26.911
- I like it.

00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:29.291
- It's less painful. (both laugh)

00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:32.238
(owl hoots)

00:02:32.238 --> 00:02:33.772
- I love owls.

00:02:33.772 --> 00:02:34.295
- So that's the leash--

00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:35.011
- So much.

00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:37.058
- For the pet.

00:02:37.058 --> 00:02:39.055
There's the brain.

00:02:39.055 --> 00:02:41.155
Here is Sir Hoots A Lot.

00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:44.755
You can see that the leash,
the key part of the leash

00:02:44.755 --> 00:02:48.248
right there plugs into the
hole on the back of the neck.

00:02:48.248 --> 00:02:50.686
(owl hoots)

00:02:50.686 --> 00:02:52.440
And the brain at least, top of the head,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.378
lights up when that happens.

00:02:54.378 --> 00:02:58.476
And you can see the brain right here,

00:02:58.476 --> 00:03:00.845
It's a little unsettling.

00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:04.363
And I think pressing the brain
causes it to start recording

00:03:04.363 --> 00:03:06.058
and things like that. (pats head)

00:03:06.058 --> 00:03:07.219
Roxanna's reading the instructions.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.344
And here at the bottom,
there's an electrical contact.

00:03:09.344 --> 00:03:12.303
I think you use this when you
put two of the pets together

00:03:12.303 --> 00:03:14.998
and they transfer their
secrets to one another.

00:03:14.998 --> 00:03:16.960
Alright, Roxanna, you
read the instructions.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.447
How does, (taps toy on table, laughs)

00:03:18.447 --> 00:03:21.029
- Ahh! (laughs)
- How does this work?

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:22.939
- That sweet owl's gonna snap
my fingers and see if it work.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:23.925
- Uh-huh.

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:26.478
- So, first of all, you go
and you put the key in--

00:03:26.478 --> 00:03:27.175
- Yes.

00:03:27.175 --> 00:03:28.696
- That's what you use to make it interact

00:03:28.696 --> 00:03:29.939
if you can change things.

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:30.461
- OK.

00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:32.226
- And then you flip open the brain.

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:34.175
- Alrighty.

00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:36.417
- And then you go, I don't touch it.

00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:38.862
If you go and you push
it down, hold it down,

00:03:38.862 --> 00:03:41.455
and then go and tell your
secret, and then let it go.

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:44.880
And then go, and like,
click it or something.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.726
It's like...

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:47.597
- Uh-huh.

00:03:47.597 --> 00:03:48.838
- To go and listen to it.

00:03:48.838 --> 00:03:49.397
- OK.

00:03:49.397 --> 00:03:50.661
- In the voice. And then--

00:03:50.661 --> 00:03:52.437
- Press and hold to record.

00:03:52.437 --> 00:03:55.374
Press and release quickly
to play back the secret,

00:03:55.374 --> 00:03:56.779
to make sure it's correct, OK.

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:59.462
- Yes. And then go and take out the key

00:03:59.462 --> 00:04:01.653
to go and hear it in, like,
a funny voice or something.

00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:03.397
I don't remember, something like that.

00:04:03.397 --> 00:04:05.835
- You wanna do a secret, or me?

00:04:05.835 --> 00:04:06.961
- I have too many, you go ahead.

00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:08.877
- OK.

00:04:08.877 --> 00:04:11.952
Gotta be a secret.

00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:15.296
I like jalapenos.

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:19.171
OK. (laughs) Let's see what
happens. (pushes button)

00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:21.182
- I like jalapenos.

00:04:21.182 --> 00:04:22.796
(both laugh)

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:23.737
- Is that my voice?

00:04:23.737 --> 00:04:24.259
- Yeah.

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.453
- I kinda thought the owl
was gonna listen to me,

00:04:26.453 --> 00:04:28.160
and then when I said to play
it back, he was going to say,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.843
"He likes jalapenos."

00:04:29.843 --> 00:04:30.621
(Roxanna laughs)

00:04:30.621 --> 00:04:31.655
That'd be funny, if he had changed it.

00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:33.140
OK, so, my secret is--

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.334
(owl hoots, both laugh)

00:04:35.334 --> 00:04:37.843
My secret is in the owl's brain.

00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:38.853
Go to sleep.

00:04:38.853 --> 00:04:42.462
Now, I pull out the key.
The secret is stored here.

00:04:42.462 --> 00:04:44.913
So, Roxanna really
wants to know my secret.

00:04:44.913 --> 00:04:47.258
She comes and steals Sir Hoots A Lot,

00:04:47.258 --> 00:04:50.101
tries to hear the secret.

00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:52.053
- Are they (indistinct), I dunno.

00:04:52.053 --> 00:04:55.036
(owl hoots)

00:04:55.036 --> 00:04:56.012
This is what I get.

00:04:56.012 --> 00:04:57.381
(owl hoots)

00:04:57.381 --> 00:04:59.296
Because no one can hear your secret.

00:04:59.296 --> 00:05:03.475
- Right, so my secret is
safely stored here in the owl.

00:05:03.475 --> 00:05:06.356
And if I had a smaller wrist,
I think I can wear this

00:05:06.356 --> 00:05:08.389
as a bracelet or something.

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.954
Anyway, you hide this away

00:05:09.954 --> 00:05:14.134
and then, somebody you
want to know your secret,

00:05:14.134 --> 00:05:17.001
you trust them, alright,
you can know my secret.

00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:21.411
(owl hoots) Stick a thing in
an owl's neck. (Roxanna laughs)

00:05:21.411 --> 00:05:24.406
Go ahead. (pushes button)

00:05:24.406 --> 00:05:28.563
- I like jalapenos. (both laugh)

00:05:28.563 --> 00:05:29.806
- OK.

00:05:29.806 --> 00:05:30.363
- That's funny.

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:32.313
- What I don't know, was
that really my voice?

00:05:32.313 --> 00:05:34.090
We gotta do one in a
regular voice and see.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.707
- Yeah.

00:05:34.707 --> 00:05:36.307
- OK, now I assume you
can change your secret

00:05:36.307 --> 00:05:38.292
over time by just
holding and re-recording,

00:05:38.292 --> 00:05:41.112
so let's do one in a normal
voice. (pushes button)

00:05:41.112 --> 00:05:45.190
I like jalapenos.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.905
(pushes button)

00:05:46.905 --> 00:05:49.506
- I like jalapenos. (both laugh)

00:05:49.506 --> 00:05:51.712
- Yeah, so they speed
your voice up and give you

00:05:51.712 --> 00:05:53.393
a little chipmunk sound.

00:05:53.393 --> 00:05:55.253
Let's have you record,
just record anything

00:05:55.253 --> 00:05:58.087
so we can hear what your
voice sounds like, you ready?

00:05:58.087 --> 00:06:01.324
- I like sea turtles.

00:06:01.324 --> 00:06:03.228
- OK.

00:06:03.228 --> 00:06:04.694
(pushes button)

00:06:04.694 --> 00:06:06.874
- I like sea turtles. (toy clicks)

00:06:06.874 --> 00:06:08.151
- That sounds almost just like me anyways.

00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:10.483
- It does sound just
like her. (both laugh)

00:06:10.483 --> 00:06:12.467
It sounds like you, like five years ago

00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:15.123
with a little kid voice,
that's the only difference.

00:06:15.123 --> 00:06:17.086
But it does modify your
voice a little bit.

00:06:17.086 --> 00:06:20.105
So, (toy clicks) she doesn't
want anyone to know about that,

00:06:20.105 --> 00:06:22.299
she keeps the key with her,

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:25.421
but Ximena sneaks in and
grabs Sir Hoots A Lot,

00:06:25.421 --> 00:06:28.325
and says, "Ha-ha, I will
know Roxanna's secrets."

00:06:28.325 --> 00:06:30.611
(pushes button, owl hoots)

00:06:30.611 --> 00:06:33.606
So that's the Monster
High Secret Creepers Pets,

00:06:33.606 --> 00:06:34.661
Sir Hoots A Lot.

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:35.847
What do you think of this?

00:06:35.847 --> 00:06:37.403
- I think it's pretty cool.

00:06:37.403 --> 00:06:39.550
- If you have that issue
with wanting to tell a secret

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.395
to someone, you don't
have anyone you can trust,

00:06:41.395 --> 00:06:43.354
you can trust your owl.

00:06:43.354 --> 00:06:45.464
You could do something else
cute with this, I would think.

00:06:45.464 --> 00:06:48.447
If you needed to leave a
message for your sister,

00:06:48.447 --> 00:06:50.502
your mother, or something,
you can record it,

00:06:50.502 --> 00:06:52.545
leave it out on the
counter, when they come home

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:54.902
they can press the button,
listen to the message.

00:06:54.902 --> 00:06:56.237
It's cute, OK.

00:06:56.237 --> 00:06:58.060
We'll be back tomorrow
with, I think it's time

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.836
for another Shopkins video.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.160
- Yeah.
- Oh, yes.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.948
Let's see how we're doing
on our Shopkins challenge.

00:07:02.948 --> 00:07:05.571
And then on Sunday,
it's Sweet Tooth Sunday.
