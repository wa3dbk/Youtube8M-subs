00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:10.610
I come from the North- East of Italy, where
there aren't many big cities around.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.520
My dad used to take me to the woods in the mountain
quite often. So I've always seen

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:28.020
trees and nature and I've always thought that was normality. And then obviously I came to London,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.940
and it's an extremely green city, it's just so different.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:46.910
When you choose to get a career in horticulture,
You do know that you won't earn a lot of money

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.139
but you do know that you will do what you
do because you love it.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.829
My connection with cacti is quite strange
because where I come from there are obviously

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:10.709
not cacti. I'm not sure exactly what it is,
the first time I saw them, I started to really

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:18.620
like them, I guess because they are somehow
quite human, I don't know.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:27.900
And also the fact they're usually kind of green and maybe not  necessarily beautiful.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.580
When they flower they're just completely different and it's a bit like  some people.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.740
You don't get to really like them until you properly meet them.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.060
This one has got hair as well. They look like
grandpas.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:59.540
So that little water lily there is a Nymphaea
thermarum. It comes from Rwanda but unfortunately

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.159
it's extinct in the wild.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.060
Having a good relationship with nature is
important because everything starts from nature,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:27.460
everything we've got thanks to nature. And
making sure that you understand that and you

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.950
are kind of thankful to nature for what you've
got. I think it's really important and everybody

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:46.350
in my opinion should worship nature and be  proud to live in this world and respect nature

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.530
mainly.
