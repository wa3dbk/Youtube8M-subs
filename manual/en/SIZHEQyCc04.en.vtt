How do you keep your pets safe from the summer
sun?

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.529
We've got a handful of helpful tips - and
cute pictures to go along with them.

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:07.529
It's win-win!

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:17.300
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and it is
officially summer now, which means barbecues,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.460
beaches, and yes - that dreaded summer heat.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.569
Most of us already know how to protect ourselves,
but what about our helpless little furry friends?

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:28.439
They need protection just as much as we do
- so here are some tips to help your pet beat

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.439
the heat.

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.710
First order of business - Never ever EVER
leave your pets in a parked car.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.710
Ever.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.360
On an 85 degree day, even with the windows
cracked - the temperature inside of a car

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.610
will reach 102 degrees F within 10 minutes.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.010
After 30 minutes, 120 degrees F. That kind
of heat can cause irreversible organ damage,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.010
or death.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.010
So don't risk it.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.440
You may also be inclined to think humidity
will keep your pet cool - when in fact, the

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.010
opposite is true!

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.100
Animals pant in order to evaporate moisture
from their lungs, which cools them down.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.500
But if the humidity is too high, they can't
do that - so their body temperature will skyrocket

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.560
- quickly.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.229
Limit their exercise, and watch out for sunburns.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.200
Believe it or not, animals are just as vulnerable
to UV rays as humans are.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.990
And that is especially true for pets with
white fur, since the lack of skin pigmentation

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.829
makes them extremely sensitive to the sun.

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.240
The shorter their hair is, the more susceptible
they are to being burned.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.680
So places on their body with the least amount
of fur - like around the face, or the underbelly,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.950
are where they're most likely to get sunburned.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.100
Some pets also have pre-existing conditions
that can increase their skin sensitivity.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.179
So things like parasitic infections, autoimmune
disorders, or congenital hairlessness - should

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.969
all be taken into account.

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.530
Hairless pets are of course the most sensitive
- so if you have one, and you know they're

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.590
gonna be out all day - try using either a
waterproof sunscreen with an SPF of at least

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.299
30, or a sunblock that contains zinc oxide.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.109
You could also try pet clothing, like a t-shirt
or a hat, which in addition to being adorable

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.359
- will also block some of the sun's rays.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:01.700
Although dark-colored clothing will get very
hot, so keep that in mind.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.689
Also important to remember - that the ground
gets extremely hot in the summer.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.690
So if YOU wouldn't go walking around barefoot
on the concrete, then your pet probably shouldn't

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.690
either.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.900
Keep em on the grass, and make sure they have
a shady place to lie down.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.470
Doghouses actually get hotter inside with
the sun, so it's better to find a tree or

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.800
some place with airflow - and of course, make
sure they have plenty of water.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.810
The sun is at its hottest between 11a-2p,
so the best thing you can do is minimize their

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.720
outdoor activity during those times.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.330
Fans don't work as well on pets as they do
on humans either - so really, it's better

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.550
to just keep them inside.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.510
If there's a chance your pet may ALREADY be
sunburned, check its skin.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.790
If it's red, warm, or flaking - take them
out of the sun immediately, and apply a cool

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.400
compress with ointments.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.130
If it's a severe sunburn, then you may need
to take your pet to the doctor.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.740
A vet can prescribe a cortisone product to
prevent inflammation, but in extreme cases

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.010
- antibiotics may be necessary to prevent
infection.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.780
Like anything else, an ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.260
So it's best to just prevent these situations
before they happen.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.980
Frequent sunburns can give your pets pre-cancerous
conditions or even skin tumors, and once that

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.980
happens - the affected skin will have to be
surgically removed.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.140
Don't let it come to that.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.330
You wanna protect your pets, with the same
dedication you'd give yourself.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.350
As always, if you have questions, comments,
or other suggestions on how to keep your pets

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.930
cool, leave em in the comments below.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.090
Otherwise, thanks for watching - and happy
summer!
