Hey, you know if you are an AMD fan, 
and a fan of Acer,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.420
and a fan of small form factor computers,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.020
probably a good one to take a look at, you know?
It's the Acer AX3200, 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.020
and it's a smoking little machine. It's got 
a Phenom Triple Core 8650,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.030
chip on board. It does have 4 'gigs' of DDR2
RAM, and it does have Vista Home Premium 64-bit

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.100
so it's going to be able to take advantage of
all the RAM you can throw at it basically.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.270
It has 750 gigabyte hard drive. It has a DVD RW
drive, that does do Labelflash. Means you can

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.140
flip that thing over, and burn images and 
labels directly on to the DVD, 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.680
it has b, g and n wireless, built in. So you're
going to be able to get on the internet, 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.180
wirelessly, from this computer. Which is one of 
those things that throws people off a lot,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.520
when you get a desktop computer, you know
because you just kind of assume it's going to have

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.130
wireless in it, most desktops don't have wireless
built in. It's kind of a funny thing,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.660
but they don't. This one does. It does have
GeForce 8200 graphics.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.370
It is a built in graphics chipset, but it is
Hybrid SLI compatible, so if you are able to find

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.870
a card that is compatible with the GeForce
8200, in a low profile form factor,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.540
you are going to be able to take advantage of
the Hybrid SLI system that Nvidia has designed.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.790
So let me go ahead and show you around this
particular computer. 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.730
Up here on the front you're going to find your
 optical drive, that is the DVD RW drive

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.440
that does do Labelflash. Down here, you'll find 
your, your memory thingy, ports... 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.470
The memory thingies.... The sticks, that go down
here. It's the Compact Flash card, the SD, the XD

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.510
the Memory Sticks, the Memory Sticks Pro. They're
all going to go in here. You've got,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.310
5 USB ports on the front, which is real handy, 
as well as microphone and headphone ports.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.680
And a Firewire port located up here, as well.
Now on the back, 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.920
you're going to find everything else. Up here is
your modem. There is a modem card installed 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.460
if you're still that guy. Alfred raises his hand, 
yeah we know.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.340
Right below that is your wireless card, you do...
There are antennas that are included with this,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.240
that you hook up to these little ports right here 
so will be able to get a nice clear 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.010
wireless signal. 7.1 surround sound, as well as
your S/PDIF Optical Output located right there.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.050
You got Ethernet, you've got 4 more  
USB ports and an eSATA port,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.890
and you've got your standard VGA and an HDMI
port on the back,

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.660
so you're going to be able to hook this up 
to your big screen TV without any problem.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.900
2 USB ports on the back as well. Now, if you want
to see how they crammed all of this 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.130
extraordinary technology into such a small package
that's how. Take a look.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.880
You've got your, your modem up here. Look how
tiny modem cards are now. 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.250
Does anybody remember when modem cards
were like really huge? Right, remember that?

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.840
That's the modem card. Right there. You're 
wireless card is right there.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.010
Plugged into the PCI port, and right here is
that AMD Triple Core processor, 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.490
located underneath that cooler. Optical drive,
hard drive back there behind the optical drive 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.530
and your 4 'gigs' of RAM are also nestled neatly
back here as well. I think you might be able to

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.200
barely catch a glimpse of that right there,
there's your RAM. 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.040
Alright, and that is 2 DIMMs slots, onboard this
thing so that's going to 2, 2 GB DIMMs,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.370
that you're going to find inside this particular
machine. Overall, really solid computer

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.520
at a really great price, and a really nice small
from factor to be used next to your desk,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.690
in your home entertainment system, wherever 
you want to put it. 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.790
But I don't think you can go wrong, with a system
like this one. It is the Acer AX3200.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.670
To get more info on this Acer AX3200, go to
any of the retailers you see here,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.200
and type in A180-3200. For Computer TV,
I'm Bauer.
