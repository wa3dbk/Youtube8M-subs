HoM 35: Karma, Reincarnation and the SOUL27 August 2007

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.050
Jack again – so you know who`s speaking.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.690
So - Reincarnation.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.970
Reincarnation was also placed-in by Anu,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.770
which is part of the White Light Construct, part of the soul construct.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.230
So, you had reincarnation, the White Light construct and the soul construct,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.060
that basically did it three-in-one which is part of the whole recycling situation.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.410
The soul construct was connected to the White Light,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.940
which was connected to Anu, existence,the universe, etcetera –

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:06.170
so that you just remained in your preprogrammed, pre-ordained life experience here on Earth, etcetera.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.320
Then you have reincarnation.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.980
Reincarnation was specifically directed by specific beings. In other words, the following:

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.810
you die and you had about seventeen lives before the one you had when you just died.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.820
Now, all that information is in your soul.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.550
So, what happens is: the moment you die,

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.060
you had beings who (obviously) specifically wrote everything down in which is called the Akashic Records –

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.010
which is basically imprints of your entire life experience in a book.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.390
And then you die and then you`d be led to this being.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:53.870
This was now the upgradedplacement that they`d placed-in, the „authoritive placement` of deciding

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:01.070
whether you`ll go to reincarnation,whether you will be placed in ascension-process,

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.390
whether you would choose to be in your own heaven, will you either go to another galaxy and exist on another planet,

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.870
reincarnation as… yeah, etcetera.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.940
So, then you walk up to this being - it was a massive, massive, massive manifestation being –

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.580
with this preacher`s table-thing and this massive book on top of it –

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.430
this is now all beings in existence`s book who have ever had lives on Earth.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.050
Then you walk up to this being and this being looks at your life

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:40.620
and decides whether you require to learn more „lessons`,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.770
whether you have „failed lessons` -

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.880
it was all about lessons and the whole bullshit about karma, etcetera –

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.020
which is bullshit; it`s part of the whole soul construct manifestation,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:06.750
to have human beings believe they have to go life after life trying to fucking figure out one point

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.460
because they fucked up in previous lives, [of] which they can`t even remember 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.520
why they did it,how they got there – and now they have to pay for it

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.660
through learning a lesson, apparently„transcending` that point.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.590
That is utter - excuse my word - but it is really bullshit!

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.710
I just couldn`t believe, you know, in terms of… I won`t get there, never-mind.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.360
So, karma, it was the manifestation of karma.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.730
The manifestation of karma was another point to enslave human beings to believe that they have to go life after life

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.730
trying to figure out and„compensate` for another past life and learn their lesson –

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.090
if they haven`t learned it in this life, they`d have to go on to the next one, next one, next one.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:01.100
You know what? Some beings lived ten thousand lives here on Earth still not being able to transcend that one point.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.800
Why?Because that`s how the Annunakis enslaved human beings, believing they have to learn lessons,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.820
believing they have to „pay for`, apparently, a previous life that they had „fucked-up`

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:18.360
in and then compensate therefore by „making it right in another life`.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:25.590
All is taken into consideration: your karma –

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.480
the decision was based on „karma`.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.170
So, let`s take it to: you`ve decided to go to reincarnation and you`re led by your „guides`,

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.050
who are apparently your „protectors` –

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.260
but your „protectors` in terms of making sure

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.920
that you as a human being remain on your path of enslavement and preprogrammed existence/life experience –

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.220
you`re taken to a being.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.450
This being places out six plates,

00:04:51.450 --> 00:05:01.340
it looks see-through,but then they place-in six different families.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.180
You`re able to choose from six different families;

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:10.080
some have a choice, depending on how „good` and „worthy` your previous life was.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.240
They placed these six placements, six families and now they can say bullshit, like:

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.730
„you`re going in this family to save the marriage, this is your purpose!` –

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:31.510
or: „this mother needs you,she is so alone, her husband left her, you will become the love of her!`.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:38.910
You know – they`d make it so that you`d have some form of purpose for a certain family.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.630
And then you may choose which family you want to be in.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.280
And then you choose one and then they send you to that particular woman.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.220
They first place you into, like, a container,

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.840
which is existent in the back of the mother`s…

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.060
just above your bum,

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.930
that line there, there was a little container which you`re placed in.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:10.770
And then round-about 6 weeks – round-about, maybe less –

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:17.160
you`d then go in and integrate into the baby that`s being developed in the mother`s womb.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.590
But recently it had gotten worse:

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.820
it was already – not „worse`,

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.030
the system-integration got worse at birth, yeah –

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:35.210
but now being integrate already at the moment of conception: [whistles], and then you sprout like a flower –

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.150
[chuckles] the birds and the bees –

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.330
just putting in a little joke there.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.630
So, that was the reincarnation process. And the reincarnation process was also automatic.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.070
Remember now,

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:55.780
all the beings in the dimensions were programmed in-here [holds headregion],by Anu –

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.970
and he knew always all the time what was happening to everything.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.490
Though he had power and dominion in the dimensions,

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.850
his power and dominion on Earth was as the consciousness systems inside human beings

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.400
and then the White Light, the soul construct and the reincarnation process;

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.730
that was all him as him.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.160
So, that`s how reincarnation worked.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
This is Jack.
Thank you very much.
