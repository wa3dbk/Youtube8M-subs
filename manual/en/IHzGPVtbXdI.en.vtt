00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This video shows you how to replace just the rubber part of the rear wiper on some cars and trucks.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
First, I'm going to show you the hard way to get the refill in and out in case you don't have a better option.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
At the end of the video, I'll show you an easier way.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
A word of advice, regardless of if you're replacing the blade or just the refill,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
since they aren't always easy to find,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
buy one ahead of time and keep it in the car or truck.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
A little on terminology,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the part of the wiper that's made of rubber is called a refill.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It comes with stainless steel rails or some sort of material to make it more rigid.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The part that holds the refill is called the blade.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The parts that the refill slides thru are called claws.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The part that attaches the blade to the car is called the wiper arm.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Getting these off is a little different from most of the front wipers.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Basically, you just lift the wiper arm away from the window and then continue to rotate the blade further until it pops free.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Yours may not be this same design so look at it carefully.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
This is a 14 inch blade and cost about $10-$15 dollars to replace the entire blade.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I paid $7 at a local parts house for a pack of 2 refills, so that's about $3.50 each.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
There are a couple of different rubber shapes for refills

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
so take your original with you to match it up.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Some parts houses have refills out on the floor, but some keep them behind the counter, so you may have to ask for them.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
To get the refill out, push it as far to one end as you can

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and then bow the center section out

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
while you continue to press the insert to the same end

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
so all of the slack is at the opposite end.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Once you bow it out far enough for the slack end to clear the claw,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
use your thumb and finger to hold the center out

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and pull the slack end out away from the claw.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Then you can slide the refill out of the rest of the claws.
 
0:02:25,0:02:57
That may be a little awkward for you the first time, but it gets easier each time you do it.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Then insert the old rails into the new rubber.
 
0:02:53,0:02:57
Cut the new rubber the same length as the rails.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It's best to have the rubber a little too long instead of too short.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Trim both tips to a point.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Trimming the tips to a point helps the refill go thru the claws easier.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Install the plastic clips to hold it all together.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:36.000
There are usually three.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Space them out evenly.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Then, starting with the second claw in, push the tip of the refill thru the claw.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
There should be a piece of rubber above and below each rail.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Make sure you get all 4 rubber pieces to go thru each claw.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Pull the refill to the next claw.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.000
If you pull the refill to the next claw the rubber lips are less likely to come out of the claws.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
If the rails get out of alignment with the rubber, just push them back in line.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Push the tip of the refill thru the next claw.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Make sure all the rubber lips go thru.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Pull the refill to the next claw.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Continue until you get thru all the claws.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Then you can remove the clips.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
The rubber may have stretched.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Pull the excess to one end.
 
0:05:38,0:05:55
Push the refill as far to the end as you can and then bow the center section out while continuing to push the refill to the same end so all the slack is at the opposite end.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Once you bow it out far enough, hold the center out with your thumb and finger and feed the tip of the refill thru the last claw.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000
It may hang up, like this.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Continue to work with it until it pops thru.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Make sure you get all 4 lips thru the last claw.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Before you bow the center out and go thru the last claw,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
check that the rubber lips have not come out of any of the claws.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
If you miss one, backup and redo it.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Even out the excess so the rubber and rails are evenly distributed along the blade.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Reinstall the blade, and you are done.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
If you do need to use the metal rails that come with the new refill,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
cut the rails to a length so they can't work free on their own

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:11.000
but they're easy to get free when you bow the center out.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
If you pull all of the slack to one end, cut the rails so they stick beyond the last claw by about 1/8 of an inch or less.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:32.000
They usually break pretty easy if you use a pair of pliers and bend them slightly back and forth a few times.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
They usually break pretty clean.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Some refills have barbed rails.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
If you want to use this method to get the refill in and out,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
it's easier if the rails don't have barbs, so you can break the barbed section off.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Then make the rest of the rail whatever length you need it.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
That was the hard way.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
