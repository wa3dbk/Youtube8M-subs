00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.440
We haven't done celebrity bashing for awhile.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.850
That's right, its been awhile.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.990
Or shall we call it social observation?

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.510
Either or, they're both accurate.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.510
Russell Brand.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:18.199
Oh God. Don't you talk to me about that douche
bag...I can't STAND Russell Brand. What a...DICK!

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.490
Its very interesting because no-one seems
to understand my dislike for the guy. There

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.410
are five main reasons why I have a problem
with Russell Brand OK?

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:43.750
So the first one: Everything! Let me try again...alright,
its his whole look. Its the lank long hair,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.040
the skinny jeans, the open shirt, the big
teeth and gums, I just can't be dealing with

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.190
it.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.760
Secondly: He married Katie Perry, bastard!
Third: he divorced Katy Perry, DICK! Third

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.929
and a half: he divorced Katy Perry via text
message. Who does that?

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:12.929
Russell Brand!

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:20.470
Obviously, the guy is an absolute douche bag.
Russell's brand of comedy, to be perfectly

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:28.560
honest I just don't get. I must admit, I've
never really given the guy too much of a chance

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.880
when it comes to his comedy; the last time
I saw him he was still with Katy and he was

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.829
making jokes at her expense. He was saying
unkind things about his then wife, to get

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.520
laughs from strangers and I just didn't think
that was that cool to be perfectly honest

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.520
with you.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.469
He's just a bit of a dickhead, look what he
did with Andrew Sachs, he was making those

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:57.099
derogatory comments with what's his face,
douche bag (Jonathan Ross), yeah with Ross

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:01.909
about the guys granddaughter. Whether they
were true or not is irrelevant, whether she's

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:02.909
a slut or not is irrelevant.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.730
I would not be too concerned because look
what he's done to other people. Look how he's

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:19.061
treated other people on camera...Russell Brand;
the guy's just a womanizing douche and he

00:02:19.061 --> 00:02:22.810
irritates the hell out of me!

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.560
Recently he did that interview with Paxman
yeah? What about his political views there

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.760
about the "revolution" and the not voting?

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:45.469
I was very surprised to find that our political
views are quite parallel in terms of him feeling

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:49.859
indifference and feeling that the system doesn't
work and doesn't serve who its supposed to

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.560
serve; I actually do agree with him on that...

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.870
Brand throws me off balance. 75-80% of the
time I think "This guy's a dickhead", the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.409
rest of the time I think, you read about how
he takes homeless people and he gives them

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:13.489
food and he does charitable things for people
who he can help, and you think "This guy's

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:20.450
mental!". In one breath he's a real dick,
and the next he does things that I find admirable

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.260
so how do I view him?

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.630
When I saw him with Paxman, I started to look
at him differently. A lot of the time when

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.639
I see him in movies and on tour, and whenever
he's doing promotional stuff, he's always

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:37.269
trying to do this uncaring, facetious, funny,
stupid thing. And its not funny at all, its

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.560
actually quite irritating I find but anyway...
He actually for the first time, I saw him

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.260
with Paxman on Newsnight, string together
ideas in an articulate, comprehensive way.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.409
And it just made me think "When you're not
trying to be funny, you actually make a good

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:02.029
couple of points there. You still are a bit
of a douche.", but I can hear him now. I can

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.870
look at him and hear what he has to say without
my skin crawling which is pretty good.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.279
I can give him a bit more of a chance now
when I see him instead of just switching over

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:13.749
like I would do usually because he just looks
so bummy, I mean sort that hair out!

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:20.539
I feel the same, I wouldn't have watched the
interview had it not been with Paxman...The

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.660
radio thing that he did with Jonathan Ross
is going back a few years.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.330
It is, but he's done a lot of things that
have just turned me off over the years!

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.520
I first became aware that he existed was on
Big Brother's Big Mouth; I actually liked

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.620
him on Big Brother's Big Mouth. I know Big
Brother isn't a thing for everyone. The stuff

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.750
that he came out with I found interesting
at the time. He moved on from that very quickly

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.530
and when you heard him afterwards: "I knew
I was destined for greater things.". And I

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.060
was thinking "Dude, sky's the limit; aim high,
but where does all that come from?"

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.770
I would like to see more of him where he's
not trying to be funny, where he's not talking

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.900
about sleeping with a lot of women. Where
he's not making fun at other people's expense

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.100
and stuff and...hopefully I'll see him as
a cool guy in the future, maybe...
