00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.620
Okay, we are here in Memphis at the Kooky Canuck, and with my good friend.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.100
and legendary eater, Randy Santel.  Welcome back to Memphis Randy!

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.089
How have you been?  It's good to be back.

00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:22.971
I was here back in 2012.  On Canada Day I won their poutine contest that they held.

00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:26.911
Now I'm back, taking on their massive Kookamonga Burger Challenge!

00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:28.800
Which was featured on Man V. Food Memphis.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.999
Shawn why don't you tell us about the challenge?

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.260
Okay, so Randy's challenge today is a four pound burger.  Now that sounds a little

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.820
bit deceiving because it's actually a four pound patty

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.100
complimented with two pounds of bun, and a pound and a half of lettuce and tomato, onion,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.604
cheese, and pickles, and he's got to do the whole thing - top of the pickle to bottom of the bun.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.800
Fries are optional in this challenge.  Now the record on this burger is 4:43.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.660
However, I think your goal for today is?

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.260
I want to beat Ramsey "The Mantis" Hilton, who has the non-dunking record of 25:50.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.480
So we're definitely going for that.

00:01:06.283 --> 00:01:08.843
Good deal!  We wish you the best of luck!

00:01:08.843 --> 00:01:10.380
How many people have tried this food challenge?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.200
Over 4,000, with only 23 people who have successfully beaten the food challenge.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.230
If I win, I'll get the massive meal free, and then I'll get a sweet t-shirt and become the 24th

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.120
person to win, out of over 4,000 people.  Lets get Atlas the victory!

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.940
Alright, now we can go!

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.000
One, two, three!

00:01:47.686 --> 00:01:50.726
Give it everybody!  Make some noise for Randy!

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.700
Yeah I think he's going through that really quickly!  I think he's going to do really well!

00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:24.875
I've never seen anything like this before!

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.880
Under nine minutes!

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:37.309
This has been on my bucket list for years, so I've been getting ready for this one for a while.

00:05:10.108 --> 00:05:16.668
 19:26!  Thank you guys for watching!  I've ate about 35lbs of watermelon to get ready for this thing,

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.940
Very good win!  Win #182.  Thank you guys for watching!
