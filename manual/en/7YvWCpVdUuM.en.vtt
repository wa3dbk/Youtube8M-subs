00:00:02.126 --> 00:00:03.987
Repairing...

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:06.915
..is redemption for me.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.989
I wanted some time for me
and I grabbed it.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.256
I left my girlfriend, I quit my job,
I left everything,

00:00:27.257 --> 00:00:31.808
everything, just to stay on the street,
on my fucking own.

00:00:32.368 --> 00:00:35.136
You might start with an idea,
then you end up

00:00:35.192 --> 00:00:39.695
that you actually lost that idea
and find yourself with some tools

00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:41.865
and that becomes your philosophy.

00:00:42.872 --> 00:00:45.609
- I'd let you come at 2:00 pm.
- That's ok.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.818
We'll do just the afternoon shift.

00:00:50.648 --> 00:00:54.456
When you come inside you think
that this place is a bunker.

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:59.720
On the one hand he lives like
all this had landed on him,

00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:05.803
on the other hand he should understand
that he is the creator of that.

00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:09.345
In fact when I was seeing her
eating sandwiches on the street

00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:12.145
I said to her
"Let's satiate those senses!"

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.625
Do you remember?

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:19.681
Gone. 400 euros of a new bike thrown away,
the price is increasing!

00:02:07.107 --> 00:02:09.565
What brings us to the Bike Pride

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:11.473
is not the city of bikers,

00:02:11.817 --> 00:02:14.079
but the city whose centre is the person.

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:23.969
Future citizens will be grateful to me,
actually, to us,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.453
if we'll get some results.
