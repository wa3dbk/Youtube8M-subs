00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.189
When I was at the Olympics,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.120
I used to wake up the day of the race

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.499
and it was such a fantastic day, and I would say “each second must last a minute

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.030
and each minute must last an hour”

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.290
 If I can manage that,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.200
then my day will be a success no matter what. My day will be a good day.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.460
The first time I took part in the Olympic Games

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.320
was at Calgary, in 1988.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.660
My sport was a demonstration sport

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.070
and what really struck me was the opening ceremony.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.870
To be able to be part of that ceremoy,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.060
To be able to meet all those athletes 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.620
who I'd never met, 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.520
who I didn't know. 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:05.680
To see everyone gathered around the same dream, the same ideal in a way…

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.180
It was like there was some kind of communion

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:10.300
happening there

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.600
and that’s when you think:

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.640
When people talk about the “Olympic family”

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.310
when you are an Olympian,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.160
I think you don’t really understand what it means

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.280
until you’re at an Opening Ceremony.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.780
I had the same feeling in Albertville and again in Lillehammer. 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.710
The most intense moment, for me,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.540
was when I got on the podium at the Olympic Games.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.860
 It was in France, I’m French.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.860
It was for a gold medal.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.040
Everyone was there, my entire family,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.640
 my closest friends

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.290
and when

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.990
they called my name

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.180
I got on the podium

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.760
I found myself there.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.510
I heard the Marseillaise.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.410
They raised the flag. 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.690
And my entire life flashed in front of me,

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.860
all the decisions I’d made.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.709
All the hard work I’d put in

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.509
All the choices that I’d taken me where I was at that very moment…

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.900
On that podium. It was very intense.
