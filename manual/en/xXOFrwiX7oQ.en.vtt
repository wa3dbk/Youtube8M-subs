00:00:03.313 --> 00:00:06.595
Okay guys, so we're going to be looking at how to uppercut in a street

00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:07.020
fight.

00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:09.164
Obviously, if you've done boxing,

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:11.148
the uppercut looks like this.

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.796
Again, somebody as big as Rock,

00:00:14.797 --> 00:00:16.309
Am I going to come over here and uppercut

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.445
him? I can't even launch my strike from here. So when I'm looking

00:00:19.446 --> 00:00:21.324
at an uppercut and we are looking at a street situation,

00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:22.953
what am i always teaching is open hand

00:00:22.954 --> 00:00:24.521
palm strike.

00:00:24.522 --> 00:00:26.728
So if you're faced with the attacker especially somebody who's

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:27.775
much bigger than me,

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:29.455
the last thing I want... I don't wanna square off with this

00:00:29.456 --> 00:00:31.621
guy I'd be crazy , he's double my size.

00:00:31.622 --> 00:00:34.757
I don't wanna get into a wrestling match or a pushing match,

00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:35.067
he's

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.307
too big, he's double my size and if he pushes me I'm gonna go through

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:39.996
the wall. So, if I want to finish the fight as quickly as possible,

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:42.523
I want to throw in my first strike,

00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:44.754
a great a uppercut palm strike,

00:00:44.755 --> 00:00:46.075
it goes underneath the jawline,

00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:47.388
this way.

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:49.403
Now, you can go... palm face with rock,

00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:51.067
I can come up way underneath

00:00:51.068 --> 00:00:52.754
the jawline, or I can come this way,

00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:54.171
even more devastating is if

00:00:54.172 --> 00:00:58.719
I'm talking to him will be both hands coming up. So the first hand

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.666
comes

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:01.617
In first hand forward,

00:01:01.618 --> 00:01:02.869
the other one comes right behind me to give

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.853
me more power.

00:01:04.854 --> 00:01:08.053
I'm driving it through the hips and I'm going right through my target,

00:01:08.054 --> 00:01:09.365
snapping the neck back,

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.212
the head's going to go flying and I get this

00:01:11.213 --> 00:01:12.305
motion, right come back,

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.353
the head snapping back is what's going to

00:01:14.354 --> 00:01:17.041
create the brain to hit the back of the wall and knock out your

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:18.816
attacker as quickly as possible.

00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:20.087
Against a guy this big,

00:01:20.088 --> 00:01:21.489
like I said, I don't want to square off with

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.959
him so if I'm faced with him and he's talking to me,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.503
let's say

00:01:24.504 --> 00:01:26.277
you're mouthing off a little bit.

00:01:26.278 --> 00:01:27.302
&gt;&gt; Hey man what you gonna do- &gt;&gt;  what's going on man.

00:01:27.303 --> 00:01:28.271
What do you want man?

00:01:28.272 --> 00:01:29.304
&gt;&gt; What the heck you gonna do?

00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:31.206
&gt;&gt; Boom, oh sheesh, you okay.

00:01:31.207 --> 00:01:36.687
Oh sheesh okay, right I went really slow because just a small tap and

00:01:36.688 --> 00:01:38.575
bites is tongue or busts his teeth,

00:01:38.576 --> 00:01:39.658
you could just imagine, just

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.146
that he felt it right away but you could imagine if I drove it

00:01:43.147 --> 00:01:44.939
full power and I would go like boom,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.762
right behind, I will snap

00:01:46.763 --> 00:01:47.435
his neck.

00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:50.501
Because his head weighs maybe 20 pounds or 15 to 20 pounds max,

00:01:50.502 --> 00:01:51.457
his neck's

00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:52.481
going to snap the brain,

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:53.502
his brain's going to hit the back of the wall.

00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:56.231
I'm going to finish the fight and you know what?

00:01:56.232 --> 00:01:57.383
It's the first strike,

00:01:57.384 --> 00:01:59.454
is it a cheap shot? Yeah damn right

00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:00.570
The guy's twice my size

00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:03.323
You think I'm going to let him pick enough momentum to hit me first?

00:02:03.324 --> 00:02:04.570
You think I'm going to take the chance to say,

00:02:04.571 --> 00:02:05.402
well, I'm not sure if he's

00:02:05.403 --> 00:02:07.226
going to hit me, let me take my chances.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:08.283
With a big guy think like that,

00:02:08.284 --> 00:02:09.946
it's either you talk and get out, or you

00:02:09.947 --> 00:02:12.454
go preemptive.

00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:20.000
