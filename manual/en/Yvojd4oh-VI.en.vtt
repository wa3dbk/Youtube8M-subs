00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.850
Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.240
This is Ann Clemmer and Stamper from stamperdog.com.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.040
I have to tell you that this card is my most
Pinned card

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.219
of everything that I've ever done.

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.720
It's all over Pinterest.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.460
But now we've gotta update it.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.080
And I hope that I do it justice when we make
it with

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.340
the Stylin' Snowfolk set in the new catalog.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.920
We're going to start off with the Window Sheets.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.460
They come in 12 X 12 so you're going to want
to

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.160
cut them down to 8-1/2 X 5-1/2 and score it
in the middle.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.980
Now you really want to be careful with these.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.120
You don't want to have dirty hands.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.079
You don't want to have anything sharp on your
table.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.749
You want to be very nice to them because they
are not

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:50.170
quite as forgiving as card stock is so just
be mindful of that.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.000
You don't have to treat it really lightly,
like nylons -

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.120
oh, golly - what are those?!

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.800
But make sure that you use a Bone Folder and
give it

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.890
a really nice, good crease because that's
going to make

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.710
a successful card.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.120
And don't go getting one of those cheap plastic
things.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.920
That's not a bone folder.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.190
Ours are made from real bone
and will last you forever.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.549
So now we're going to start off making the
belly of

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.420
the snowman with the 1-3/4 inch Circle Punch.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.920
And we're going to sponge him with Baja Breeze.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.220
You know, those Sponge Daubers are just perfect.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.880
They're really small and you can just lightly
go around the edge

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.880
like I am.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.490
Or else you can lay them down onto a piece
of paper and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.450
then go backwards and get a little more of
a defined edge,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.579
but I tend to be a light sponger.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.290
I guess I'm sponge challenged!

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.680
So now we're going to get out some Mini Glue
Dots.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.499
And you know, you could use some Mono Adhesive,
you could use SNAIL.

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:56.450
I don't know about SNAIL, because I used
Sticky Strip on the original card.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.240
But you know, I think that the Mini Glue Dots
are really going to be

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.640
the thing that we really should use.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.539
Once you see me put one on, well then, you'll
know how I put the rest of them on.

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.979
I probably put 4 or 5 all the way around the
edge, pretty much evenly.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.700
Now you're going to think I'm going to put
this on the front of the card

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.060
but actually I'm going to put it on the inside
of the card

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.420
because you want to have a finished card.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.110
You want this to look as if your snowman is
floating in air

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.860
and the best way to do that is to have a finished
inside.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.220
So now we're going to take some Cherry Cobbler
ink and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.100
we're going to put some buttons on here.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.450
These are the buttons that come with the Stylin'
Snowfolk

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.820
stamp set and I'm going to give you the number
for that in a minute.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.820
And I try to get that all the way up to the
edge

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.370
because really only one button's going to
show unless you

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.990
decide to put your card together a little
bit differently.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.870
Oh, here we go with those Mini Glue Dots;
there are 4 or 5 on the back of this.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.590
Lay it down carefully and put it on top of
the original circle.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.180
So you want it to be layered just exactly
even.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.600
Now this one is a 2-1/2 inch Circle Punch
and this is for the bottom part of the snowman

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.350
and I'm putting that on the inside and lining
that up

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.640
in the right place according to the body.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.710
Now I already put the Mini Glue Dots on this
so this is a label backing that I've used

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.850
because . . .
You know we make personalized stamps and we've

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.180
gotta give
the dog his props.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.480
And since I had the Mini Glue Dots on there,
I could use that

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.230
label backing and it wouldn't stick to it.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.220
I want to lay this down and make sure that
I have the personalized

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.500
stamp going the right way and then lay it
down.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.880
And once again you want to make those circles
match

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.680
because you want them to know that this is
a handcrafted card.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.820
You don't them to get it confused with that
"H" place.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.790
So anyway, you're going to think that this
is a little pinhead,

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.790
but it's really not.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.040
It's a 1-1/4 inch Circle Punch.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.210
And I like to start with the mouth on this
snowman.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.870
For some reason he lines up better when I
start with the mouth.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.970
And so we're going to give him a carrot nose
and that's with Pumpkin Pie.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.760
Now remember don't stick your stamps really
hard into these

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.729
new stamp pads because they're very juicy.

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.400
And then back to the black Staz-On which is
the best thing to use

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.340
on Whisper White card stock when it comes
to black.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:33.150
Now always put the top on that jet black Staz-On
because if it's fast drying on your card stock,

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.760
it's going to be fast drying on your ink pad
as well.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.870
Now I've already got one of these that I sponged
before

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.870
we started.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.290
You know, it's funny - I got the same face
twice.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.620
Boy, I'm lucky.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.650
This is the scarf from the Stylin' Snowfolk
stamp set.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.940
Well, I wish I would have made it in Cherry
Cobbler,

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.400
but that's fine.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.870
I put that together with SNAIL but here I'm
going to secure it

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.230
and put a second piece of adhesive here
and that is with the Stampin' Dimensionals.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.620
I'm going to put that all the way around and
then

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.180
I'm going to add his hat on, too, the same
way.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.930
I'm going to have a little bit of SNAIL Adhesive
on there

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.010
to secure the hat initially and then I want
to

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.130
secure it down really good with the Stampin'
Dimensionals.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.150
Then you get double coverage.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.900
Now in hindsight I probably should have finished
the back

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.410
on the inside for the hat and the scarf but
you can do that

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.590
on yours, okay?

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.690
Because you don't want to watch me back up
this whole thing.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.980
You can put that hat just like I've got it
there or else you can

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.740
slide it down and have just the one button
showing.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.960
But I'm trying to make this pretty true to
the original card.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.640
Now here's that "Got Treats?" from - or "Got
Merry?" from the Got Treats set.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.639
And it's punched out with the Window Punch;
it cut off a little bit.

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.980
Those mittens are from the Stylin' Snowfolk
stamp set.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.930
You know you're going to have to have it if
you like snowmen.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.160
I mean he's so cute and you can make them
with glasses, scarves . . .

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.430
you name it.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.090
There's lots of ways you can make it.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.169
So we've got these little mittens here and
the hardest part

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.000
is to figure out where to put it on the front
of the card.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.610
Now . . . what's that, Stamper?

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.570
Stamper, what did you say?

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.040
Okay, don't put the mitten down without putting
the back of the sign.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.260
Okay, gotcha, gotcha.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.450
(laughter)
Oh, that Stamper.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.420
He's such a tough director.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.590
You know, he always knows best.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.810
So I'd better back up that sign because it
really looks better

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.090
if you can't see the adhesive on the inside.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.139
You know, this is a nice card, and you will
want to give it

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.480
to your best friend so that they will keep
it for a long time.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.480
So there you go.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.680
You know, this is good but there's one more
thing that we could

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.110
add to this.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.770
Just one more thing - it's those googly eyes.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.870
Googlies are just in the Holiday Mini this
year and I think they're great.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.710
Maybe I should call it the Holiday Not-So-Mini.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:20.270
