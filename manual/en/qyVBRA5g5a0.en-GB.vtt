IS YOUR MICROWAVE
TOO SMALL?

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.666

and make more room.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.800
HOW TO OPEN JARS

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.733

Place the egg in a bowl with water,
if it floats, it's rotten.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.566
If it sinks, it's good.

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:48.066
STILL SOME
LEFT IN THE JAR?

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.433
Add hot milk to the jar

00:01:49.433 --> 00:01:52.600

close it, and it's done.

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:10.400
The paper towel will
absorb the humidity,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.100
keeping the leaves fresh longer.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.933
My favourite tip is
about the lettuce.

00:02:15.933 --> 00:02:17.700
Duca? Duca?

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:20.400
What do you mean by that?

00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:23.866
COMMENTS OF THE WEEK

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:27.466
We read all the comments
and it was so much fun.

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:28.700
-Right, Duca?
-Always is.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.566
Because everybody is interacting
and we love this interaction.

00:02:31.566 --> 00:02:34.600
We have here SulemaniKida,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.666
I'm not sure if it is a boy or a girl,
I don't know, who said:

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.800
Come to Brazil.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.266
Come, our country is waiting for you.
And so are we!

00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:50.066
Come, come.

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:53.900
And Carlos Eduardo
da Silva de Souza Eduardo.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.166
That's a lot of Eduardo.

00:02:57.166 --> 00:03:02.566
I think I want to be a dog
to eat the caopcake, that is 'wonder'.

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:06.466
You don't have to, this caopcake
can be eaten by humans.

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:08.933
Sure, sure, it was delicious,
I ate, why not?

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.433
And finally:

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.133
Bolitas?

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:18.466
What are bolitas?

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:23.266
What did she, or he,
this person mean by that?

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:27.500
If you know if this is Brazilian,
tell us in the comments.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.700
What is bolita, where can
it be found, how it is made.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.266
Where does it live?
Where does it reside?

00:03:31.266 --> 00:03:34.733
How do they appear?
Bolitos, bolitas.

00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:40.066
Actually I think bolitas are
the famous Brazilian bolinhos.

00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:44.400
-Like brigadeiro, cheese ball.
-Feijoada.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.133
So wonderful.
That must be it.

00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:48.500
-We can find it out.
-For sure.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.066
What are you watching?

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:56.266
This Sorted app is very good.
I like it very much.

00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:58.500
You have the recipe,
and the illustrations,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.600
which helps me a lot.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.000
Another amazing thing is that
you can find your friends

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.366
and see what they are cooking, eating.

00:04:05.366 --> 00:04:08.066
You can like if someone
makes a good recipe.

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:10.800
That's the fun,
it's not only about cooking,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.200
you have to show the result.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.433
And someone can complain:

00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:18.966
you made pancakes
and didn't call me.

00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:22.433
And you can follow
the guys from Sorted.

00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:24.700
You can follow Ben, Jamie.

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.300
And you can also follow us.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.800
I found a recipe
that looks like Barry.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.266
You know I like to
send things to him.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.500
That's so Barry!

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.700
Isn't he the posh guy?

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.933
Is he or not?

00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:43.300
-Maybe Mike?
-Mike?

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.300
Think about
the Spice Girls.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.433
We have Posh Spice, Victoria.
Which one is she?

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.066
-Look Jamie.
-Where?

00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:55.200
With a stylish hat.
Cuban style.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.966
The more real ones,
Ben and Mike.

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:02.466
Mike is normal,
Ben with his chef apron.

00:05:02.466 --> 00:05:06.666
Now, Jamie and Barry
are so fashionable.

00:05:09.133 --> 00:05:12.166
Pure style.
I'll be ready for the competition.

00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:15.733
Barry, Jamie, we are going
to compete in style.

00:05:15.733 --> 00:05:19.633
Now I have to take a
better profile picture.

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:22.200
To compete, because this
isn't just a food app,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.966
it's a beauty app.

00:05:24.566 --> 00:05:26.666
That's it,
if you want this app,

00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:29.300
go to your app store
and download it now.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.633
It's free.

00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:32.300
And follow us.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.133
And the Sorted guys.

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:35.533
And tell me if my 
picture is cool. 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.433

-You open it like a tractor.
-No, I opened slowly.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.533
And then you'll ask yourself,
how I didn't think of it before?

00:06:05.533 --> 00:06:07.966
How I didn't think of it before?

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:10.933
How I didn't think of it before?

00:06:10.933 --> 00:06:13.533

00:06:13.533 --> 00:06:16.166
How I didn't think of it before?

00:06:16.166 --> 00:06:18.966
How I didn't think of it before?

00:06:18.966 --> 00:06:21.833
How I didn't think of it before?

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:24.066
How I didn't think of it before?

00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:26.633
How I didn't think of it before?

00:06:26.633 --> 00:06:29.200
Why I didn't think of it before?
