Audio Podcasts: "Touch the Invisible Sky"

00:00:01.789 --> 00:00:02.789
Chapter 3: The Sun

00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:06.920
The star that dominates our daytime sky and
provides the heat and light to support life

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:14.349
on Earth is, of course, the Sun. In astronomical
terms it is very close, 150 million kilometers

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:21.180
(93 million miles), so we can study its properties
in great detail. Light from the Sun takes

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.810
just over eight minutes to reach the Earth.
For comparison, light from the next nearest

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.090
star takes four years to reach us.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.940
The Sun is composed primarily of hydrogen
and helium gas. The Sun generates its energy

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.550
by nuclear reactions at its core. the energy
generated at the core makes its way to the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.810
surface of the Sun and is radiated away into
space. the Sun is very dynamic and the gas

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.590
is always in motion; the surface resembles
a stormy boiling liquid.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.470
The surface of the Sun has a lot of structure
and has different layers that constitute its

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:04.070
atmosphere. A thin surface layer, called the
photosphere, is at a temperature of 6,000

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.030
degrees Celsius (11,000 Fahrenheit). Most
of the light from the Sun is radiated away

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.060
from the photosphere. Above the photosphere
is the chromosphere, which is hotter and is

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.430
transparent at visible wavelengths. The outermost
layer of the Sun is called the corona. The

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.710
corona is very rarefied but very hot, with
a temperature of more than a million degrees.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.979
By observing the Sun in different parts of
the spectrum, we can get information about

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.420
the different layers in its atmosphere to
better understand the Sun as a whole.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.090
Figure 6: The Sun - visible image. In visible
light, the Sun appears uniformly bright, but

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.930
touch the Sun at three, eight and nine o'clock
on its disc and you discover small dark regions

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.799
called sunspots. These cooler regions mark
the locations of strong magnetic fields. The

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.350
Sun is a ball of ionized gas, and the motion
of the gas generates electric currents and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.810
magnetic fields. The number of sunspots tells
you how active the sun is. more sunspots mean

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.590
more magnetic activity, which increases the
chance of solar storms.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.419
Figure 7: The Sun- radio image. Electrons
caught up in the magnetic fields of the sunspots

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:33.769
spiral along the invisible field lines and
generate radio waves. The radio image therefore

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.919
maps out the magnetic fields around the sunspots.
these are irregular outlines and the solid

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:45.359
areas are radio emission, which correspond
with the dark sunspots seen in the previous

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.230
visible image.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.909
Figure 8: The Sun - ultraviolet image. Ultraviolet
light from the Sun originates from the hot

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.889
chromosphere and corona, the outermost layer
of the Sun (sand-like texture). this gas is

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:05.849
heated by the strong magnetic fields generated
around the sunspots. In ultraviolet light,

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.930
the Sun appears dark except for the most active
areas, the hotspots associated with the magnetic

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.919
fields. As you touch the ultraviolet image
along the edge of the disk at two, four and

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:24.159
ten o'clock you can feel the gases following
the curved magnetic fields (loops) rising

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.029
above the disc and into the corona.

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:35.150
Figure 9: The Sun - X-ray image. The X-ray
image shows us the gas regions which extend

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.680
into the hot corona. In X-ray light, the disk
of the Sun is dark, but you can study the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.769
sand-textured glow of the corona extending
high above the Sun's surface. The irregular

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.069
patterns in the corona are produced by gas
heated by the magnetic fields that also create

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.930
the sunspots. When these magnetic field lines
get bunched and twisted they can snap, releasing

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.480
huge amounts of energy and hot gas into space.
This is called a coronal mass ejection. If

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.019
a coronal mass ejection happens to be aimed
at Earth, it can damage the sensitive electronics

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.500
and detectors on board satellites and space
telescopes.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.320
The Sun is a relatively long-lived and stable
star. Both these characteristics make it an

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.450
ideal star for life-bearing planets to orbit.
Many stars in the galaxy are much less stable

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.700
and lead short, dramatic lives. Let's now
pay a visit to one of the greatest superstars

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.450
in our galaxy!
