00:00:00.081 --> 00:00:01.161
- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:03.089
and it is the Friday video of the year.

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:04.969
If you don't know by
now, I am doing a video

00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:06.777
every single Friday this year,

00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:09.582
which has been really fun.

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:11.912
This past weekend I was at Playlist Live,

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:12.909
which was in Orlando.

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.826
It is a YouTube gathering
that's once a year.

00:00:14.826 --> 00:00:16.045
I was so excited to go back

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:17.206
because the first year was super fun.

00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:18.425
This year was even crazier.

00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:20.224
It was even bigger; it was amazing.

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:21.723
I got to meet so many of you guys.

00:00:21.723 --> 00:00:23.789
Here's a quick little
montage of all the people

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.646
like you that I got to meet.

00:00:25.646 --> 00:00:29.451
(country fiddle music)

00:00:35.213 --> 00:00:38.051
Wow! Such amazing people
that were amazing,

00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:40.939
and things, and all these other things.

00:00:41.093 --> 00:00:42.307
Really cool guys.

00:00:42.307 --> 00:00:44.295
For some reason they
even invited me on stage

00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:46.752
to do a live question and answer portion.

00:00:46.752 --> 00:00:47.920
That was really fun.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.218
- Here is your friend, Mr. Tyler Oakley.

00:00:50.218 --> 00:00:52.941
(cheers and applause)

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.409
- [Tyler] Say hi!

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.462
(cheers)

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.977
- [Tyler] That's cool.

00:01:01.977 --> 00:01:03.417
Everyone that I met was super awesome

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:06.040
and so nice, and some of
you even gave me presents.

00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:09.504
- [Girl] My hands are shaking
so bad I can't even --

00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:11.896
- You know what? I've seen you in person.

00:01:12.187 --> 00:01:13.571
I will save this.

00:01:14.463 --> 00:01:17.005
Wait, shut the fuck
up, oh my God you guys!

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.073
Wait, come to me, you're perfect.

00:01:20.073 --> 00:01:21.652
I can't wait to tweet this to Darren,

00:01:21.652 --> 00:01:24.194
he's gonna be like what?

00:01:24.544 --> 00:01:26.504
This is perfect in every way.

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:31.983
That is so funny (laughing)

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:33.999
Thank you so much!

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:35.242
- [Girl] You're welcome.

00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:36.705
- In addition to that beautiful gift,

00:01:36.705 --> 00:01:39.223
so many of you guys, for
some reason, I don't know,

00:01:39.223 --> 00:01:41.760
gave me bags of Cool Ranch Doritos.

00:01:42.252 --> 00:01:43.831
Over the weekend I acquired, I think,

00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:46.206
six or seven bags of Cool Ranch Doritos,

00:01:46.883 --> 00:01:48.731
and they were all gone by the time I left.

00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:51.828
But yes, I had an amazing time and I met

00:01:51.828 --> 00:01:53.930
so many YouTubers that I love watching.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.147
It was really cool, I don't
know, it was just super fun.

00:01:56.147 --> 00:01:57.912
All weekend I was kind of losing my voice.

00:01:57.912 --> 00:02:00.686
It's kind of coming back now,
but it's still kind of bad.

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:02.305
But deal with it.

00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:03.767
Also at Playlist Live one of you guys

00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:04.997
gave me these stickers.

00:02:04.997 --> 00:02:07.156
They are pizza scratch &amp; sniff.

00:02:07.156 --> 00:02:08.770
Can you even handle that right now?

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.172
Okay, let's try one. Let's see.

00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:14.353
It kind of smells -- oh my
God, that smells like pizza.

00:02:14.737 --> 00:02:17.510
Ooh, girl, I am like into that (laughing).

00:02:18.254 --> 00:02:19.406
Oh my God!

00:02:19.622 --> 00:02:23.803
I am beautiful and I smell
fabulous, so back off.

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.870
This is like the best
cologne I've ever used.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.890
I am so congested right now, but the fact

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.547
that I can smell my face and
that it smells like pizza

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:33.193
says something, it's fa la la.

00:02:33.193 --> 00:02:34.760
I'm just falling apart.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.474
So my question today is, comment below --

00:02:37.558 --> 00:02:39.797
I am really lazy right
now, so I don't know

00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:41.355
if I could come up with a question.

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:42.678
So comment below.

00:02:42.678 --> 00:02:44.896
If you could make your
face smell like anything,

00:02:44.896 --> 00:02:46.728
what would it be?

00:02:47.882 --> 00:02:49.432
I am gonna pick some
of my favorite comments

00:02:49.432 --> 00:02:51.593
and put them at the end of my next video.

00:02:51.593 --> 00:02:54.796
So, yeah, what else is
going on in my life?

00:02:54.796 --> 00:02:56.933
You know, I feel like
all of my videos recently

00:02:56.933 --> 00:02:58.512
have just been like announcement videos

00:02:58.512 --> 00:02:59.915
or telling you guys about things.

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:03.270
I just wanna like, can
I just talk to you guys?

00:03:03.713 --> 00:03:07.635
(exhales) Goodness gracious!

00:03:07.776 --> 00:03:09.947
Actually I do have something
I wanna show you guys.

00:03:09.947 --> 00:03:12.186
It's ridiculous in every way but,

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.148
look at this box I found
on the side of the road.

00:03:15.148 --> 00:03:16.413
My roommate tried to
tell me that I couldn't

00:03:16.413 --> 00:03:17.527
bring it in the apartment, but I was like

00:03:17.527 --> 00:03:18.933
lookatit, I have to have it.

00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:20.651
Will you just look?

00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:22.845
Can we have a moment?

00:03:23.414 --> 00:03:25.486
I just needed it in my life.

00:03:25.486 --> 00:03:28.248
Although I will say when I opened it,

00:03:28.248 --> 00:03:29.549
when we came in the apartment I opened it,

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.546
and there was literally a tarot card

00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:34.053
with death on it inside.

00:03:34.053 --> 00:03:35.087
That was all that was inside.

00:03:35.087 --> 00:03:36.584
So Cory was like "Throw that away.

00:03:36.584 --> 00:03:38.407
"Get it out of the apartment, get."

00:03:38.407 --> 00:03:40.833
But I just think it's
majestic in every way.

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:44.444
It's like little kittens
and roses and things

00:03:44.444 --> 00:03:46.151
and it's just like how
could you not want this

00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:47.090
in your apartment?

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.589
Cory said I have to keep
it in my room though

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:50.733
because it's not very pretty.

00:03:51.072 --> 00:03:52.694
So there, that was the
portion of the video

00:03:52.694 --> 00:03:55.200
that's not an announcement today, so...

00:03:55.287 --> 00:03:56.738
If you follow me on Twitter, you know that

00:03:56.738 --> 00:03:58.864
a couple weekends back I went to Texas

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:01.707
to speak at a gay pride conference thing.

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:03.322
It was super fun; I loved it.

00:04:03.322 --> 00:04:05.365
Here's a picture from the event.

00:04:05.365 --> 00:04:06.746
To be honest I never thought that I would

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:09.149
go to people's schools and speak,

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.345
but I've done it a few times.

00:04:10.345 --> 00:04:12.203
I did it at Michigan
State, did it at Illinois,

00:04:12.203 --> 00:04:14.420
I did it at Texas, and now
I'm coming to Wisconsin.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.987
So if you live in Wisconsin and you wanna

00:04:15.987 --> 00:04:17.741
come see me, I would love to meet you.

00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:20.260
I am coming to University
of Wisconsin-Stevens Point.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.582
The link will be below
to the Facebook event,

00:04:22.582 --> 00:04:24.821
and I would love to see you guys attend.

00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:26.703
My last video was while
I was at Playlist Live,

00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:27.706
and I showed you some of the people

00:04:27.706 --> 00:04:29.471
I was hangin' out with
and I asked you guys

00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:31.909
who are your favorite YouTubers
that you would love to meet.

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:33.952
Here are some of my favorite responses.

00:04:33.952 --> 00:04:35.229
I love these guys. I checked them out

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.552
because you guys suggested 'em.

00:04:36.552 --> 00:04:38.607
So thank you, okay.

00:04:38.607 --> 00:04:40.267
Ooh girl, look at all these YouTubers.

00:04:40.267 --> 00:04:42.125
Okay, so that is all I
have for you guys today.

00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:44.145
I will talk to ya soon.

00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:46.153
And yeah, okay.

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:48.450
It's been really real.
