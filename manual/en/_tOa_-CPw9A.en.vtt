00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.840
I can see

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.380
your eyes

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.400
gazing at the horizon

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.940
An empty street corner

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.560
a silent embrace

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.860
love is quietly ablaze

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.420
woo I can hear your voice

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:13.460
woo I can hear you in my mind

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:23.680
I think back to my first sight of you, think back to those mottled times

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:33.700
With you by my side, I finally stopped wandering aimlessly

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:42.600
I think back to those familiar streets, think back to the beautiful days that flew away

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:53.820
There is a place Only you and I know

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.240
My heartbeat

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.280
Your smile

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.860
it quietly gives me support

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.480
woo I can hear your voice 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:33.060
woo You are my eternal paradise

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:43.220
I think back to my first sight of you, think back to those mottled times

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:52.480
With you by my side, I finally stopped wandering aimlessly

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:01.660
I think back to those familiar streets, think back to the beautiful days that flew away

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:14.200
There is a place Only you and I know

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:40.160
I think back to my first sight of you, think back to those mottled times

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:50.240
With you by my side, I finally stopped wandering aimlessly

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:58.820
I think back to those familiar streets, think back to the beautiful days that flew away

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.760
There is a place

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.780
Only you and I know

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.440
I know

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:27.020
somewhere only we know
