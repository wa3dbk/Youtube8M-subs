00:00:00.696 --> 00:00:01.246
&gt;&gt; Welcome back.

00:00:01.246 --> 00:00:01.926
I'm Curtis Smith.

00:00:01.926 --> 00:00:03.896
We've returned to the rose
garden in Albuquerque to look

00:00:03.896 --> 00:00:04.926
at some of the problems

00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:07.246
which have developed this
summer here in the rose garden.

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:10.216
And Al Troyer, consulting
Rosarian President

00:00:10.216 --> 00:00:13.106
of the Albuquerque Rose Society
has come back to describe some

00:00:13.106 --> 00:00:14.786
of these problems and tell
us what's going on here.

00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:16.966
&gt;&gt; Nice to have you
back, Curtis.

00:00:17.556 --> 00:00:18.056
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Al.

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:20.896
&gt;&gt; What I'm going to explain
to you today is powdery mildew,

00:00:20.946 --> 00:00:24.096
one of the major problems
with roses here in New Mexico.

00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:27.036
I want to show you the different
stages and what it looks like.

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:31.196
Curtis, what you have
here is powdery mildew

00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:32.366
in its early stages.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.886
As you see the leaves
are starting to curl.

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:38.146
&gt;&gt; But I don't see any of the
powdery mildew on the surface

00:00:38.146 --> 00:00:39.716
of the leaf so it's
very early, isn't it?

00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:42.136
&gt;&gt; That's true but what you're
seeing is the front side.

00:00:42.136 --> 00:00:44.576
If you turn the leaf over,
you can see the beginnings

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:45.686
of that powdery mildew.

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:46.246
See here?

00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:48.586
&gt;&gt; Development of the powdery
material right here too.

00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:49.366
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:54.006
As the powdery mildew
progresses,

00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.906
it tends to make the
leaves turn brown

00:00:57.126 --> 00:00:58.996
and shrivel as you can see here.

00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:04.926
This is what powdery mildew
looks like in its final stages

00:01:05.326 --> 00:01:09.066
as you can see the white
on the leaves and the brown

00:01:09.406 --> 00:01:11.166
as the leaves completely
shrivel.

00:01:12.026 --> 00:01:13.256
&gt;&gt; And if people
have this problem,

00:01:13.256 --> 00:01:14.386
they really need to
do several things.

00:01:14.386 --> 00:01:15.866
First thing you ought to
do is just sanitation,

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.126
cleaning up the fallen leaves.

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:19.716
If they want to use some
chemical to control this,

00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:20.986
they can go to the nursery.

00:01:20.986 --> 00:01:24.926
Look for a product labeled to
control powdery mildew on roses

00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:26.556
and buy that and
follow the directions.

00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:32.546
This looks a lot like the
powdery mildew problem we just

00:01:32.546 --> 00:01:34.156
discussed, but you said
this is something other

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:34.886
than powdery mildew.

00:01:35.086 --> 00:01:36.286
&gt;&gt; It is, Curtis.

00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:39.036
This is a bush that's
under stress

00:01:39.216 --> 00:01:41.176
from too much heat
and not enough water.

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:43.446
&gt;&gt; And this is a common
problem here in New Mexico.

00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:44.656
&gt;&gt; It sure is.

00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:47.626
As you can see, this
leaf is brown on the tips

00:01:47.686 --> 00:01:49.836
and green in the center.

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:52.736
That's a key factor
that shows you

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:56.066
that what the real problem here
is this plant is not getting

00:01:56.146 --> 00:01:56.866
sufficient water.

00:01:57.776 --> 00:02:00.236
&gt;&gt; And the heat just
really aggravates that.

00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:00.876
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:02:01.446 --> 00:02:05.226
&gt;&gt; Well, this plant looks
like it's in really bad shape.

00:02:05.226 --> 00:02:05.876
What happened here?

00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:07.156
&gt;&gt; You're right, Curtis.

00:02:07.196 --> 00:02:08.866
This is an example
of what happens

00:02:09.786 --> 00:02:12.606
when we have late
freezes in the springtime.

00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:16.796
This rose was badly damaged
in the spring and has managed

00:02:16.796 --> 00:02:18.626
to hang on throughout
the summer.

00:02:18.676 --> 00:02:20.446
However, it is now
giving up the ghost.

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:21.866
See how it's beginning
to shrivel?

00:02:22.126 --> 00:02:25.486
&gt;&gt; Yes. If you left it here,
it'd just be a stick by spring.

00:02:25.576 --> 00:02:27.906
&gt;&gt; That's absolutely right and
it will have to be dug out.

00:02:28.426 --> 00:02:30.356
&gt;&gt; So it's a good example of
what needs to be replaced.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:30.976
&gt;&gt; That is correct.

00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:33.596
&gt;&gt; Al, thanks for coming
back to the rose garden here

00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:35.116
at the Wyoming Library
in Albuquerque

00:02:35.116 --> 00:02:35.916
to show us the problems

00:02:35.916 --> 00:02:37.846
that have been developing
this summer.

00:02:37.846 --> 00:02:38.736
&gt;&gt; You're welcome, Curtis.

00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:41.746
And tell your people to
come back here in September

00:02:42.056 --> 00:02:43.636
and this garden is going
to be in full bloom.

00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:44.706
&gt;&gt; We look forward to it.

00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:48.020
