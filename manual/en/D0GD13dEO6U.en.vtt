00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
Hello, friends!
My name is Sergey Polyansky,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
today Iâ€™ll tell you about
the Epiphone G-310 guitar.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This is a classic SG model,
entirely made of redwood,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the fretboard is made of rosewood.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The only difference from the more expensive
counterpart is a bolt-on neck, not set-in.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The electronics is also standard:
two humbuckers, two volume knobs,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
two tone knobs and 3-way switch.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.000
The guitar has the great tuners by Grover.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Let's listen to the each pickup one by one.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Now let's play with an overdrive.
