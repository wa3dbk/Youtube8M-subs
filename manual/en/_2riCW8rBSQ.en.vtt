Hi, my name is Elizabeth Sutton.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.069
I'm one of the head decorators here at Amanda
Oakleaf Cakes.

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.670
I really enjoy working here and being a cake
decorator, more specifically cupcake decorator.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.420
You can come visit us at oakleafcakes.com
at 1, Pauline Street in Winthrop, Massachusetts.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.010
And you can also visit our website at oakleafcakes.com.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.950
And today, I'm going to be talking to you
about cupcake decorating.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.651
To start the frosting, the first thing that
you want to do is to make a meringue Italian

00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:30.651
butter cream base.

00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:37.350
We are going to take 1/4 cup of water and
pour it into the boiler along with 1 1/4 cup

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.589
of sugar.

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.350
It feels like a lot of sugar but believe me,
it's not.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.399
So to measure the temperature of the sugar
water, we're going to use a candy thermometer

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.879
and we want that to get to about 250 degrees
Fahrenheit.

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.339
Just watch it, it takes a little while.

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.659
When the sugar starts to bubble and get thick,
that's probably a good time to check it because

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.819
it should be about 250 at that point.

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:04.409
Now while that's going on, you want to pour
8 large egg-whites and it comes out to about

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.800
a cup, into your mixer along with 1 teaspoon
of ; the helps to stabilize the egg-whites,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.800
helps them whip up really nice.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.800
So you want to let that go until the froth
kicks firm.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.360
Now that the froth in the egg-whites kicks
firm, we're going to add 1/3 cup of sugar.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:26.160
I usually keep it separate next to the bowl
so that I really don't forget to add it.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.790
It's an so that makes it you know, taste a
lot more better.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.100
While that's going on you want to check your
syrup.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.550
So now that it's reached 250 F, we're going
to turn down our mixer to very slow because

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.060
you don't want this to splash up on you.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.850
And you're going to pour it in making careful
not to hit the bowl or the whisk or the sugar

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.590
will harden instantly and then you'll get
lumps of sugar syrup in your frosting.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.240
You want to let everything mix in and then
turn the speed back up to medium-high level.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.960
Okay, so the bowl feels better in temperature,
it's been 7 minutes and now it's time to add

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.960
the butter.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.120
So you want to turn it back up to low speed.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.009
For this, we're going to be using 6 sticks
or a 1 pounds of butter.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.340
You want to add the butter in slow increments,
about 2 tablespoons at a time.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.480
You want the butter to be soft but not melted.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.140
So once you've added all the butter, you want
to turn the meringue back up to a pretty high

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.140
speed.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.409
You want to let everything incorporate in
it for about 2 minutes.

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.109
So once your mixture looks light and fluffy,
you want to take the last step which will

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.530
be to add a tablespoon of vanilla extract.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.170
These are real stuff; I wouldn't recommend
using imitational extract.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.650
And then you're going to turn it back on to
high speed.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.790
So now we're having our Italian meringue base,
we're going to be adding chocolate to it.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.249
Now I have 5 ounces of chocolate measured
out right here.

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:00.239
You can either boil it down on a double boiler
or you can just put it in the microwave as

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.379
long as you are using a microwave safe bowl.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:13.099
So now that our chocolate has melted, we're
going to turn our mixer on low and start pouring

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.099
it in.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.489
You want to do it fully because the chocolate's
hard so you want to kind of temper the frosting.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:26.329
Now that all the chocolate has been put in,
you can turn back the mixer to medium high.

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:35.249
So once all the chocolate is incorporated,
you can since this is chocolate added to , it

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.930
is not a super-rich fudgy chocolaty flavor.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.169
We think that because this is a nicely sort
of whipped flavor, it can complement any flavor

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.369
of cupcake very well.
