00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.609
osteoarthritis is a huge problem around the
world and in the united states today

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.900
it's a disease affecting the cartilage of the
joint issue

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.640
it affects over twenty-one million adults

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.920
once the joint issue

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.679
is damaged it doesn't have the ability to
repair itself

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.450
and the articular cartilage is 
important because it allows the joints

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.130
to absorb shock and also to rotate and glide 
smoothly against each other

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.459
because there is no treatment today

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:44.460
there's an urgent need for a therapy

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.690
this is where

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.410
our cells come into the picture

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.250
we're able to generate

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.350
cartilage cells

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.780
from human embryonic stem cells which may
be suitable for repair of damaged

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.240
articular cartilage in osteoarthritis

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.060
it all starts here in the lab

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.330
the human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent
stem cells that we use in

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.610
our studies they're stored in a tank of
liquid nitrogen

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.930
in the tissue culture room the cells are
maintained in an incubator these are carefully

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.329
controlled conditions

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.270
which will allow them to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.959
proliferate and again under the conditions
that we have established, begin to

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:25.850
differentiate into cartilage cells

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.150
everyday we take the cells out of the incubator

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.170
and we look at them under the microscope
to be sure that they're still growing

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.820
properly

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.590
after the cells have been cultured for a
period of time we confirm that they've

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.350
appropriately differentiated what we're
able to do is mimic these 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.420
conditions

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.790
in-vitro in a culture dish and staining them

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.860
with chemicals which will detect their
cartilage genes

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.270
in order to test the cells we need to
develop animal models

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.010
as well as methods and approaches for
introducing the cells into the joint

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.940
accordingly the university has filed a
patent

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.480
for this technology

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.710
because they saw the potential for
commercialization

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.479
commercialization is the most efficient
way

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.200
to get long-term

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.579
usage of that research it's very
rewarding for the faculty

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.150
it's a return on investment to the state

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.469
and it's actually fun

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.839
it's new and it's different through partnership
with university of connecticut research

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:27.489
and development corporation a company
named chondrogenics has been formed

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.659
it's the first

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.400
biotechnology company to develop out of
the state of connecticut stem cell

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.629
initiative chondrogenics has just received a 
significant grant in which we will test

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:38.719
whether or not

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.699
these cells can really repair damaged
articular cartilage

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:46.670
there's a long way to go still we're 
really at the very initial stages

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.730
and very much in the research which is
necessary to establish that their safe

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.359
and that they're going to be a feasible
treatment for osteoarthritis in the

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:55.609
future
