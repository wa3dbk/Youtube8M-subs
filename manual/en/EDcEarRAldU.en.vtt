00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.090
Are you having fun?

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.700
Yes~

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.770
Really ..

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.300
We sang and danced breathlessly over the concert time,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.880
but there still another two songs.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.970
To be honest,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.110
Holding the concert in this large scale stadium,

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.250
made us tremble and worry a lot.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.900
There were a lot of mistakes and insufficiency,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.480
but we sang,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.850
danced, and cheered together
without missing one song till the end,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.320
which I'm so grateful for.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.820
Really..

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.580
god are still practicing hard till now.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.290
Our bodies and minds are tired
because of the successive performances,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.460
but thanks to your supporting,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.330
we were able to finish the concert till the end.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.500
I've always wanted to tell you this,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.970
Thank you really,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.440
for giving god all this support.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.320
and I hope you will always remember,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.780
this very memorable and enjoyable concert
that passed safely without any accidents.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.330
That was Tae-woo.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.050
This is Danny.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.700
As everybody here saw before,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.940
I shaved my hair.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.690
The reason why I did that,

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.340
was only one thing.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.600
It's to show you how I believe in you.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.520
It was a really difficult decision.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.360
I wanted to show my faith in you
by all means in this concert,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.320
so I shaved my hair.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.720
The faith that I was always talking about.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.550
Now it's time,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.130
for you to show your faith in us.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.420
There are a lot to talk about
and a lot happened in our Seoul concert,

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.690
we faced a lot of burdens,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.650
and a lot of fails too,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.500
which I hope you would understand.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.960
From now on we will keep more advanced and reliable.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.870
We will always be the awesome god,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.510
that you won't regret being a fan of.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.280
Thank you.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.690
Yes.
Everybody, it's Ho-young.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.430
It was trembling,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.890
to stand on the biggest stage in South Korea,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.500
and holding a god only concert,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.020
we were really scared and shaking
before going on the stage,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.310
but thanks to you, all that disappeared.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.310
You looked really beautiful.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.170
For your sake,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.060
I will pay respects.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.150
Thank you, everybody.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.200
That's what I was planning to do.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.500
It's Kye-sang.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.290
First,

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.510
I want to express my sincere appreciation.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.390
I'm really not alone now,

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.230
is exactly what I felt.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.740
I will do my best from now on,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.320
and as much as you believed in us
we will believe in you too.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.980
I will always treasure,

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.040
these most unforgettable memories,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.020
that could be,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.650
between a singer and his fans, his family.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.000
I wish that we won't ever change,

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.960
and always be together.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.050
Thank you

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.590
Hello~

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.320
Wow!

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.680
For me, we really,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.520
When we first created our group,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.300
we didn't even dream that fellows like us would be ,

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.790
standing on this stage.
Really..

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.420
In case,

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.650
these guys' appearances ever changed,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.780
be sure of just one thing,

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.570
I and theses guys' hearts,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.150
will stay the same as the first stage we ever went up.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.020
Thank you.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.020
Thank you, everybody.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.760
This is the last part.
Start the music please.
