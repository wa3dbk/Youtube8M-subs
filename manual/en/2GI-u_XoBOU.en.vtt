The Forest and Natural Resource
Management major is really designed to

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.480
train students who are interested in
working in forested ecosystems, whether

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.120
they're managed for timber production,
whether they're managed for the

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.940
ecosystem services like watershed
protection, whether they're protected and

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.519
used for recreational resources or
whether they occur in our urban systems.

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.750
My favorite part of the program I think
is the small community feel where you really

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.170
get to know our professors really well.
Our department head almost knows all the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.949
students and it's just really fun to be
able to feel really comfortable asking

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.839
questions and getting involved. There's a
wide variety of information that's

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.069
covered in this program but you can
really also hone in on things that you

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:56.640
enjoy most or really want to become
involved in. Some of the courses are

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.069
really hands-on, really awesome and the
faculty just make that ten times better.

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:05.880
You get a lot of opportunities for
connections and meeting people. You get to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.780
grow in your career like as an
undergraduate and they help you advance

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.770
so you're just ready to go when you
leave. I decided on this major because I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.000
wanted to work in a field
someday that would work with how people

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.550
and the environment interact so really
focusing on the science aspects of the

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.880
environment, really learning about how
the environment functions as well as

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.740
trees and then also working with people
and understanding how they interact with

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.860
the environment. The field sessions
are really hands-on you get to use a lot

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.540
of tools that you would be using as a
professional so it's a good way to learn

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.020
about what are your going to be doing
and practice those skills. You know when

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.380
you're sitting in a classroom and you're
looking at pictures projected up on a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.330
wall and you're hearing someone talk
about some concept, it's not quite the

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.070
same as going out there, seeing and
touching and smelling and experiencing

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.850
it firsthand. The U of M is a huge school
with a lot of connections and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.300
opportunities which is great because it
lets you grow and you lets you explore.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.650
Saint Paul campus is very small and very
homey feeling. I love that you can see

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.979
people you know all the time around.
Everyone's really nice to each other and

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.330
willing to help you, so it's just great and it
feels really personal. I think it's a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.080
really great feeling where I feel like
the faculty are not only my teachers but

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.280
really a good support system to have. They are just
always there for you. They've got a lot

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.580
of background knowledge, they've got a
lot of resources available at their

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.959
disposal and they're very personable.
I really think forestry is a really

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.440
well-rounded degree and I would
definitely recommend it to anyone

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.220
interested in natural resources. No
matter what you want to do, you can do

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.690
it with this major, whether it be a
forester or a park ranger, environmentalist,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.950
this major is the all-around major.
Anybody who really has a love for the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.350
outdoors is gonna be able to find
something you love here.
