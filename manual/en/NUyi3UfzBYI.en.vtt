00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
Bowel Wars: Hydrogen Sulfide vs. Butyrate

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.049
There's a take-off of the industry slogan
"Beef: It's What's For Dinner" ---

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.230
"Beef: It's What's Rotting in Your Colon."

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.430
I saw this on a shirt
once with some friends

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.539
and I was such the party pooper
-- no pun intended --

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.550
explaining to everyone how meat

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.230
is fully digested in
the small intestine,

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.109
and never makes it
down into the colon.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.419
No fun hanging out with biology
geeks --- but I was wrong!

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.480
It's been estimated that
with a typical Western diet,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.500
up to 12 grams of protein
per day can escape digestion,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.000
and when it reaches the colon

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.940
it can be turned into toxic
substances like ammonia.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.920
This degradation of undigested protein
in the colon is called putrefaction,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.789
so a little meat can actually
end up putrefying in our colon.

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.969
The problem is that some of the by-products
of this putrefaction can be toxic.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.430
It's generally accepted that
carbohydrate fermentation

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.059
- the fiber and resistant starches
that reach our colon -

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.420
results in beneficial
effects for the host

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.200
because of the generation of short
chain fatty acids like butyrate,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.310
whereas protein fermentation
is considered detrimental for us.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.799
Protein fermentation mainly
occurs in the lower end of colon,

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.640
when carbohydrates get depleted

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.420
and results in the production
of potentially toxic metabolites.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.770
Perhaps that's why we
see more colorectal cancer

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.180
and ulcerative colitis
lower down,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.799
because that's where
the protein is putrefying.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.790
The most simple strategy
to reduce the degree

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.680
of potentially harmful compounds
by protein fermentation

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.110
is probably a reduction
in dietary protein intake.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.640
But the accumulation of these harmful
by-products of protein metabolism

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.640
may be attenuated by the fermentation
of undigested plant matter.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.649
This study showed that if you give people
foods containing resistant starch

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.869
-- that means starch resistant
to small intestine digestion

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.930
so it can feed our good
bacteria down in our colon;

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.140
foods such as cooked beans, peas,
lentils, raw oatmeal, cold pasta --

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.549
you can block the accumulation 
of these potentially

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.090
harmful byproducts
of protein metabolism.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.510
The more starch ending up in the
stool, the less ammonia, for example.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.170
But there's protein in plants, too.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.030
The difference is that
animal proteins tend to have

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.510
more sulfur-containing amino acids

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.510
like methionine that can be turned
into hydrogen sulfide in our colon,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.030
the rotten egg gas that may
play a role in the development

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.760
of the inflammatory bowel diseases

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.950
like ulcerative colitis
as I've covered previously.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.260
The toxic effects of hydrogen
sulfide appear to be mediated

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.819
through blocking the ability
of our colon cells to utilize butyrate,

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.010
which is what our good bacteria
make from the fiber we eat.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.379
So it's like this constant
battle in our colon

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.050
between the bad metabolites
of protein, hydrogen sulfide,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.680
and the good metabolites
of carbohydrates, butyrate.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.890
Using human colon samples
they were able to show

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.629
that the adverse effects of sulfide
could be reversed by butyrate.

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.870
So we can either cut down on
meat, eat more plants, or both.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.430
But there's two ways hydrogen
sulfide can be produced.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.090
Though it's mainly present
in our large intestine

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.519
as a result of the breakdown
of these sulfur-containing proteins,

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.500
rotten egg gas can also be generated

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.060
from inorganic sulfur preservatives
like sulfites and sulfur dioxide.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.690
Sulfur dioxide is used
as a preservative in dried fruit,

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.480
and sulfites are added to wine.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.159
We can avoid sulfur additives by reading
labels or by just choosing organic,

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.930
since by law they're forbidden
from organic fruits and beverages.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.569
Now cabbage family vegetables
naturally have some sulfur compounds,

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.970
but thankfully, after following more
than a 100,000 women for over 25 years,

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.739
cruciferous vegetables were NOT
associated with elevated colitis risk.

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.860
But because of the animal protein
and preservative laden processed foods,

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.379
the standard American diet may
have five or six times more sulfur

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.590
than a diet centered around
unprocessed plant foods,

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.480
which may help explain the rarity
of inflammatory bowel disease

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.340
among those eating traditional
whole food plant-based diets.
