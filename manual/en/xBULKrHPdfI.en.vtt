Hi and welcome to AC News!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here’s today’s video clip, movie news are coming up!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Ruby Sparks is a creative love story centered on the myth of the girl of one's dreams.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The movie is directed by the couple Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
directors of Little Miss Sunshine.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Also the two leading actors, Zoe Kazan and Paul Dano,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
are like the directors a couple in the real life.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Paul Dano plays a young writer who became famous early,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but he has to face problems of the real life and is quite lonely.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So he finds a creative solution and invents a character, Ruby Sparks,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
who comes to life and falls in love with him.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Zoe Kazan is his muse. Also starring Antonio Banderas and Annette Bening.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The two directors have already demonstrated their ability to treat love issues

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
with humor and a little bit of melancholy at the same.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
We expect the movie to be more clever and sophisticated than the usual romantic comedies.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
That’s all for today, see you next time!
