[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.680
Getting ready for Tough Mudder,
I start up this great hill.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.771
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.470
By that time in the run, the
daily grind has faded away.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.510
Nothing else exists.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.130
It's just that moment.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.610
So much of our lives are
focused on dwelling on yesterday

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.810
and what just happened, and so little
of our lives are spent right now.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.960
It's a really beautiful place to be.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.200
I run down there at
Churchill Road, which

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.070
is the main street, right into
the small part of Newtown,

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.780
that's the village that
they call Sandy Hook.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.220
The hard part of the run is
running past the firehouse

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.700
that we were all in when we learned that
our kids were murdered in the school.

00:00:53.027 --> 00:00:54.860
And if you look on the
top of that building,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.910
there's 26 stars, six large
ones and 20 small ones.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.730
Avielle, she was six years old when she
was killed in her first grade classroom

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.960
with 19 of her friends
and six of her educators.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.190
She was a goofy, fun-loving kid.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.770
She loved stories.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.330
She wanted stories in the car,
going to bed, in the morning.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.770
Wherever we were doing it, it was
tell me a story, tell me a story.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.340
You know, she was creating her
story and making it a colorful.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.940
She was just a real fun kid.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.780
Jennifer and I are scientists, and so
we speak a language of whys and hows.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.710
Immediately, we said,
why did this happen?

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.010
How can we stop it from happening again?

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.730
I said to Jen, this is something
that we should be able to solve.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.730
And she loved that idea.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.612
And from that we formed
the Avielle Foundation.

00:01:59.612 --> 00:02:01.320
We built a large
community of people that

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.520
wanted to help us raise funds and
give exposure to the foundation.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.980
And one of those people
said, hey, you got

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.000
to run this Tough Mudder event
with me, and we'll create a team,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.127
and we could call it Mud for Brains.

00:02:13.127 --> 00:02:16.370
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.880
Coming together as a team, a community
with a common vision of overcoming

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.540
something that seems so
large, a real crucible,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.784
and you're going to be
changed when it's over.

00:02:27.784 --> 00:02:28.950
All right, let's partner up.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.400
Cross hook.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.991
That's it.

00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:32.490
Good.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.250
Everybody has to face
serious challenges,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.900
and we're all better off if we can
come together and face them eye to eye

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.470
and challenge ourselves to be better
tomorrow than we were yesterday.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.851
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:50.600
You're going to move forward or
you're going to move backwards.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.540
And for Jennifer and I, it was
definitely trying to help others

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.690
and challenging us to find a
way to give back to the world.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.036
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:04.904 --> 00:03:08.710
I'm Jeremy Richman,
and I'm a Tough Mudder.
