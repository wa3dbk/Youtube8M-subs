How to Avoid Red Eye in Photos.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.959
Learn a few red-eye reduction tricks and you
can proudly display family photos instead

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:11.959
of hiding them away.

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:18.410
You will need Camera External flash and photo-editing
software.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.420
Step 1.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.060
Turn off your camera's automatic flash to
eliminate red eye.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.680
To compensate for the loss of light, go outside,
turn on lights in the room, or use a slower

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.329
shutter speed or camera setting that is intended
for low-light photography.

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.329
Step 2.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.239
If you need to use flash, turn on the anti
red-eye feature on your camera if it has one.

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.550
Look for an image of an eye among the flash
settings, or consult your camera's instruction

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.300
booklet to find the setting.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.809
The short flashes of light cause pupils to
constrict and diminish the red-eye effect.

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.469
Have your photo subjects look directly at
a light right before posing for the picture

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.600
if you do not have an anti red-eye setting.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.519
Step 3.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.390
Instruct your subjects to look slightly to
the side of the camera lens.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.030
Looking to the side changes the angle of light
that your retinas reflect and can reduce red

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.030
eye.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.620
Step 4.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.630
Mount an external flash to your camera using
a bracket that sets the flash off to one side.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.850
This technique changes the angle of reflected
light and minimizes red eye.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.659
Place a thin white cloth over your camera's
flash if you can't use an external flash.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.520
The cloth diffuses the light before it gets
to your subject's eyes, which decreases red-eye

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.520
problems.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.020
Step 5.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.600
Once you've taken the picture, remove red
eye with basic photo-editing software included

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.259
with your computer or with a more expensive,
professional program.

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.880
If you have the time and skill to edit photos,
you can get rid of most blemishes with no

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.880
problem!

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.210
Did you know Although singer David Bowie looks
like he has a brown eye and a blue eye, he

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.870
actually has an enlarged pupil in one eye,
making it appear as though his eyes are 2

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.299
different colors.
