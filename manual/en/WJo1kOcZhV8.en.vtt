00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:05.999
This is a true story. 
It happened to a friend of a friend of mine

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.333
Jonah was a sandlot slugger. 

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.333
He was the best player in 
our neighborhood little league.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.333
Which is a good thing, 
because he lived for the sport.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.570
I mean really lived for it.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.933
Day in, day out he ate, breathed, slept. 
He even drank baseball.

00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:25.867
There was nothing he'd rather do
 in his whole life than play a game of baseball. 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.999
Which was a good thing too, because his team was 
headed straight for the inter-league championship. 

00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:35.366
And the great thing was, 
Jonah's parents couldn't have been happier. 

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:36.999
He'd never seen them more excited.

00:00:37.378 --> 00:00:39.967
Heck, they were even more excited 
about it than he was.

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:45.658
Neither parent resembled how dedicated and containers
 that were the mother and father of Jonah.

00:00:45.658 --> 00:00:48.215
So, it was the week before the big game. 

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:51.847
Jonah had gone to bed early because 
there was a practice in the morning.

00:00:51.847 --> 00:00:58.124
But in the middle of the night Jonah 
woke to the sound of strange noises.

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:01.889
He followed the noise, 
tiptoeing down the stairs and into the basement. 

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:06.301
That's when saw something 
he'd never noticed before.

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:10.791
A light, a kind of spectral and scary light.

00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:15.961
He could see lights through the hundreds of tiny 
holes in the walls of dad's workshop. 

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:17.999
There was a room back there.

00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:20.666
A secret room that Jonah had never seen. 

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:24.210
- and Mom and Dad were back there -

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.157
A secret room?
Why they wouldn't told to him?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.506
He tried to get a peek but there was something
 on the other side of the wall, blocking his view. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.304
Whatever was going on - 
his folks were real serious about it.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.119
So the next day, 
when his parents were at work 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.523
Jonah snuck down the stairs to the basement. 

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:50.800
All he had to do was find the door to the secret room. 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.463
He poked around Dad's workbench,
 there must be a hidden lever 

00:01:55.463 --> 00:01:56.676
- just like on TV. 

00:01:56.676 --> 00:02:00.266
He tried turning things, 
pressing secret buttons under the bench

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.467
but nope.

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:04.584
Jonah headed up the stairs and 
stopped to turn out the light. 

00:02:04.584 --> 00:02:09.221
That's when he noticed his old T-ball
 plaque was crooked.

00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:14.000
He leaned over, straightened it, 
But then... He heard a creaking sound.

00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:16.467
He turned around - 
just in time to see: 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.472
a door swing open. 

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.333
A secret door!

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:25.700
And behind it was a secret workshop. 

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:31.850
It was a long, low room,
 filled with workbenches and shiny machines. 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.159
There were drill presses, 
computers and all kinds of stuff.

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.602
It remembered to him a Frankestein 
movie that he saw on T.V.

00:02:39.602 --> 00:02:42.355
And Trophies! 
But whose was it?

00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:45.815
Jonah had no idea that his
 Dad had ever won anything.

00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:48.996
He was supposed to be 
the Champion of the family.

00:02:48.996 --> 00:02:55.295
But sitting there before him was an entire display case 
practically stuffed with silver trophies and things. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.967
He kept exploring 

00:02:58.967 --> 00:03:02.186
Then he turned the corner - and saw them...

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.803
Robots!

00:03:04.803 --> 00:03:07.216
 - all lined up in a glass case against the wall -

00:03:07.216 --> 00:03:10.200
The first one was the Mark I.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.824
It looked like a robot from a Science Fiction movie -

00:03:12.824 --> 00:03:15.433
But some of it's wiring had been ripped out... 

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:20.171
The Mark II was better.
Not truly human, but more similar.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.760
 It looked - kind of like a doll. 

00:03:22.985 --> 00:03:25.405
Jonah opened the case and poked at it. 

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:29.881
It had a hard plastic skin and hair.
 But it's wiring was gone, too

00:03:29.881 --> 00:03:32.110
The Mark III: This was even better. 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.500
It had a rubber skin and all.

00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:38.934
But for some strange reason it had
 the same wiring problem

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:44.417
There was an empty space
 where the next robot should be.

00:03:44.417 --> 00:03:49.660
But, the robot - I guess it was the Mark IV
 - was missing

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.695
Jonah went to the workbench. 
There was something under a sheet. 

00:03:54.667 --> 00:04:00.000
Jonah switched on the light. 
The plans read, "Mark V". 

00:04:00.127 --> 00:04:03.600
He pulled back the sheet. 

00:04:04.214 --> 00:04:08.000
The Mark V robot looked just like him. 

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:11.330
It even had the same freckles...

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:14.858
There were a few parts lyin' around. 

00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:16.288
It was almost finished... 

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:19.886
And that's when Jonah realized
 that he was the Mark IV robot 

00:04:19.886 --> 00:04:21.700
- and the Mark V was his replacement! 

00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:23.275
A Baseball Playing,

00:04:23.275 --> 00:04:25.100
Championship - Winning Robot!

00:04:26.102 --> 00:04:28.343
Hey! It's a true story. 

00:04:28.343 --> 00:04:30.765
It happened to a friend of a friend of mine. 

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:35.815
Yeah, he practice baseball each time that he can

00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:37.901
and he still practices baseball all day 

00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:39.516
- but at night -

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
he practices

00:04:41.166 --> 00:04:43.967
Sabotage.
