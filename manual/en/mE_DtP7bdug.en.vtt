00:00:03.365 --> 00:00:06.246
everybody will matter the frugal
filmmaker in today wanna talk about C

00:00:06.246 --> 00:00:08.296
stands or century stands and

00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:12.456
with that is a basic group equipment if
I know any professional film set

00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:16.556
if I seen you before the scan a large
black stand with twenty feet on the

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:17.216
bottom

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:21.606
and their we're Armco another top
attached a kind of weird ball type thing

00:00:21.606 --> 00:00:23.286
that can hold another armed

00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:27.245
do all kinds of weird stuff and you see
a wholly everything on a film set for

00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:29.606
backdrops the lights to light modifiers

00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:33.386
very handy in everybody loves them but
they do have some drawbacks if you're

00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:35.326
like me and my her budget film world

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:39.576
and one of them has cost the run for
about 150 to 200 bucks

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:44.216
not cheap and if you're trying to fill
these things in your car you know how

00:00:44.216 --> 00:00:48.636
big unwieldy in heavy they are they
disarm aidid fit into a car

00:00:48.636 --> 00:00:52.446
consumer right drive opposed to somebody
who works on a film set

00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:55.766
for hollywood and raisa grip truck with
easy put into a truck

00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:59.266
you go to a truck licking their career
problem so what do we do if you want to

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.726
use this type of equipment

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:05.036
care for it okay see me now realize it
but there's already a piece if you're

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:09.436
out there that can be used as a ceased
and release a similar manner and that is

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:10.036
this

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:13.716
this is a microphone boost and
essentially it's a mic stand comes up

00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:14.396
from the ground

00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:19.326
street like normal but their brooms of
and does other cool things like this

00:01:19.326 --> 00:01:22.706
holding a microphone that's exactly was
designed for and

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:26.475
this as a application in the film world
as well it's a are understaffed don't

00:01:26.475 --> 00:01:27.585
have a boom operator

00:01:27.585 --> 00:01:31.786
and we're doing close-ups or static
shots you can now have a pearl boom

00:01:31.786 --> 00:01:34.006
operator right here that will hold your
microphone

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:38.335
over your talent and the fact that it's
a boom arm is great because then you can

00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:41.835
hold your shotgun mic in the proper
position which is over the top player

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:42.926
actors mouth

00:01:42.926 --> 00:01:47.625
and this will raise up and down you can
put out a frame

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:51.765
just everything to say it like it

00:01:51.765 --> 00:01:55.545
and it's great and I think you can use
this for

00:01:55.545 --> 00:01:59.136
is if you're doing an interview it's a
you don't want your

00:01:59.136 --> 00:02:03.136
people you're interviewing two were love
my ex like this because love my ex can

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:06.335
have problems with clothing noise or
maybe he were interviewing

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:09.166
it's the microphone like so because they
don't know they're wearing one right

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:09.996
used to it

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:14.836
%uh you can make them with the
microphone boom stand in shock and likes

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:17.746
all the lights over the top with them
again aimed at their mouth like you're

00:02:17.746 --> 00:02:18.565
supposed to

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:23.416
and I will make all the noise problems
and also will never in a million years

00:02:23.416 --> 00:02:26.266
you know hit that Mike from a bow their
head opposed to being on their bodies

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:29.716
another thing you should do if you get
one of these is to buy the successor Ian

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:30.576
this is a

00:02:30.576 --> 00:02:36.216
mic stand to quarter inch adapter and
you just screw that run to use standard

00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:37.656
mic stand thread

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:43.556
and now you've gotta a quarter inch male
thread the interview rice in here which

00:02:43.556 --> 00:02:47.985
opens up a world accessories since
that's a universal size universal thread

00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:52.446
are kinda stuff that's on it I'm gonna
put this on it first this is Sourav

00:02:52.446 --> 00:02:56.815
lighting stood with her progress thread
on one side 3/8

00:02:56.815 --> 00:03:00.696
inch three on the other and now he wanna
put a light on their

00:03:00.696 --> 00:03:04.546
I can however I don't really have any
standard whites as you probably know or

00:03:04.546 --> 00:03:05.416
so

00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:08.595
this is also available for hanging stuff
such as this

00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:11.906
this is a China ball or a paper lantern

00:03:11.906 --> 00:03:15.006
big go over here we go with this is you

00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:19.526
take a socket light like this and pretty
bright

00:03:19.526 --> 00:03:23.746
put it inside at the China role here in
this axis diffusion in create some cheap

00:03:23.746 --> 00:03:24.716
soft white

00:03:24.716 --> 00:03:28.546
have a very old trick but it's a good
one and

00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:32.425
a tricky part about this however is how
do you hang me the deceased ANSI

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:35.076
standard refrain China balls with you
don't have one

00:03:35.076 --> 00:03:38.705
or if you tried using the BBC licence
has worked well for you

00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:43.515
because there is tricky unstable you can
use this you can use the form in C stamp

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:47.375
with the sunny and raised here there you
go it's a great way to hang

00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:51.826
China ball now one caveat about this of
course is that your uses before you know

00:03:51.826 --> 00:03:54.616
that these have to hang straight down
especially for using a higher

00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:56.826
incandescent ball because it's that ball

00:03:56.826 --> 00:04:01.235
he gets too hot and touches the side in
this paper lantern the whole thing will

00:04:01.235 --> 00:04:03.595
burst into flame there is room issue
right there

00:04:03.595 --> 00:04:06.836
so make sure these are hanging straight
down

00:04:06.836 --> 00:04:10.836
now with these are the form in C++
standards extensions tall as a full

00:04:10.836 --> 00:04:14.866
rate real ceased and so this is probably
best in serious situations

00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:18.955
the best use a thing for this thing is
to mount these this is a

00:04:18.955 --> 00:04:23.436
LED light is my photo dr. silly Dida
there if you are back

00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:27.926
and as you know also these lights have a
corridor through the bottom so go ahead

00:04:27.926 --> 00:04:28.956
and mouth this

00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:32.195
right to this adapter for excellent a
cheap ceased

00:04:32.195 --> 00:04:36.635
her light stand about what if I add this
many ball head to

00:04:36.635 --> 00:04:40.906
the adapter like so

00:04:40.906 --> 00:04:47.906
and then add LED lights

00:04:48.866 --> 00:04:52.836
now I have no idea why they can move in
all kinds of positions because the

00:04:52.836 --> 00:04:54.996
flexibility this many ball head

00:04:54.996 --> 00:04:58.605
in the arm that can move up and down and
sideways and backwards and all that

00:04:58.605 --> 00:04:59.466
stuff

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:02.975
and I can do all kinds of stuff like
suppose they wanted to top white

00:05:02.975 --> 00:05:03.836
somebody

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:07.635
have a light from above I can do with
the setup or so on under light somebody

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:09.255
would you could do that with the normal

00:05:09.255 --> 00:05:12.725
light stand but you can you top
plaything least not usually

00:05:12.725 --> 00:05:17.036
showing the stay in the frame so that's
a badass just the

00:05:17.036 --> 00:05:20.255
three things I can show you right now
that I've done with this poor man's

00:05:20.255 --> 00:05:22.066
ceased and if you will

00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:25.846
and it's not too bad the price is this
is about twenty dollars on e-bay which

00:05:25.846 --> 00:05:28.926
is about the same price is a normal
inexpensive waste and

00:05:28.926 --> 00:05:32.066
but this is way more flexible in my
opinion a

00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:35.556
and I think they hear you guys are done
with this series before we've got some

00:05:35.556 --> 00:05:38.306
ideas in a share those ideas in the
comments below

00:05:38.306 --> 00:05:41.786
as always everything you see in this
video I will have a link

00:05:41.786 --> 00:05:45.706
to in the description below in this has
been a proven record to the month

00:05:45.706 --> 00:05:52.406
the

00:05:52.406 --> 00:05:56.046
the

00:05:56.046 --> 00:05:56.866
the

00:05:56.866 --> 00:05:57.116
and
