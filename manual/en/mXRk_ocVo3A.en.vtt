00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.240
Sam had just told me she has extensions in; you guys already know...

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.240
Ok, when you have extension and your
blond or black hair

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.740
 Sam just told me that she has extensions in; you guys already  know...

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.609
The disconnect lines they all show
up, so, OK 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.710
when you're done cutting blow dry and what not

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.060
you want to give them...you want to kind of make  sure that this

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.240
flows so she feels only what can make this flow

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.360
better okay is to make this

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.820
be more seamless to her extension you
can"t do that by cutting

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.920
I tried it all I did, all I did

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.610
was: made it shorter okay: it's even disconnected for my   middle hair 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.910
 like this part over here, because my real hair goes down to here

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.399
oh here it is right here: it's even disconnected right there

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.629
All here, guys, what would you do here? we got balk! Soften it.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.260
Right.  If you want to cut it all, I'll take them out!

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.040
Oh, it's Ok.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.659
so we want to make sure again,

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.570
 we are going to cross over, it's very simple

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.080
you get to see this so much better because she has long hair

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.080
over direct you see all that

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.880
how do you determine how far down to
keep your fingers at this moment

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.030
the weight you can see the weight: 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.039
here is very light here is very thick!

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.619
 so when I am holding it, I am only cutting the top 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.299
because I am over directing so as she

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.450
not cutting the length  here that's back here on the back

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.280
so you're just cutting the front and as
I'm doing it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.689
I cut  enough of it then I am going up
just enough

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:02.689
the clean up those ends: Edward Scissorhands: 
you can do it faster if you wanted

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.360
Just doing that

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.950
I see a okay see how skinny

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.900
her corners got, just doing that one
section so you don't have to

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.890
a lot like of dry cutting to blend hair cuts Fix your mistakes 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.980
or fix other people's mistakes that's
even better OK

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.630
(From the audience): I am a hairstylist

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.150
And I want to cut your hair.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.560
So again, there's the go, there is the weight the thin spot's on top

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.070
all I am doing is point cutting those on the
bottom

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.180
towards me over directed and then

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.440
I'm sliding it up a little bit at a time
and I might clean up those ends... 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.610
(audience: are you not closing and opening your scissors?) it's up to you

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.670
it's like playing guitar okay you don't have to

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.390
stroke it same way you have your own
style the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.710
you just point open it do this

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.890
you don't have to open/close your scissorsyou should be

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.420
they are sharp

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.690
Ok see this side? 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.250
so  you don't have to spend a lot of
time

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.780
fixing haircuts especially that okay

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.060
now you can see that we can do a little bit of more work on this one

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.090
so it's visual! Visualize

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.090
everything guys

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.019
that's it!

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:48.980
that little guy

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.879
was given her a hard time

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.760
it was, wasn't it? and now

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.530
the way it blends you wan't even know where extensions

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:10.519
was in your hair right?  that's good to know because

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.079
I liked to do extensions. Yeah, anytime you cut extension you wanna do a dry cut

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.079
you don't wanna cut extension wet

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.079
you gonna mess it up

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:29.079
let me see 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.520
usually I have them sawn in , I have clipped them temporarily, so..
