00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.590
Dell recommends keeping your system
setup, or BIOS,

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.120
up-to-date.  We will go through a few simple
steps to do this.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.309
Before you start check the current
version of the system setup.

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.109
You can check this either from the
system setup or in the MSINFO32 utility.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.869
 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.570
To check using the system setup,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.890
power on your computer and tap the F2 at the Dell splash screen.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.699
You'll find the version next  to the BIOS revision.

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.789
To check the setup version from within Windows

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.020
Go to the start screen and type MSINFO32

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.280
 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.480
Click MSINFO32 and the system information
window will open.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.129
You can find the Senate version next to
BIOS version/date.

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.820
To download the latest version
of system setup

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.180

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.480

Select the category dropdown and choose
BIOS.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.270
 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.390
Click download file and save the file on
your desktop.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.530
Ensure you do not power of your
system during the update

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.200
as this may make the system
non-functional

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.450
If you're running the update on a portable

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.970
ensure that the AC adapter is connected
to the wall outlet

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.200
Save and close all applications,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.900
then double click the file you downloaded on the desktop.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.490
Follow the on-screen instructions
to complete the system setup update.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.670
Your system will automatically restart,
run the update

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.810
and then boot back to Windows.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.330
To confirm the update go to the system
setup or MSINFO32 utility.
