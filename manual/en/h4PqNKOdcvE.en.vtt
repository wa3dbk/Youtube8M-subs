Hi, I'm Mark Emiley on behalf of Expert Village.
In this segment we are going to talk about

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.320
the equipment you are going to need to brew.
First, we are going to start with the most

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.121
basic equipment that you are going to need
that should be around in your house already.

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:16.720
You are going to need a large pot; up to five
gallons is good, but bigger than two gallons

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.850
is definitely recommended. The larger of a
pot you are going to get, the lower your chances

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.210
of having a boil over. Next you are going
to need some sort of a spoon to stir up your

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.850
mash. You can do plastic, you can do wood,
but if you are going to do wood, just make

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.250
sure you don't leave it in the brew. It can
also be metal, obviously. And finally, you

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.350
should have some sort of measuring cup for
doing some different measurements. Now we

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.380
are going to talk about the equipment that
you are going to need to purchase from your

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.760
brewing supply store. First, you are going
to need a fermenter. This is the most basic

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.879
one you can get, which is a seven gallon bucket
with a lid that fits nice and tightly. On

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.990
that lid there is going to be a hole that
is drilled in it. You are going to need a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.380
stopper, a rubber stopper that will fit in
that hole and an air lock for going in that

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.569
stopper. You're also going to need a bottling
bucket which is roughly the same thing except

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:13.060
it has a spigot at the bottom. You're going
to need to get roughly sixty bottles of the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.750
twelve-ounce bottles or forty sixteen-ounce
bottles to bottle your beer in. You are going

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.619
to need to focus on that they need to be pop-off
tops, not screw-off tops. You are also going

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:31.079
to need to purchase some bottle caps, and
a bottle capper. You're also going to need

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.009
to pick up a muslin sack or several of these
depending on how many hop additions you are

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.450
going to have in the grains that you are going
to use. You are going to need some kind of

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.450
a sterilizer and sanitizer and we'll talk
more about this later. Along with your bottling

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.299
bucket, you are going to need a bottle filler.
This can also be used to take samples from

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.890
your beer. You are going to need a notebook
to write down your recipes and different measurements

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.509
that you take during the process. You are
going to need a racking cane as well as about

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.059
six feet of hose as well to do your siphoning
operations. Most basic packages can run about

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:10.700
fifty bucks. If you are willing to spend a
little bit more, they may be up to a hundred

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.280
bucks. And next we are going to talk about
some of the different equipment you can spend

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.550
a little more money on.
