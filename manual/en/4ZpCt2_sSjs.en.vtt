00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.600
So guys, we've make it through our workout
congratulations, way to go. Thanks a lot for

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.559
joining me for this and now before we depart
I want to give you some homework. It's called

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.660
cardio homework. The reason why I prescribe
this homework for you is because I want you

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.779
to start to develop some stamina. If you develop
some stamina it will help your body get conditioned

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.910
and allow you to come back to the gym more
often. The more you come back the stronger

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.399
you'll get and the more changes you'll have
in your body. If you remember at the beginning

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:41.610
of today's episode we visited the cardio warm
up and the machines to go along with it. The

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.100
bike, the stair master and the cross trainer
or pre-core, now I would like for you to go

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:56.079
revisit them again. At least once during this
week if not try for twice and all I want you

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:04.360
to do is to get on those for about 15 minutes.
If you could go longer that's better, but

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.520
don't worry about going too far unless you've
already been working out on cardio machines

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:17.320
before. Also on these machines what I want
you to pay attention to is your posture and

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.930
also your heart rate. To help build up stamina
and help to build an aerobic phase that will

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.470
give your body more opportunity to be efficient
with consuming oxygen, which will also burn

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.229
fat and help rejuvenate your body. I want
you to work with a low intensity heart rate

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:47.841
zone. A rough estimate would be anywhere from
105 to 135 beats per minute. There will be

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:53.140
codes on the machines that will help you find
out what is your optimal heart rate for burning

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:01.380
rate. Also I would like to take this moment
to stress to you how important drinking water

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.920
is while you're doing weights. Every muscle
contraction you have uses water, so be sure

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.280
to drink plenty of water throughout the day.
The golden rule is if you're thirsty drink

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.220
water. So once again thanks a lot of joining
me here on personal training for the average

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.070
guy here on expertvillage.com. I'm Mike Rosengart
your host signing off and hope to see you

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.849
back next week.
