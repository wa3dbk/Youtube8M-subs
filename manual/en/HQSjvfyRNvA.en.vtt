Hello there I had been sitting and thinking about which story I should tell you today

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
oh great I hope it's another story about the brave David

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
yes it is but you have to listen carefully because

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I will ask a question at the end of the story

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we always do wholly or right that

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
This story is about a young man David going into hiding

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
David's a young boy was chosen by the Lord to be the next king of Israel

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
after King Saul.  Saul loved David and had made him the commander in the army

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
he was brave handsome and a good leader

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
it was not long before people started singing praises in the main off David

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
when King Saul saw this he was very angry and jealous

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and he thought that soon his people would want David as their King

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
so he tried to kill him

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
David soon realized that and so he went into hiding

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
he could not understand why the king had the sudden change of heart

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
David ran from one place to another to get away from Kings soul

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and his many soldiers who were looking everywhere for him

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
one day King Saul and his soldiers came near the cave where David had been hiding

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
it was night so they decided to rest and continue the search in the morning

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
when David saw them he became very worried

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
he thought to himself this is the perfect time to kill him

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
However David could not kill soul david was loyal

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And he wanted to know why soul wanted him dead

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So when everyone was asleep david crept towards King Saul

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and cut a part of his robe in the morning he showed the piece of cloth to King Saul

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and said my lord while I had the chance to kill you

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I did not I'm a lord serving then why did you want to kill me

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
seeing David Saul's anger went  away

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
David is so loyal isn't that wonderful

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
hmm now for my question where was David hiding

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
when Saul soldiers came looking

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I know  in a cave, that's right

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
