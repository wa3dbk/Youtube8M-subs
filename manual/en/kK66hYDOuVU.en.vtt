00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.580
Please remember to keep all your belongings and luggage with you at all time whilst travelling on the underground.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.080
Mind the gap.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.320
ROAR!

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.760
Zombies!

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.760
Son of a-

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.740
Hello?

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.900
(Gibberish)

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.720
Matt is trapped in a zombie infested train station.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.700
Soooo?

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.180
Err so, we should save him and stuff.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.860
Why?

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.060
Whhyyy?

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:00.380
Why? Because i'm your friend you butt munch.
Besides I have the emergency coke. Muhahaha!

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.920
Alright, let's go save Matt and whatever.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.560
Braaaains!

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.700
(Screaming)

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.900
Braaains!!

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.840
Alright, there are three routes to the station.
Through the zombie infested mall, through

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.790
the haunted graveyard or through that old
house over there.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.460
I say the old house.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.260
Yeah, that looks safe enough.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.280
10 minutes later!

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.880
Well, I hope Matts doing better than us.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:57.220
Brains!

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.980
Brrraaaainnns!

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:11.640
I can't just hide out here. I need to find
a weapon!

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.080
No... Too predictable...

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.700
We need to think of a plan.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.020
I know!

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.540
An escape plan!

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.280
Err, I have an escape plan.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.980
Braaaains!

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.660
Ahhh zoombies!

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.200
Matt? MATT? We are here to save you.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.150
About bloody time.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.620
Hmm we need to think of a way of opening this
gate. I suggest throwing Tom at it.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.880
Sounds good to me.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.270
Or we could press that big red button clearly
marked 'In case of zombie outbreak, press

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.360
to open gate to free any/or ginger civilians
trapped inside'

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.460
Throw Tom!

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.840
I hate you all so much.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:43.440
Give me back the coke!!

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:56.340
Well, I think it's time that we should be-
Holy trombones on a pogo stick!

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.900
Err, run away!

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.900
They're everywhere!

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.480
Phew, that was close.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.480
Flaming zombies! Run away!

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.980
Doesn't seem to be any survivors.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.280
Look a helicopter!

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.120
Wait, what is that down there?

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.900
Oh wait, never-mind it's just more zombies.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.940
We're saved!

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.740
(Gunfire)

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:49.680
