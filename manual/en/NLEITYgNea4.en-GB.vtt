I really love the look for short curly ponytails

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:20.090
but having long hair means I had to find a
different way of doing it!

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:35.750
Start by curling the ends of your hair.
Pull it up into a high ponytail without disturbing

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:56.530
the curl too much.
On the last loop of the elastic, don't pull

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:11.590
the hair all the way through.
Twist it to face the curls to the front and

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:20.580
the loop to the back like this.
push the loop so it's flush to your head and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:29.370
pin place.
Pin the curls to the scalp just in front of

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:45.479
the hair band.
Flip the curls back over so they cover the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:02:05.970
loop and fluff them out.
Hairspray it all in place.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.940
I love this style with a simple scarf wrapped
around it.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.400
Done! Too cute!
My loop shows through a bit more because of

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.560
my pink ends.
If your hair is all one colour it will be

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:29.020
less of course.
I hope this was a useful video, please check

Thanks so much for watching.
Bye!
