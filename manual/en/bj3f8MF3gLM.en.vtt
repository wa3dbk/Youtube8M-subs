00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.190
VO: Here’s more on lawn maintenance from
Lowe’s.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.069
If you missed part one, be sure to check it
out first.

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.990
VO: With the soil prepared and the seed down,
you’re well on your way to greener grass!

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.640
Now, learn about feeding.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.140
VO: Begin by measuring your lawn’s square
footage to determine how much fertilizer you

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.140
will need.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.900
VO: You can use either a broadcast or drop
spreader, just be sure check the bag for the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.679
correct spreader setting.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.289
You want to get the amount of fertilizer right
as too much can be just as bad for your grass

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.349
as too little.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.379
VO: Apply the fertilizer evenly – do not
overlap passes.

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.920
VO: Using ‘weed &amp; feed’ is a convenient
way to deal with weeds and fertilize your

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.899
lawn in one pass.

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.719
Just don’t use these types if you are sowing
grass, because they work by preventing seeds

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:48.719
from germinating.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.070
VO: If you are sowing grass, use a Lawn Starter
fertilizer instead.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.179
VO: How often you fertilize your lawn depends
on several factors, so check out Lowes.com/LawnCare

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:00.230
to learn more.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.570
VO: Now that you’ve fed your lawn, it’s
time to think about mowing.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.500
VO: First, only mow when the lawn is dry -otherwise
your grass clippings may clump.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.920
VO: Next, make sure to cut the right height
for your type of grass.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.250
Typically cool-season grasses are cut taller,
and warm-season grasses, a little bit shorter.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.430
If you’re not sure, use the 1/3 rule: only
remove 1/3 the length of each blade.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.500
VO: Be mindful of your grass type when mowing,
and slow your mowing frequency for cool-season

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.980
grasses when the weather is hot and arid.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.990
VO: Keep your mower blade sharp for a clean
cut that’s disease resistant, and alter

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.200
your mowing pattern so grass won’t lean
in one direction.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.570
VO: Last but not least comes watering.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.790
Most lawns need about an inch of water per
week.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.400
A rain gauge can help you monitor rainfall.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.100
VO: Deeply water your lawn in the morning
to avoid loss of moisture from evaporation.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.490
VO: Watering deeply is the most efficient
method.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.030
It gives the water time to reach the root
system, and allows the soil to dry some between

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.030
watering.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.490
VO: It’s a good idea to hook your sprinkler
to a timer to avoid runoff and wasted water.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.810
VO: That’s it!

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.000
By following these easy steps, your lawn can
look great with just a little time and effort.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.940
