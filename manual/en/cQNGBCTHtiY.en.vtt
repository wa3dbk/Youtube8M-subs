Hi everyone I’m Ryoya.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.820
I’m making Yaki Onigiri (soy sauce flavored fried rice bowl) today.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.180
There are several ways to make this.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.440
first, by using open fire. Second, toast it with oven toaster, and the Third, fry it on frying pan.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:31.340
with open fire, you’ll need gridiron, and you might spill soy sauce on stove top.So it’s a little bit pain in the neck.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.740
I’m showing you how to make Yaki Onigiri with frying pan today.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.220
Let’s get started.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.160
It’s so easy to make, so please try this out at home.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.880
I used to like Yaki Onigiri when I was kid. I mean store bought, frozen one.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.380
I’m no longer using microwave by the way.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.080
Try not to spread soy sauce right after put Yaki Onigiti onto frying pan.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:33.040
You’ll never fail if you spread soy sauce after Yaki Onigiri gets golden brown both sides.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.680
I hope you gonna like this recipe.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.940
See you next week!
