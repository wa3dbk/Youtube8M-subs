KAMIUSAGI ROPE

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.733
Beach

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.733
- Uwah...
- Oh my god...

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:16.800
Holy crap.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:17.666
This is crazy.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.666
There's tons of them.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.733
Yeah, a ton.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:23.533
They said something on TV...

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.733
- About what?
- Uh...

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:30.400
- During the end of summer...
- Uh-huh. Yes.

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:33.366
...the beach is filled with sharks, so watch out.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.600
Wasn't that jellyfish?

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:36.933
Oh, yeah.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.800
Yes.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:45.066
What's your plan?

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:45.900
Huh!?

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:49.200
I don't think it's a good idea...

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.300
Wait, they're sharks, right?

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.366
Yes.

00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.133
Sharks are carnivores, right?

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:55.866
Yes.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.400
What are we?

00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.066
Uh...

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.033
We're paper.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:01.800
Yeah.

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:03.633
Oh, I get it.

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.333
Oh yeah! I know what you mean!

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.266
Then it's totally ok.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.000
But!

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:12.666
- If they just eat...
- Uh-huh.

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:18.066
...anything they catch...

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.466
That would be a problem.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.166
Yeah.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.066
Alright! Never mind!

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:41.433
Yep.

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:45.666
- Let's go rent the "Jaws" series.
- Uh-huh.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.800
And learn more about sharks.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.100
What about the movie theater?

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:50.966
Oh yeah.

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:54.200
"Jaws"...

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:57.266
A theater showing "Jaws"...

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.300
There's none!

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:00.600
Of course not.

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:01.533
True.

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:08.533
To be continued...
