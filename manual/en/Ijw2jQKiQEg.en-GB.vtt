hi

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.670
my name is Andy Cusick and I am an
Instructor and Therapist of Shaolin Qigong

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.930
and this is the story of how I overcame
my health well-being problems

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.140
From late childhood I was diagnosed with

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.850
Asthma and allergies, necessitating a dependence on
medication every day

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.030
By the time I was in my mid-twenties my

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.060
energy levels were also getting low. Worringly, 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.180
my general heatlh was getting worse rather than
better. But things changed for me after a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.720
chance encounter with a book

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.460
'Qigong for hHalth and Vitality' whilst
traveling in China

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.060
in 2005.  The message of the books seemed a bit
too good to be true.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.800
But I was determined to find out the truth for myself.
So, I travelled to learn directly from the

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.800
Master of the Art.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.860
Everything in the book was proven...and more.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.659
And since then it has only been improvements for me, at all levels, not

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.659
only physically but mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.740
Interestingly, the most difficult part of the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.310
journey for me wasn't travelling across remote
 parts of distand lands, by myself.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.960
It wasn't going on intensive course.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.040
It was committing to my Qigong practice everyday.
0:02:06.040,0:02:09.869
So how do we build such positive new habits?

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.869
Well, if your internal image of yourself,

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.040
your identity, is of someone who is sick and
tired.  Are you ever not going to be sick and tired?

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.420
So to reach our goal we need three things.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.440
number one: the vision of ourselves achieving our
goal

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.780
number two: a method to reach the goal.
and number three: a commitment to action toward the goal.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.120
All of us can potentially reach the top Mount
Everest

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.569
but the only people who will are those with a
vision of themselves

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.080
reaching the top. Who find a method to get
themselves to the top

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.080
and who commit to daily action towards their goal.
The Vision Approach is what seperates

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.580
fantasy

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.540
from direction in life.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.930
It may sound fairly obvious when it is spelt out like this.  But you'd be surprised

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.959
how many artists never pick up a brush.
How many writers never pick up a pen.

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.560
How many people never pick up that book

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.290
learn that new skill, take that new class,

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.060
take that risk. Essentially how many people 
don't believe in their own dreams.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.880
So to change this we need a vision of ourselves

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.019
achieving our goal, find a method to reach the goal, and commit to
action towards the goal.

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.069
The vision approach

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.209
is integrated into the teaching of our
Qigong beginners course, as well as the support and guidance to

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.230
build positive new habits.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.329
Not to mention the very method which made a
return to health possible not only for me but

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:42.630
for

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.530
thousands of people all around the world. For more
