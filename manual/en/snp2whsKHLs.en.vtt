00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:08.939
inkjet printers create the image by propelling drop of ink on the paper 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.520
through the nozzles

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.220
these nozzles or about one-tenth of the
diameter

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.070
of an human hair

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.330
if the printer has a long period of inactivity

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.980
the ink may dry into the nozzles

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.350
clogging the printhead

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.800
unfortunately, Epson print-heads are part of the printer itself

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.080
and cannot be easily removed and cleaned

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.670
changing the ink cartridge is useless

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.950
it only contains the ink

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.720
to solve the problem of an Epson printer with clogged print-head

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.400
try these methods

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:44.499
turn your printer on

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:46.959
press the ink button

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.820
the cartridge will move into the changing position

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.160
unplug the printer

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.790
now you can move the ink cartridge
carriage freely from side to side

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.380
take a strips of soft cloth

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.380
insert the strip under the printhead

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.770
put a few drops of distilled water
near the middle of the cloth

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.860
you can use 80 percent water and 20 percent ammonia

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.720
the inkjet inks are water-based 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.880
the alcohol is not so useful

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.849
move the cloth over the printhead

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.320
you can let the printhead sit over the wet cloth for at least 10 minutes

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.820
but you can leave the cloth under the
printhead for about one hour

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.820
this will soften the dried ink on the printhead

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.480
removre the cloth

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.960
and move the printhead assembly back to
its resting position

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.300
if any water or printhead cleaner dripped into the printer

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.440
wipe it dry with a paper towel

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.260
do a cleaning with the Epson utility head cleaning

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.059
it may take several pages of dense print to get the ink flowing  properly again

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.080
do not make more than three cleaning
cycle at a time

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.950
or you can damage the printhead

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.690
and don't forget

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.780
a dozen od cleanings can use half the ink in the cartridge

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.780
second method

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.629
turn the printer

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.580
press the ink button 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.160
until the cartridge move into the changing position

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.720
unplug the printer

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.680
remove the ink cartridges

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:26.239
make attention: they may lose Ink

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.040
you will see the small cone shaped ink tubes: the ink ports

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.840
they take the ink from the cartridge to the printhead

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.060
draw some hot distilled water into a 5
milliliters or 10 milliliters plastic syringe

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.020
it's possible to use a mixture of ammonia and water

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.820
place the syringe without the needle over the clogged ink port

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.960
make sure it is a snug fit

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.660
gently put some of the water through the ink port

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.880
allow the liquid to soak into the printhead 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.900
do not use pressure to force the clog to clear

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.700
if you feel resistance, push a little, then pull it back

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:24.280
slowly eject the syringe plunger to suck up the sediments out from the nozzles

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.720
a few milliliters of water will do the job

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.240
to minimize injecting air into the ink port

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.820
it would be better to use a flexible plastic tube

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.500
if it's the red which has nozzles missing

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.740
then put water only into the red ink port

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.540
make the process a quick one

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.500
without the ink cartridges the open ports
tend to dry quickly

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.100
if you're not sure which color port is

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.300
then look at the holes in the bottom of the cartridge

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.500
once ypu have injected the water, insert the ink cartridges

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.280
move the printhead assembly back to its resting position

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.099
clean up the water from the paper path

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.920
and let the printhead soak for at least 3 hours

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.480
do not install the power cord immediately

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.030
to avoid short

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.000
run one or two cleaning cycles

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.560
it may take several pages of dense prints to get the ink flowing properly again

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.500
repeat the process if necessary

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.540
this works on all printers with cartridge without printhead: Brother and
Epson

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.580
do not use these methods cartridges with printhead

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:08.580
to clean a cartridge with printhead use
this method

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.800
if nothing works, the nozzles are
hardly clugged or damaged

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.460
the best choice is buy a new printer

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.490
unless you have an expensive professional printer

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.330
replace the printhead yourself can be
very difficult

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.270
if you don't know what you're doing

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.380
have the printer repaired is more expensive than buy a new printer

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.890
in case the printer is in warranty purchase original Epson cartridges

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.420
never return Epson printers for warranty

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.580
with compatible cartridges

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.640
doing so, will give Epson the opportunity to blame the problem on the cartridge

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.340
and refuse warranty

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.340
while is their print-head technology which is to blame for most of their problems

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.120
you certainly won't get anyone at Epson to admit it
