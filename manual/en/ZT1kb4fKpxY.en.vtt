00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.230
WOOSH what is up Daily crew it's Tuesday
I'm going to take

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.770
one of your questions and I'm going to
address it directly

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.240
 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.110
 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.390
 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.369
 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.910
 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.519
 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.170
 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.790
none of this will matter

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.920
you're about to be in college and
the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.680
second you leave high school who almost
everyone thought was important in high

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.250
school

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.080
disappears I can literally count on one
hand how many people

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.520
I still keep in touch with from high
school what happens is sometimes you

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.280
grow

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.360
and change and people don't grow and
change with you

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.300
you grow apart in this is like you said it
happens it's a part of life

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.229
I'm not sure exactly how you communicated
with them about the issue that you were

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:02.890
having

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.570
but if you were kinda beating around the
bush you need to be direct with them

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.929
like what is going on why do you guys
feel the way that you do

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.600
but honestly maybe not if you've tried
multiple times

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.650
to talk to them and communicate with
them and they're busy

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.420
thent these aren't people that you
probably want to be around

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.850
here's the thing about busy I'm a busy
guy

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.720
but I always make time for the people
that are important to me

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.900
and what these people are saying is that
they don't feel like you're

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.660
an important part of their group and
that sucks

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.040
but it happens if I'm being blunt your
friends sound like assholes

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.049
if their the type og people to pretent to
wanna hang out with you and then not

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.880
wanna hang out with you and then

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.989
make plans in front of you this is
all like

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.060
really childish stuff and the these are
not

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.360
friend like actions if you can get them
to talk to you

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.360
maybe they'll be your friends again but
is

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.890
don't sound like people that treat you
very well

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.170
in the end you are about to embark on
a new

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.810
journey in life college is a completely

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.040
different ball game and

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.579
and if those people don't wanna be your
friends than fine they don't deserve you

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.709
as a friend it's time to get new friends

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.760
and trust me in college new friends are
not hard to come by

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.760
just do me a favor and make sure you get
your studies done

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.689

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.060
