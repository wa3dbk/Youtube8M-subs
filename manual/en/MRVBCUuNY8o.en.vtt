00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.900
Why buy an Isabella awning?

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.540
We use the best materials on the market.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.099
This awning here is made of polyester the
only polyester in the market that has a

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.280
texture to give the extra depth behind
it.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.260
We also have covered zips around all the awning.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.420
Everything on our awning is
double stitched

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:36.820
Underneath the windows are extra eyelets for storm lashings.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.680
There's a mosquito net
down the middle to give extra

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:49.740
ventilation - on the awning and you can
have it whatever size you require.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.340
Again we have extra ventilation on the side panel.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:12.119
Zips on all Isabella awnings are spiral - so when we go around the corners we have
a smooth slide.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.660
All these vent awnings has the Isabella typhoon.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.060
The guy rope which comes standard to be attached to give you that extra peace of mind.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.680
The guy rope adjuster - made of wood simply slides up the rope to give you that tension.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:43.080
The canopy is deeper to give protection from the rain - and also the canopy is a lot longer

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.360
down to the ground to keep the rain from the door.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.020
All Isabella awnings come standard with the Fix-on's.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.440
It gets clamps on to the profile for the poles then to be attached.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.900
All Isabella awnings now come with the new ISOFIX.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.080
No wing nuts involved - just pull the poles apart and
lock into position.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.540
All Isabella awnings have reinforcement material behind the pegging points.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.560
They're all flag stitched.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.580
Behind all the poles that go across

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.880
the front is extra material to reinforce
and to protect the poles against the canvas.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.100
With all Isabella awnings you have
the choice galvanized steel frame or as

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:43.590
shown here a carbon fiber frame. 96% of
ourselves in the UK - half the weight -

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:51.060
- as strong as steel - flexible and warm. All Isabella awnings have a printed roof

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.890
to give that extra coating and to also help
hide all the dirt. All the curtains for

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.780
Isabella awnings are designed to match
the awning also it has an added feature

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.739
of where you can choose which way you
would like the print to be fixed on the

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.260
inside or outside the choice is yours.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
All Isabella awnings - pegging points

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.420
with these rubbers - are one elastic
around sixteen and a six to make them

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.660
nice and strong and if you do lose one
just feed them in from the back

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.160
