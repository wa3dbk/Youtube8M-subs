00:00:00.357 --> 00:00:02.334
- Hey guys it's my
birthday, so to celebrate

00:00:02.334 --> 00:00:05.299
we are making birthday cake martinis, yay!

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:08.044
- [Man] It's your birthday
tomorrow technically OK?

00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:09.275
Not today, OK?

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.097
We are making them a day
early, I'm just saying.

00:00:11.097 --> 00:00:13.011
Just keeping it correct.

00:00:13.011 --> 00:00:14.777
- Getting the party started.

00:00:14.777 --> 00:00:17.132
First we are going to rim
the glass with corn syrup.

00:00:17.132 --> 00:00:18.693
- [Man] Get a nice, thin layer.

00:00:18.693 --> 00:00:20.987
Now we stick that in the sprinkles.

00:00:22.217 --> 00:00:23.895
Voila!

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:25.319
Vanilla vodka pour!

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:27.542
- (laughs) You're going
to tell me when to stop?

00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:29.075
- [Man] Give us like two ounces.

00:00:29.075 --> 00:00:30.448
OK stop, stop, stop.

00:00:30.448 --> 00:00:31.264
Cranberry juice!

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.956
Not a ton, just to get it pink, OK?

00:00:33.956 --> 00:00:35.502
OK that's good, that's good, that's good.

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:39.671
That's good, I said "that's
good" 20 minutes ago.

00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:41.167
Shake that!

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:44.113
And keep it sexy!

00:00:44.113 --> 00:00:45.814
- I don't know what to do.

00:00:45.814 --> 00:00:46.665
- [Man] Just shake it.

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:48.292
More body please, more body OK?

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:50.322
That's right, that's
what I'm talking about.

00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:52.535
Oh yeah, oh yeah!

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:53.745
That's it?

00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:55.670
- I don't know, I really need to go home

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.669
and work out a routine.

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:57.390
- [Man] Practice that's right.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.037
You need to practice this,

00:00:59.037 --> 00:01:01.472
it's a part of your job description OK?

00:01:01.472 --> 00:01:03.257
I would fire you if I had someone.

00:01:03.257 --> 00:01:04.749
Luckily for you I don't have nobody.

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:07.347
- They said to like, put it
in between here and shake it.

00:01:07.347 --> 00:01:08.713
- [Man] That's what the guy said?

00:01:08.713 --> 00:01:10.840
You saw that in the
comments and you listened?

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.678
- Yes!

00:01:11.678 --> 00:01:13.254
But I, it doesn't like, it's not...

00:01:13.254 --> 00:01:14.577
- How dare you?

00:01:14.577 --> 00:01:16.377
- How dare you?

00:01:16.377 --> 00:01:18.471
- Yeah, I know.

00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:19.771
(laughs)

00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:21.440
Dear girl, another job
but not on this job, OK?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.741
We don't encourage that kind of behavior.

00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:25.172
It's sexy, but no.

00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:26.344
OK, stop.

00:01:26.344 --> 00:01:28.353
Excellent.

00:01:28.353 --> 00:01:31.258
Excellent, that's a perfect pour.

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:33.566
Champagne!

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:35.501
Open that and top those boys off.

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:36.497
- It's going to pop off?

00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:37.286
- [Man] It's not going to pop off

00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:38.886
because you are holding it in your hands.

00:01:39.962 --> 00:01:40.795
You're going to hold it in your hands.

00:01:40.795 --> 00:01:42.144
Oh God.

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:43.998
(squealing)

00:01:43.998 --> 00:01:45.975
Come on, it's coming.

00:01:45.975 --> 00:01:47.685
Don't let it go because
it is going to shoot up!

00:01:47.685 --> 00:01:49.324
You want these lights to get you?

00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:51.207
Keep your hand on the top.

00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:52.054
How hard was that?

00:01:52.284 --> 00:01:55.035
How hard was that?

00:01:55.421 --> 00:01:56.967
Up from that height, yeah close up.

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.512
OK excellent, OK.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.462
OK.

00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:03.868
Oh look at that!

00:02:03.868 --> 00:02:06.555
- [Jessica] Sex-y.

00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:07.229
Come on man.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.158
- [Man] Any day, any day (laughs)

00:02:09.158 --> 00:02:10.375
- Yay!

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:10.882
- [Man] How is that?

00:02:10.882 --> 00:02:13.561
- These are so pretty!

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:14.695
- Come on say something.

00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:15.728
Say something birthday girl, come on!

00:02:15.728 --> 00:02:17.798
Come on let's see what
you've got, come on!

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.618
- I don't like to fight on my birthday.

00:02:20.618 --> 00:02:21.674
- Sure.

00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:24.960
(laughs)

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.589
And there you have it!

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:28.441
The birthday cake martini!

00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:29.661
Some of you will go "wait a minute.

00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:31.918
"A birthday cake is this,
a birthday cake is that."

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.129
Birthday cake got a hundred
different recipes, OK?

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.384
This was one that we found
online that looked pretty cool,

00:02:36.384 --> 00:02:37.861
so we decided to make it, OK?

00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:39.358
Happy birthday, I want
to go out and eat cake,

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:43.763
but I did that already and I
ain't your man so forget it!

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:44.695
- Aright, good.

00:02:44.695 --> 00:02:46.619
Alright, are you tasting this with me?

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:48.333
- No, I just made two for fun.

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:50.627
(laughs)

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:55.502
- Mmm

00:02:55.502 --> 00:02:56.216
- You like it?

00:02:56.216 --> 00:02:57.574
- That's good!

00:02:57.574 --> 00:02:59.029
- Here is the thing
with this drink though.

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:01.022
This isn't exactly a weak drink.

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.047
It's got a little bit of pineapple

00:03:03.047 --> 00:03:04.994
I mean cranberry juice in it but it's just

00:03:05.348 --> 00:03:08.196
vanilla vodka and the champagne, you know?

00:03:08.196 --> 00:03:09.751
- It's not really that like it's doable

00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:12.197
where you can drink a lot of it and get...

00:03:12.197 --> 00:03:14.038
- It's a nice mix.

00:03:14.038 --> 00:03:15.314
And if you really want
to get it even more pink

00:03:15.314 --> 00:03:18.335
you can use a pink champagne, alright?

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:20.695
Happy birthday, OK?

00:03:20.695 --> 00:03:22.644
You want to tell them how old you are?

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:25.349
They already know because
when you started the show

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.938
you were only 22.

00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:28.986
We stressed that and so...

00:03:28.986 --> 00:03:30.084
- True?

00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:30.894
- Yeah and it's been two years

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:34.255
so they know she is 24 now.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:34.912
(sigh)

00:03:34.912 --> 00:03:37.073
What does it feel like to be 24, huh?

00:03:38.042 --> 00:03:38.552
- It sucks.

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:39.107
- Huh?

00:03:39.107 --> 00:03:39.641
- It sucks.

00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:40.844
- Feel like you're getting older.

00:03:40.844 --> 00:03:42.255
And you haven't accomplished
what you want to accomplish.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.131
- Exactly.

00:03:43.131 --> 00:03:44.016
- You think your life is a failure.

00:03:44.016 --> 00:03:44.781
- Yes.

00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:46.082
- Drink some more,
you'll get over it quick.

00:03:46.082 --> 00:03:47.519
(laughs)

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.854
Tipsy bartender!

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:49.977
- That's why he made two.

00:03:49.977 --> 00:03:52.731
- Cure the pain!

00:03:52.746 --> 00:03:53.590
What's up everybody?

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.137
Today we are making this.

00:03:55.137 --> 00:03:57.396
Spicy vodka gummy bears.

00:03:57.396 --> 00:03:58.027
- Go ahead Ava.

00:03:58.027 --> 00:03:59.904
- Did you wash your hands
when you put these bears

00:03:59.904 --> 00:04:01.446
in with those?

00:04:01.446 --> 00:04:04.542
- It's in alcohol, it's clean now.

00:04:04.542 --> 00:04:06.558
- I want the red one.

00:04:06.558 --> 00:04:09.566
- I try not to play with
myself before I put those in.

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:12.280
(laughs)
