I'm John Vincent. For 28 years, I've been
involved in helping women and men find a solution

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.039
to their hair loss problems. As president
of Nutreve International, I feel we've created

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:19.630
the best treatment option for thinning hair
in one comprehensive package. Female pattern

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.609
baldness (Androgenetic alopecia) is an often
overlooked but common condition frustrating

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.720
one in four women today.
Facts About Hair Loss

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.690
We know that hair loss can be depressing for
men, but for women it can be devastating to

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.220
their self-esteem and sense of beauty. While
men can point to celebrities with shaved heads

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.150
and simply accept hair loss as inevitable,
women don't have bald role models in our society.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.600
Hair loss is almost always an inherited trait
passed down by female or male relatives. Hormonal

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.600
changes such as hypothyroidism, post-partum
shedding, even stress or trauma like chemotherapy

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.229
can trigger hair loss. When the hair doesn't
grow back after the condition is corrected,

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.810
we can normally attribute the cause to hereditary
baldness.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.729
Treatments for Hair Loss
Alternatives to thinning hair are more limited

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.259
for women than for men. Hair transplant surgery
is often not a good option for sparse hair

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.229
and rarely achieves the thickness women are
looking for. I've often pointed out the difference

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.999
between men and women seeking more hair are
that men want hair nobody notices and women

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:40.999
want hair that everybody notices.
There is only one FDA approved drug treatment

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.369
for women that's Monoxidil and it is been
found to be marginally successful for regaining

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.979
thickness and growing hair. More often than
not, women who use Monoxidil twice per day

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.719
as recommended find it messy and unattractive
when left in the hair.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:06.719
Some men and women simply can't tolerate Monoxidil
on their scalp. We know that many women today

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:13.959
spend hundreds of dollars on hair repair treatments
at the salon or on off the shelf products.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.629
We've seen the infomercials about products
that claim to make the hair thicker, shinier,

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:26.629
and fuller by applying a special volumizing
shampoo or conditioner to the hair shaft.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.400
When we realize that hair is dead once it
leaves the scalp, we understand why such products

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.069
are extremely temporary.
Simply applying product to the hair shaft

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.760
does not get to the root of the problem. Hair
growth needs to be encouraged from within

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.799
the scalp not from without.
So what's the answer to female pattern hair

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:55.060
loss? Well, for thousands of women nationally
who've used low level laser light hair therapy

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.060
(LHT), the vast majority have seen their hair
regain a thicker, fuller appearance as a result

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.980
of a regular treatment regimen.
This laser hair therapy system program does

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.980
not diminish with time and does not require
repurchasing overpriced products. Your hair

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:21.430
quality is maintained by the regular use of
laser light not hair products on a consistent

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.370
basis, much like brushing your teeth or exercising
muscles to maintain their health and strength.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.989
Laser Hair Therapy
The Nutreve 3500 Personal Laser Hair Therapy

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.840
provides the most power of any device of its
kind. Used along with a Nutreve women hair

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.810
loss treatment system, women report improvement
in the thickness and look of their hair in

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.500
as little as 12 weeks. Low level laser therapy
for hair loss delivers cool light energy to

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.489
the depth of the scalp where hair grows.
Harvard Photomedicine professor Dr. Michael

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:02.489
Hamblin explains that LHT stimulates microcirculation
of blood flow to the follicles that it opens

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:09.829
up pathways to the cells blocked by DHT and
allows for ATP synthesis, the natural proliferation

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.090
of new healthy cell growth. The sooner you
start using the Nutreve 3500 Personal Laser

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.079
Hair Therapy personal laser the sooner you'll
see your hair regain the appearance you're

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.240
looking for.
Its ergonomic shape and smooth direct to the

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.639
scalp light delivery system assures you that
you're receiving the most benefit LHT can

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.910
deliver. The result of using LHT is thicker,
fuller, shinier looking hair and typically

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.169
a halting of excessive hair loss that results
in baldness. Best of all, Nutreve products

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:51.169
carry a money back guarantee. There's no risk,
no down side. Just the satisfaction of knowing

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.120
you're encouraging the growth of healthy hair.
One of the latest technologies in laser hair

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.370
treatments is what we call the Pulsed Laser
Wave Technology. This creates the intermittent

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.370
pulsing of laser diodes at very fast intervals.
The cellular response is said to be enhanced

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.380
by this awesome technology.
