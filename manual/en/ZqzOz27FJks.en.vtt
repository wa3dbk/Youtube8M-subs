00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:05.340
The atmosphere of the stadium...

00:00:05.823 --> 00:00:09.610
The voices and the shouts
of competitors and teammates...

00:00:11.034 --> 00:00:13.283
The whistles of the referees...

00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:17.597
The sound of the net...

00:00:17.597 --> 00:00:21.291
And this... (laughs)

00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:26.856
There are a lot of feelings
trapped in a moment, in a second

00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:29.342
and in a phase.

00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:37.169
I'm Vlado Jankovic and my whole life
revolves around a ball.

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:45.355
When I was young at school, I was looking
at the other kids playing basketball

00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:50.429
and that’s why I began to play.

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:56.388
Basketball is special to me, 
because in the four lines of the court,

00:00:59.294 --> 00:01:02.202
there are several feelings 
that everyone can express.

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:15.806
The most thrilling moment for me 
is the entry in the entrance tunnel

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:19.765
and the voices and the shouts
of a full stadium.

00:01:27.698 --> 00:01:31.238
I'm a pretty competitive guy 
and sometimes...

00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:35.762
I prefer to get angry and bring someone
to his limits, than to lose.

00:01:38.153 --> 00:01:41.025
Usually, I am well-prepared 


00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:44.490
to avoid any stress 
I keep inside me.

00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:04.086
The best game for me was this year, 
during the play-off season

00:02:06.015 --> 00:02:08.877
in the fourth final against Olympiakos,
which actually helped my team to win

00:02:08.877 --> 00:02:12.329
and return the game in OAKA.

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:17.452
My path until today
was not filled with roses.

00:02:17.582 --> 00:02:19.910
It was very hard.

00:02:23.468 --> 00:02:28.431
The worst time in basketball so far
was a serious injury I had,

00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:32.161
which left me off the court 
for about four months.

00:02:36.098 --> 00:02:40.621
At that period there were times 
I thought that maybe I'd like to stop,

00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:45.183
but during that time, 
things would always appear

00:02:45.273 --> 00:02:48.526
to help me continue and move on.

00:03:05.341 --> 00:03:09.061
Sports have helped me 
see things more clearly

00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:12.622
and deal with difficult situations 
more easily.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.326
I believe there are two things that
distinguish a champion from an athlete

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:31.155
the discipline he has inside of him 
and how much he wants it.

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:39.469
My advice to someone who wants 
to stand out is to have a dream

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:43.376
and to always know what
to do to reach that dream.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.720
The best advice I've got so far
is from my father and that is,

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.080
“To do everything I do with all my heart."

00:04:10.865 --> 00:04:15.044
I'm Vlado Jankovic and my whole life 
revolves around a ball.
