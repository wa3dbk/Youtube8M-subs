00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.539
December 2011 / January 2012 Roundup.

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:14.889
December is the quietest month of the new
for new releases, but things start to get

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:21.090
busy again with the CES show in Las Vegas
in January.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.750
Nokia.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.519
The Nokia Lumia 900 is a big screen Windows
smartphone, at the moment heading to AT&amp;T

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.410
in the US only, but it is likely that we'll
see a European version (possibly the Lumia

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.460
910) next month.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.660
Right at the other end of the scale is the
inexpensive Nokia X2-02, a dual-SIM device

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.940
designed for people with different priorities.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.350
Samsung.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.870
The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus is a lower midrange
Android phone, the Samsung Galaxy S Advance

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.350
is an upper midrange Android phone.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.990
If you thought you understood Samsung's new
naming convention.. well, you probably don't

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.190
now.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:12.360
A couple of dual-SIM Galaxy devices are the
Samsung Galaxy Y DUOS and Galaxy Y Pro DUOS.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.050
Also this month we saw indications that Samsung
may merge the Bada and Tizen operating systems.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.310
Motorola.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.330
The US-only Motorola DROID 4 is a straight
upgrade to the old DROID 3, we hope that this

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.410
handset will herald a new Milestone 4 worldwide.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.870
A cut-down version of the DEFY and DEFY+,
the Motorola DEFY Mini is more basic but is

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.940
actually about the same size as the full fat
version.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:49.659
And if the DEFY+ isn't tough enough, UK customers
can also get the Motorola DEFY+ JCB Edition.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.950
If you want a big screen Android device, but
you don't want a big ticket price then the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.690
upcoming Motorola MOTOLUXE might be the ticket
for you.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.160
Sony.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:08.890
2012 saw the old Sony Ericsson name swept
away with two new "Sony" branded devices.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.310
The Sony Xperia S is a high end smartphone
with a striking design, the slightly bigger

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:24.170
Sony Xperia ion is heading exclusively to
AT&amp;T in the US.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.270
Other manufacturers.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.440
The HTC TITAN II adds 4G support and a better
camera to the original TITAN.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.170
LG take a sideways step with the fashionable
PRADA phone by LG 3.0.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.550
Chinese manufacturer Huawei announced the
incredibly slim Huawei Ascend P1 and P1 S

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.170
smartphones.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.530
Not a smartphone.. but a smart camera, the
Polaroid SC1630 combines a real digital camera

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.520
with an compact Android tablet.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.080
Finally, struggling BlackBerry maker RIM changed
CEOs to try to reverse its recent slide in

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.820
sales.
