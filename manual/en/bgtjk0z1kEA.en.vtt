This is a terrific chicken wing recipe, but
for Halloween, we're calling them bat wings!

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.160
So, I'm gonna start by making my marinade.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.520
It's super easy to make.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:25.970
You, basically, are going to add soy sauce,
and you're gonna add some diced garlic.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.140
Put that in there.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.980
And then, I've got some spices.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.520
I've got some ginger, five-spice powder, and
a little bit of red pepper, and I'm gonna

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:46.010
put that in there also, and I'm just gonna
whisk this together to make this delicious

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.010
and simple marinade.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.940
You know, most of this stuff you probably
have in your cupboard already, in your spice

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.470
cabinet.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.980
Super-duper easy!

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.580
Now, in here, I've got about 20 chicken wings,
and I've put them in a really big Ziploc bag.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:09.659
So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pour my
marinade right in here.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.980
Make sure you get all that goodness.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.240
And then, I'm gonna just seal it up and kinda
shake and shimmy it around to make sure that

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.040
every wing gets really well coated.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.460
And then, what you wanna do once you got them
really well coated is you wanna just put them

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.170
in the refrigerator for a few hours.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.140
If you can, ideally put them in overnight
`cause the longer they soak in, the more they're

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.600
gonna suck up that flavor.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.400
Then, once they've been in the refrigerator
for a few hours, you're just gonna take `em

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.659
out and put them on a foil-lined pan.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.380
Before you do that, you wanna pre-heat your
oven to 450 degrees, and what you're gonna

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.070
do is you're gonna put your wings in there
for 10 minutes, and you're gonna cook `em

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.070
uncovered.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.820
So, when you're done with your 10 minutes
in the oven at 450 degrees, you're gonna take

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.380
whatever is left of your marinade.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.560
You're gonna brush it on the wings and put
them back in for another 15 to 20 minutes,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.750
and you wanna really watch them and make sure
that the meat is really well cooked.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.770
You don't want any pink meat, and keep cooking
them if you feel like they still need to be

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.560
more well done, and I've actually got some
that have been cooking in the oven and are

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.100
ready to go right here.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.670
I'm gonna make some swamp dip to dip them
in, and this is so super easy!

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:35.250
You're just gonna take sour cream, and you're
gonna put it into a bowl with a little bit

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.680
of stone-ground mustard.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.730
Very, very simple and it's delicious.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.030
So, you just add these two together, and you'll
mix them in just to make a really good dipping

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.030
sauce.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.810
Okay, so once you've got your sauce all done,
you're gonna wanna pour this into a little

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.630
serving dish and put your, you know, chicken
wings on a nice little platter and everyone

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.080
is gonna
