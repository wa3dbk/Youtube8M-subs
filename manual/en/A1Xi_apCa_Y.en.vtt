00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
electric piano plays softly

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
(Frank Big Bear)

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
When I was 18, this one

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
counselor at North High,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
he asked me what I

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
wanted to be when I grew up,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and I said, an artist.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And he says oh, you want to

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
be more than that, don't you?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
laughs

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
guitar, bass,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
&amp; drums play folk-rock

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I've been

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
driving cab

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
for 31 years

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and trying

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to do my artwork.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Some of the drawings I do are,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
maybe the curves

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and the lines and stuff

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
might have something to do with

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the freeways and the streets.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
When you look at my drawings

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
before they're colored in,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
they look like intersections.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Every artist is influenced

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
by a lot of other artists,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
but then you got

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
your own images,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
what you want to paint,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
what moves you.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
bass &amp; acoustic guitar

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
play

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Everything I do is my culture.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I draw people I know,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and landscapes,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and a lot of times

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in the earlier years,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it was my children.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This is my daughter here.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
My youngest daughter Cricket,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
when she was a baby,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
she'd rub her feet

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
together all the time,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
so the name stuck.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I look at some of the older

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
work and I like the concepts.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I could tell that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I was driving cab,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and the work

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
wasn't real polished,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
but the concept

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
came through real good.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I think drawing, that's what I

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
started to do first was draw,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and it helped me as a child,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
probably to deal

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
with my problems.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I'm not out to shock people.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I think that's already

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
been done by everybody else.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I just wake up in the morning

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and I feel inspired.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I think I have to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
paint and draw every day,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
do one of them,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
or else I get restless,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
or I get--

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
it calms me down a lot.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Without it,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I'd probably be lost.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:03:33.000
electronic music plays
