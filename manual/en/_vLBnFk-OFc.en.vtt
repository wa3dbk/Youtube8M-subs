00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I have the distinct pleasure of introducing 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
an American poet: Elizabeth Alexander.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
"Praise Song for the Day"

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Each day we go about our business,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
walking past each other, catching each other’s

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
eyes or not, about to speak or speaking.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
All about us is noise. All about us is

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
noise and bramble, thorn and din, each

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
one of our ancestors on our tongues.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Someone is stitching up a hem, darning

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
a hole in a uniform, patching a tire,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
repairing the things in need of repair.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Someone is trying to make music somewhere,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
with a pair of wooden spoons on an oil drum,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
with cello, boom box, harmonica, voice.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
A woman and her son wait for the bus.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
A farmer considers the changing sky.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
A teacher says, Take out your pencils. Begin.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We encounter each other in words, words

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
spiny or smooth, whispered or declaimed,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
words to consider, reconsider.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We cross dirt roads and highways that mark

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the will of some one and then others, who said

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I need to see what’s on the other side.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I know there’s something better down the road.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We need to find a place where we are safe.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We walk into that which we cannot yet see.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Say it plain: that many have died for this day.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Sing the names of the dead who brought us here,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
who laid the train tracks, raised the bridges,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
picked the cotton and the lettuce, built

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
brick by brick the glittering edifices

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
they would then keep clean and work inside of.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Praise song for struggle, praise song for the day.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Praise song for every hand-lettered sign,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the figuring-it-out at kitchen tables.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Some live by love thy neighbor as thyself,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
others by first do no harm or take no more

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:14.000
than you need. What if the mightiest word is love?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Love beyond marital, filial, national,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
love that casts a widening pool of light,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
love with no need to pre-empt grievance.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
In today’s sharp sparkle, this winter air,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
any thing can be made, any sentence begun.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
On the brink, on the brim, on the cusp,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:59.000
praise song for walking forward in that light.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
[applause]
