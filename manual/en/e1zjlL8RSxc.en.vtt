00:00:00.054 --> 00:00:03.224
(rock music)

00:00:03.224 --> 00:00:05.102
- Look who's in the house! What's up?

00:00:05.102 --> 00:00:06.432
- What's up?

00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:09.599
- Ow!
- Ow!

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:10.438
(laughing)
- That's how me and Skyy

00:00:10.438 --> 00:00:12.586
greet each other every
time we see each other.

00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:13.601
- You ready for this?

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:14.419
- Yeah!

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.384
- Are you ready for this, Jessica!?

00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:18.140
Are you ready!?

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.321
- Yes.

00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:20.521
- Melon liqueur.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.654
(laughter)

00:00:22.654 --> 00:00:24.181
- Sweet and sour.

00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:25.661
You know what's up with sweet and sour?

00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:27.573
- I don't know what...

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.508
- Now dammit, why's the
sweet and sour always leak?

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.521
- [Man] Rock it out!

00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:43.630
Grenadine!

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.848
Now we can just lay the grenadine

00:00:44.848 --> 00:00:46.458
down the side, you know what I mean?

00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:47.997
Just to get it to go to the bottom.

00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:49.998
Pefect! You see that?

00:00:49.998 --> 00:00:52.191
Blue Curacao!

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:54.834
What's this?

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:56.249
- Bacardi rum.

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.466
- Now, this ain't just Bacardi rum, woman.

00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.551
- Oh, wait, hold on.

00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:00.980
Puerto Rican.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.612
- Not that part!

00:01:01.612 --> 00:01:02.592
The one-fifty-one!
- Oh.

00:01:02.592 --> 00:01:03.811
- Okay?

00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:04.667
That's what the power is!

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:05.488
That's power!

00:01:07.672 --> 00:01:09.550
- [Man] Try to shake it sexy, okay?

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.177
Okay?

00:01:10.177 --> 00:01:10.782
- Okay.

00:01:10.782 --> 00:01:11.718
- [Man] Let's see a sexy shake.

00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:12.658
Go ahead.

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.206
(Laughs)

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:19.833
- [Man] That is sexy!?

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:23.022
That's your definition of sexy!?

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.490
(Laughs)

00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:34.751
- [Man] Now here's where it gets wild.

00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:37.348
We grab our little spoon...

00:01:37.348 --> 00:01:39.078
and we float our blue right on top

00:01:39.078 --> 00:01:41.045
of that baby, just like that.

00:01:42.064 --> 00:01:43.519
That's right, blue.

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:46.812
Yeah, just like that, that's right baby.

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:48.356
It's a Nuclear Rainbow! That's right!

00:01:48.356 --> 00:01:50.223
After the nuclear holocaust,
when you look up at the sky,

00:01:50.223 --> 00:01:51.310
that's what it's going to look like!

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.612
Beautiful! Okay?

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:54.156
You'll probably have like
three legs and a tail

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:55.199
growing out of your head,

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:56.807
but it will be pretty!

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.000
(laughs)

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.849
And there you have it!

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.339
The Nuclear Rainbow!

00:02:03.878 --> 00:02:04.925
You ready for this one?

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:05.905
- Yes.
- Hold up.

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:06.695
- What?

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:08.506
- Girl drink or guy drink?

00:02:08.506 --> 00:02:09.859
- I mean...

00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:15.521
I could see a girl
ordering a Nuclear Rainbow.

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:17.422
- Girl drink or guy drink, Lord Jesus.

00:02:17.424 --> 00:02:19.479
- But a guy ordering a Nuclear Rainbow?

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:20.793
- He's kinda soft?

00:02:20.793 --> 00:02:21.961
Okay, go ahead and take a sip then.

00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:22.838
Take a sip.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.748
- I'm just saying.
- Okay, go ahead, take a sip.

00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:30.889
- Whew!
(laughter)

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:34.010
- Okay, so.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.205
Checks out.

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.402
- That potent, right?
- Yeah.

00:02:38.844 --> 00:02:39.963
Girls, don't drink this...

00:02:41.254 --> 00:02:42.668
- Let me tell you something,

00:02:42.668 --> 00:02:44.793
This drink: Strong!

00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:46.774
Okay, because you got to realize, in order

00:02:46.774 --> 00:02:48.122
to get the blue to float,

00:02:48.122 --> 00:02:50.215
you mix in number one-fifty-one, okay?

00:02:50.722 --> 00:02:52.858
This is a 10, Yo!

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.122
Tipsy Bartender!

00:02:55.122 --> 00:02:57.416
I'm going to hit this Nuclear Rainbow.

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.272
(retching)

00:03:00.272 --> 00:03:01.793
- [Man] Jesus!

00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:05.322
- [Jessica] Checkout Christina
making a jalapeno shot glass,

00:03:05.322 --> 00:03:08.569
