00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.560
I didn't see it at first I heard it and
I heard the tinkle of flakes underneath

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.599
my boots and I looked down and said oh
look at this it's everywhere it's dense

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.250
nobody's gonna believe me

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.210
so I didn't learn a lot about Hozomeen
as a young person there were some of the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.870
things that our families decided to just
kind of let drift off. I first learned

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.829
about Hozomeen actually you know through Bob Mierendorf of the National Park

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.539
archaeologist who took us out there
after he discovered it and did some

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.140
studies on it. You know you find it
amazing that yes to to know that our

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.560
people use this resource for thousands
of years. Another piece of Hozomeen

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:25.770
chert and in a minute you're going
to see many pieces. Chert is flint basically and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.310
so we have mountains in the North
Cascades. Mountains made out of flint and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:41.390
and this is what the original people
knew and why they were coming.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.540
The idea that Northwest Coast people
really didn't spend much time in the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.090
rugged interior of the mountains and
therefore wouldn't even have accessed

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.560
the tool stone in places like the
mountains is a bias that developed

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.280
because most of the archaeology in the
Northwest Coast has been done close to

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.820
salt water

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.430
I knew that if I could find decent tool
stone material in the mountains it was

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.640
likely to have been exploited and once I
found the ribbon chert then it was

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.970
immediately obvious that that was the
source of some of the tools that I was

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.150
finding in archaeological sites. Once I
found the first chert quarry then that

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.269
link became indisputable

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.590
what's archaeologically significant
about Hozomeen chert is we can trace

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.600
it quite readily we can identify it we
can see where it's ended up we know

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.140
where it started from and that's
oftentimes a very difficult thing for us

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.160
to get a handle on now it's kind of
interesting though so you've got the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.650
chert bedrock there you've got the
mountain part of that mountain is made

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.410
of this bedrock the lower Thompson word
Hozomeen means sharp like a sharp knife

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.900
well you saw how the rock fractures to
make sharp knives the oral history again

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.070
the mountain is sharp the Hozomeen chert itself is sharp it's an excellent

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.050
source of material for cutting so you
know carrying that meaning with those

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.070
tools is a constant attachment if you
were to put yourself in the mind of the

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.790
people collecting and using that
material it's a constant attachment to

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.360
the place even that even though that
material may be hundreds of kilometers

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.850
away
how often do things come together like

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:05.910
that it's just really really cool to
have the social linguistic

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:13.709
archaeological history all different
lines of evidence just all come together

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.030
our place names are important  to me
and I think to all us because

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.560
it gives us an indication of the the use
of the land and the connection that we

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.979
have to place us so we have mal Tallis
just the popke mountain and it means

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.810
help one another and then the creek that
comes down there is a lolk popke

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.490
means always foaming and right behind
the pop come creek you can see that

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.800
mountain that one there is called slaw
Howerton meaning hunting place I wish we

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.750
had that knowledge from these all these
other bands that came into the valley

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.240
much of that knowledge was lost as a
consequence of the diseases brought to

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.259
the new world by old world populations
so today we rely on archeology that

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:28.180
comes from places like this to fill in
where we've lost that traditional elder

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.949
knowledge you know they say a lot of our
elders went to their grave crying because

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.150
they took a lot of information that they
had to the grave with them because we as

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.830
young people didn't show an interest
into it so in talking with

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.280
archaeologists and trying to be
open-minded about what they're doing and

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.930
what they're trying to figure out it has
provided me with questions that I've

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.620
taken back to the old people and asked
them if they know anything about this

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.240
and sometimes they say, ah, forget all
forget all about that

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.590
forgot about that, I'm glad that you've asked because that happened so long ago I forgot about that

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:13.370
people were here somebody might have
gotten born here probably somebody got

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.290
conceived here probably somewhere here if it was used for thousands of years

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.639
somebody died and got buried but we
won't find them because the soils are

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:28.940
too acidic so you know you want to
reconstruct that whole life history that

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.650
is in the ground this place and of
course you're going to be largely

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.560
unsuccessful because all you've got is
stone tools
