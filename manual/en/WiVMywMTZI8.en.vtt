Hi, this is Andy Wilkinson from SkinnyGainMuscle.com,
bringing you another video lesson on how to

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.080
gain weight if you're skinny.
And in this lesson we're answering the question:

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.740
"What Foods Should You Stay Away From, And
NOT Eat, If Your Aim Is To Gain More Weight?"

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.449
Well, contrary to what you may be thinking,
I suggest you stay away from junk food most

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.480
of the time if your aim is to gain more weight.
And why do I say this? I mean, wouldn't eating

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.449
more junk food be one of the fastest ways
to gain weight?

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.370
Eating a diet of burgers, fried chicken and
french fries. Wouldn't that put on weight

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.420
quickly?
Well there's a good reason why you want to

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.430
take a different approach.
Although it seems like stuffing yourself with

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.730
junk food might be one of the speediest ways
to gain weight, you need to realize that this

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.530
kind of food is often very HIGH in saturated
fat.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.320
And because of this, the only kind of size
and weight gains you're likely to see from

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.050
a diet based on junk food, is the growth of
a spare 'tire' around your belly.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.860
This kind of diet is loaded in fat, very unhealthy,
will raise your cholesterol levels, and could

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.890
put in you line for a heart attack.
Not only that, but a fat stomach is not exactly

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.290
the image most skinny guys have in mind for
themselves when they think about gaining weight.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.060
Instead, you most likely want to gain weight
in the form of lean muscle mass, that is distributed

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.950
throughout your body - that makes you look
stronger, fitter, and more attractive.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.300
So, at the top of the list of 'Foods to Avoid'
and stay away from is: Fried Foods, and foods

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.880
loaded in saturated fat.
This means staying away from high fat, processed

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.000
meats like salami. Staying away from ice cream
and most frozen desserts as well.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.409
And then next, you want to avoid empty calorie
foods that contain little or no nutritional

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.200
value.
And the biggest culprit of this is 'Refined

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.509
Sugars' like sweets and candy bars.
Just remember, gaining weight healthily involves

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.619
eating more calories, so that you have enough
fuel in your body to support and encourage

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.520
a weight gain and increase in your overall
muscle mass.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.150
And if you're skinny, and not used to eating
these amounts of foods, you need to train

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.569
yourself to increase your appetite.
And if you're finding it a challenge to eat

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.629
all the calories you need, you need to make
sure that every single mouthful you take is

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.400
packed full of healthy, nutritious food, that
will serve your body well, and help you gain

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.510
healthy weight.
So, avoid most sugary food, except for the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.640
'2-hour window' after your training session
ends - and I'll go into this in more detail

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.319
in another video.
So, give sodas and fruit juices a miss, because

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.620
they tend to have these refined sugars as
well - or sugar alternatives - because they're

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.230
way too high in sugar.
'Number 3' to avoid is: Avoid 'empty calorie'

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.150
foods such as white flour products, because
your body treats these in a similar way to

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.940
sugar.
So instead of white bread, choose wholemeal

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.930
bread. And instead of normal pasta, go for
whole wheat pasta.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.560
And then finally, you want to minimize your
consumption of alcohol as well, if your aim

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.239
is to gain healthy weight. Again, alcoholic
drinks tend to be loaded with empty calories.

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.560
And alcohol actually has a 'catabolic' - a
destructive effect - on muscle. Meaning it

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.510
actually depletes your body of muscle stores.
Now, does this mean you can't have ANY of

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.730
these 4 categories of foods at all?
Well, not exactly. It's more about not going

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.349
'overboard', and making these more of an occasional
treat, than a regular occurrence.

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.170
Just remember that the more closely that you
follow a healthy and nutritious, calorie dense,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.240
whole food diet, the more your body will 'thank'
you for it and reward you too - with healthy

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.110
gains in your weight.
Okay, that brings us to the end of this video.
