00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.070
Speaker 1: All right.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.270
Next thing we're going to talk about is basketball.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.250
It doesn't matter if it's basketball, football,
or baseball, but I have a basketball on my

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.250
hands.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.250
Let's just talk about that.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.730
A lot of kids I deal with, everybody wants
to be quick.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.984
Everybody wants to be able to get to the hole,
and that's important.

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:15.984
Let's be realistic.

00:00:15.984 --> 00:00:28.101
The fundamentals are great, but let's teach
the kids how to be quicker and take a ball,

00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:29.101
put it in their hands, and make them quicker,
all right?

00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:30.750
A lot of kids I train for basketball will
train for shooting, proper technique, how

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.750
to shoot, how to release.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.750
How do they explode?

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.750
Okay?

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.750
If you got a kid and you're teaching him the
triple threat where you're here and you drive

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.750
off the back foot, if you're standing straight
up again, it's harder to explode to that corner

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.750
to shoot.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.750
What we do is put the ball here, keep it away,
and we take that first step.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.750
Bam!

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.750
We're going to take that first step.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.950
It's very important to take a basketball step
and explode.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.320
You need to get past that defense.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:01:09.940
It's just [inaudible 0:01:05] inches and some
of the shots that we get on when we play basketball.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.770
It's our job to get quicker to the spot.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.990
You pull up for the jumper.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.090
Get a proper form where the defender can't
get to, okay?

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.090
Again, left, right.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.090
I take that ball around here and I work on
that first step, okay?

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.060
When we get to the point, we get that first
step, you square up, ball up, release, release

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.870
point, okay?

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.291
We need for the same thing to hold true for
our defensive players.

00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:41.460
Defensive players need to do the same thing.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.280
They're taking a first step on.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.680
You need to take your first step.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.233
I want to equate some of our training of our
gaining ground to both defense and offense,

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:51.233
okay?

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:52.233
For every action, there's a reaction.

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:57.110
Our defender here, the defender needs to take
that first step too.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.060
If the offensive player is taking that first
step and they're driving off of there, that

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.810
first step is here, okay?

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.500
As a defender, it's up facing this guy, I
have to open up that hip and stay with him

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.500
on that step.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.500
I need to stay belly to belly with that offensive
player, okay?

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.500
What I'm doing is I'm just taking a little
bit of fun here with a basketball, but I want

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:21.300
to show you how it's important and how the
bands can work for you in a functional manner

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.690
for basketball.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.330
Now, I'll train my kids, but also a little
warm up before a game and I'll let them use

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.390
the bands for a few minutes.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.760
Even in the locker room if they don't want
to be seen with the bands on.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:45.940
Somehow, someway, I let them use the band
because they train with the bands and we want

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.134
them to perform like they've had the bands
on and open up those hips.

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:49.134
If you train with the kinetic bands and you
do a kinetic stretch, and then you do a couple

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:54.330
of drill specific in the locker room or on
the court, you're going to have the advantage

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.770
on that other team.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.870
That means if you're wrestling and you're
in the pit ready to come on the mat and you

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.640
have five, 10 minutes of warm up, you've got
the advantage on your competitors.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.210
Football is the same way.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.850
If your muscles come out firing, it's going
to take those guys two to three minutes to

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.810
catch up with you, all right?

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.970
I want you to keep that in mind.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.510
Kinetic band training is a whole another level.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.800
It makes you feel better.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.630
It makes you feel faster.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.820
Your body is more responsive, more explosive,
and we reduce the risk of injury by giving

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.060
you range of motion and flexibility.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.401
This is the stuff something every coach needs
to start instilling in their program and start

00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:33.401
getting back to the fundamentals.
