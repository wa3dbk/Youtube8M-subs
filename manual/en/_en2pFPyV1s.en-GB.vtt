00:44
COMM: The zoo keepers decided to give the

00:00:48.821 --> 00:00:55.370

the cub, this could make him more sociable

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.129
with other youngsters and will stop him being
attacked by aggressive adult males.

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.100
01:01
COMM: And he is thriving and growing up fast,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.380
he may look cute now, but the cub will grow
to be a 5ft long awesome hunter and weigh

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.369
up to 50lbs, but his raw still needs a bit
of work.

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:36.990
01:22
COMM: The cub is fed every 4 hours 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.000
and doesn't seem to be a fan of bath time.

COMM: Clouded leopards are native to South

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.969
East Asia but their habitat is being destroyed
by deforestation and they are often targeted

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:59.149
by poachers, the team will continue to care
for the costed kitty till its 3 months old

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:27.310
when they will decide on his future, no doubt
the cute cub will be short of offers.
