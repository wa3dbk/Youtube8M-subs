00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.940
John: Good morning, Hank. It's Monday.

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.220
Using the magical power of green screens I have
 transported myself to your home office

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.460
in Missoula, Montana, to show you something 
that has been annoying the crap out of me.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.240
Let's go to the tape

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.520
You're making a nice video blog, it's funny, 
everybody's laughing. There, there! Enhance!

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.100
There it is! That thing. Ah, it's so annoying. 
Hank, it's GLaDOS.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.140
She has to go; she's annoying me. 
If only this weren't a green screen.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.680
Oh, wait, it's not. Goodbye GLaDOS.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.900
Uh-ooooooh!
The Illustrated Guide to Free Hugs just broke.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.460
Hank (off-screen): Did you break her? 
John: Everything's fine.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.700
Hank: That's, like, my favorite thing. 
John: Nothing is broken.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.480
Look, it's Hank! Ow! 
Wow, that was unnecessary.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.840
Hank: This is a slidey chair. 
You didn't change the poster.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.100
John: Oh sorry, I can fix that. 
Bam! Done.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.080
Hank: This is- I mean, it's just a bit, uh... obnoxious.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.520
John: Is it? Is that too forward?

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.800
I don't know what happens if you go to that link.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.500
So I flew all the way to Montana so I could be in a hankgames video.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.780
Hank: It's Hank and John play FIFA 11.
John: Poorly.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.860
Hank: Very badly. Man.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.600
Oh, when you get to the 
penalty kicks.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.880
That's the second episode.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.300
John: Ah, yeah. Stay tuned for tomorrow

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.800
when you will see us miss nineteen consecutive penalties.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.440
Um, but we played perhaps the worst match

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.080
that Liverpool and Arsenal have ever played.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.040
Hank: Yes, hold on a second. 
(laughter)

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.620
John: You can watch it right there at youtube.com/hankgames.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.960
Hank: We should make that a clickable link 
John: There's also a link in the dooblydoo.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.320
And also in the future, I'm going to be making 
more hankgames videos with Hank

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.960
which I'm really excited about because,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.440
I'm really bad at video games, but I'm really passionate about them,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.720
the same way I felt about skateboarding when I was ten.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.660
Another thing, I have a punishment

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.480
and I can't do the sandwich punishment.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.520
Hank: Because, do you want to show them your scars?

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.780
John: Not really. 
Hank: Okay.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.400
John: You'll just have to trust me that I was 
lately removed from my gall bladder.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.100
Hank: (laughs) Really, your gall bladder got the worst 
part of that deal.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.600
John: That's true. I wrote a haiku for the 
occasion, actually.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.580
Hank: Oh. 
John: Would you like to hear it?

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.600
Hank: Yes please. 
(John clears his throat)

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.980
“Stupid gall bladder. Not performing properly. 
I will kill you now!”

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.980
Yeah. So my gall bladder was taken out

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.980
which means I can't really do the sandwich punishment,

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.300
so if you could suggest a different punishment for me,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.840
I would appreciate it, and Hank will pick one.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.120
In other news, we do have a punishment for Hank.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.300
So in addition to bringing myself and my family to Montana,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.660
I also brought one box full of sheets from The Fault in Our Stars.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.240
Hank: Which is seventy-four hundred sheets. 
John: And that is 5% of the total.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.700
Hank: And I'm going to Hanklerfish all of them 
John: Hanklerfish?

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.340
Hank: I'm going to Hanklerfish them. I'm going to write 
an anglerfish on each one of those pieces of paper

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.560
which means you'll have a 5% chance of getting
a Hanklerfished Fault In Our Stars

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.980
John: Hanklerfished... 
Hank: It's a verb. I made up a word and I verbed it.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.720
(John laughing)
Hank: I just verbed verb.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.820
John: So a Hanklerfish is an anglerfish drawn by a Hank.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.480
Hank: Yeah, uhuh. 
There are other Hanks that can make Hanklerfish.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.000
(John laughs)

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.220
John: So, like, if Hank Williams the Third were to draw 
me an anglerfish that would be a Hanklerfish?

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.160
Hank: It would also be a Hanklerfish.
 It would probably be better than mine, too.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.460
John: So I had to bring all these copies of 
The Fault in Our Stars

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.960
because I can't take a week off from signing.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.600
Hank: Right, he has to sign them anyways. 
He had to bring them to sign them.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.120
John: Uh, yeah. Just in case you don't know, by the way,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.320
everybody who pre-orders The Fault in Our Stars 
will get a signed book. (H: Hold on a sec!)

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.000
John: All pre-ordered copies will be signed.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.500
John: And five percent- 
Hank: Will be Hanklerfished.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.580
John: Alright, uh, we've gotta go to breakfast.
Nerdfighters, don't forget to be awesome. Best wishes.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.580
Hank: Don't talk to me about my shirt or 
I will put forks in you.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.800
John: What is that from?

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.440
Hank: It's from a really old Vlogbrothers video. 
(J: I mean uh...) Ningmaster Tom Made this.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.800
John: We have so many inside jokes that I don't even get.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.980
Hank: (laughs) It's been a long run.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.160
John: Don't talk to me about my t-shirt or 
I will put forks in you.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.840
That's a great t-shirt, actually. 
Hank: I know.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.600
John: We should make- that should be a thing. 
Hank: Well, I kinda like me having the only one.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.560
John: (laughs) Alright, uh, goodbye. 
Hank: Goodbye.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.864
John: Hank, I'll see you when I turn off the camera. 
Hank: Okay.
