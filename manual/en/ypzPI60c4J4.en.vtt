00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.360
Hi this is Gary with MacMost.com.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.220
Let's look at all the different printing options
you have in iPhoto.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.860
I'm using iPhoto version 9.5.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.740
I'm going to show you printing photos.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.679
Now of course you can select photos.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.540
Let's go into an Event here and select a set
of photos and you can Order Prints which is

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.540
handy to do.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.670
But say you want to use your own printer.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.020
Then you want to go to just the regular Print
function and here you have a variety of options

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.070
on the right.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.750
For instance you can fill each page with the
photo.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.800
Fill it with a closer margin right there.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.460
This one will fit and fill.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.340
The difference is that Fit is going to make
sure the entire photo is printed even if there

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.310
has to be some larger margins above and below
or left and right.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.800
Whereas Fill may crop out some parts of the
photo like the left and right sides so it

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.440
always fills the entire sheet.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.580
You can do a standard 8 x 10 or you can also
do 5 x7 or 4 x 6 and it will group those two

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.780
per page.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.080
You can also choose Custom.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.920
Custom then will allow you to select an aspect
ratio.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.320
In this case I'm just going to leave it there
on Custom effect and then I'm going to change

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.320
the photo size.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.041
So you can shrink it down or enlarge it.

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:20.360
If it gets too large for one page it will
go here.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.920
So 5 x 2 is a little bit too long.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.799
So let's just do something standard like a
4 x 3 and you can see here as I adjust say

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.640
the width the height will automatically adjust
to fit.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.960
So it turns out a 4 x 3 I can fit all six
photos here on one page.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.210
Now another variation on this to go to Contact
Sheet.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.049
What Contact Sheet is going to give you that
the others aren't are captions and things

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.049
underneath.

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.030
So here you can adjust all sorts of different
things.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.970
Like the margins between the photos and you
can adjust how many columns are involved.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.020
If you get too many columns here it will then
go to another page.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.200
So you are not really worrying about the picture
size per se but how many you can fit on a

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.540
page here.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.500
So we do it like that.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.189
Also you can go to Captions and there is a
whole bunch of different styles for Captions

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:14.500
here that you can use and you can add things
like descriptions.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.439
This is photo has a description on it.

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.409
The camera that was used.

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.450
You can include Keywords, Filename.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.719
All sorts of things that can come in handy
you can put there in the Caption and print

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:27.719
them out.

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.870
So it is not so much printing to use for typical
purposes but maybe to print these out for

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.829
someone to be able to look at them and pick
one they like.

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.569
Or just for you to kind of have a printed
archive of your photos.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.879
Remember with any of these you can always
print to PDF.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.459
So I can go to Print.

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.029
I can choose my printer and all the options
that are specific to my printer but I can

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:55.950
also go to PDF and open it in Preview or Save
directly to a PDF file.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.870
You also have the ability to do some interesting
things like Add PDF to iBooks.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.870
So image, for instance, if I were to select
all my photos, say several hundred from a

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.150
set, and then print it like this it would
be many pages.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.279
Add PDF directly to iBooks and then in iBooks
on my iPad I've got this book that I can page

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.950
through showing all my photos.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.090
So there is a lot of cool little things you
can do if you kind of think outside the box

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.950
with the options in the PDF menu.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.290
Now in any of these layouts where you can
adjust the picture so pretty much everything

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.709
except for Fit and Contact Sheet, because
Contact Sheet is driven by the number of columns,

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.471
you can click on a photo and then zoom in
on it and even adjust what part of the photo

00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:42.109
you want to print out.

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.340
So you can do that without adjusting the photo
itself.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.999
The original photo isn't touched it is just
on this printout it is going to zoom in this

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:49.999
area of the photo.

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.370
So you have the ability to do that.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.269
Of course you can use other apps to print
the photos from your iPhoto collection as

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.269
well.

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:03.169
For instance, let's go into Pages here and
create a blank document where I can view the

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.250
layout and see the entire page.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.680
I am going to go to Setup and turn off the
document body so I basically have a page layout

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.750
document here.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.120
Then go to Media and there is my photos from
iPhoto, the ones we were just looking at.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.840
So I can select one.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.960
It will put it in here and then I've got a
ton of options how to size it to fit on this

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960
page.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.230
So, for instance, I can go in and add a cool
border to it like a picture frame border.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.420
I can do some adjustments.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:43.040
I can go ahead and add some text and put the
text underneath as a caption if I want.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.390
So there is a lot of different things I can
do.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.780
I can even put shapes like arrows to point
at things if I want to.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.200
So there is a lot you can do if you exit iPhoto
but still use the photos there and use another

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.370
app like Pages to create something really
cool.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.590
Then I can print this out onto a sheet and
the photo will still be the same quality but

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.730
now I've got all this extra stuff that I've
done and put on the page.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.730
You can also use Pages to do something that
is really not possible to do in iPhoto, in

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.370
the current version.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.220
You can print multiple copies of the same
photo.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:24.100
So just going to take this photo back down
to normal size here with normal options.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.920
Set it to be about 3 inches wide and then
I'm going to option drag to create duplicates

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.920
of it.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.330
Then I'll take the time to align these up
and then print this page out and then I can

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.670
have multiple copies of the same photo on
one sheet of paper on my printer.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.780
One last option I want to show you is to create
a book.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.020
You usually think of creating these as things
you have Apple print for you.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:56.460
But you can create a book here and just select
anything you want, create it, and you end

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.080
up with pages in the book that you can print.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.000
You don't have to send it to Apple.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.970
So you can go here and say Print and you get
pages from the book here.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:17.030
For instance, if I were to design just a page
out of the book like this one right here and

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.620
I wanted to send that to my printer, I can
see that is page 4 so I just send from 4 to

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.950
4 to the printer.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:30.980
That is kind of handy to have and you can
do some nice design work in these books ignoring

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.520
the pages that you are not actually going
to print and just working on designing some

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.640
cool pages that can be used to print at home.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.480
Of course you can also save these out as PDFs.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.000
So it is also handy to create say a book that
you never intend to print but intend to save

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.780
as a PDF and view it that way.
