00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.420
The first one is the basic,
the second one will be the whisk.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.259
Here is the whisk.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:20.230
One a two, three a four,
five a six, seven a eight.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.230
The whisk.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.199
Iâ€™ll demonstrate this by myself,
since the ladies step

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.430
is the same as the manâ€™s step,
just a mirror image.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.310
We have dance hold.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.210
We are going over to the side.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:42.870
One, a two,
three a four.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.899
And repeating it,
five a six,

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.980
seven a eight.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.870
With my back to you,
one a two,

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.680
three a four,
five a six,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.430
seven a eight.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.600
A description,
sideways,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.210
left foot side, one
place the big toe of the right foot

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.300
just behind the heel.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:27.180
A. press up using the back foot
and quickly replace back

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.400
onto the front foot.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.110
Same thing on this side, step,
big toe of the left foot

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.280
behind the front heel,
push up replace.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.910
So you get this feeling
of the feet and ankle

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.850
working in unioson.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.520
Step and step,
step and step.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.130
Now we do it together.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.700
We incorporate the basic first,
one a two three a four,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.990
five a six, seven a eight.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.550
Whisk.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.830
One a two, three a four,
five a six, seven a eight.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:23.180
In samba
we usually do four of each pattern

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.000
to fit in with the phrase of music.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.020
Four bars to one section of the music.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.010
And leading it is very simple.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.660
We simply move the body frame
in once piece and the lady will feel that

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.280
and do her steps.
