00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.243
This one is simply called...

00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:02.896
"What're you saying?"

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.300
Hey guys, my name's Darko and today I'm joined with my brother

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.080
Jure

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.580
once again

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.640
For today I thought we would do a challenge video

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.240
I saw Mamrie, Hannah and Grace do the "fart sound boards challenge"

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.000
and it was so funny I thought, "Lets do it."

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.600
they did it with alcohol but because Jure's under-aged we must...

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.860
not use alcohol

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.760
so we take shots when we lose, or?

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.260
yeah.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.060
the rules are,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.520
for example. If it's my turn, I name the fart and I play it, and if you laugh

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.100
to either of those actions

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.160
(the playing of the fart and the naming of the fart)

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.865
you drink a shot of vinegar

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:42.285
got all we need

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.640
this one's yours because it ain't clean (heh), clean it up

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.000
I did not do that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.500
anyway

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.600
Shane would be proud

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.440
Shane would be proud.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.840
ok, lets begin

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.360
lets play rock, paper, scisors.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.000
playing...

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.320
Ahh, you win. You go first

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.790
You name the fart and then you play it.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.410
ANd I mustn't laugh. wait, wait

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.130
Puff Daddy.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.860
but I can laugh right?

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.360
You have to drink.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.900
You can laugh, but you have to drink if I don't.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.660
so drink.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.260
I have a high tolerance for "Puff Daddy" because I already saw it on Grace's video.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.260
pour it up, pour it up.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.720
watch it all fall out.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.360
Not too much. Because this is strong.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.080
oh shyyy

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.700
How was it?

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.400
The aftertaste!

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.560
Shawn Mendes - Aftertaste

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.320
It's my turn. We don't go rock paper scisors.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.800
Only when we decide who starts.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.780
This one is called...

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.040
"OH-OH"

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.300
Fill my cup, put some... vinegar in it.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.202
I'm the only one taking shots..

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.460
It has only begun.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.000
Your turn. Ok.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.780
"Slide Trombone"

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.720
You're cringing.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.567
That's not cringing. That's grinning.

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:15.139
Grinning isn't laughing. I need to laugh.

00:02:15.398 --> 00:02:16.358
I cri everytim

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.530
You cry everytime, I will...

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.798
What's that on your shirt?

00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:22.555
Damn it feels good to be Biggy Smalls.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.920
This one hit me.. I'm really sorry for you. though.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.420
don't look!

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.100
I think it's all about the presentation. How you present the name and how you play it and then...

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.719
Okay, just do it.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.460
This one is called... "Mud Slide."

00:02:45.358 --> 00:02:47.838
Why do you always take the long ones!?

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:52.075
Four shots.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.997
Four shots? It's been four shots? Wow.

00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:55.860
You have to drink on the camera...

00:02:57.032 --> 00:02:58.152
"Tanya farting"

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.319
I survived.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.450
You drink. Noooooo!

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.720
Not again

00:03:21.127 --> 00:03:21.920
bad words Jure...

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.400
I'm getting used to it.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.540
This one is called, "Morning doo."

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.060
Get it, Morning dew?

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.080
Ahhhh.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.420
Ok. The first time. My turn being. Now it is. Ha-ha-ha. Okay..

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.840
Ugh. Pour it up.

00:03:46.448 --> 00:03:47.888
Watch it all fall out.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.517
Ok, I've got more than you had.

00:03:52.127 --> 00:03:53.807
Oh my god that's strong.

00:03:57.685 --> 00:04:00.325
It will be alright young grasshopper.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.860
That's horrible, I'm sorry for you. My turn.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.420
No...

00:04:07.327 --> 00:04:07.887
"No..."

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.500
"Alien encounter."

00:04:14.268 --> 00:04:16.828
Time to take a shot. Ok, that's funny..

00:04:18.263 --> 00:04:18.763

00:04:18.844 --> 00:04:20.124
"Alien encounter"

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.860
You imagine what it could be and then it's that..

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.965
This is your second shot already...

00:04:26.965 --> 00:04:27.465
Hey gurl, hey.

00:04:28.302 --> 00:04:29.822

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.936
This one is called, "Goo-Goo Doo-Doo,"

00:04:42.156 --> 00:04:42.656
Ok.

00:04:47.865 --> 00:04:49.625
Time to take a shot. Noooo.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.640
Yeah-yuh.

00:04:55.898 --> 00:04:58.538
Okay. This one's called "Forest Dump,"

00:04:58.538 --> 00:04:59.818
*Slight chuckle that he takes for a laugh*

00:05:00.476 --> 00:05:02.156
I'm starting to get sick.

00:05:02.663 --> 00:05:03.623
That's right.

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:07.009
Do I still play?

00:05:07.643 --> 00:05:08.843
Play, Play, Play.

00:05:17.893 --> 00:05:18.393
Drink!

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.120
But this round is already over. I didn't laugh, so you drink!

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.226
Okay. We're gonna do 3 more rounds. Mine, yours, mine.

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:27.276
MIne's the last one.

00:05:29.146 --> 00:05:32.506
"This one is simply called, "What are you saying?"

00:05:39.081 --> 00:05:41.881
You played it 2 times! You laughed. Drink!

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.880
You played 2 times.

00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:47.781
I can play it how many times I want.

00:05:48.482 --> 00:05:50.482
Oh, that's a lot of vinegar...

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.800

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.740

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.640
"Donald loves Daisy,"

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:06.599
Not even funny.

00:06:07.053 --> 00:06:07.553
Drink.

00:06:07.553 --> 00:06:08.826
This video's just torture for Jure.

00:06:08.826 --> 00:06:09.740
I'm used to it.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.200

"Monica, you is stinky,"

00:06:21.597 --> 00:06:22.397
God damn it.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.280
Yay-yuh.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.620

00:06:30.264 --> 00:06:33.064
Wow, so that was a fun experience.. Was it?

00:06:33.064 --> 00:06:34.816
Yeah it was, it was alright.

00:06:34.816 --> 00:06:36.581
Did we bond over vinegar drinking?

00:06:37.168 --> 00:06:37.668
