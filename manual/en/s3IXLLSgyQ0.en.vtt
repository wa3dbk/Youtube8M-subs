Hi I'm Karen for Expert Village our cabbage
rolls are all rolled we got about 20 cabbage

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:13.270
rolls now you take the sauce and you spoon
it over here you want to use a lot of sauce

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:22.860
on that, spoon that over, we'll actually just
dump all of that over there and we're going

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.940
to cover it with foil so we want to protect
it from the foil the tomato sauce from the

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:38.160
foil. So you can either use pieces scraps
of the cabbage and lay that all over or I'm

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:49.990
going to use a piece of baking paper and then
I'll cover it with foil. Cover it really tight

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:58.309
because it's if you want it nice and tight
because it's going to steam the rice in the

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:07.560
cabbage roll. So put lot's of foil and wrap
that nice and tight and we're going to cook

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.799
that in a 350 degree oven for about 3 to 4
hours until the rice is and the meat is cooked

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:23.090
all the way through. Our stuff cabbage has
been cooking for about 3 hours and a 350 degree

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:31.450
oven it's all finished now as you can see
I put on the pan a layer of baking paper because

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:44.240
it will bubble over a little bit while it's
cooking. And nice and steamy hot and let me

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:55.950
take one out for you and put it on the plate,
there's a cabbage and we'll just cut it right

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:05.460
in half, see how nice, and you can serve it
with a little bit of the tomato.
