Welcome to the West Wing Week!

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:06.567
Your guide to everything
that's happening in 1600

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:08.000
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.934
This week, the President
welcomed to the White House

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:13.400
the Girl Scouts; the Presidents
of the Philippines and Israel;

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.266
the New York football Giants;
local television anchors from

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.700
across the country;
and Betty White.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.066
He also kicked off the
"Fatherhood Buzz" campaign and

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.934
visited One World Trade Center.

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:26.800
That's June 8th to June 14th
or "The Fatherhood Buzz!"

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.633
The President:
Everybody say cheese!

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:30.166
Children:
Cheeeeeese!

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.834
Narrator:
On Friday, the
President welcomed

00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:34.266
eight recipients of the Girl
Scouts highest achievement,

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:37.700
the Gold Award, who had come
from all over the country to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.900
celebrate the 100th
Anniversary of the Girl Scouts.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.433
Anna Marie Chavez:
We currently have
59 million living

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:44.900
alumni in this country.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.100
The President:
That's a lot of cookies to sell.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.433
Connie Lindsey:
And one interesting
fact, Mr. President,

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:50.533
is that this White House has
more Girl Scouts in senior

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.500
positions than in the
history of our organization.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.934
Narrator:
The President also held
a news conference in the

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:58.033
Briefing Room to urge Congress
to take further actions to

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:00.600
strengthen the economy; held a
bilateral meeting with President

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.500
Aquino of the Philippines;
and hosted the 2012 Superbowl

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.233
Champion New York Giants.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.533
The President:
Give the New York Giants
a big round of applause!

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.300
(applause)

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.767
Narrator:
On Monday, as part of
"Live from the White House,"

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:15.633
the President participated in
interviews in the Cabinet Room

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:18.867
with local television anchors
from Virginia, South Carolina,

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:23.133
Florida, Iowa, Wisconsin,
Colorado, Nevada and California.

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.667
Also on Monday, West Wing Week
caught up with Betty White for

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:28.533
some Q and A about how a
President Betty White would

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:32.033
take charge in the White House
or rather "White's House."

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:33.533
Betty White:
Welcome to White's House!

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:42.667
♪♪ (Big band orchestra music) ♪♪

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:47.300
Robert Redford comes to my mind,
but he comes to my mind with

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.700
practically anything
anybody asks me.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.166
I think a good Vice President
would be probably a Saint

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:59.600
Bernard because he's big.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.500
Narrator:
On Tuesday, we put Senior
Advisor for the National

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.734
Economic Council Jim Parrott
on the clock to outline the

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:09.200
President's refinancing
proposal in 60 seconds or less.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.500
And go!

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.967
Jim Parrott:
The problem we're trying
to address is actually

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:12.734
really straightforward.

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:15.667
You've got millions of families
out there today who despite

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:18.700
paying their mortgages on time
for years now are locked out of

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.266
the refinancing market because
home values in the neighborhoods

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:24.200
have plummeted so as a result
they are stuck in a 6 or 7%

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.834
mortgage when the rest
of us are paying 3 to 4%.

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:28.800
It weighs on their pocketbooks,
it weighs on the economy,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.734
it's just a bad deal all around.

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:33.000
So what we've done is put
forward a three-part proposal

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.800
that would help open the market
up for these families really in

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.734
three ways: The first way is
it expands and improves on HARP

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:40.900
which is a program designed
to help just these folks with

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.800
GSE-guaranteed mortgages; the
second way is it provides these

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.433
folks with an incentive to
actually take a shorter-term

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.133
loan which helps
them rebuild equity,

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:51.900
get themselves above
water much more quickly;

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.700
and the third way is taking the
very same refinancing idea in

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.400
HARP and making it available for
borrowers who don't happen to

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.333
have GSE or FHA insured loans.

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:03.467
Is that good?

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:06.367
Narrator:
On Wednesday, the President
kicked off the "Fatherhood Buzz"

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:10.400
initiative, a barbershop-based
outreach campaign, by inviting

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.433
four other dads for lunch to
talk about the fatherhood buzz.

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:15.000
The President:
It turns out with the
father being involved

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.367
the kids are less
likely to do drugs,

00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:20.300
girls are less likely to get
involved in pregnancy and so

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.033
that message is something
that we want to make sure

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:25.166
gets out there.

00:03:25.166 --> 00:03:26.934
Narrator:
Later, the President
awarded the Medal of

00:03:26.934 --> 00:03:29.633
Freedom to President
Shimon Peres of Israel,

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:33.066
an ardent advocate of
Israel's security and peace,

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:37.000
Shimon Peres was elected the
9th President of Israel in 2007.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.333
Through his life and work he
has strengthened the unbreakable

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:42.000
bond between Israel
and the United States.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.900
On Thursday, the President
traveled west to Ohio.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.367
And much to the surprise of
those Clevelanders expecting

00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:50.500
just another regular Thursday
afternoon in Cuyahoga County,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.834
the President of the
United States dropped

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:53.033
by for a friendly visit.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.934
(screaming and giggles)

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:55.567
The President:
Good to see 'ya!

00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:56.166
And what's your name?

00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:56.834
Terry?

00:03:56.834 --> 00:03:58.500
What's your name, man?

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.166
(giggles)

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:01.233
Student:
Look at Tyrone.

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:03.500
He's talking to the President!

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.166
Small Child:
Right here!

00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:05.800
The President:
I didn't see you.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.633
How are you doin'?

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:07.200
Small Child:
Good.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.133
The President:
You doin' good?

00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:09.800
Narrator:
The President then met up
with the First Lady in New

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.734
York City to visit the Port
Authority of New York and New

00:04:12.734 --> 00:04:15.934
Jersey's World Trade Center site
to meet with workers and get an

00:04:15.934 --> 00:04:19.066
update on construction progress.

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:21.867
And now a look to the "Rhodes
Ahead" and next week's G-20

00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:24.867
summit in Mexico with Deputy
National Security Advisor for

00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:27.100
Strategic Communications,
Ben Rhodes.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.400
Ben Rhodes:
Hi, everybody.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.266
So next week the President will
be going to Las Cabos, Mexico,

00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:34.033
for the G-20 summit.

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:36.633
There he'll meet with other
world leaders to talk about

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:39.900
the ongoing challenges in the
European economy and our ongoing

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.867
efforts to coordinate our
actions with countries around

00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:44.633
the world to sustain a
global economic recovery.

00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:48.800
The G-20 is a group of nations
that accounts for 90% of the

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.000
world's domestic,
gross domestic product;

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.100
80% of the world's trade;
and over two-thirds of the

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.300
world's population.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.133
So it's the one forum that
leaders come together every

00:04:57.133 --> 00:04:59.834
year to have discussions about
how to coordinate their actions

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:01.200
on the global economy.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.567
The President will also be able
to have his first meeting with

00:05:03.567 --> 00:05:07.100
President Vladimir Putin since
he got elected President of

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.266
Russia once more.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.767
And so the two leaders will have
a chance to talk about a lot of

00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:13.233
issues from Syria to the
global economy as well.

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:16.200
So we look forward to seeing
everybody in Mexico next week.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.433
It's an exciting
time to be in Mexico.

00:05:18.433 --> 00:05:20.500
It's two weeks before an
election there as well.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.433
And we'll keep you posted.

00:05:22.433 --> 00:05:24.700

00:05:31.967 --> 00:05:32.967
a gem from the archives.

00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:33.700
The President:
It's a great honor to
meet you. Congratulations!

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.367
Wilbur Fiass:
Well, thank you, sir.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:34.967

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:35.433
Voice behind the camera:
Amazing.

00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:36.667
The President:
Huh? This is wonderful.

00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:38.600
You've got to tell me your
secret for staying married

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.967
for 79 years.

00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:41.600
I love that story.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.100
Wilbur Fiass:
You should know what it is.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.066
The President:
You just do what
she tells you to do?

00:05:44.066 --> 00:05:45.300
Wilbur Fiass:
No. Compromise!

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.000
The President:
Oh, well, there you go.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.133
(laughter)

00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:47.934
Wilbur Fiass:
You know that very
well. Don't you?

00:05:47.934 --> 00:05:49.767
The President:
Absolutely.

00:05:49.767 --> 00:05:51.767
(chuckles)

00:05:51.767 --> 00:05:53.000
The President:
That's a great story.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.900
Seventy-nine years!
