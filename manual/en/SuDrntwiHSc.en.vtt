00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:22.160
I'll spare you the usual spiel about the name
of this game, and get directly into the meat

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.240
and potatoes: WHAT THE HELL IS ACCLAIM'S NAME
DOING ON THIS THING?

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.949
Was Taito in such a stage that they had to
throw the former House of NBA JAM into this

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.349
mix?

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.349
I haven't the slightest idea.

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:37.420
But crazy-ass branding aside, It's almost
impossible to screw up a Bust-A-Move game.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.100
All you need is a playfield, a weird bubble
cannon thing, a number of candy-colored bubbles

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.149
at the top of the screen to aim at, and maybe
some cameos by the cast of Bubble Bobble.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.149
That's it.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.530
That's all you need.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.000
And this arcade-ported version gives you...

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.370
well, exactly that.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.280
This isn't the kind of game that's going to
sit you down and tell a story about a fanciful

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.810
island where two kids got turned into dinosaurs
once and then they fixed that and learned

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.390
how to wield rainbows... nuts to that.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.770
Most you're going to get is a strange (but
decently-animated) introductory pantomime,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.250
and then BAM.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.270
Straight into the action.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.810
The primary challenge in this Arcade Edition
involves head-to-head matchups against a slew

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.560
of computer opponents, who - even on normal
difficulty - are really good at this game.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.409
I mean, really good.

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.290
It becomes kinda obvious kinda quickly that
this very direct port still has its unflinching

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.200
determination set on opening your wallet and
depleting your supply of quarters... problem

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.960
is, this is a home version, and there aren't
any quarters involved.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.689
(I'd try jamming some into my Saturn, but
that would be stupid.)

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.299
No, instead you're simply presumed to have
a stock of nine credits, with which to pound

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.810
your way through robotic cats and girls who
materialize out of cotton candy.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.229
But what's a puzzle game without a solipsistic,
single-player puzzle mode?

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.829
Preferably one that involves having to land
carom shots off the side walls, enough to

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.039
make Minnesota Fats revolve in his grave.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.739
As has become the trend for Bust-A-Move titles,
the puzzle mode branches out in a lattice

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.830
fashion to include an alphabet's worth of
different puzzle packs.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.300
These tend to be less fixated on rushing down
an opponent in bubble-to-bubble combat, and

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.220
more about getting the most out of each bubble
fired.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.300
(Though it is worth mentioning that you're
still working on a time limit.)

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.030
In both modes, the playfield shrinks every
so often, so you've gotta keep your stack

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.580
low - preferably by severing large stacks
of bubbles from the top of the screen, thus

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.380
optimizing your output - in order to survive.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.470
This Saturn version, along with the PC version,
also features an Edit Mode for creating your

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.330
own bubblestacks to destroy, as well as a
strange quirk of the audio mix where the pleasant

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
"You win" jingle sounds like it's being played
from another room or something.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.420
But I can tolerate a strange audio mix.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.820
Not like I can hear it anyway.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.000
My ears are filled with loathing resentment
for that puff-wearing jungle girl and her

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.580
bubble-bursting antics.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.830
Friend-of-the-show Jeanie in PA, sorry, I'm
monopolizing this thing until she tastes bubbly

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.680
defeat.
