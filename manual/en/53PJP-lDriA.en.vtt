Hi! My name is Cortney on behalf of Expert
Village and this clip we are going to be making

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.050
a butterfly out of tissue paper. The first
thing you are going to need is take 2 pieces

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:23.029
of black construction paper, put them together
and fold them in half horizontally.

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.820
Then we are going to take a white pencil and
we are going to draw half a butterfly so when

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:39.300
we open it up at the end it would symmetrical
and I'm just going to free hand this. Once

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:52.600
you draw the outline for your butterfly you
are going to cut it out. Keeping it folded

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:01.970
we are now going to draw, we are now going
to draw the design for the wings. You want

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.880
to make this big enough so you can cut out
if there are to small you are going to have

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:17.369
a harder time.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:26.530
Once you have drawn you circles you are going
to cut those out. Once you have cut the holes

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.930
out of your butterfly it will look like this
and know we are going to take some tissue

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:41.409
paper and fill in the parts that we cut out.
I have picked some purple and yellow tissue

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:49.060
paper what you want to do is just cut these
so that they overlap the holes that you cut

00:01:49.060 --> 00:02:05.259
and ti does not have to be perfect. We are
going to put some glue on the edges and then

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.480
we are going to glue down our tissue paper
and if there is any remaining hanging over

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:24.030
the edge you can just trim that up. Then we
would do the same with the purple on the top.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.280
We have now glued the tissue paper at the
bottom and the top. To give this a more of

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.500
a clean finish look we are going to take our
second butterfly, this was our first one that

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.160
we did and we put the tissue on it, now we
are going to take the second one and glue

00:02:39.160 --> 00:03:01.730
it on the back. We put some glue down

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.590
and we lay it on top and now we have our finished
butterfly.
