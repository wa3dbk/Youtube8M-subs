00:00:01.513 --> 00:00:02.651
- We're Rainy Day Dreamers.

00:00:02.651 --> 00:00:04.693
- And we're very excited
because The Toy Insider

00:00:04.693 --> 00:00:06.375
has sent us our latest box.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:08.308
This is the June box, and a YouTubers

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:09.934
Surprise Box Party.

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:11.628
What could be inside?

00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:15.471
♫ Rainy Day Dreamers,

00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:18.315
♫ Rainy Day Dreamers ♫

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:19.976
- Thank you to The Toy Insider for

00:00:19.976 --> 00:00:21.393
sending us this month's box.

00:00:21.393 --> 00:00:22.612
- [Both Girls] Thank you.

00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:24.586
- Thank you so much to The Toy Insider

00:00:24.586 --> 00:00:26.605
for choosing us to be a part of their

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:31.138
new YouTube monthly
Toy Surprise Box Party.

00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:32.871
- Each month, The Toy Insider is going to

00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:34.867
send us a box of toys to review

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:37.410
and we won't know ahead of
time what is in the box.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.873
- Do we know what's in this box?

00:00:38.873 --> 00:00:39.930
- No.
- [Roxanna] No.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.836
- Let's find out what's in this box.

00:00:41.836 --> 00:00:44.158
This is exciting!

00:00:44.158 --> 00:00:46.504
Now, if you don't know
The Toy Insider, they have

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:49.997
a website and they have
folks that go out on TV shows

00:00:49.997 --> 00:00:52.319
talking about the latest
toys that are coming up

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:54.363
for Christmas and holidays, so we'll have

00:00:54.363 --> 00:00:56.964
a link to their website
down below this video.

00:00:56.964 --> 00:00:59.958
We're hoping we'll get
some cool new stuff in here

00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.699
that we've never seen before.

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.545
Ready?

00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:08.818
Oh, it looks so party-ish!

00:01:09.658 --> 00:01:12.875
Hey, we got something addressed to us.

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:15.207
I guess I better read this
first, Roxanna tells me

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:17.055
that the etiquette is to read the card

00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:18.493
before you open the present, right?

00:01:18.493 --> 00:01:20.894
- Mm-hmm.
- [Parris] Okay.

00:01:21.954 --> 00:01:25.359
- This is to all of
us, Rainy Day Dreamers.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:26.531
"Hi, Rainy Day Dreamers."

00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:29.551
Why don't you guys read
that, my voice is done.

00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:32.909
- "Happy June, since you loved 'Kahuna'",

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.963
- That was the game we
reviewed from last month's box.

00:01:34.963 --> 00:01:37.657
- "Kahuna so much, we
decided to make this month's

00:01:37.657 --> 00:01:39.900
"Surprise Box all about games!"

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.429
Yes!
- [Parris] Cool, ok, Roxanna?

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.287
- "From card to party,
to strategy, there's

00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:48.387
"tons of games in this
box you're sure to love.

00:01:48.387 --> 00:01:51.081
"We can't wait to find out
what your favorites are."

00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:52.182
- Okay, last thing?

00:01:52.182 --> 00:01:53.227
- "Happy playing!"

00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:55.166
- We love the games.

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:56.988
This is gonna be a good one.

00:01:56.988 --> 00:02:01.203
Okay, I'm already seeing
abacus thing here.

00:02:01.203 --> 00:02:04.209
I don't even know how to say
the name of this, Quadrillion.

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.986
Doesn't that look kinda like an abacus?

00:02:06.986 --> 00:02:10.305
Why don't you take that one.

00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:12.325
Oh, I've heard of this one.

00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:14.102
Oh, but this is different,
"Apples to Apples",

00:02:14.102 --> 00:02:15.317
- [Ximena] Oh yes!
- [Parris] People suggested we

00:02:15.317 --> 00:02:18.434
try this, it says "Apples
to Apples Freestyle".

00:02:21.064 --> 00:02:23.247
Oh my goodness, this looks cool.

00:02:23.247 --> 00:02:26.846
"Strike A Pose, the fun
and frantic freeze phrase

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:29.076
frame game."

00:02:29.076 --> 00:02:32.713
Okay, that one you gotta
play standing up, I think.

00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:37.863
This one exploded on the way here.

00:02:37.863 --> 00:02:42.484
It's got those little magneticky stones.

00:02:42.484 --> 00:02:43.494
Get back in there!

00:02:43.494 --> 00:02:44.469
What is this called?

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.673
"Hearts Of Attraction, the
game you can't resist."

00:02:47.673 --> 00:02:49.369
Hmm!

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.605
What is this?

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:57.692
"A to Z, the game that covers
everything from A to Z.

00:02:57.692 --> 00:02:59.863
"Things that are hot, fire, salsa, coffee,

00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:02.731
my boyfriend", okay.

00:03:02.731 --> 00:03:04.612
I think it talks to you.

00:03:04.612 --> 00:03:09.023
I think it's like 20
Questions or Guess The Object.

00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:11.405
Put that one over here.

00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:15.911
Nice and colorful.

00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:19.057
Here's a big one, I thought
this was Battleship at first,

00:03:19.057 --> 00:03:23.996
it's called "Dominate,
the sliding puzzle game".

00:03:24.906 --> 00:03:27.108
- Wow.
- [Ximena] Ooh.

00:03:27.108 --> 00:03:29.163
- [Parris] Guys, we're
gonna be mentally taxed

00:03:29.163 --> 00:03:31.613
to the limit with all of these games.

00:03:31.613 --> 00:03:33.851
Looks like it's gonna be
a fun next week or two,

00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:34.446
don't you think,
- [Roxanna] Yeah.

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:35.804
- [Parris] trying out all these games?

00:03:35.804 --> 00:03:37.590
