&gt;&gt; DARREN: Grand National is not only one of the biggest racing events of the year, it has become one of the biggest fashion events too.

00:00:09.501 --> 00:00:13.500
With the ladies stealing the limelight I wanted to turn my attention to the men.

00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:18.500
So I have challenged to fashion bloggers, Matt and Paul, to show us how to pick great occasion wear from the Matalan range.

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:22.500
&gt;&gt; PAUL: I’m Paul Mcgregor, I’m the founder and editor of MensFashionMagazine.co.uk.

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:26.500
&gt;&gt;MATT: My name’s Matt and I’m the editor of ManSnaps.com.

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:34.500
I love everything about fashion. I love the fact that you can be a different character, you can be unique, you can play around with things now.

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:42.500
You can pick up a print and clash it, you can be smart. I love the fact that you can pick whatever you want to be that day and go with it.

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:45.500
&gt;&gt;PAUL: A lot brands are now releasing more men’s collections. 

00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:54.500
There’s defiantly more choice in occasion wear now for men. Men can go out and buy a blazer, they can go out and buy suit trousers and mix that together. 

00:00:54.501 --> 00:01:02.500
My style is quite timeless and also, of course, I like to wear accessories. Anything that really adds an individual touch to a look.

00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:08.500
&gt;&gt;MATT: The thing I’m really excited about in men’s fashion at the moment is prints. Right now, men can play around with quirky designs.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:14.500
So I’m going to show how you can mix prints with occasion wear and make it suitable for an occasion like this. 

00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:19.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: Well the guys seem pretty confident, so it’s time to put their style skills to the test.

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:23.500
Let’s see how they get on in Matalan putting together a look for the races.

00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:32.500
&gt;&gt; MATT: The outfit I’ve decided to wear to the races today is all based around this printed flamingo shirt.

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:44.500
What I’m really trying to do is bring prints into occasion wear. I’ve teamed it with this navy block blazer, these coloured chinos and these suede desert boots.      

00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:57.500
&gt;&gt; PAUL: I went for this three piece blue suit from Taylor &amp; Wright. I’ve paired it with a stripped white shirt, quite a basic tie and some brown brogues. A timeless, classic look.

00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:05.500
It’s a suit you can wear with other things. You could wear the blazer on its own with a pair of jeans or a pair of chinos. You could wear the trousers on their own with just a shirt.   

00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:16.500
&gt;&gt;MATT: The look I tried to pull together really is casual elements into a formal look. I’ve tried to pull together elements that every man has in his wardrobe into an occasion wear outfit.

I’ve actually bought and Taylor &amp; Wright suit before form Matalan and it’s all about the fit. It’s almost like a tailored fit, but it’s off the self and it’s really affordable at the same time. 

00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:29.500
The attention to detailing as well as the quality of the suit is really a stand out feature. 

00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:34.500
I’m really pleased with the look I’ve put together and I’m really looking forward to wearing to Aintree.

00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:40.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: Well I think the guys look great and if you want to see more of the Matalan range go online to Matalan.co.uk.
