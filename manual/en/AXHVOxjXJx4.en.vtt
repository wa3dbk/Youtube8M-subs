00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.980
Hello, today I am making 3-ingredient no-churn no-machine chocolate ice cream.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.410
First, pour ½ cup and 2 tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk in a bowl 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:32.700
and sift in 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder. 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.820
And stir until combined. 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.530
And sift in remaining 4 tablespoons of cocoa powder 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.610
and whisk until homogeneously mixed. 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.740
It is pretty thick.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:03.740
Then whisk 1 cup of heavy cream until stiff.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.030
Transfer a whiskful of whipped cream into cocoa milk mixture 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.240
and stir until well mixed. 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.950
Doing this, the batter should be thinned out.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.250
Then pour cocoa milk mixture into whipped cream all at once 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.030
and fold until combined. 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.160
Be careful not to break whipped cream. 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.660
This is a way of mixing thick batter into lighter mixture.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.740
Now transfer the batter into a container 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.680
and cover with a plastic wrap. 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.880
Then freeze for at least 6 hours or overnight.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.980
Voila,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.980
Simple and easy chocolate ice cream with only three ingredients! 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:11.580
And this thick luscious chocolate ice cream in a snap. 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:20.580
And of course, chocolate sauce and chopped walnuts make the ice cream even better.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.680
Bon appetit.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.280
I love this homemade chocolate ice cream. 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.780
Everybody knows chocolate ice cream is the best. 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.910
