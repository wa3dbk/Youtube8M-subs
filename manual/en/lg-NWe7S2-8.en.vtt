00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:06.906
J.F. MUSIAL: Welcome to a very
special DRIVE CENTRAL from the

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:10.146
North American International
Auto Show where Leo Parente

00:00:10.146 --> 00:00:11.866
has joined me--

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.082
LEO PARENTE: I'm on
the step for you.

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:13.518
See?

00:00:13.518 --> 00:00:13.954
See?

00:00:13.954 --> 00:00:14.826
See?

00:00:14.826 --> 00:00:15.676
J.F. MUSIAL: I like that.

00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:16.456
I like that.

00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:16.586
LEO PARENTE: OK.

00:00:16.586 --> 00:00:18.356
J.F. MUSIAL: Anyway, so DRIVE
CENTRAL is a program to tell

00:00:18.356 --> 00:00:21.226
you, basically, as a partner
channel of what's happening on

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:22.416
Drive over the coming
few days.

00:00:22.416 --> 00:00:25.246
Now, as you saw, yesterday,
pretty good, right?

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:27.956
LEO PARENTE: I know a few guys
are talking about too much

00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:29.176
talking on the show.

00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:31.026
But we've got to have a little
bit of storytelling and

00:00:31.026 --> 00:00:31.726
information to share.

00:00:31.726 --> 00:00:34.206
But yesterday with Matt Farah,
you got to love that Porsche,

00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:34.666
J.F.

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.436
J.F. MUSIAL: You see, last week
was more of a soft roll

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:37.606
out of the Drive program.

00:00:37.606 --> 00:00:40.376
This week, two episodes
every day.

00:00:40.376 --> 00:00:43.386
So today, after this show, Alex
Roy goes on a road trip.

00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:46.371
And tomorrow it's Chris Harris
after a road test.

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:48.426
Now, Chris says he
saw a teaser--

00:00:48.426 --> 00:00:49.606
LEO PARENTE: Don't tell them.

00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:50.326
Don't tell them.

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:51.096
More driving.

00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:51.966
More driving.

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.576
J.F. MUSIAL: Now, a little
cautionary note.

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:55.536
After this program, Alex Roy
goes on a road trip.

00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:59.776
I want people to rest assured,
you know, we have separate

00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:01.506
compartments for different
shows.

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:03.176
Chris Harris reviews cars.

00:01:03.176 --> 00:01:05.816
You speak motor sports
and shake down.

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:08.516
Matt talks about after market
tuned vehicles, so he's

00:01:08.516 --> 00:01:09.546
reviewing cars.

00:01:09.546 --> 00:01:11.596
Alex's show is not about
reviewing cars.

00:01:11.596 --> 00:01:12.576
It's about the journey.

00:01:12.576 --> 00:01:13.266
It's about the road trip.

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.246
He does talk about the car.

00:01:15.246 --> 00:01:20.661
He's driving, with Mike Musto,
a '68 or '67 Dodge Charger.

00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:22.376
But it's going to be different
cars every episode.

00:01:22.376 --> 00:01:23.841
I just want to make--

00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:24.186
rest assured.

00:01:24.186 --> 00:01:26.456
LEO PARENTE: I mean, honestly,
not to be too literal, the

00:01:26.456 --> 00:01:29.986
channel's called Drive, and the
drive is an experience.

00:01:29.986 --> 00:01:32.486
And Alex is sharing those
experiences when you drive the

00:01:32.486 --> 00:01:34.001
car across wherever.

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:34.456
J.F. MUSIAL: Exactly.

00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:36.246
It's not about driving,
always.

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:36.796
It's about stopping.

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:38.001
You know, you've done
road trips.

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:38.946
I've done road trips.

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:41.666
It's pretty fun to go experience
this country.

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.356
And actually he's going to be
experiencing the world.

00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:45.596
He's going to be taking trips
to Europe, South America,

00:01:45.596 --> 00:01:46.736
whatever it may be.

00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:47.786
LEO PARENTE: Alex Bourdain
watch out.

00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:49.346
It's Alex Roy on the road.

00:01:49.346 --> 00:01:50.056
Oh, my God.

00:01:50.056 --> 00:01:51.746
J.F. MUSIAL: Yeah, but
Alex's diet is

00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:52.986
a little bit different.

00:01:52.986 --> 00:01:54.616
If you like chicken wings,
you'll like Alex.

00:01:54.616 --> 00:01:55.756
LEO PARENTE: I wasn't
talking food.

00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:57.506
I was talking personality.

00:01:57.506 --> 00:01:59.366
J.F. MUSIAL: Well, we're at
the Detroit Auto Show.

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:01.216
We can't just not reference
the show.

00:02:01.216 --> 00:02:02.706
LEO PARENTE: Right, we've
been here all day.

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:04.416
J.F. MUSIAL: Tomorrow on Road
Testament, and the day after,

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:05.706
we'll be going through
some interviews.

00:02:05.706 --> 00:02:06.766
You have some interviews
with some

00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:08.260
drivers for Friday, right?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.536
LEO PARENTE: Yeah, yesterday,
Monday, and today, we talked

00:02:10.536 --> 00:02:13.706
to a number of people in the
industry, and there are a lot

00:02:13.706 --> 00:02:15.636
of race car guys around,
race car drivers.

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:19.176
We spoke to them a little bit
about the whole craft and

00:02:19.176 --> 00:02:22.166
grassroots and how they started
racing and the skills

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:23.736
involved in doing this job.

00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:26.226
So there's some interesting
stuff there.

00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:27.376
Don't give me any crap
about talking.

00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:28.216
It's good talking.

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:28.306
J.F. MUSIAL: Yeah.

00:02:28.306 --> 00:02:29.686
It is.

00:02:29.686 --> 00:02:31.041
What else is going on?

00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:32.316
We have to reference the show.

00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:33.086
Anything you like here?

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.386
We've got the Dart behind
us, the Alfa Giulietta.

00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:36.876
But what do you think?

00:02:36.876 --> 00:02:39.006
LEO PARENTE: OK, so there were
three cars that it felt like

00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:44.956
everyone was waiting for,
the Ford Fusion, and--

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:47.846
OK, you maybe got his
opinion from that.

00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:48.896
Here's the bottom line.

00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:49.746
The car is crisp.

00:02:49.746 --> 00:02:51.226
The car's an adult,
thought out.

00:02:51.226 --> 00:02:54.226
No offense to the Hyundai
Sonata, but the lines on the

00:02:54.226 --> 00:02:56.926
Fusion look like the adult was
playing with the PANTONES and

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:58.626
the pens and whatever.

00:02:58.626 --> 00:03:01.036
And maybe the Hyundai is
a little different.

00:03:01.036 --> 00:03:03.596
The second car was
the Dodge Dart.

00:03:03.596 --> 00:03:04.156
You know what?

00:03:04.156 --> 00:03:07.116
It may be Italian underneath,
but it looks really crisp,

00:03:07.116 --> 00:03:08.086
really clean.

00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:09.126
It's all going to be
in the driving.

00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:10.616
But they've got a good job.

00:03:10.616 --> 00:03:13.806
And this is the first, the first
Dodge Chrysler that's

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:17.056
really come from this whole
Fiat combination.

00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:18.376
And the third car--

00:03:18.376 --> 00:03:21.366
I always change my list, but
the third car is the ATS.

00:03:21.366 --> 00:03:25.381
And I will just say it's
polarizingly good.

00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:26.846
But it's all going to
be in the driving.

00:03:26.846 --> 00:03:29.476
J.F. MUSIAL: It all comes
down to driving.

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:31.476
Actually, the only car I really
want to drive here,

00:03:31.476 --> 00:03:34.086
though, is actually the
Subaru BRZ Scion FRS.

00:03:34.086 --> 00:03:36.266
They released their, what
is it, trip car?

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:37.146
Is that what they had?

00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:37.666
Spotted it.

00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:38.771
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:39.836
So that was cool.

00:03:39.836 --> 00:03:40.741
NSX is here.

00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:42.796
LEO PARENTE: Well, and that's
where I was going to use my--

00:03:42.796 --> 00:03:44.676
you always say, I ask
14 last questions.

00:03:44.676 --> 00:03:45.056
J.F. MUSIAL: Yes.

00:03:45.056 --> 00:03:46.546
LEO PARENTE: I was going to add
to my list of three with

00:03:46.546 --> 00:03:48.006
four and, it is the NSX.

00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:49.616
Literally, I haven't been
over to see it yet.

00:03:49.616 --> 00:03:51.366
Just scanned it from
a distance.

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:52.416
It looks kind of cool.

00:03:52.416 --> 00:03:55.306
There's a lot of talk about how
the electric power train

00:03:55.306 --> 00:03:57.416
is built into the
gas power train.

00:03:57.416 --> 00:04:00.746
So I've heard everything from
front drive, all wheel drive

00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:02.596
electric, to rear
drive electric.

00:04:02.596 --> 00:04:04.216
Somewhere in there we'll
find the truth in

00:04:04.216 --> 00:04:04.966
about 5 or 10 minutes.

00:04:04.966 --> 00:04:05.566
J.F. MUSIAL: You know
what's funny?

00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:07.986
And this is a different
element of this show.

00:04:07.986 --> 00:04:08.886
We came here.

00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:10.776
We kind of knew what we
were going to get.

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:14.266
That car, Acura-Honda did an
amazing job keeping it secret.

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:16.336
They did a very good
job not releasing

00:04:16.336 --> 00:04:18.066
any photos, any details.

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:18.826
And it was good hype.

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:20.761
And it built the hype up, and
that's something that auto

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:22.906
shows kind of have lost because
of all the spy shots

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:23.966
and the leaks and whatnot.

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:24.586
Good job, Honda.

00:04:24.586 --> 00:04:25.986
I have to give them that.

00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:27.436
LEO PARENTE: Yeah, everyone
got caught with a lot of

00:04:27.436 --> 00:04:28.706
advanced stuff.

00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:34.016
The show, Detroit here in the
center of Motown, has these

00:04:34.016 --> 00:04:37.856
little cliches like some of
the OEM suppliers have

00:04:37.856 --> 00:04:39.566
displays on the floor.

00:04:39.566 --> 00:04:42.576
But beyond that, I was afraid
that it was always going to

00:04:42.576 --> 00:04:45.656
feel too American,
too homespun.

00:04:45.656 --> 00:04:48.116
And you've got a pretty good
blend here going on of what

00:04:48.116 --> 00:04:50.746
matters, everything from
the import brands to

00:04:50.746 --> 00:04:52.676
the American brands.

00:04:52.676 --> 00:04:52.946
J.F. MUSIAL: Hold on.

00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:54.966
We've got to leave a little
bit for Road Testament.

00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:56.116
LEO PARENTE: OK, very good.

00:04:56.116 --> 00:04:57.912
J.F. MUSIAL: Now, last week we
posed the question, what do

00:04:57.912 --> 00:04:59.546
you guys want us to
do with Drive?

00:04:59.546 --> 00:05:03.056
This is a very interactive show
with YouTube and Google.

00:05:03.056 --> 00:05:05.776
We want this to be a two-way
communication.

00:05:05.776 --> 00:05:07.356
You guys can communicate
with us on

00:05:07.356 --> 00:05:09.676
Twitter, on the comments.

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:13.466
Now, a lot of people, all they
referenced, actually--

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:16.856
a fair portion of comments last
week said, more races.

00:05:16.856 --> 00:05:17.416
Daytona.

00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:18.536
We're going to Daytona.

00:05:18.536 --> 00:05:20.036
That's the basics.

00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:21.706
LEO PARENTE: Yeah, I mean, I
thought I heard two things

00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:22.686
very clear.

00:05:22.686 --> 00:05:24.996
More races, and you gave us
a great list of races.

00:05:24.996 --> 00:05:26.126
J.F. MUSIAL: Yeah.

00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:26.861
Trust us.

00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:29.246
The budget's there for
the those races.

00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:31.696
LEO PARENTE: Wow.

00:05:31.696 --> 00:05:34.586
I haven't heard "the budget's
there for those races" in my

00:05:34.586 --> 00:05:35.746
racing career ever.

00:05:35.746 --> 00:05:37.256
So this could be a first.

00:05:37.256 --> 00:05:38.086
Yes, races.

00:05:38.086 --> 00:05:39.686
And we had some of those
on our list.

00:05:39.686 --> 00:05:40.746
But there were some
great additions.

00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:43.306
And the second thing was
see cars driving.

00:05:43.306 --> 00:05:44.566
I assure you--

00:05:44.566 --> 00:05:46.396
and I've even commented,
I'm even going

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:47.266
to get behind wheel.

00:05:47.266 --> 00:05:49.096
So there will be driving
of cars.

00:05:49.096 --> 00:05:51.236
Just stick with Drive.

00:05:51.236 --> 00:05:52.786
That will be there.

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:54.076
J.F. MUSIAL: Racecars though,
we haven't seen a lot of

00:05:54.076 --> 00:05:56.536
comments of other unique things
to do, and that's what

00:05:56.536 --> 00:05:58.916
we really want you
guys to get to.

00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:03.726
You give us a crazy, unique
idea, we may pick it up.

00:06:03.726 --> 00:06:06.686
That's the thing, you and I, all
we do is come up with the

00:06:06.686 --> 00:06:08.186
crazy, unique ideas.

00:06:08.186 --> 00:06:10.416
The problem is we're on
the road constantly.

00:06:10.416 --> 00:06:12.876
We don't always have the
opportunity to really follow

00:06:12.876 --> 00:06:14.286
through with some
of these ideas.

00:06:14.286 --> 00:06:15.766
And we don't know if they're
actually going to stick.

00:06:15.766 --> 00:06:17.716
If you guys reference them--

00:06:17.716 --> 00:06:17.926
Go ahead.

00:06:17.926 --> 00:06:18.766
Sorry, you were--

00:06:18.766 --> 00:06:20.076
LEO PARENTE: No, that's OK.

00:06:20.076 --> 00:06:22.316
I ask for a little
bit of caution.

00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:24.476
We're not Red Bull, and we're
not going to be dropping a

00:06:24.476 --> 00:06:26.686
sonic bungee cording
off a tower.

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:30.576
But things that really are
feasible and possible,

00:06:30.576 --> 00:06:33.086
possible, let us know, because
we'd love to try.

00:06:33.086 --> 00:06:34.026
J.F. MUSIAL: This
show is for you.

00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:37.611
Well, these series of shows are
for you as hopefully we've

00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:39.636
made that statement before.

00:06:39.636 --> 00:06:41.246
LEO PARENTE: And if you haven't
figured it out, we've

00:06:41.246 --> 00:06:46.206
got an eclectic group of hosts
from Chris to Matt to you to

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:47.716
me to Spinelli.

00:06:47.716 --> 00:06:48.516
J.F. MUSIAL: Not really host.

00:06:48.516 --> 00:06:49.626
I'm not supposed to be host.

00:06:49.626 --> 00:06:51.456
LEO PARENTE: By the way, isn't
this supposed to be Spinelli's

00:06:51.456 --> 00:06:52.216
DRIVE CENTRAL?

00:06:52.216 --> 00:06:53.441
J.F. MUSIAL: Yeah, where is he?

00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:54.496
Oh, yeah.

00:06:54.496 --> 00:06:55.926
LEO PARENTE: Oh, lost
in the auto show.

00:06:55.926 --> 00:06:58.622
J.F. MUSIAL: Either way, guys,
leave your comments

00:06:58.622 --> 00:06:59.836
below and Tweet us.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.766
I hate that word, but--

00:07:01.766 --> 00:07:03.146
LEO PARENTE: I'm too old to know
what the right word is.

00:07:03.146 --> 00:07:04.486
'Cause it ain't twat.

00:07:04.486 --> 00:07:07.028
J.F. MUSIAL: I'm young enough,
and I still hate it.

00:07:07.028 --> 00:08:06.581
