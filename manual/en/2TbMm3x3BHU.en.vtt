00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.710
Now that we've got our front assembled and
ready to go, our back has been assembled,

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:20.010
it's been drying for a while, we're going
to take the clamps off over here. Get our

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:30.099
back laid out and we're going to apply glue
to all our joints, they are clean and fresh

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.040
and ready to go. We're going to apply all
our glue to the holes, that we're ready to

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.690
go to but I'm going to avoid that step right
now, just to show you how to put it back together.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.800
Once we get everything glued back together,
we start lining up all our joints and again,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.280
we don't want to hit it while it's up in the
air, we want to bring everything to the edge

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:17.420
of the table so have support. Just gently
tap it in, work one side at a time.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.990
Once we get everything lined up and fairly
snug, we don't have to be really tight right

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.380
now, we just want to make sure we've got it
tight enough where we can stand the chair

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.840
back up. We want to make sure the chair is
leveled because, if it starts to rock a little

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.450
bit, what we want to do is, figure out which
side is rocking and we're going to pull the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.049
pressure on that side. First we are going
to tighten up these joints with the clamps.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:56.840
On the bottom, we just want to snug it up,
make the stretcher tight and then we'll take

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:05.960
this clamp back off and use it on the other
side. Once you pull everything up and everything

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:14.910
is snug, you can remove that one and go to
the other side and apply pressure here, same

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.280
thing. We want to put an equal amount of pressure
here; we're not trying to crush it but get

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.560
it nice and snug and the same with the bottom.
If you see the white there, we want to pull

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:47.260
that up, until it disappears into the chair.
Once you get to that point, you can take the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:58.370
bottom clamps off, turn it around, see if
it's fairly sturdy now, if not what we can

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.150
do, is put a clamp from front to back and
pull into square, get those legs to stabilize.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.460
Other than that, that's it. We've brought
the chair back together again. We've got the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.201
front and back together, all our marks line
up. Everything is tight and snug. We're going

00:03:15.201 --> 00:03:21.470
to let that sit and dry for 24 hours and then
we'll come back and work on the next process.
