00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:10.061
The third rock from the Sun..... how did this ever happen

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:19.564
and then 800 million years later people appear
 and people can look back at the whole thing

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.944
and try to understand it ...................

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:32.439
the big player in the biosphere is almost certainly  protein
,, protein is ...like... is the machinery of life

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.040
things that happen.. happen because of protein

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.380
it's like a protein is what ...

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.875
is what pushes the whole thing forward

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.632
everything else is like a supporting cast

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.020
proteins is really at the center of it

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:48.160
and a lot of things are made out of protein

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.520
protein .... the structure of protein is dictated by the DNA

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.960
so protein is manufactured under the direction of DNA 
and there's no exceptions to this

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.140
protein is ingested.. we eat protein but 
the protein is broken down into amino acids

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.700
and then rebuilt into whatever the body wants

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.992
the DNA describes what the protein is going to look like

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.700
the RNA polymerase find the spot that it wants to start working ...

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.940
it finds it using promoters and transcription factors 
which are made out of protein

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.771
the RNA polymerase is made out of protein

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.060
and the RNA polymerase goes along the DNA unzipping it

00:01:43.304 --> 00:01:45.544
reading it... zipping it  behind it

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.375
and puts the code on a piece of RNA

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.920
so it takes the DNA code ..
puts that code on a piece of RNA.... messenger RNA

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.180
in a process called transcription

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:09.220
the RNA goes out into the cell and 
becomes associated with a ribosome which is largely protein

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.012
and other things which are mostly protein ,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.522
not all of them, but most of them are

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.659
and the RNA code is made into a sequence of amino acids

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.580
so it's like the RNA establishes what the protein looks like

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.160
the DNA establishes with the RNA looks like

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.315
and that is the basic dogma of genetics

00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:40.684
transcription into RNA ....translation into protein

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.520
and everything is really driven by ...everything is really

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.353
..within the cell..is really driven by protein

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.620
and protein doesn't come from anywhere else.
