00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.950
In 2001 our Lead Pastor, Jeff Little, began
dreaming of starting a church where people

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.830
like you could begin a relationship with Jesus
and see their lives built on the foundation

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.130
of the Bible. The dream was to start a church
that was life-giving, spirit-filled and would

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.770
emphasize reaching people and building lives.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.310
In August of 2002, that dream became reality
with the establishment of Milestone Church

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.890
as one of the top Fort Worth Churches! A team
of 32 people gathered in the ballroom of a

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.949
Holiday Inn. It was a time of anticipation
and prayer. Pastor Jeff and that initial Milestone

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.300
Church group focused on building genuine friendships
with people who needed Jesus through neighborhood

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.530
associations, coaching sports and serving
in the community.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.690
The dream was developing. In October of 2002,
we began meeting at Indian Springs Middle

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.590
School in Keller, TX for our formal launch
as a church and to be more centrally located

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.850
in our community. The simple style of life-giving
messages, passionate worship and a commitment

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.410
to building authentic relationships allowed
Milestone Church to grow steadily into one

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.950
of the leading churches in Keller, TX. During
the first two years, more than a third of

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.309
Milestone's growth came from people beginning
a new relationship with Jesus Christ.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.219
After two and a half years of being a portable
church in a school cafeteria, we leased our

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.010
first permanent facility off of Willis Lane
in Keller, TX. It was at this location that

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.360
we were able to develop and establish our
dynamic children and youth services to become

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.540
one of the most diverse Churches in Fort Worth.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.030
We quickly outgrew the Willis Lane facility,
maxing it out with four weekend services,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.159
parking lot challenges and a growing need
for classroom space for our children and youth.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.270
God provided an incredible solution with our
current facility in the heart of Keller, TX

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.500
and helping us become one of the most centrally
located Fort Worth Churches.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.740
We purchased our first facility at 801 Keller
Parkway and soon after began an expansive

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.040
remodel to represent our desire to serve and
care for our community as one of the Churches

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.040
in Fort Worth Texas. Part of the remodel included
the KidzBlast Play Zone, a two-story slide

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.759
and tube jungle gym! Our new children's rooms
allowed for increased security, and outfitted

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.629
a 400-seat student auditorium for Elevate,
our rapidly growing student ministry.

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:18.629
Our grand opening at 801 Keller Parkway was
April 11, 2009, Easter Weekend. As we created

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:26.919
space, we watched God add 600+ people in the
first 6 months. Even with our growth, we have

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:36.269
never lost site of our original dream. You
will never be a number at Milestone. We are

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.969
known as one of the friendliest Churches in
Fort Worth, and there is a reason why. We

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:49.609
know that God deeply cares for you as an individual
and so do we. This carries over into everything

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.290
we do at Milestone Church.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.290
We are in our ninth year with over 2,500 people
currently attending our four weekend services.

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:07.639
We offer contemporary, Biblically driven worship
services that are alive with energy and creativity

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.819
as well as excellent and exciting children's
and student ministries. And yes, we're still

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.370
as friendly as the first day we met and became
one of the Churches in Keller, TX.

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:37.109
If you haven't been our guest, we invite you
to experience a worship service and see how

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.809
exciting church can be when the focus is simple
and people are free to flourish in their relationship

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:45.040
with God and others. Milestone Church is simply
one of the Fort Worth Churches that you must

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.290
experience for yourself!
