00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.140
Hello, I'm Mark Blocker. On behalf of Expert
Village, in this segment, we're going to cover

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.160
removing the plug wires. Prior to removing
the plug wires we need to pay close attention

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.560
to the order that the plug wires are installed.
On a newer vehicle, or a vehicle with the

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.910
original equipment still installed, the plug
wires are numbered from the factory. This

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.650
being a four cylinder engine, the plug wires
would be numbered one through four because

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.380
they are indicating cylinder. It's extremely
important that the plug wire for which ever

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.110
cylinder you remove it for goes back into
the same cylinder again. The ignition is set

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.310
on a timed basis and the correct spark has
to go to the correct cylinder according to

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.890
the firing order. So, we must ensure that
we keep these plug wires in order, in the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.620
correct firing order, and back into the original
slots. As you can see, the wiring is clipped

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.830
into plastic looms which also snap, or bolt,
or attach to the valve cover. If we leave

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.820
all the wires in that loom, and remove them
one at a time, you can leave the loom back

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.840
and keep everything in its chronological order.
If you look at the layout, it?s almost impossible

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.539
to mix up the order itself by the plug wires.
And just for safety procedure, or for common

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:23.270
sense, if you'll take a ball point pen or
felt marker and number them one through four.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.159
On this particular engine the cylinder number
one is the closest one to the driver's side

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.749
and they're numbered one, two, three, and
four. And the engine numbering, if your unfamiliar

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:38.829
with it, on most vehicles is the intake manifold
on the runner itself where it connects to

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.740
the head, there will be a casting. And it
will cast the numbers one, two, and three,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.000
and four indicating the various cylinders
so you can quickly go back and identify which

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.219
cylinder is number one so you can number the
plugs. It's just a little tip. If you number

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.460
them before you remove them, then you can
be sure that you put them back in the same

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.789
place because it's extremely important. The
vehicle will not run correctly. It may not

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.899
start to run at all unless these plug wires
are installed back in the original location.

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.080
Watch our next segment on removing the plug
wires part two.
