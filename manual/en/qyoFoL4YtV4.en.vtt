00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.360
(light snoring)

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.220
Big: Aw, that's what I get for trying to take a
nap near Cowboy Jed's Lightbulb Emporium!

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.080
Robots: Let's all fire the same laser blasts
that we do every time he shows up.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.860
One is bound to hit him sooner or later.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.140
Sonic: All right! I made it past the lasers,
the security bots, the deathtraps, and-

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.760
OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOD!

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.440
Tails: Here I come, Sonic!
Deus Ex Machina Cannon, fire!

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.100
Strong Bad: SPINDASH'D!

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.120
Robot: Owww! My artificial intelligence!

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.680
Eggman: Despite his ability to move
beyond the speed of sound,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.580
there's no way Sonic will be able
to get here in time to stop me!

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.680
Cream: Oh please,
Sonic always defeats you.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.860
It says so right here in the script.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.400
Eggman: Hey, no comments
from the peanut gallery.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.920
Besides, if he falls to my ultimate
weapon as easily as you did, then-

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.900
Cream: What ultimate weapon?!
You threw a freaking rock at my face!

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.820
Eggman: Yes, well...the
economy and all...

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.600
Amy: Watch out, Tails!
We're gonna crash! Ahhh!

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.600
Tails: Meh. It could be worse.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.280
Knuckles: KNUCKLES SMASH!

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.900
Amy: Knuckles, you saved us!
You're a true friend!

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.700
Knuckles: Actually, I saved you because
you both owe me 20 bucks.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.940
Eggman: GAH!

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.440
Eggman: That was a perfectly good wall,
I didn't even have it insured yet!

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.440
Sonic: So, Doctor Eggman, what's
your evil scheme this time?

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.600
Eggman: Um...actually,
I'm not entirely sure.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.440
I kind of just kidnapped Cream
for no apparent reason,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.620
tied some wires together, tightened
a few bolts, and figured I'd wing it.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.000
Sonic: It's such a revolutionary thought!

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.440
Eggman: Now, I shall send you to a 
different time period, where you shall-

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.380
Sonic: You did that already.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.640
Eggman: Really? Well then I'll
fire you into space, where-

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.400
Sonic: Did that too.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.080
Eggman: Parallel universe!
Sonic: Yep.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.760
Eggman: Ancient fighting robot!
Sonic: Uh-huh.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.300
Eggman: ...hoverboard racing?

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.220
Sonic: Oh yeah. Twice, actually.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.720
Eggman: Is there anything
I HAVEN'T done?!

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.940
Sonic: Well, you haven't just
tried shooting me point-blank.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.400
Eggman: Ehhh, I don't see where you're
going with this, but I'll give it a try.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.660
Rouge: I can't believe
they called me for this.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.840
No lines, and I just sit up here
like some incredibly hot gargoyle?

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.120
This is some bullsh-AAH!

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.380
Eggman: WHOA! I knew I should
have turned off friendly fire!

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.360
Eggman: Even though my machine
is damaged and highly unstable,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.400
I'm-a press this button
and see what happens!

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.400
["Blinded by the Light"
begins playing]

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.460
Amy: What's that?!

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.860
Knuckles: It used to be Chaos Control...

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.640
Amy: Uh, Knuckles? It still IS
Chaos Control. You're just dumb.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.400
Knuckles: Yeah, I know.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.400
Sonic: Curse you,
Warner Music Group!

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.180
Sonic: Ugh...what the...?
Where am I?

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.980
Driver: ROAD RAGE!

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.200
Sonic: HOOOOOOOLY CRAP,
IT'S A TRUCK!

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.820
Cop A: Look at this blue pit bull!

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.060
Let's rescue it and get
on Animal Planet!

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.260
Cop B: Eeeeeh, I don't feel like
exerting the extra energy.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.420
Let's get reckless race car
drivers to do it.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:37.820
["Into the Wind" by Crush 40
begins playing]

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.160
Driver: Whoa, hey, wait a second,
you can't stand up there!

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
I mean, what if
kids start trying this?

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.740
Sonic: Oh, all right, FINE.
If you're gonna get all PC on me...

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.160
Sonic: Kids, there's nothing cooler than
doing stupid stunts for someone you like,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.920
but if someone tells you to ghost ride
the whip, THAT'S NO GOOD!

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.620
It's your body! No one has the right to
make you stand on a Formula-1 racer

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.840
if you don't want to! So what
do you do? First, you say "No!"

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.220
Then you stick your friend out in the middle
of a busy highway and get outta there!

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.920
Sam: Looks like it's all up to me, then.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.680
And when I catch you, hedgehog,
I'll show you that no one is faster than-

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.680
Sam: ...that's it? That's my whole scene?

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.560
They wouldn't have
done this to Vin Diesel!

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:34.200
["I Believe I Can Fly"
begins playing]

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.480
[record scratch]

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.480
Sonic: OH CRAP GRAVITY AAAAAAAAH!

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.500
Sonic: Oh, that's just GREAT!
I can run at supersonic speeds,

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.220
but I can't even get out
of a kid's swimming pool?

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.520
What the hell has Sonic Team
been smoking all these years?

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.260
Chris: Oh no, not another
animal drowning in our pool!

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.760
I better go fish it out, or
the SPCA's gonna be pissed!

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.740
(coughing and spluttering)

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.920
Sonic: Thought I'd lost my
rings there for a second...

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.640
Chris: Wow, you can talk, huh?
Do you have a name?

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.540
Sonic: Yeah, it's Sonic!
Sonic the Hedgehog!

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.440
I mean, come on, everybody knows that!
Where were you during the 90s?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.860
Chris: I had a Super Nintendo...

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.600
Sonic: I hate you SO much right now...

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.560
BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
