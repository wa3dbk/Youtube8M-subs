Hello, my name is Luis Estrada, and I'm a
software developer. In this video, I'll show

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:15.940
you how to track visitors to your blogger
blog using Bravenet hit counter. Blogger is

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.210
a registered trademark of Google a company
to which I have no affiliation. Go to the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.390
website at Bravenet.com. Click on the free
web tools link. There are a lot of widgets

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:35.089
that Bravenet provides for free. You can easily
add them to your blog. For example, calendar,

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:45.750
guestbook, photo album, site search, web polls,
etcetera. Click on the hit counter link. The

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.580
Bravenet counter provides a lot more functionality
than just counting your visitors. You can

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.549
get access to reports on new, returning and
unique visitors. You will know how many pages

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:02.939
these visitors read on your blog. Also you
will know your visitor's computer screen resolution.

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:12.080
That way you will be able to create a better
design for your visitors. To get your hit

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.050
counter you will need to have an account on
the Bravenet website. If you do not have an

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.900
account, then click on the join link and provide
your data to become a member. Once you complete

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:32.960
registration, enter your user name and password
to log in. On your member page you will find

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.241
a link for new hit counter. When you press
on the link a message will be sent to your

00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:45.510
e-mail account for further instructions on
how to use and configure your counter. In

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.570
the message, you will see the code needed
to add your counter to your blogger account.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:04.590
Copy the code. Then, log in to your blogger
account and add a new gadget. Select the html

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:13.730
slash Javascript option. Paste the code inside
the content field and optionally give a title

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:26.201
to the widget.
Finally, click on save. Now, go to your blog

00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:35.940
page and you will see your new Bravenet counter
added. I'm Luis Estrada, and I've just showed

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.340
you how to make money with mere websites.
