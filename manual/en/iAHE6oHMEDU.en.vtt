00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.480
Although cross-country bikes aren't
designed specifically for technical

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.300
trails, one look at the very best
cross-country riders shows they're more

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.712
than fast enough.
So what are the secrets?

00:00:09.712 --> 00:00:12.235
Well, here are five things for you
to work at.

00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:15.354
♪ [music] ♪

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.250
Line choice is always critical in mountain
biking, but on a cross-country hardtail,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.900
perhaps even more so. You're going to have
to choose different lines than you might

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.030
do on a bigger full suspension bike,
because your bike is simply going to reach

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.850
the limits of its ability far sooner.
So when it comes to line selection,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.220
you can ride big rocks and big routes,
but on a ton of repeated big hits that you

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.247
might find yourself getting a little bit
overfaced, and then potentially

00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:43.817
losing control. So for example, like a
big, gnarly rock section.

00:00:43.817 --> 00:00:47.024
And in those cases, it's simply a case
of trying to pick the smoothest line that

00:00:47.024 --> 00:00:48.957
you can to avoid the biggest hits.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.470
To give yourself the best possible chance
of finding the right line,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.740
look ahead a good few meters down the
trail. The faster you go, the further you

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.419
need to look, and looking ahead also
keeps your head up, which helps put

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:06.648
your body in the right aggressive
position and lead you through turns.

00:01:06.648 --> 00:01:10.500
Just remember, don't fixate
on obstacles, though, as you see them.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.690
Focus on the line instead, and then move
your gaze beyond that.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.958
When riding out the saddle, you want
to have your pedals level,

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.871
and then be crouching over the bike
with your arms and legs slightly bent

00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:26.253
to absorb the shocks, but maintaining
clearance over your saddle.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:29.194
Now, if you do drop your seat,
then you also want to drop your heels.

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:32.613
But with your saddle in a fixed position
like this one, then it's better to have

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:35.872
your feet closer to parallel with the
ground to give you that little bit more

00:01:35.872 --> 00:01:37.848
room to maneuver over the saddle.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.791
Although, on climbs or on pedaling
sections where you need to be seated

00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:46.110
for efficiency, you can sometimes hover
slightly out the saddle to give the bike

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.960
just a degree or two of movement
underneath you.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.370
Now, one thing that goes in the favor
of hardtails is pedal clearance.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.410
Generally, it's a little bit greater on a
hardtail than on a full suspension bike.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.080
So what it means is you can actually keep
pedaling for longer through really

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.310
difficult sections. And I also find
there's an extra bonus, that pedaling

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.310
through really rough or technical sections
actually really helps to keep the bike

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.130
under a bit more control. Now, you'll see
it if you try it, doesn't even have to be

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.702
a particularly rough section of trail,
but do one run freewheeling through,

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:18.366
and then one run pedaling through.
Compare the two, and you'll probably

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:20.525
find exactly the same.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.245
Aside from pedaling, there is another way
to conserve your momentum,

00:02:25.513 --> 00:02:29.010
and it's a great skill to perfect. Without
suspension, or just with less of it,

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.270
you have to absorb more of the shocks
to keep your wheels rolling,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.940
so you need to learn to ride light.
Clearly, there's actually no way of making

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.270
yourself lighter, but you can unweight
for key sections, and this means that you

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.100
bounce on the pedals just before a rough
section of trail, and then effectively try

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.092
to float the bike over it. It's like a
very primitive form of bunny hopping,

00:02:48.092 --> 00:02:52.368
and anyone can do it, but to take it
further, it is critical to learn to hop.

00:02:52.368 --> 00:02:55.760
Hopping shouldn't just be reserved
for bigger stuff, though. It's amazingly

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.340
effective on small imperfections in the
trail, as well. Any tiny bump or rock

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.040
or root can be hopped in order to preserve
your momentum, and you can actually do it

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.010
while pedaling, as well. It might seem a
bit labor intensive at first,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.590
to try and float over every lump or bump,
but believe me, when you get comfortable

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.592
doing it, it will make a big difference.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.060
Final trail skill to unlock your potential
on technical trails is to get comfortable

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.616
having your wheels slide
around underneath you

00:03:23.616 --> 00:03:25.113
and doing unpredictable things.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.380
Whether it's rocks or roots or mud
or dust, when the trail gets tough,

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.920
often the only way through is to let the
bike move around underneath you.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.845
Generally, this comes from experience,
but you can speed the process

00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:40.644
up by finding a short patch of roots
or rocks and riding it

00:03:40.644 --> 00:03:43.721
over and over again, getting familiar
with how the bike responds

00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:48.272
and finds its own way. So there are five
key ways to ride cross-country

00:03:48.272 --> 00:03:51.230
technical trails faster. You've got
to think about your line choice,

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.187
going around obstacles, not necessarily
straight over the top of them.

00:03:54.187 --> 00:03:57.003
You've got to think about your body
position, conserve momentum,

00:03:57.003 --> 00:04:00.479
and then, finally, just get comfortable
with your wheels sliding

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:04.750
around underneath you. Now,
we mentioned bunny hops as an absolutely

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.984
key skill, so why not click up there,
and you can learn how to bunny hop

00:04:07.984 --> 00:04:12.545
in just 60 seconds? Then,
to do technical climbing, why not

00:04:12.545 --> 00:04:16.232
click down there, and watch that
video?  And finally, you need to subscribe

00:04:16.232 --> 00:04:17.790
to GMBN, if you haven't already done so.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.610
So a shortcut is just to click on me,
right now. Now then, if you'll excuse me,

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.670
I'm just going to go and ride some more
technical trails, because I'm quite

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:38.338
enjoying myself. Just subscribe before I
go. I'm waiting. All right, thanks.
