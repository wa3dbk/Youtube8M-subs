On July 2nd, 2010 a young female disappeared

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.340
&gt;&gt; Sgt. Randy Huisman: I am the current lead
investigator on a missing file for 2010 - Karina

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.340
Beth-Anne Wolfe. Karina was an aboriginal
female, 22 years of age, 5'7", 110 lbs. Her

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.190
hair was a little longer than shoulder length,
between her shoulder blades. It was dark colored,

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.190
however it had red and blonde dye in it, and
she did color her hair different colors quite

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.859
frequently.

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:15.039
Karina struggled with some addiction issues
and lived a high risk lifestyle. Karina wanted

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:22.039
to deal with her addictions issues so she
went to treatment from the 22nd of June 2010

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.149
and she checked out of treatment on the 1st
of July 2010.

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.429
It was on the 2nd of July that she moved from
one address to her mother's place. On the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:41.429
early afternoon of July 2nd 2010 Karina phoned
a male acquaintance of hers. He picked Karina

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.039
up and gave her a ride over to her mother's
residence where they dropped off some belongings.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:55.039
And from there Karina wanted to and go get
a shower and a bite to eat at his residence.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.289
From there Karina left with this male -- that's
the last time that her mother or any family

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.729
members saw or heard from Karina.

persons liaison officer from the Saskatoon

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.180
&gt;&gt; Dorthea Swiftwolfe: I have been working
very closely with Carol Wolfe -- her daughter,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.629
Karina, has been missing for two and a half
years. I try to visit her probably once a

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.709
week, minimum twice a month. Just so she has
updates on what's happening with the file

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.049
and to make sure she's okay. My primary job
is to try and support hope with Carol.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:36.840
&gt;&gt; Sgt. Huisman: Through the police investigation
we discovered that this male person took Karina

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.040
from her mother's residence to his residence
where they had some food and Karina took a

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.900
shower. She then wanted to get a ride and
get dropped off on 20th Street near Avenue

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.510
H and this person took her there and dropped
her off.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.469
&gt;&gt; Dorthea Swiftwolfe: We do things like have
a birthday celebration with birthday cake

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:03.900
on Carol's birthday or Karina's birthday.
And we take part in the marches. We try to

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.989
bring attention any way we can to Karina's
case because she has been missing for so long.

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.709
&gt;&gt; Sgt. Huisman: A couple hours later he received
a phone call from Karina believed to be from

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:20.709
a pay phone near the gas station at 20th street
and Avenue H where she wanted to borrow some

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.939
money and she disappeared from that point
on.

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.590
&gt;&gt; Dorthea Swiftwolfe: I know Carol, I was
visiting her yesterday and she said "The only

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.479
thing that I can say is that I'm okay and
I am trying to remain positive."

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:36.950
&gt;&gt; Sgt. Huisman: Karina would be 22 years
old now. I absolutely believe that there are

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.950
people out there that have answers. People
don't just disappear from a busy area of Saskatoon

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:46.349
without witnesses.

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.700
&gt;&gt; Dorthea Swiftwolfe: I think dealing and
working with this family so closely for the

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.400
last two and a half years is that they struggled
because she's missing, she's not here in the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.700
physical sense, but she's still there in the
emotional sense. So you keep looking and you're

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.609
wanting and waiting and I think it's the waiting
part that's the hardest for the family. But

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.769
I mean that's the raw emotion of having somebody
that's missing and not knowing exactly where

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.420
they are. And searching and waiting.
