Hi. I'm Jay French from Jay French from Jay
French Studios dot com. And I'm going to teach

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:11.400
you how to draw an elephant. Of course you
could do a cartoony elephant is going to be

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.910
much simpler. But we're going to show you
the basics of drawing a realistic elephant.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.250
You kind of want to get your egg shape for
a head. And we're going to come at a kind

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.260
of a profile shot. And another thing, is that
we are doing an African elephant. An Indian

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:36.140
elephant looks very different. They have much
more dropped ears. They're smaller. The backs

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:45.850
of an elephant, because of their size, are
always bowed downward. You can have basically

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:53.020
the mass of the body, and you can think of
it as a sort of curved oval, is a good way

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:01.579
to start. And the head of an elephant's very
complicated. Or will throw you off, because

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.360
it's not just a big round thing like you'd
think it would be. From this angle, we got

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:15.060
a nice oval start, but when you get to the
face we want to get a lot more precise. I'm

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.670
getting the edge of the ear in here. Again,
here's where we can tell it's an African elephant,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.070
because they have much larger spread out ears.
We're only going to see the edge of this one.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.290
And one of the main things about the face
of an elephant is that it's shape is something

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:42.560
of an hour glass. You have a bulb of a forehead.
It indents, comes back out, where the eyes

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.960
are. So from the, on this side we'll just
have a shadow. On the outer edge we'll actually

00:01:47.960 --> 00:02:01.220
see that shape. Eyes are very small and proportionate.
Of course one of the most prominent features

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.130
of an elephant, and this is where you start
to see it, is the wrinkles. The looseness

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.700
of the skin. And you'll see it right around
the eyes very prominently. From this angle

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:23.550
we can't see the other eye. Get a few across
the forehead usually. Now we've got tusks

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.380
on this guy. Because again, he's an African
elephant. And also in this angle we're not

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.450
going to be able to see the mouth very well.
It's very difficult to see. You basically

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.550
they have to have their trunks raised in order
to see an elephant's mouth. The photo source

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:51.421
I'm using has his trunk curled under, which
actually is a little easier if you want to

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:59.040
start there. That's a, a good, a good shot
to use, because it's a simpler beginning.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.150
Learn how to draw the basics first. This is
where the, the wrinkles on an elephant are,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.660
are the strongest is on their, across the
nose. And we're going just get them real basic

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:15.580
here. You see a little bit of that other tusk.
So remember that hour glass shape. And then

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.269
you have the, the nose extending from that.
And from there, here's where the cartoony

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.720
really differs from realism. They're legs
are not nearly as stout as you think they

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:41.209
are. Or as cartoons lead you to believe they
are. And, but like any four legged animal

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:53.930
the front legs are fairly straight and long.
The back legs with a little more curvature

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:02.489
to them.
And there you have a basic lesson in how to

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.090
draw an elephant.
