00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.610
EVELYN : All right, take two.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.210
HOYT: OK, people, let's circle
up and focus on Summer for

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.190
just a few seconds.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.800
SUMMER: OK, let's all
join hands And let's

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.652
all just let go.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.930
No thinking.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.550
Some of you are still
thinking.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.530
Let it go.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.410
For some time now, Colin and I
have been devotees of Prada

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.820
Patel who is the founder of the
movement for effortless

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.730
prosperity.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.750
Which basically believes that in
order to get what you want

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.180
from life, you basically
have to do nothing.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.190
But you really have
to do nothing.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.580
It's hard doing nothing,
thinking nothing.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.830
Look, here's an example.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.620
For the next minute, I am going
to think about nothing.

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:34.840
Damn.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.500
LENNY: So you're up first.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.280
ROBERT: Uh huh.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.470
LENNY: So when you hear them say
your name, you walk rather

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.650
quickly, OK, to this
chair and sit down.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.630
ROBERT: Is it going to
be this hot in here?

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.890
LENNY: Yes, yes it will be
exactly this hot in here,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.980
because these lights.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.560
It gets rather hot under them.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.960
ROBERT: I think I should tell
you, I have CRTD, chronic

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.390
regulatory temperature
disorder.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.150
I have to be on the lookout
for sudden changes in

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.950
temperature.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.420
LENNY: Great.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.540
ROBERT: Oh, Summer I, I, I
thought in the interview you

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.920
might like to ask you about
string tension.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.330
That might be interesting
for the folks.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.020
You see, normally string tension
is set in a range of

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.000
about 80 to 130 newtons, but
you're recreational players

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.220
have a range of about
110 newtons.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.180
But I, and brace yourself,
150 newtons.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.560
Well, that's really
quite bold.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.050
I mean, in the hands of someone
who was even a little

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.780
bit nervous, that wouldn't
be a good idea.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.160
But I'm known for my coolness
under pressure.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.066
You know, cool?

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.020
Calm?

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.270
SUMMER: Hoyt.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.240
HOYT: I just thought it
might be a little

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.300
more prominent here.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.700
SUMMER: Prominent, yes.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.330
Tasteful, no.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.040
You don't want to ram the store
down people's throats.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.640
HOYT: Sweetie, the whole
point of the show is--

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.890
SUMMER: Where's Colin?

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.820
HOYT: I don't know.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.114
SUMMER: You mean you just
let him wander off?

00:02:56.114 --> 00:02:57.092
Colin?

00:02:57.092 --> 00:02:58.342
Colin?

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.850
HOYT: I didn't just marry into
Hollywood royalty here, I also

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.820
married into Versailles
royalty.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.520
You know, Bud Tickler was the
president and CEO of the

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.110
Versailles Sanitary Rag Company
which is nothing to

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.395
thumb your nose at.

00:03:21.395 --> 00:03:23.600
Uh, of course I knew who
Summer Tickler was.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.870
Everybody knew her in town.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.590
I know who her mother was.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.150
She was very famous here
in Versailles.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.100
In fact, she cut the ribbon when
Dad opened the new store.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.760
Um, there was an incident
that happened at the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.090
ribbon cutting ceremony.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.820
It seems that Evelyn was having
a problem with one of

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.420
her medications, as
I understand it.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.330
Somehow though, she ran the
scissors through the fleshy

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.620
part a Dad's arm.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.560
WILLIAM H. MACY: She could
drink, that's true.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.270
HOYT: We ended up using the
ribbon as a temporary

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.420
tourniquet, but we've been able
to laugh about it since.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.340
I didn't really know Evelyn.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.980
She passed away, um, shortly
before I met Summer, or very

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.010
shortly, just ironically
a couple of hours.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.050
I remember I met Summer at the
4th of July barbecue over at

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.130
the VFW hall which
is still there.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.112
They're going to tear it down,
but it's still there.

00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:19.500
Um, incidentally, it was
the same day that

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.730
her mom passed away.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.010
And I thought she was holding up
quite well considering she

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.260
just lost her mom.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.370
And she would laugh at almost
anything anybody said.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.280
And if anyone would mention
Independence Day, she'd sort

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.630
of yell, you got that
right, mister!

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.100
And then she'd take another shot
and just start to laugh.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:45.180
And long story short, two months
later we tied the knot.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.020
WILLIAM H. MACY: She
saw into my soul.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.080
She transformed me.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.210
That was the moment that
I decided that I

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.460
wanted to be an actor.
