Hi, this is Alia, and welcome back to cooking with Alia International edition

00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:15.248
And today, we have a special guest here...
Ariyele!

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:19.930
She is going to show us how to 
 make American cookies with a twist 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.589
The twist is they are gluten free 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.129
Not only Alia they are gluten free, they are grain free.

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:33.335
Grain free means that the flour that I am using 
 is actually not from any kind of grain

00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:39.273
So live time gluten free baking you can have, gluten 
 free makes a good buyer in a package

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:41.867
But I think this is a really special recipe

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:44.648
They even if you are not gluten- free hopefully you love  

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:47.218
You certainly I don't think we'll be able to tell you the difference

00:00:47.218 --> 00:00:50.111
And I'm super excited to share with everyone today

00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:53.549
And I am excited about this because usually the 
 gluten free cookies are not that good

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.631
But your vision sounds amazing

00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:57.805
Hopefully, We'll get to try together when we're done

00:00:57.805 --> 00:01:05.765
I may use cookies china get the recipes

00:01:27.057 --> 00:01:27.787
Thank you Alia

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:29.034
Are you ready?
Yeah, I am ready

00:01:29.034 --> 00:01:30.229
Let's startâ€¦ 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.562
So first, we can go all over my ingredients.

00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:34.755
In the food processor

00:01:34.755 --> 00:01:38.809
first, we're going to add a large room temperature egg

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:42.490
Add butter. I like the grass-fed staff

00:01:42.493 --> 00:01:44.030
add some almond butter

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:46.330
If you don't have almond butter, what can you use?

00:01:46.327 --> 00:01:48.060
You can use more honey.

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:53.490
add vanilla extract, honey

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:55.940
and then add some coconut sugar

00:01:55.943 --> 00:01:59.130
and if you don't have coconut sugar, you can use brown sugar

00:01:59.126 --> 00:02:05.320
But I really like the coconut sugar because it's natural who minimally processed sugar.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.290
It's awesome. and now we'll mix them

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:10.070
Now, we'll mix all over the ingredients in their.

00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:14.180
and we just get them nicer in the food processor.

00:02:14.185 --> 00:02:20.250
For the dry ingredients, We can use almond flour which is from blanched almonds.

00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:24.520
some salt, some baking soda, and some coconut flour.

00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:28.540
So this almond flour are really special fine ground almond flour

00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:31.430
and their sources on the website where you can find.

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:37.510
So now we're going to add the dry, tour it and let around.

00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:41.810
You wanna make sure that you getting your dough which is nice and thick

00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:46.230
Get off all the sides of the pool and give another tour

00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:51.840
Once your dough is ready. We had incorporated all the ingredients.

00:02:51.844 --> 00:02:55.860
and add yummy chocolate chips

00:02:55.862 --> 00:03:01.090
I have a combination of dark chocolate with a little bit of sweetness

00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:04.860
and they are really dark chocolate chance because I like the change in texture

00:03:04.857 --> 00:03:07.140
 just add something

00:03:07.143 --> 00:03:13.210
Using a spoon, make sure that the chocolate 
 chips are well-incorporated into the dough. 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.840
Shaping time.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.540
Ice cream scooper

00:03:16.544 --> 00:03:19.230
Ice cream scooper. it's a thing, it just helps.

00:03:19.228 --> 00:03:25.660
I've made a lot of different ways and find that Ice cream 
 scooper is a nice way to get and even on dough.

00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:31.000
you click and shot. You can see the chocolate chip.

00:03:30.997 --> 00:03:33.830
Can I try?
Please.

00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:35.770
I can do one here

00:03:35.774 --> 00:03:37.770
Do you fill it completely?

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.180
Yes, I do.

00:03:39.182 --> 00:03:44.180
and then it just like . . . Wow!

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:51.390
Now, on the dough, use another piece of waxed 
 paper and gently press to flatten them

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.810
Because if we don't do this, they would take exactly the 
 way you see them now in the ball shapes.

00:03:56.807 --> 00:04:04.110
and it's one of the things that make the texture great.

00:04:04.107 --> 00:04:05.540
I really like this trick.

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:08.090
Since instead of using your hands, use a waxed paper

00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:09.550
This is awesome.

00:04:09.553 --> 00:04:12.520
to put it on the top and just press gently

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:16.120
and you can fell the cookie will coming 
 on your hand. I fell really nice.

00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:18.080
So now, we'll bake them.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:25.240
Preheat your oven to 350 F (176 C), and 
 just bake them for around 9-11 minutes

00:04:25.237 --> 00:04:27.390
Too fast! 
It's really fast.

00:04:27.388 --> 00:04:32.500
I got another trick. If you have left over dough, you can freeze it.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.280
and you can use another piece of waxed paper like this 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:42.860
Just get rolled up with your dough. what happen in 
 a shape that looks a cookies dough rapper

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:47.230
then in the freezer when baking get them off

00:04:47.228 --> 00:04:50.200
They really good rock. They're awesome.

00:04:50.202 --> 00:04:58.890
To the oven...

00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:03.000
Ariyele! the cookies smell. It's so good.

00:05:02.996 --> 00:05:05.400
It pretty yummy yummy!

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:07.080
We can eat them now, Right?

00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:10.180
We're going to let them rest. We're going 
 to put them on a cooling rack

00:05:10.178 --> 00:05:17.000
We just can slide the waxed paper with the cookies right alongside.

00:05:17.002 --> 00:05:19.410
So you're going to show us other things with this cookies?

00:05:19.413 --> 00:05:24.070
I'm going to show, I have a very 
 special treat as a bonus for us

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:27.510
and We're going to get to that once these guys are nice and cool

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.080
Okay, Can't wait!  See you in 5 minuets.

00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:34.620
Now, the cookies are a little cooler. 

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:37.840
You're going to show us Ice cream sandwich cookie

00:05:37.843 --> 00:05:41.850
So we can take an even flatter cookies

00:05:41.853 --> 00:05:45.700
So it's a nice balance between ice cream and cookies

00:05:45.704 --> 00:05:50.460
and when the ice cream is soft enough to work

00:05:50.455 --> 00:05:55.880
You just add a layer a nice thick

00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:59.280
Because it will get all hard again in the freezer.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.260
and latter leverage just makes the image

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:11.130
If you want it, you could like to know to make them

00:06:11.134 --> 00:06:14.560
This is so good.

00:06:14.557 --> 00:06:18.540
Actually, we have some special that we can do it.

00:06:18.541 --> 00:06:21.620
You can put sprinkles on the outside, if you want it 

00:06:18.541 --> 00:06:21.620
You can put sprinkles on the outside, if you want it 

00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:24.350
You can roll in some, if you want it

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.300
Anything, you can be creative with that

00:06:26.295 --> 00:06:27.550
and then back to the freezer?

00:06:27.546 --> 00:06:29.530
you can put them back in the freezer

00:06:29.526 --> 00:06:30.690
We just wrap them.

00:06:30.692 --> 00:06:32.890
To wrap the up, we have some here

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.390
Here is a finished wrapped one

00:06:36.394 --> 00:06:37.760
Actually to show this

00:06:37.757 --> 00:06:41.240
This is Ariyele wrapping . . . and this my wrapping . . .

00:06:41.243 --> 00:06:43.440
That shows my skills in wrapping

00:06:43.443 --> 00:06:45.110
I'd like rather something presents

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.410
If you could have some thing gluten, sugar and dairy 
 free, I wanted to feel like I'm getting it.

00:06:50.406 --> 00:06:55.520
I'm going to eat my one, and it's wrapped here. Ohhh!!

00:06:58.405 --> 00:07:03.040
Oh my God! It's so good!

00:07:03.044 --> 00:07:09.650
I feel so healthy eating this and love it so much
