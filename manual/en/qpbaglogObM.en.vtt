00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:02.815
- [Voiceover] Let's say you're
in the babysitting business

00:00:02.815 --> 00:00:06.430
and you like to keep a log
of whom you are babysitting.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.069
So in the last month
you babysat six children

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.666
and you wrote the ages of
all six children in your log.

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.137
But then when you go back
to your log you notice

00:00:15.137 --> 00:00:18.297
that some blue ink spilled
over one of the ages

00:00:18.297 --> 00:00:21.632
and you forgot how old that child is.

00:00:21.632 --> 00:00:22.898
And at first you're really worried,

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:27.450
your whole system of
keeping records seems to...

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.433
you know, you've lost information.

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:31.084
But then you remember that every time

00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:34.350
you wrote down a new age that month,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.334
you recalculated the mean.

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:38.668
And so you have the
mean here of being four,

00:00:38.668 --> 00:00:41.801
the mean age is four for the six children.

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:44.802
So given that, given
that you know the mean,

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:47.301
and that you know five
out of six of the ages,

00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:50.037
can you figure out what the sixth age is?

00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:51.750
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.234
and try to figure it out on your own.

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:56.628
So assuming you've had a shot at it.

00:00:56.628 --> 00:00:58.612
So let's just call this missing age,

00:00:58.612 --> 00:01:00.547
let's call that question mark.

00:01:00.547 --> 00:01:02.580
So let's just think about
how do we calculate,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.918
how would we calculate a mean

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:06.605
if we knew what question mark is?

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:08.415
Well, we would take the total.

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:10.892
We would take the total of ages,

00:01:11.643 --> 00:01:13.619
of ages,

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.194
we would then divide that

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:18.508
by the number of children.

00:01:18.508 --> 00:01:21.583
We then divide that by the number

00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:24.217
of ages that we had,

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:26.532
and then that would be equal to,

00:01:26.532 --> 00:01:29.281
that would be equal to the mean.

00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:30.416
Or another way to think about it,

00:01:30.416 --> 00:01:33.954
if you multiply both sides
times the number of ages,

00:01:33.954 --> 00:01:37.802
the number of ages on that side

00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:42.329
and the number of ages on that side,

00:01:43.087 --> 00:01:44.921
then this is gonna cancel with that,

00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:46.880
and we're gonna be left with the total

00:01:47.887 --> 00:01:51.615
The total is going to be equal to,

00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:53.528
is going to be equal to the mean

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.073
times the number of ages.

00:01:57.073 --> 00:02:00.103
Mean times, and I'll just
write times the number,

00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:03.006
times number of data points,

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:05.671
or number of ages.

00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:07.187
So maybe we can use this information,

00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:08.624
'cause we're just going to have this

00:02:08.624 --> 00:02:09.938
missing question mark here and

00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:12.080
we know the mean and we
know the number of ages.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.937
So we just have to solve
for the question mark.

00:02:13.937 --> 00:02:15.037
So let's do that.

00:02:15.037 --> 00:02:16.338
So let's go back to the beginning here,

00:02:16.338 --> 00:02:18.838
just so this makes
sense with some numbers.

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:21.696
The total of ages, that's going to be

00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:25.992
five plus two

00:02:25.992 --> 00:02:27.827
plus question mark,

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:32.990
plus question mark, plus two, this two,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.241
plus two plus four plus eight.

00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:40.157
We're gonna divide by the number of ages.

00:02:40.157 --> 00:02:42.076
We're gonna divide it
by the number of ages.

00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:43.638
Well we have six ages here.

00:02:43.638 --> 00:02:46.156
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:02:46.156 --> 00:02:47.340
Six ages.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.193
And that's going to be equal to the mean.

00:02:49.926 --> 00:02:52.394
This is going to be equal to the mean.

00:02:52.394 --> 00:02:54.845
The mean here is four.

00:02:54.845 --> 00:02:57.375
So let's see, and this is just
how you calculate the mean.

00:02:57.375 --> 00:03:00.126
So let's see if we can simplify this.

00:03:00.126 --> 00:03:03.558
So five plus two is seven.

00:03:04.844 --> 00:03:06.795
Let me do this, that's the wrong color.

00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:10.378
Five plus two, five plus two is seven.

00:03:10.378 --> 00:03:12.948
Two plus four is six plus eight is 14.

00:03:13.682 --> 00:03:14.347
14.

00:03:14.347 --> 00:03:16.734
And then seven plus 14 is 21.

00:03:17.768 --> 00:03:20.252
So we're left with 21 plus question mark

00:03:20.252 --> 00:03:22.351
over six is equal to four.

00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:24.917
Now we can do what we did
when we just wrote it all out.

00:03:24.917 --> 00:03:27.752
We can multiply both sides
times the number of ages,

00:03:27.752 --> 00:03:28.936
the number of data points we have.

00:03:28.936 --> 00:03:31.209
So we can multiply both sides times six.

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.060
We can multiply both sides,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.658
both sides times six.

00:03:36.658 --> 00:03:39.893
So six on that side, six on this side.

00:03:39.893 --> 00:03:42.942
Six in the numerator, six in
the denominator, those cancel.

00:03:42.942 --> 00:03:44.610
So all we're left is,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.125
on the left-hand side we're
left with 21 plus question mark.

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:51.340
Alright. All of these other green numbers,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.274
those just simplified,

00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:55.208
five plus two plus two
plus four plus eight is 21

00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:56.520
and we still have the question mark.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.804
So we get 21 plus question mark,

00:03:59.804 --> 00:04:01.147
I want to do that green color,

00:04:02.392 --> 00:04:05.357
21 plus this question mark,

00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:06.871
the thing that we're trying to solve for.

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:10.460
The missing number is
going to be equal to,

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.272
is going to be equal to

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.353
four times six.

00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:16.885
Well what's four times six?

00:04:16.885 --> 00:04:18.536
That's 24.

00:04:19.203 --> 00:04:20.587
And so what's the question mark?

00:04:20.587 --> 00:04:23.705
21 plus what is equal to 24?

00:04:23.705 --> 00:04:24.721
And we could, of course,

00:04:24.721 --> 00:04:27.105
you might just say, well
it's gonna be three.

00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:28.404
Or, if you want to, you could say well,

00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:30.205
question mark is going to be,

00:04:30.205 --> 00:04:32.915
question mark is going to be equal to,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.729
is going to be equal to 24 minus 21.

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.307
Which is, of course, three.

00:04:40.116 --> 00:04:42.367
Which of course, so let
me just write this down,

00:04:42.367 --> 00:04:46.116
so the question mark is equal to three.

00:04:46.116 --> 00:04:48.431
So the missing age, you
were able to figure it out

00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:49.900
based on the information you had,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.165
because you had the mean,

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:54.067
you were able to figure out
that behind this blotch,

00:04:54.067 --> 00:04:58.240
that behind this blotch you had a three.

00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:00.443
It's exciting.
