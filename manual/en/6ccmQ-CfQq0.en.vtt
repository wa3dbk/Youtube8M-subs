Oh, Wow! This is Beautiful!

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.540

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.800

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.100

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.890
*Tropical Drum Beats*

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.920
*Parents Laughing*

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.430
*Tropical Drum Beats*

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.450
The ocean is so awesome.  Do you surf? Oh, yeah Definitely! 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.470
Hey, I'm the Dad. Good to meet you. How's it going?

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.240

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.610

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.140
Oh my god! Get out! Get out! Get out!

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.650
*Tropical Drum Beats*

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.690
We. We are the Etheridge family! We... No, no one?

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.970
Ok troops, I'm sure that the map said that the lake is this way.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.980
*Talking together* No, Dad it's this way.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.250
Wow, ancient hieroglyphics.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.270
Dad... uh, whatever.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.560
The Donner party was a group of settlers that got stranded in the mountains and they cannabalized each other.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.070
No, we're not lost.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.100
A part of the excitement of getting where you're going is the journey there.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.100
Are you sure about that?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.860
Yes I am.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.370
We're totally lost.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.380
Where are you taking us?

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.890
The lake!

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.170
Dad, I don't want to go any further. This is insane.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.690
I don't see a lake.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:02:01.050
*Tropical Drum Beats*

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.830
Ok, everybody smile. Come on we're having fun.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.340
No!

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.620
Honey...

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.900
Dad.. This isn't a lake.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.930
It's ok Dad. It's water.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.190
Thanks buddy.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.990
*Ocean sounds and sea gulls*
