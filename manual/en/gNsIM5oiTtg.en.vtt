Welcome to Pins and Things. Today, we're going to be making this amazing delicious crepe. What you're going to need is 6 eggs

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.569
1/4 cup of oil, 2 cups of flour

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.840
1/4 cup sugar or you can use 1/4 cup of honey, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of baking powder

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.260
And 3 cups of milk, so if you want pan cakes only add 2 cups of milk and they will turn out

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.640
perfect, and now I'll go ahead and mix it all together

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.900
I've mixed it until the lumps are mostly gone, so it's pretty thin and it just looks very

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.000
smooth. Okay now we're just gonna put them

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.260
Make sure to go slow because they expand because they're very thin

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.480
So while that's cooking, we're going to make some homemade whipped cream. Whipped cream is super easy

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.920
All you do is take some heavy whipping cream, so I usually use about a cup of it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.260
which is half and then one teaspoon, and I use the lid of vanilla

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.900
And now we're just going to add a little bit of honey

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.400
This is about a teaspoon. You can also add powdered sugar or agave. Whip it good

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.240
All right

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.880
It's ready to eat

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.020
While these are still cooking, I am going to make some chocolate sauce

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.420
so we're going to take 1 teaspoon of vanilla

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.160
and 4 tablespoons of honey

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.020
This is so yummy. This is worth it. It's like a semi-sweet chocolate sauce

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.160
an eight 1/4 ounce little squares of baker's chocolate

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.340
Playing a pancake is so wrong, you just flip it

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.420
So we're going to cook our chocolate sauce on super low heat and just make sure to stir as we go. It's done

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.720
This is how it should look and it is so delicious

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.020
Okay, we're going to put one of these babies together. I've got this chocolate sauce all ready

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.700
Just going to put a little bit of that in the middle

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.480
Smear it around

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.400
It's not a very pretty word

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.340
And you take some whipping cream, put that in the middle

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.680
And I've also cut up some fresh strawberries. I'm just going to fill it in there too

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.040
Now I'm going to roll it up, and then take some chocolate sauce and drizzle it on top

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.180
We're going to take a dollop of whipped cream and stick it right in the middle and top it off with some more strawberries

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.980
Perfect and it's gonna taste so good too

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.040
