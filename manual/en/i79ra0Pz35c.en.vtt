00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.850
For years, there’s been one classic, the
playground, held in the hearts of adults and

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:28.850
children.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.850
Remember the rush of wind flying back and
forth across your face—the count down of

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.850
3…2…1…before you let go, flying through
the air.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.850
Let your own children take to the air and
enjoy the one thing you’ll be sure never

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.270
to forget, with a Lifetime 10-foot Swing Set.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.680
With 2 belt swings and 1 trapeze bar with
gym rings, your kids will have hours of fun,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.640
right in the safety and convenience of your
own backyard.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.550
The Lifetime Swing Set is built with your
children’s safety in mind, because we have

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.040
children of our own.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.730
The set is made to pass playground safety
standards.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.890
All hard edges have been rounded or covered
to eliminate snagging or scratching of your

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.480
children’s skin and clothing, and the swing
chains have added rubber grips to prevent

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.229
their delicate little fingers from being pinched.Unlike
wooden swing sets, the Lifetime Swing Set

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.530
does not splinter or chip—keeping your kids
free of slivers, scrapes, or cuts.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.270
The powder-coated steel and high density polyethylene
plastic is heat resistant so kids can play

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.720
safely and comfortably during the hot summer
days.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.350
The Lifetime Swing Set is perfect for children
ages 3 to 12 years old, has a weight capacity

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.520
of 600 pounds, and is strong and durable enough
to provide your family with years of fun,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.830
and memories to last forever.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.860
With the Lifetime Swing Set, you don’t have
to worry about staining or painting your playground

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.400
equipment ever again.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.480
The UV-protection reduces fading or discoloration,
and the powder-coated steel is weather and

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.370
rust resistant to prevent cracking, chipping,
or peeling.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.830
Unlike other metal swing sets, the Lifetime
10-foot Swing Set has heavy-duty, 3 inch diameter,

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.270
16 gauge steel and is guaranteed to keep its
design and great looks for years to come.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.680
With durable support bases our swing set is
free-standing and simple to assemble with

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.480
no cement required, making it simple to move
around the yard, no matter how your family

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.510
or home changes.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.640
Give your kids a reason to leave the TV inside,
and create the same memories you had as a

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.640
child!

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.720
