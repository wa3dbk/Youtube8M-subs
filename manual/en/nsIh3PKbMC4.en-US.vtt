00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.900
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.500
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.500
Bells on bobtail ring'
Making spirits bright

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.549
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight!

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:07.549
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.690
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.590
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way;

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.500
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.089
A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:28.829
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side,

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:53.120
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:22.680
He got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot.
