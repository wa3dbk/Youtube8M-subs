00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.160
Introduction music track

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.120
 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.890
 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.500
 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.440
 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.900
 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.830
 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.830
 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.630
 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.489
Has it ever happened that you have big
plans for your child's birthday, and life

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.239
happens and you just can't

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.540
make the deadline and you feel bad but
at the end of the day it's just the way

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.879
that

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.190
the cookie crumbles, and so
sometimes we just have to be okay with

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.519
it being simpler

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.540
gonna show you how to make this Captain
America

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.710
easter egg cookie with edible markers

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.159
and we're going to keep it simple today

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.890
I've got a baked and cooled

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.049
egg shaped cookie, here you can see I
covered the cookie

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.049
in some white royal icing. Why
royal icing, because it dries

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.130
hard and so after its dry you will be able
to come back onto it with some markers

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.060
and decorated

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.880
 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.720
 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.360
here's that cookie it's dry it took an hour

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.360
and I have a nice smooth surface to be able
to draw on.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.950
Here's my template I'll have it on the blog, link in the description.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.940
 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.410
I'm working in edible markers, edible markers are available

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.480
a few companies around make
them

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.330
Here I have AmeriColor Foodoodler &amp; Rainbow Dist also makes some

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.070
 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.550
now I've got I've cut the template to
facilitate transferring

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.790
the design, I'm gonna start with the blue
marker

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.390
if you look at the marker you see it has a very fine tip.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.860
 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.179
This is ideal for transferring details.

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.570
I don't recommend that you start with a
black marker, now if you look here

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.690
this was the shape my actual cookie
cutter, the cookie warped in the baking process.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.840
Here he has these kind of like
wings coming out at the top of his head

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.590
and I'm leaning towards the paper just
to get a straight line

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.040
as well as a fine line since I'm not coloring
that has to be white

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.080
I'm doing a little circle on top of his
head now the "A"

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.130
I'm just lightly outlining the design

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.410
I'm half on my paper and
I'm just creating

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.130
a very fine line

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.850
and now the star

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.660
We don't outline his face in
blue we're gonna be outlining his face

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.920
with the skin color

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.850
to ensure we get a nice line, leaning
towards the paper

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.800
 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.140
Because the star needs to stay white

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.770
switching I'm taking the AmeriColor

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.660
pink does a pretty decent skin color

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.820
 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.010
 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.340
Now we're going to be
picking up the red

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.489
now I can outline the shield in red

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:42.489
here I'm going to draw the border

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.629
There we go and here

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.409
is the lower part

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:58.720
I'm going to do

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.800
the waist line then the red stripes

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.480
I will eyeball the rest without the template.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.430
 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.730
 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.890
And now you just colour the rest of the cookie

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.040
 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.200
 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.870
 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.590
 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.860
I don't like that I see so many

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.030
marker strokes and so I've got some
water

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.330
and I'm just passing all over my blue

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.240
areas to reduce

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.150
those lines and this gives it
more of a painted look.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.570
 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.990
It's helpful to have

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.410
your marker strokes all in the same
direction

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.120
 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.220
Here's the rainbow dust
marker and here's the AmeriColor

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.380
marker the AmeriColor gives a
darker black line but the other gives you more control.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.570
the black here you have to be very
gentle when you're coloring your cookie

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.979
Or else you are gonna get some really fat messy outlines

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.389
Here I'll demonstrate it for you with the AmeriColor

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.000
I am going to start with the outer perimeter.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.280
 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.050
 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.050
 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.169
 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.060
 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.890
Thanks for watching, I hope you
enjoyed this abbreviated version of

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.120
cookie decorating

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.140
when life happens and you still have a
birthday to celebrate

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.370
and your child is counting on their
number one baker to come through for

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.880
them

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.419
see you next time the

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:06.770
 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.650
 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.900
