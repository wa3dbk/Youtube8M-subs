Hey guys it’s Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy
Nummies!

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.250
I’ve been getting so many requests from
you guys to do something else Adventure Time

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.140
themed, and I love Adventure Time, and if
you can tell, my favorite character is

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.349
LSP! Lumpy Space Princess!

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.329
I also like cheesecake, so I thought, let’s
make some LSP Cheesecakes.

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.460
Let’s get started!

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.410
The things you will need, will be: 1 cup of
regular sugar, 2 cups of sour cream,

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.410
2 sh-ticks of cream cheese, 3 eggs, 1 tablespoon
of vanilla extract. A few drops

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.890
of icing coloring, the color I’m using is
violet. And I’m using a few drops of

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.440
raspberry flavoring, this part is totally
optional, if you remove this step it will just

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.300
be regular cheesecake. But I want a little
bit of Raspberry cheesecake today!

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.720
And then to make the crust for our cheesecake
you will need 1 cup of graham cracker

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.340
crumbs. These were so easy to make, I just
got a few graham crackers and threw them

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.070
in the blender and ta-da! 1 cup of graham
cracker crumbs!

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.890
Then you’ll also need 1/2 a stick of butter
and a pinch of cinnamon.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.689
Then, to make the shape of Lumpy Space Princess,
we are gonna be using this mini

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.360
flower silicone mold, this one’s by Wilton.
And if you’re interested in getting this

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.159
I’ll put a link down below so that it’s
easy to find.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.790
I just love these silicone molds because they’re
so easy to work with, and, look!

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.729
It’s a flower shape but multi-purpose!

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.249
We’re gonna be making Lumpy Space Princess!
Oh-hu-hu!

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.299
Alright, let’s put it all together!

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.329
The first thing that we’re gonna do is make
our cheesecake crust, it’s really easy!

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.829
You’re gonna take your cup of graham crackers,
put it in a mixing bowl, melt your

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.110
1/2 a stick of butter and pour it in. Then
you’re gonna add a pinch of cinnamon,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.840
then you’re gonna whisk it all together.
Now that we’ve got our crust all mixed up,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.340
we are gonna take a tablespoon, do a scoop,
and we’re gonna put it into each mold.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.759
You can use your fingers to pack it down once
it’s in there. Now that our crust

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.149
is all packed into the mold, I’m gonna place
this in the fridge for about

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.320
10 minutes to chill. And while this is chilling,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.440
we are gonna make our cheesecake filling!

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.820
To make our cheesecake filling, the first
thing that we’re gonna do is mix together

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.520
our cream cheeses until they are nice and
smooth. I’m using a stand mixer, but

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.250
if you don’t have 1 of these you can also
use a regular hand mixer. No big D!

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.350
And we’re just gonna stir together for about
a minute on a medium speed.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.490
Now add your sugar and mix for about 1 minute.
You want to make sure to scrape

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.770
down the sides in between mixing, so that
everything evenly mixes.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.080
Now we’re gonna add our 3 eggs, and I’m
gonna add my vanilla as well.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.400
Now we’re gonna mix it for another minute.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.340
Now we’re gonna scoop in our sour cream.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.860
Now we’re gonna mix again until it’s nice
and smooth and then we’re gonna add

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.350
some coloring. This part is totally optional,
I’m gonna be adding a little bit of

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.080
raspberry flavoring, and not too much, just
a little bit!

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.720
And then we’re gonna be adding a few drops
of our coloring, of violet, and just keep

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.860
adding color as you’re mixing until it becomes
the desired Lumpy Space Princess

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.800
purple that you love!

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.820
Now that our cheesecake filling is all done,
I just took our mold out of the

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.810
fridge, and now you’re gonna take a
little spoon, and you’re just gonna spoon

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.950
in the cheesecake filling to each mold! And
remember when you’re making cheesecake,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.630
it does not rise in the oven like a regular
cake, so you can fill them all the way to the top.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.900
This recipe that we’re using today is enough
to fill 2 molds, so you’ll be able to

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.620
make 12 little Lumpy Space Princesses!

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.510
Now that we’ve got our molds completely
filled, we’re ready to bake!

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.450
We’ve got to get our pan ready. Right over
here I have a roasting pan, I’ll put a

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.490
link down below so that you can order the
same 1 if you would like, and you’re gonna

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.400
take out this little rack in the middle. Move
it over here, and we’re gonna move

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.990
very carefully, our molds on top of the rack.
To just sit right here,

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.320
right in the middle. And then in our pan,
we’re gonna pour in 10 cups of water.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.570
Now we’re gonna head over to the oven, you’re
gonna preheat your oven to 325 degrees,

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.210
and we’re gonna place in the pan with the
water. And as the oven pre-heats, we’re

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.240
gonna allow the water to heat up as well.
Once it’s heated, you’re gonna take your

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.810
rack with the molds on top and gently place
it down into the water in the pan.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.620
Then you’re gonna bake for 27 minutes! Once
your little cheesecakes are done baking, you’re

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.960
gonna carefully remove the rack from the oven.
Use your hot mitts, it’s very hot!

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.110
And then we’re just gonna let them sit at
room temperature for 1 hour,

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.539
and then we’re gonna pop these in the fridge
to chill for 3 full hours.

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.139
After your little cheesecakes have chilled
in the fridge, now we’re gonna pop them

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.580
out and decorate! I just wanted to show you
how to pop ‘em out.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.710
It’s really, really easy! Because these
are silicone molds, you can bend them.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.259
So you just pull them apart, I like to pull
off the sides, just a little bit,

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.139
give it a little stretch. And then push from
underneath, oh, look! There we go!

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.139
And it’s popped out! Little cheesecake!

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.460
Now it’s time to decorate, my favorite part!

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.169
To decorate, you’ll be needing some jumbo
sprinkle stars, I’ll put a link down

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.969
below where you can find these. And we're gonna
be using some black decorative icing.

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.870
I really like these because they have, at
the end, you can put little adjustable

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.560
tips for more control. And I’m using a umber
2 tip to make

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.540
her little facial expressions!

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.919
I love this idea because it’s super easy
to decorate!

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.900
You’re just gonna take a little star, put
it right on the top

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.060
where her head is, ooooh! Then you’re gonna
take your decorative icing and

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.590
draw her little eyeballs. You can get really
creative with it, Lumpy Space Princess

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.939
has so many facial expressions. Mostly sassy
faces, so if you want to do all sass

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:45.259
face, that is totally OK!

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.440
Ta-da! Here are the Lumpy Space Princess Mini
Cheesecakes that we made today!

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.110
I hope you guys enjoyed them, they were so
much fun to make. I love that you can

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.469
make her facial expressions different on every
single 1! So if you have a friend

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:02.889
who likes her when she’s sassy, or when
she’s cute or scared, you can do

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.590
whatever you’d like. I’ll be posting lots
of pictures of these on Facebook, Tumblr,

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.529
Instagram and Twitter!

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:11.599
And if you guys make these please send me
photos, I get a big kick out of seeing

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.520
your baking creations! It just kind of makes
my day!

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.889
