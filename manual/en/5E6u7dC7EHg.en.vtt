00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.380
So I’ve got a new project here

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.600
I’m going to be showing you how to replace

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.800
The strut assembly on this 2005 Toyota Tacoma

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.950
Without using a spring compressor

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.890
And this is my brother’s truck

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.480
I’ve got another video posted up

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.570
And I’ll throw up a…

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.850
I’ll annotate a link to that

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.410
Here’s the new struts

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.630
And he also got some heavier coil springs

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.740
Because he does have the ARB bumper

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.780
And there is a winch in there as well

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.940
So he needs the heavier coil springs to support

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.830
The weight of that front bumper and winch
assembly

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.530
So, we’ll get to it

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.730
This is actually really, really easy

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.230
We just finished up doing the driver’s side

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.460
This here is the passenger side

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.820
So, we’ll get started on this

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.249
And we’ll show you how to get this done

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.270
Well the first part of this project is you
need to get

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.690
The vehicle safely supported on a good set
of jack stands

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.160
And get your tires and wheels off

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.460
Now, we are going to need to loosen

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.170
The lower control arms and drop them out of
the way

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.039
So what we’re doing here

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.590
We’re putting a couple of little marks on
the alignment cams

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.410
So that when we retighten the lower control
arm

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.820
We can get it roughly in the ballpark of where
it was

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.619
So that we can safely drive the vehicle to
the alignment shop

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.590
And after any suspension modification

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.509
You do need to take your truck in to have
it realigned

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.840
After we’ve made the marks on the lower
control arm alignment cams

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.700
We need to support the lower control arm

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.740
With this floor jack here

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.649
There are 2 bolts that need to be removed

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.229
They connect the lower ball joint assembly

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.200
To the actual steering knuckle

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.899
So we’ve got to pull these out

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.509
So that we can drop the control arm down further

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.380
You do not need to remove the actual ball
joint

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.040
So here’s the 2 bolts that you need to remove

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.700
You can see us putting the socket on these
2 bolts

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.179
They take a 19mm socket

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.479
There you can also see the castle nut and
the cotter pin

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.200
For the ball joint

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.390
You do not need to take that assembly apart

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.330
You just need to remove these 2 bolts

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:27.819
Well here we are

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.170
We’re loosening the lower control arm mounting
bolts

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.790
You do not need to take the lower control
arm off

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.569
You just need to loosen the bolts

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.010
So that the lower control arm

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.019
Will swing down far enough

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.399
The you can remove the strut assembly

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.060
The next step of this process

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.900
Is to remove the nut on the top of the shock

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.400
With a 17mm wrench

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.959
At this point we are not going to be removing

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.329
The 3 bolts that hold the tophat bushing

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.049
To the shock tower assembly

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.769
We’re only going to remove this one nut
on top of the shock

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.060
So now that we have that top nut removed

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.430
Holding the shock in place

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.690
We’re going to use the floor jack

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.969
To slowly lower the suspension

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.420
And effectively what we’re doing

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.249
Is we’re using the weight of the truck as
a spring compressor

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.040
And as we lower the floor jack

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.860
And drop the suspension down

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.709
That spring will decompress slowly and safely

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.079
So that it doesn’t fly out and injure you

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.840
When you’re trying to pull it out

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.340
Here you can see we’ve got all the spring
tension

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.530
Released and now we can unbolt the strut

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.370
From the lower control arm

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.750
And safely pull the assembly out of the truck

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.409
So not only are we replacing the spring and
the strut assembly

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:01.480
The shock absorber

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.040
We’re also going to replace the tophat

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.160
This here, this is the new one

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.360
And you can see some damage here

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.719
See how that hole is wallowed out

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.260
And I’ll come over here and I’ll show
you on the shaft

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.760
Can you see how it looks like someone has
been trying to chop down a tree

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.609
So this shaft was walking around in there

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.639
So we needed to replace this tophat as well

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:28.930
And one thing I want to mention

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.240
You can see the different lengths of the shock

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.449
There is supposed to be positive pressure

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.210
Pushing up on the shaft

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.419
This one’s fully collapsed

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.960
And it’s been collapsed for more than an
hour

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.280
And it has not reset

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.180
So this shock absorber is junk

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.720
It definitely needed to be replaced
