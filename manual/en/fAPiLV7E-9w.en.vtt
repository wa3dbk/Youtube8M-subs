00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:17.670
Many people don’t understand the importance
of believing in a literal 6 day creation.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.449
Most Hebrew scholars agree that the wording
used in the Creation account indicates literal

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.180
24 hour days.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.230
An old Earth view gives rise to many ungodly
theories such as death before sin, human-primate

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.989
origins, a chance cosmos, and other speculative
views.

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.720
Not only that, it suggests to non-Christians
that we are prepared to compromise our belief

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.030
in the Bible when man spouts an impressive
sounding “billions of years ago”.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.690
An old Earth doesn’t explain the origins
of our 7-day week with its seventh day Sabbath.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.820
Genesis 1 tells us that God called the light
day, and the darkness night, and that He created

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.179
the sun and moon to divide the days.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:07.830
Today, this cycle of light and darkness is
24 hours — Just as it was IN THE BEGINNING.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.240
According to Genesis 3:20, Eve was to be the
mother of everyone, making life before Adam

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.030
and Eve impossible.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.140
The Big Bang theory questions not only the
young earth, but also the very existence of

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.540
God.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.890
Where did the matter in the universe come
from in the first place?

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.750
What caused a big bang?

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.110
And how could space be formed with such intricate
design and beauty?

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.050
The theory of an old earth – while gaining
support by some – has many problems and

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.750
unanswered questions.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:49.240
These theories have NO PLACE in Biblical Christianity.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.200
I’m David Rives…

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:05.310
Truly, The Heavens Declare the Glory 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:15.620
of God.
