00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.968
- Well, hello everyone!

00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:03.603
My name is Tyler Oakley
and about four years ago,

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:06.173
MTV did a documentary about Nicki Minaj

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:07.802
and there was one interview that I just

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:09.943
always remembered and always thought of as

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.446
time went on, and as my career progressed,

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:13.747
I always thought about this.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:16.550
It's a story that she told
about pickles and pickle juice.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.889
Basically she's talking about if she were

00:00:17.889 --> 00:00:20.721
to show up to a photo shoot,
that's got like a 50 dollar

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.657
budget for clothes, it's got
like instead of a whole table

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:25.459
of snacks and things for the models,

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:26.760
the for the photographers, for the staff,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.762
for everybody, it's just
got a plate of pickles,

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.598
she is saying that if she saw that

00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:31.698
when she showed up to a photo shoot,

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:32.866
she would leave.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.067
And basically she asked a question,

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.402
is it a bad thing?

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.671
Is that a bad thing to
want more for yourself,

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:39.106
and to expect more for yourself,

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:42.038
and to demand a level of respect

00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:43.577
that comes with putting so much

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:44.911
of yourself into your work.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:45.879
And it makes me think,

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.281
and it makes me approach all of my work

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.082
with the same mindset.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.184
If you accept the pickle juice,

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.786
you're going to be drinking pickle juice

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.187
for the rest of your life.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.655
But if you say no to the pickle juice,

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.624
the people that you will be working with,

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.626
are gonna know better
and they're gonna respect

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:01.829
your work as much as
you respect your work.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.629
It's not just work.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.430
It could be relationships.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.598
It could be friendships.

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:07.534
It could be your family,
your work, your education.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:08.702
It could be whatever!

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:11.805
If you're trying to deliver
quality in your life,

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.474
in whatever aspect, and what
other people are contributing

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:17.878
is not the same quality, are you, in turn,

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.313
accepting pickle juice?

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:20.790
So I guess if I were to have a takeaway

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.217
for this video, it would
be if you are delivering

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:25.085
something of quality, and somebody else

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.054
is giving you pickle
juice, fix the situation.

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:28.622
Get rid of them from your life,

00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:30.624
or from your work, or from whatever,

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.025
and find people that know better

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.293
than to deliver pickle juice.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.027
That's all.

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:34.995
That's all I gotta say!

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:36.129
I hope you like this video!
