hey guys this is jithin and

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.099
im going to show how to use the plugin BuyPack

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.519
Made by this guys

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.099
to stop home actually just run server

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.259
else does which are treated so I don't
worry about it

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.590
so once you get that you should be
enough boulder like

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.590
thats my pack and if yes actually doing
work to confiscate really doesn't really

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.179
matter

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.590
the number purges you can turn after I'm
turning

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.580
this on for this and if you guys too
many anglers occasioned

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.410
up let me just update c-class true and
whatever continuity

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.890
deliver language like to use it does
comments like French

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.090
soul that's what you get so once you
open bite back

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.730
%uh the pacs less clothes you can create
new text file

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.219
and peace this practically

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.739
so let me show you packs how to create
one

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.440
so one yet have a title

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.960
CFK title call an example what we like
to call it

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.440
description are might

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.459
back examples how much cost so it's

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:17.740
for now the for in that %uh in the main
page it's

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.420
says they're ok but I'm gonna do my own
customer here

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.330
then it's a command when a player to ice
pack the Consul sense disconnect

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.030
and how long durations tax played in all
takes time here

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.750
lol how long it does last 10 seconds

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.360
how many times a lot but this one pack
um for one player

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.310
its said its whatever and welcome back
to be done

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.110
when the time is over so when I get here
is

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.759
and is eating exit might need it cost
100 I hate crime and crime

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.300
game ok I'm actually gonna um

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.610
cool pushes right now so push Christians

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.780
sheen's pushed sucks so right now as you
can see

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.560
it says reggae this is for no space and
this means

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.129
you have that's based so who would take
respect time in seconds

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.380
so for example despite its command

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.380
potions I'll which one is

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.960
endurance last 10 second-degree steer

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.320
so I'm actually gonna make my last

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.520
50 seconds and

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.800
I make my game around Astley five
seconds

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.840
you can change this to enroll early like

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.780
to me last too long like you so

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.510
be careful about that our options and be
careful about but

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.100
that's about it I'm gonna run server she
cancelled exactly use it

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.140
host

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.160
good

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.680
smacked my look school students is ok
and Egypt

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.990
so I'm urgently

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.310
in game 10 but i wanna by

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.560
pack so in the list this is what you get

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.770
10 I'll example and cause hundred
dollars

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.370
and if you wanna know info about it info

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.400
example latest caps and up

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.569
case sensitive so I can buy

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.069
though pack all example what it's like
that back gate

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.140
cue cost $100 and the

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.980
its last five seconds and slashed by

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.130
black I don't think that okay

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.130
so you can buy actually people or by
yourself

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.360
so to buy its by back by

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.890
up to buy for someone else by other

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.660
and butter packed going to college and
what a player

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.000
if you're using to buy back up solid
showing us by just buying one time

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.069
pack by example and

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.590
their last five seconds but for 3

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.410
to you run and co-evolution fax

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.810
endurance that's pretty resistance so
that's the bush in fact

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.019
so that's that and I'll be showing you
how to use a sign

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.699
X %uh how do you sign in hugging its
intractable

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.639
so grab yourself a sign play said by

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.350
no me da caps not sure if this is key
since thats

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.000
by packed were really to cuddle whatever
the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.500
pakis and it says it costs 100

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.919
last five seconds well fire dance floor

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.330
tree to you wunderkammer consistory here
and knock

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.100
ok thats so I'm

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.970
being attacked I scouted my goodness
kick

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.740
so that works with the Suns so that's
started on that

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.800
we can run like multiple commands on one
pack

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.639
and yeah

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.419
something I'm missing and dead so this
command ranked

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.880
after 5 seconds like a sec so that's
what I don't miss

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.210
comments really great clintonites to my
own server

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.970
so yeah oh and one last thing

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.560
later what every label this

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.410
doesn't matter I labeled it a real
people five but this title

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.290
so you got started late likely on not
just look out for that

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.060
don't mess up on that some that spot in
our at

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.090
somewhat check it out later

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.530
or now really like it so we'll see us
