00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.810
Dr. Robert van de Geijn: Now, we
can make things even more complex.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.065
We can ask the question,
what the probabilities are

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:11.592
a week from today, given
that today it is sunny.

00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:13.550
Well, we're not going to
answer this right now,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.799
because what we're going to do is, we're
going to program this up in a minute.

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:18.930
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.210
To do so, though, we need
to introduce some notation.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.180
We're going to say that chi sub s
super k is the probability that it's

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.380
sunny k days from now.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.460
Similarly, chi sub c k, chi sub r k.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:44.570
Now, I could, of course, have said, chi
sub 0 k, I sub 1 k, and chi sub 2 k,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.102
but it's kind of convenient
to use s, c, and r, so

00:00:48.102 --> 00:00:50.730
that we know it's
sunny, cloudy, or rainy.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.781
 

00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:54.280
OK.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.980
So here's our table again.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.290
And notice that we can
ask the question, what

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.370
is the probability of it
being sunny on day k plus 1,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:11.660
given that the probability of it being
sunny on day k is chi sub s super k.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.800
And the same thing for cloudy
on day k and rainy on day k.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.600
Well, that's a matter of looking
at what the probabilities are

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.400
going from sunny to sunny, cloudy
to sunny and rainy to sunny,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.750
and you get this right here.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.210
And you could do the
same thing to figure out

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.300
what the probability is of it
being cloudy on day k plus 1

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.240
or rainy on day k plus 1.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.490
 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.910
And what you notice here is that
this is a system of linear equations.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.890
That's a term that you
may have heard before.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.160
And if not, I now introduce it.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.600
You'll also notice that this can be
written as a matrix vector multiply,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.130
because this matrix vector
multiplied with this matrix

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.100
is just this times that
plus this times that

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.700
plus this times that for the first one.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.860
And that must be equal
to that, et cetera.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.450
So, now we recognize matrix
vector multiplication

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.310
as a compact way of writing
a system of linear equations.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.250
And then we can say, OK, well
we could call this matrix

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.030
P. That's known as
the transition matrix.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.550
And we can call the
vector that tells us what

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.870
the state is on day k, the
state vector, x super k.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.370
So, we have a notion of a state
vector, x super k, the state on day k,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.920
and a transition matrix
P. So, what we notice

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.880
is that matrix vector
multiplication is now

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.920
used to compactly write a set of
simultaneous linear equations.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.320
So, here we have a vector that tells
us the probabilities that today it

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.550
is sunny, cloudy, or rainy.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.780
Well, we can look out the
window and see what it is.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.780
And let's say that it is cloudy.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.880
As a matter of fact, I think
today it is cloudy here.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.220
What vector represents that?

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.050
Well, our good old friend
the unit basis vector.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.160
In this case, the second
unit basis vector.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.780
OK.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.140
What happens if you
ask the question, what

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.910
are the probabilities of it being sunny,
cloudy, or rainy, on day one, tomorrow,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.580
given that today it is cloudy?

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.310
Well, that's a matter of doing
this matrix times vector multiply.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.320
And if we plug in that today
it is cloudy, then what we get

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.380
is just this multiplication.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.840
But we could have
simply said, oh, we know

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.070
that when we do a matrix vector
multiplication with a unit basis

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.780
vector, we'd simply pick
out the appropriate column.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.700
And there you have it.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.410
 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.140
So, we shouldn't be surprised.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.210
P, the transition matrix
times a unit basis vector

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.920
picks out the appropriate column.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.610
If we now want to know what the
probabilities will be for the day

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.070
after tomorrow, all we need to
do is take our transition matrix

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.700
and multiply it times
the vector that indicates

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.230
the probabilities for tomorrow.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.120
We just calculated what that was,
and when we multiplied it out,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.400
we got the vector of probabilities
for the day after tomorrow.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.690
And notice that this is a lot
easier than writing out the tree

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.590
that we would have had
to write out otherwise.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.650
What now if we want to know what
the probabilities are for a week

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.810
from now, given that today
it's sunny, cloudy, or rainy?

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.599
Well, we know how to do that now.

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.140
That's a matter of doing a bunch
of matrix vector multiplies.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.280
 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.690
But it's a lot easier if
we use the computer to do

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.070
the heavy lifting for us, so I want
you to now go and open up the Python

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.590
notebook, predicting the
weather for the next week.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.824
And I'll see you in the next video.

00:05:00.824 --> 00:05:01.324
