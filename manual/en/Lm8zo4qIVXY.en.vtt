Welcome to Xyron Inspiration in Motion.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.630
You already love Xyron products for their
use in scrap booking, but did you also know

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.619
that Xyron is terrific for kid's crafts, home
decor, school projects and more?

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.989
We've created some short project videos to
get your creativity juices flowing, so come

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:28.989
on in!

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.430
Today, I'm going to show you how to put together
an album cover in just seconds using all the

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.180
different creative different sticker machines.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.329
I've already gone ahead and run my photo and
mat and decorative frame through the 5 inch

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:42.329
Create A Sticker.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.039
I can just go ahead and lay that right on
top of my album cover.

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.100
Now, I'm going to run my border through my
1.5 inch Create a Sticker also known as the

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.729
150 or the X.

00:00:53.729 --> 00:01:01.199
Just going to pull this through and I'm also
going to run two pieces of ribbon, right into

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.199
the X.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.920
There is actually a split down the middle
of the machine so you can put one piece of

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:15.500
ribbon on each side and I'm going to take
my little title "Clemens Cat" and run that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.530
through as well.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.810
So, I've got all of my pieces.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.700
I'm going to give it a good rub.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.840
I've also cut some die cut crowns out earlier
and run those through my 150.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.840
I'm going to go ahead and peel this off 
and one last embellishment before I start

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.870
putting this together is my paw print.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.740
I'm going to put that into the 2.5 inch Create
a Sticker as well.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.390
So, now I've got all of my pieces ready to
go and I literally just start creating.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.750
I can put one piece on top of another.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.979
It makes your projects go by so quickly.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.820
It's great for kids, there's no glue.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.039
I'm going to take my title "Clemens Cat" and
I'm actually going to adhere it onto a metal

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.039
tag.

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.679
That's one of the other great things about
Xyron products is that it works on a variety

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:09.679
of mediums.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.750
So, I've got my title right onto my metal.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.280
Now I'm going to take my gold ribbon.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.971
I'm actually going to lay a portion of this
onto the project and then I'm going to add

00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:30.990
my metal tag.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:40.900
Put it right into place and we are ready to
go.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.100
I'm going to fold the ends over.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.370
We will going to add a cute little, how about
this cute crown, just to add an embellishment.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.320
We are going to put that right, how about
on the cat and the album page is already completed

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.210
but now since I've got so much time and so
much fun stuff, I'm actually going to flip

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.210
the page over.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.090
I've got this page partially done as well.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:15.320
I'm going to take that second piece of ribbon
and put that right onto my project and take

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.290
my paw print and lay that right on top of
the ribbon.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.270
Also, these machines also give you a nice
dimensional feel to your products as well.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.820
Now, in about 30 seconds I've completed two
pages of my project already.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.800
