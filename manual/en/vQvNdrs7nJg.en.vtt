00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.660
How to change your toilet seal after a tile floor.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.120
Usually the tile floor raises this up a bit,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.360
but this one was up quite high because it's a lead piece

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.780
that's moulded over a brass ring.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.300
And then the brass ring is fastened to the floor, but

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.540
I had to change the bolt so how you change the bolts,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.360
is you find, there's a wide spot in here somewhere,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.360
and you've got to find that.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.120
And then the bolt will come out of there,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.460
see it's wider there than it is in here,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.900
so you can slip it in there and then turn it around,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.880
and then you can spin that bolt so it doesn't work,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.160
it doesn't turn when you're passing the toilet down.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.800
This is called a can't leak one,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.000
because it's got that little plastic seal in there,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.740
which actually is lower than the rest.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.980
So, now we've got new toilet bolts.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.470
The old ones were too short

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.050
because of the added three eights of floor on there,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.600
and the bolts were too short,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.980
but I think the seal is fine.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.180
And now I'll just grab the toilet,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.500
and set it down on the seal.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.370
I've got new bolts in there,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:29.840
and then I can draw it down into the wax seal.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.640
So, it's not that hard, but sometimes,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.860
after you tile the floor,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.680
you've got to put longer bolts in.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.840
And if you've really, if the thing was level to begin with,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.440
if this flange was level to begin with,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.670
you may have to add a piece of flange,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.910
which you can do. This is a,

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.440
you can buy the flange pieces at any plumbing supply

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.180
or tile supply, I guess. And away you go.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.960
So, back to installing this toilet again,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.040
after putting all the thicker tiles on the floor,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.460
we had to add longer bolts for the toilet,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.920
which we did before, but now, also, this is too short,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.920
the supply pipe is too short.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.500
So the best thing to do is replace it.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.480
This is what I always do,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.700
replace it with about a twelve inch supply line,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.300
and these are much easier, you just hand tighten these,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.980
and tighten that a little bit with a wrench, but not much

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.700
because they have little rubber things in them,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.100
and they can flex around and go.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.380
It's much easier than trying to work with this old stuff.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.080
No plumbers use this stuff anymore

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.220
because this is much better.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.220
They're only about five bucks,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.220
and they really do the trick.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.080
They're called a steel supply line,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.250
or stainless steel toilet supply line.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.560
Five bucks at a local hardware store or lumber yard,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.380
and you've got it made. You just hand screw it on here,

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.040
on the top,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.220
and then you fit it to the bottom.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.760
I always just bend them up like that, and I can,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.000
that'll thread on to the bottom real easy.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.480
It's actually started there, so that's cool.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.080
That's how we do it. That's how we roll.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.731
