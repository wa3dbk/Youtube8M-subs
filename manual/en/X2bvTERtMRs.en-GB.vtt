Hello - Vince Stanzione from winonmarkets.net
Making Money From Financial Spread Betting

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.740
here, and if you're watching this it's likely
that you've already visited my site. So you've

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.840
read the press cuttings, and seen the testimonials,
and you're thinking, will this work for me?

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.320
And, if it's so good, why is he selling it?
Both valid questions, and I'll do my best

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.300
to answer them for you.
When we venture into a new business or take

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.489
interest in a new subject, there are always
doubts, challenges and highs and lows. And

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.440
Financial Trading, Make Money Money Shares
is no different.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.340
I've been doing this for 28 years, and my
course is designed to give you access to all

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.390
that knowledge in an easy to follow format.
If you tried to get from A to B with no map

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.190
and no SatNav, I'm sure you'd get there eventually,
with lots of wrong turns and stops to ask

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.430
for directions along the way. But of course
it'd be much easier and faster to have the

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.159
route mapped out for you.
And that's exactly what the Making Money From

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.090
Financial Spread Trading course is -- a route
showing you what works and what doesn't that's

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.450
easy to follow. It's a workbook, 2 DVD's,
unlimited access to my website and support.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.659
It's written in plain English, and you can
watch videos where I'll explain everything

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.060
clearly for you. You also get access to a
virtual account, so you can practise what

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.260
you're learning without risking a real penny.
So if it's so good, and I'm making a lot of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.650
money, why am I bothering to sell it?
Well, before I even started selling the course

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.780
back in 1997, I'd already accumulated substantial
wealth from my other businesses and my own

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.640
investing. The course was, and still is, an
enjoyable side-line. I basically got sick

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.010
of people asking me things like "How do you
make so much money from Trading?", or "Why's

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.090
my Broker getting so rich while I make little
or nothing?"

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.290
Financial markets are massive. Trillions of
dollars go through the system every day and

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.650
we're all just specs on the radar. So sharing
my knowledge and techniques with you doesn't

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.000
affect me in any way. Seriously, if it did
then I wouldn't pass the info on!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.900
Anyway, I'm not into the hard sell and all
the work that goes into that. I know I can

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.470
help you, and I've already made a big difference
to countless people in

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.629
over 100 countries around the world. Take
a look at www.winonmarkets.net to find out

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.650
more.
And if there are any questions we haven't

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.019
answered, you're very welcome to email and
we'll get right back to you. Thanks for watching.
