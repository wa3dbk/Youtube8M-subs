00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.259
The oil and gas
industry relies on formation evaluation

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:07.330
for critical decisions.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.090
Clean formation fluid samples are vital
to these decisions.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.170
Real-time fluid information is
traditionally obtained using

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.180
optical analysis.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.060
Based on the color of light
passed through formation fluids

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.450
and a few assumptions, a rough analysis
determines when the cleanest

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.950
sample can be taken. This basic
technique

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.250
and the limited information derived 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.480
has remained largely unchanged for many years.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.410
Until now.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.769
Halliburton presents ICE Core fluid
analyzer technology.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.100
ICE Core technology features integrated
computational elements.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.640
They bring laboratory grade optical
analysis downhole for the first time.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.140
Let's take a look at the basics of optical analysis.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.340
Light passes through formation fluids.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.740
In a laboratory, a high-resolution spectrometer is used
to gather

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.270
optical spectra to determine fluid
properties.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.679
But traditional downhole spectroscopy
only uses a small fraction of the

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:18.729
inherent information in that signal

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.759
because only a few points are actually
sampled.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.780
When the spectral information is limited,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.860
only a few fluid components can be resolved.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.509
ICE Core technology however utilizes

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.720
all the information in the spectrum.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.600
This new proven approach results in a
laboratory grade

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.100
optical analysis of downhole chemistry.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.380
It also sees a spectral range that traditional technology

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.860
simply cannot access.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.920
The ICE Core fluid analyzer technology
measures 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.640
more components than any other downhole  method

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.890
yielding a far better picture of fluid
chemistry

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.410
with the maximum inherent information. How? 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.880
During sampling operations

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.260
fluids flow through the tool and
readings are taken in real time.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.970
Halliburton's ICE Core analyzer

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.700
uses high-resolution multi-variant
optical regression

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.040
to provide detailed accurate chemical
information.  

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.520
It's the integrated computational

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.239
element or ICE Core analyzer that make
this possible.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.260
It's a first in the industry and only
available from Halliburton.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.120
The ICE Core analyzer performs
calculations optically 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.600
eliminating the need for a

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.680
downhole spectrometer and digital computer. 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.100
Using a special process

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.640
we encode individual chemical
fingerprints on each element 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.780
of the ICE Core fluid analyzer

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.269
so that they respond selectively to
different fluid components.

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.630
Halliburton's ICE Core fluid
analyzer technology

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.850
produces laboratory quality optical
analysis

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.270
in real time.
