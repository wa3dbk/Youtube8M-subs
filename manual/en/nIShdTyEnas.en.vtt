00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.017
The Planet

00:00:02.018 --> 00:00:06.346
Imagine that Earth was only one day old

00:00:06.347 --> 00:00:08.933
It was born at midnight,

00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:12.376
Life appeared at 5 o'clock in the morning

00:00:12.377 --> 00:00:16.455
The dinosaurs arose at 10:30 P.M.

00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:19.376
... and lived for one hour

00:00:19.377 --> 00:00:23.205
Our first ancestors looked upon the sun

00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:25.871
more or less 20 seconds ago

00:00:25.872 --> 00:00:31.229
And our first civilization came up half a second ago

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.300
In the last 200 years, mankind used more resources

00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:40.553
from our planet than in 1 million years

00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:43.387
We just destroyed nearly everything

00:00:43.388 --> 00:00:49.236
in little less than 3 miliseconds.

00:01:14.714 --> 00:01:17.684
For millennia

00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:20.460
I was here

00:01:20.565 --> 00:01:23.583
 The human age

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.514
is going to end

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:30.867
The seals are opening,

00:01:30.868 --> 00:01:34.212
there are several signs,

00:01:34.213 --> 00:01:36.923
Your innate children

00:01:37.093 --> 00:01:41.517
will not be born anymore

00:01:56.778 --> 00:02:02.424
Of all the beings that live here,

00:02:02.425 --> 00:02:09.284
 Only those destroy what I did

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:12.859
What race is this, 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.214
what is their ambition?

00:02:16.215 --> 00:02:23.077
Only fools seed their own extinction

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:27.299
It's the end of the river,

00:02:27.386 --> 00:02:29.894
It´s the end of the sea

00:02:29.953 --> 00:02:37.778
What else is going to end?

00:02:39.316 --> 00:02:42.238
The cruel tomorrow, 

00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:45.023
more and more

00:02:45.024 --> 00:02:53.792
What God will save us?

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.857
I can’t understand

00:04:25.858 --> 00:04:28.820
what is the reason

00:04:28.821 --> 00:04:34.960
And what is their limit?

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:42.333
What wisdom exists

00:04:42.334 --> 00:04:49.042
 if they kill everything they see

00:04:50.586 --> 00:04:53.455
It's the end of the sky,

00:04:53.456 --> 00:04:55.971
It's the end of the water

00:04:55.972 --> 00:05:04.182
What else is going to end?

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.312
It warmed the planet, 

00:05:08.313 --> 00:05:10.899
polluted the air

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:18.773
What God will save us?

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:20.869
Now it’s time 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.171
to see the end of this people

00:06:26.971 --> 00:06:28.846
My limit was reached 

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:32.169
a long time ago

00:06:34.801 --> 00:06:38.847
Their development always was 

00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:42.829
unsustainable to me

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.950
Only a miracle could delay their end

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.878
Now it’s time

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.289
to see the end of this people

00:06:58.907 --> 00:07:00.889
 My limit was reached 

00:07:00.924 --> 00:07:04.070
a long time ago

00:07:06.822 --> 00:07:10.833
Their development always was

00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:14.261
 unsustainable to me

00:07:14.807 --> 00:07:20.506
Only a miracle could delay their end
