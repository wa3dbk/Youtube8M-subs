00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.500
Vsauce!

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.500
Kevin here.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.839
For almost three thousand years the cure-all
for any medical ailment was bleeding.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.370
It was believed that being sick was due to
an imbalance of the four humors: blood, phlegm,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.560
black bile and yellow bile.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.930
So whether someone had a seizure or a fever
- they thought it was due to having too much

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.720
blood and therefore had to remove some by
cutting at the elbow or letting leeches suck

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.720
it out.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.470
George Washington died after half of his blood
was removed as treatment for a severe sore

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.480
throat.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.171
Trepanning is the oldest surgical procedure
we have archaeological evidence of and it

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.829
consists of drilling a hole in the skull.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.850
It was often performed for medical purposes
to cure migraines, epileptic seizures, and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.690
even mental disorders by means of releasing
the evil spirits trapped in the head.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.180
In the 60s Dutchman Bart Hughes performed
self-trepanation using an electric drill and

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.040
advocated others to do the same in order to
increase the volume of brainblood and reach

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.020
a higher state of consciousness - a claim
to which the scientific community said umm.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.619
No.

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.020
The enema has also been around for thousands
of years - being mentioned in detail on Ancient

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.830
Egyptian Papyrus circa 1600 BC.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.759
The rectal purge was performed using hollowed
out animal bones attached to liquid-filled

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.659
gourds and were purported to cure everything
from the common cold and allergies to headaches.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.950
17th Century France became so obsessed with
internal cleansing some had three or four

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.759
enemas a day and King Louis XIV is said to
have had thousands.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.530
Even receiving enemas while hanging out with
his buddies.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:56.140
When the Great Plague of London hit in 1665,
attempted remedies included tobacco smoke

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.780
which led to children being instructed to
smoke in schoolrooms to passing gas in a jar

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.040
and then smelling it - because they believed
foul smells caused the plague, and they could

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.069
fight it off with foul smells of their own.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.840
And as always - thanks for watching!
