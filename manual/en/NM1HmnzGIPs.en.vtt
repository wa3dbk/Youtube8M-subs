Unfortunatelly, the correct answer is "Zbigniew the dog"

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.800
Zbigniew the Dog

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.197

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.646
I'm taking you on a field trip!

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.540
I'm also up your nose.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.200
I'm everywhere.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.820
Tell me, Agatha, how old are you?

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.220

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.420
Who's that?

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.540
Margaret 3000

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.740
Don't worry about it.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.780
What does it mean?

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.240
Just as I thought...

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.200
Quickly! You have to miss a finger!

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.940
Emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency!

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.300

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.040
Settle down, settle down, settle down, settle down!

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.280
This is only a dog test

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.060
Emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency!

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.880
MOM

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.600
IT'S ME

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.420
AGATHA

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.380
CAUTION! BAD DOG

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.340
I picked up the phone and I looked a little bit like bwaaaah!

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.300
Something's not right - run to the last episode!

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.838
DOG TEST

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.020
Come back, come back, come back, come back!

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.320
My hands smelled like potatoes

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.780
I didn't understand it and I couldn't fully accept it

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.660
You can say, I just wasn't fully myself.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.820
"The Mushroomland is nice,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.040
the mushroomland is safe,

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.600
the Mushroomland will always be there"

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.920
- that's what they kept telling us

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.740
were we supposed to just not believe it?

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.980
There are these days when you think about just ending all this,

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.080
that you can't take it anymore.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.020
It did cross my mind, yes.
