00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.400
Hi everyone! It's Alejandra, and I hope you guys are having a 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.940
great start to 2012. I’m going to do a quick video today on 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.040
how to organize your shower, or some quick tips on minimizing 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.380
the clutter inside your shower. Ok, so this is my shower. 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.710
It’s just a normal standing shower. It’s not even a bathtub. 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.720
It’s just a shower. And, normally what you see in showers is, 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.450
people get these shower caddies, just like that one, and they 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.960
hang it from underneath the faucet, kind of like that, and 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.460
they put all their shampoos and conditions at the very top, 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.500
and the shaving cream down there, and the soap right there, 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.530
and even though it’s better to do that, like, it’s better to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.840
put stuff inside the shower caddy than having it sitting on 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.170
the ledge there, or the ledge there, or even down on the ground. 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.380
I think this is a great way to maximize your vertical space. 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.920
So what really bugs me here is when you have really tall bottles 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.420
that interfere with the faucet up here and, when the water 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.860
is coming down, and you grab this and bring it down, the water splashes, 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.960
and then it splashes again when you put it back up, and when you 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.830
take something down. The weight is not evenly distributed. 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.100
This is going to swing back and forth, just like that, and it 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.040
makes it super annoying. So, although this maximizes space, 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.540
I’m not really a fan of this setup. So, what I’ve done to avoid 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.080
having frustration in the shower is I’ve gotten a shower caddy 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.020
and a hook, and I’ve put it on the opposite end of the shower. 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.520
So, I literally bought a really large hook at Home Depot, 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.960
and I bouight a regular shower caddy. I think this is from 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.990
The Container Store. I mounted the hook to the wall with two 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.070
anchors and two screws and then I just hung the shower caddy 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.840
from the bottom hook down there. And now I don’t need to worry 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.440
about the height of these bottles interfering with the faucet 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.180
and it’s out of the way from the water so there’s not going 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.010
to be any extra splashing. And, also, what I’ve done here is, 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.250
I’ve placed two suction cups that have little hooks down here. 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.790
Can you see that hook? Can you see all the soap scum also? 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.490
Okay, so they have these little hooks there, and there’s one 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.490
on that side and there’s one on this side. Here, let me go 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.930
like that. See how it kind of like connects? It holds this in place. 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.370
So, because I added those suction cups, when I remove a heavy bottle, 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.470
the shower caddy is not going to swing side to side. 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.180
The weight is all… the suction cups are holding the shower 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.710
caddy in place, so this is not going to swing. I don’t know 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.080
if that was a good explanation or not, but you can just tell 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.150
that this is not going to swing because of the two suction 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.960
cups I added. Now, suction cups: some work really well; 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.690
some tend to fall down. I’ve had these in place for two to 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.430
two and a half years and they’ve never fallen down. They are from 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.570
The Container Store. The Container Store has a really great 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.070
brand of suction cups. I’ll have to post a link. I really like 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.780
this setup. It’s out of the way. Everything is contained. 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.510
There is nothing on the ledge, there’s nothing on this ledge. 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.280
I don’t have anything right here. This shower caddy is not 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.550
normally here. I just brought this in from the other bathroom 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.590
to show you guys usually what people have and what you can do 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.930
instead to save on your frustration levels. Okay, so that’s 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.030
really the big tip of the video, but something else 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.170
I have here – this is holding the shower curtain back. 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.010
You guys have seen this in my house tour video, but I’ll 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.910
just show you again in case you guys haven’t seen it. 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:40.450
Okay, I have the shower curtain here, and behind it I have a 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.390
shower liner that has pockets inside. Do you see that? 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.660
There’s like six pockets. But, right now the pockets are empty, 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.230
but what I usually keep are bars of soap, or I have a mini 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.770
brush in here. It’s also great for kids’ toys if you’re a mom or 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.040
anything that’s small that you don’t want to keep cluttering 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.940
up your shower. You can just put it inside this shower curtain. 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.340
And this is actually a shower curtain, but I just use it as a liner. 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.880
I’ll put a link to where you can get it at the bottom of the video. 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.020
I hope that was helpful. I will post links to some of the 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.820
products I just showed you below this video in the description 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.160
and if you like what you saw, you are welcome to do the same 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.160
thing inside your own shower. I will see you guys soon. Bye!
