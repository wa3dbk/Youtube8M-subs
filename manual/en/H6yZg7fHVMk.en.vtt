Sarah Burnell and Stephanie Rouse Interview\f1\par
\par

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.880
\pard\sa200\b0\f0 TS: And here we are, I\rquote
m here with Sarah Burnell and Stephanie Rouse

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.550
and they are both heading to the NCAA Division
III National Cross Country Championships after

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:18.450
a very successful NCAA Central Region Meet,
up in St. Olaf. Well first of all Sarah we\rquote

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.599
ll start with you. You finished 10\super th\nosupersub
, so you already knew after Saturday\rquote

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.869
s action that you had qualified. Tell me what
it means to qualify for the first time.\par

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.970
\par
SB: Well this was my season goal from the

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.730
very beginning, so I\rquote m so excited and
so happy that all my hard work has paid off.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.580
Just being able to experience nationals, I
was just so surprised and so happy.\par

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.550
\par
TS: Bring me through your race on Saturday.\par

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.510
\par
SB: Well the whole field went out pretty fast.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.830
We went through our first mile in 5:34, which
is much faster than what we\rquote ve been

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.850
going. The second mile was a little tough
just because we had to go out so fast. Then

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:09.780
the third mile I just mentally decided that
this was the time to kick it in and start

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.670
to focus. I just finished it strong.\par
\par

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.670
TS: Steph you\rquote ve qualified now two
years in a row for nationals. How much did

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.399
last year\rquote s experience of having made
it that far help this season for you, especially

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:23.639
at the regional meet?\par
\par

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:28.970
SR: I think it gave me a better idea of what
it would take to qualify for nationals. Obviously

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.799
the more you race the more confidence you
have, and the better you are. I think just

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.960
generally I was a little less nervous for
this race than maybe I was last year. I was

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.469
coming back from an injury. It was nice to
know I\rquote ve done it once I can probably

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.289
do it again.\par
\par

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.539
TS: Just like I asked Sarah, bring me through
your race on Saturday.\par

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.899
\par
SR: I knew the field was going to go out fast.

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.740
There was a corner within 300 yards that we
wanted to get out around. I didn\rquote t

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.490
feel like we got out that fast, but I came
through and thought, \ldblquote we made a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.090
mistake, we\rquote re going to feel this really
soon.\rdblquote For the entire field it hit

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.530
in the second mile, but it\rquote s not a
very spectator friendly course. You just have

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:27.020
to be tough mentally; there are a lot of hills
in Aspen, Colorado. That helped, it was my

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.790
favorite part. And we had talked a lot as
a team and strategically about the race so

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.180
I knew when it was time to pick it up, which
was really nice. \par

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.420
\par
TS: Unlike Sarah you didn\rquote t know until

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.140
Sunday to know that you had qualified, because
you had to wait for the at-large teams to

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.200
be announced. How tough of a 24 hour stretch
was that?\par

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.820
\par
SR: It was awful. It was awful, and the same

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:55.580
with last year where I thought I was probably
in. So I thought, \ldblquote I\rquote m excited,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.080
kind of.\rdblquote\par
\par

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.570
TS: Sarah you had also won the conference
championships, the individual title. How much

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.770
did that experience give you confidence for
this past Saturday\rquote s meet?\par

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.960
\par
SB: I think it just helped me prove to myself

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.350
that I was ready. As Evelyn told me before,
\ldblquote you belong up there with that group

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.220
of girls.\rdblquote It added some confidence
and made me think I belong here and I deserve

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.150
to be with this group of runners, yeah it
helped.\par

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.340
\par
TS: And now for the tough question, what are

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.380
your expectations or goals for the national
meet?\par

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:41.370
SB: We haven\rquote t really talked about
it very much yet. I guess I want to PR again.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.450
That would be my ideal thing. I\rquote m not
really looking at places but just time. I

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.450
know this course is pretty flat and pretty
fast so it would be great to get an all-time

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.450
PR.\par
\par

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.900
TS: How about you Steph?\par
\par

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.130
SR: I think I\rquote d like to do the same.
At last year\rquote s nationals, the start

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.890
is really overwhelming because there are so
many runners that have such close times. I\rquote

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.940
d like to be a little more strategic, go out
a little harder, and a PR would be nice. It\rquote

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.860
d be an improvement from my placing last year.
I\rquote m really excited that Sarah will

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.569
be on the line with me this year; it\rquote
ll make it less nerve-wracking. \par

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.540
\par
TS: Well again congratulations Sarah Burnell

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.040
and Stephanie Rouse, NCAA Division III National
Cross Country Qualifiers. Good luck.\par

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.080
\par
Both: Thank you.\f1\par
