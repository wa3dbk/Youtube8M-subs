Hi I'm Tony Newton for Expert Village and
we are going to talk about he usage of the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:16.760
wrist for dynamic control. Okay now if we
where playing let's say let me give you a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:55.440
good example.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.790
Okay you see what is going on is when I play
in order to get good dynamics you can use

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:13.700
your wrist as a pivot so let's say we would
just play a simple chord again. Now if I wanted

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:31.040
to play this chord soft I don't just do that
I can control from my wrist by see you can

00:01:31.040 --> 00:02:12.580
go from very soft to very load. On chords,
single notes,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.440
and all of that is wrist control and that
is what gives you the able to the ability

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.379
to express yourself by utilizes your wrist
now next we would talk about using our arm

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.920
together with the wrist but the arm is a pivot
point for everything that goes on.
