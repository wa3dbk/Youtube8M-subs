00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.919
K its and the hoe and here are a few
things that we've done too late prof.

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:05.410
nude for the iPhone 5s

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.190
as well as the lifeproof fre iPhone 5s case for the
iPhone 5s before doing this comparison

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.660
video

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.590
it's waterproof iPhone case there's a good chance
that it's snow iPhone 5 case proved

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.060
lifeproof fre the iPhone 5s

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.730
and it's in at the bottom of a swimming
pool this whole definitely isn't big

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.500
enough for the two tone flash

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.420
the lifeproof nuud iPhone 5s case hole is significantly larger
than the one for the free

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.960
try again so took two

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.840
I'm texting and I'm a clumsy oaf of up

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.340
the touch ID actually isn't a full
circle 30 usage

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.989
Real Reviews. Real Usage. Mobile Reviews - eh.ca

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.579
a .ca battle up the lifeproof iPhone case is

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.960
now I have to say that both these tough iPhone cases
they are very very good tough iPhone 5s cases but if we

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.010
had to pick one

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.789
it would have to be the lifeproof
nude iPhone case now the caveat is that the new

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.120
doesn't have a screen protector but they
do include is extreme protector that you

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.320
can install optionally

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.710
we did review that because well its new
food

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.290
now based on our reviews and their usage
we gave this case the lifeproof nuud waterproof case to score 4.2

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.930
is out of 5 from the lifeproof fre iPhone case  got a measly
four

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.590
if you talk between these two tough iPhone cases the
only two things that you need to ask is

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.170
do you really need to screen protector

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.860
thats built into the protective iPhone 5S case and can get
away with not taking pictures

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.830
your to talk flash now for this
comparison video we've kinda

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.710
made it easier for you if you will we've
got a table contents in the description

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.490
section below

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.100
which have time sense for the different
sections that we're going to be talking

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.810
about

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.890
which are designed protection as well as
functionality

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.610
got annotations on the screen to also
help you picked the section that you

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.189
wanna go

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.820
view so let's get started for the design
category we look at the waiting the ball

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.259
we look at the ISM insulation and we
look at the build quality in terms of

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.700
waiting balked at noon is a little
heavier and it's a little thicker but

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.799
you don't really notice that thickness
because your Casa use your iPhone

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.820
kind in the Middle to finish part n at
that point I think both tough iPhone cases are about

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.680
as thick

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.390
in terms of the ISM insulation you
exactly the same you

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.049
and do the lead import latch and then
you pull everything apart really easy

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.080
for build quality we have to give that
to the lifeproof nuud iPhone case

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.140
newt this feels like a very solid protective iPhone case

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.379
and mostly because well there's no
screen protectors everything needs to be

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.360
much tougher

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.790
nice wanna know more about these actual
cases do checker unboxing insulation as

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.640
well as our up-close videos which are
found at the end of this video as well

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.450
as the description section below

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.870
for the drug test for the late for lifeproof fre iPhone 5S case
we did some office furniture park or if

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.519
it's an

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.410
what the from survived the live person
with this laptop which provoke me and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.010
threw it up in the air and slapping it

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.800
terms a water protection late per free
spent some time at the bottom swimming

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.200
pool

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.030
and the lifeproof nuud iPhone 5s case well went
drinking we did a beer test

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.750
with like 15 to see if it was beer proof
and it wise

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.950
and I think that's probably more
realistic test given that's well we're

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.470
probably gonna go drinking with their
phones rather than

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.810
doing water sports that's my guess
anyways

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.840
now just as an observation and doesn't
happen to us we're doing our test is

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.599
that there is another seal

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.050
on the life perfume so there's two seals
which is basically crisis many

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.629
on the lifeproof re and so the chance of
something happening

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.099
I'm to the waterproofing afternoon is
much higher because if you get to bring

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.989
between your iPhone 5s case and they all ring I've
the lifeproof nuud iPhone case well it's not water

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.860
proof anymore so that's just something
to keep

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.680
in might always keep the O-rings on your
left for products claim

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.409
term the screen protection that goes to
the free because there isn't much

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.080
on the lifeproof nuud case now the protective iPhone case does
have in edge to it

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.459
and it probably comes off about a
quarter inch so does provide a bit a

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.040
clearance

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.769
if you were to put a face down it's not
a lot extra protection but it's better

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.010
than nothing which

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.900
is but still a perfect news is being
marketed all about having no screen

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.409
protector

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.909
nothing now we film oliver test so I do
encourage you if you like watching us

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.709
being sadistic to our phones in

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.129
Tenebrae come to watch them as we
they're actually really fun to make I

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.299
like making them feel them a slowing

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.989
things just moved to release the leak in
terms of functionality that goes

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.920
lifeproof nude hands down when trying to
access your iPhone inside these cases

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.450
well the biggest thing for us was the
whole for the two talk lester like proof

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.040
free is not big enough for you to talk
last to work properly other than that

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.459
getting to the ports between these two
cases exactly the same sound quality

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.290
coming from them

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.459
exactly the same in terms of screens
ability well

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.009
because the case that doesn't have any
screen protection that's not to say that

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:25.860
the screen is a billy on the freeze bad
this is actually probably one of the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.360
better cases for screen is ability
because a plastic screen protector

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.040
extends from the bombing the case to the
top in the case which allows you to

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.280
easily swayed

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.720
your notifications and your command
centers for the late prof. nude

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.169
this is a great improvements over the
original one as the edges were a little

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.320
too high for me too

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.650
is the access everything that's not the
case for the new nude this is pretty

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.500
awesome

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.090
in terms of screams your ability again
acosta the case it doesn't have any

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.290
screen protection

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.990
the glare is exactly the same as an
iPhone 5s

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.880
the glare of this life per free isn't
bad but you can kinda knows it's a

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.160
little wavy

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.210
because the entire screen protector
doesn't sit flush on the screen there is

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.220
also some rain going affect I know

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.960
I know a lot of viewers complain about
that is still exist for this case so

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.030
just be wary

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.220
so with all that being said to questions

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.400
d like to use your two tone flash and
you like to take your screen

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.690
can answer those questions he say yes to
both of them then you should pick the

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.690
lifeproof noon

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.100
I'm not trying to discount the life for
free it's still a very excellent case in

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.039
I guess last question that you need to
ask yourself is on a day-to-day basis

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.250
how often to go through this into my
back

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.710
brain if you take good care have your
phone this is a really good case because

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.759
like anne still

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.300
use the iPhone Touch screen on it too
but if you just really careless with

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.090
your device is really care

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.080
to go to like for free if you have these
cases I would love to hear your feedback

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.229
