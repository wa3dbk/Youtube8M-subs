00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Easter Special!

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.220
Hi guys!

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.620
Today we´ll start with our Easter Special episodes!

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.490
And I´m very excited!

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.520
To start, I´ll teach you how to create your own Play Doh Egg!

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.800
I have two of them ready to show you

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.100
This one was made by my mom

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.100
Look how nice it is

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.820
And this very cute Olaf Egg was made by my daddy

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:26.309
I don´t know what they have inside

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.140
And I can´t wait to open them, but I´ll do it in another video together with you

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.520
"subscribe :)"

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.160
For those who don´t know what is a Play Doh Egg

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.620
It´s an Easter Egg that has many surprises inside

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.320
To tell the truth, it´s not only for easter, you can do it for other ocasions too

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.580
You put several surprises inside it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.200
Than you cover the egg with Play Doh

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.960
And you can make a very beautiful decoration

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.640
And give it to someone as a gift

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.060
I loved the idea!

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.460
There are some people that create huge Play Doh Eggs

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.600
I´ll teach you how to do it

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.480
As you can see, I have all the things that I need right here

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.540
This egg I´ll do it for my little cousin

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.536
But do not tell her, It´s a secret!

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.080
I don´t want to spoil the surprise!

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.480
I´ll put everything very organized inside

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.880
...there are these little wristbands...

00:01:28.253 --> 00:01:29.793
...so cute...

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.500
...there is this little crab that grows big in water...

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.340
...a lipstick...guys, she really loves lipsticks!

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.880
I´ll put it here

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.080
...some nice little erasers....

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.860
...one kinder surprise...

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.900
these one´s they have little surprises inside them

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.780
...and one Olaf´s lollipop.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.320
....ah.there are also these hair clips.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.960
I´ll put this in the other half of the egg....

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.140
Is everything going to fit? Let´s see.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.660
first the Olaf....

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.180
and in the other half

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.800
Let´s see...

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.840
I succeeded to close it with everything inside

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.180
I used some addesive tapes in the sides for it no to open accidentaly

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.480
These little eggs you can find in shops that sell packages or supplies for handcraft

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.040
But this one came with this Elsa stamp

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.160
But you can also use the ones that come in the Kinder Surprise

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.260
Or the bigger one that comes with the Kinder Surprise Easter Egg

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.160
You can decorate it the way you want

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.240
But the one that I´m doing now will be an Easter theme

00:03:37.713 --> 00:03:39.713
...really exciting...

00:03:39.973 --> 00:03:42.453
Initially I´ll prepare the play dough

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.120
...these little play dough tubes...

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.480
I´ll use this roll to flatten then, in order to cover the egg

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.680
I´ve already covered the whole egg

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.740
Here we have the blue sky

00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:41.933
and below we have the green grass

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.400
I liked it so much

00:04:44.423 --> 00:04:46.423
Now I´ll decorate it

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.600
I´ll use these little shapes

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.140
These are two-in-one. There is the butterfly and also the little flower

00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:07.411
I love these little shapes

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.580
So guys, this is how we did Lulu´s Play Doh egg

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.493
Really cool, isn´t it?

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.620
The little rabits and their footprints

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:16.373
I hope that you liked it

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.020
Many kisses for you!

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.280
And a happy Easter!
