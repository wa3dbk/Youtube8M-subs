00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.470
Today we will be working on a 2004 Lexus GX470.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:14.250
We will be installing Hidden Hitch part number
70779, also comparable to Draw-Tite part number

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.990
75155.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.960
These measurements will be helpful when ing
a drawbar, a bike rack or a cargo carrier.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.320
From the top of the receiver tub to the ground
is about 16-3/4 inches.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.870
And it is about 1 inch from most external
points of the bumper.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.520
Now let us go ahead and do our installation.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.370
0:35
There are three attachment points on the passenger

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.530
side.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.829
These are pre-manufactured drill holes.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.989
As part of a pre-installation what we are
going to do is lubricate those well and clean

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.070
the threads out thoroughly before we try and
do any installation.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:01.910
We are going to use a nylon tub brush, part
number 814092, and some lubricant to try and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.460
clean these threads out.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.940
It is always a good idea to take your new
bolt and test it to make sure you have your

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.510
threads thoroughly cleaned out.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:27.960
Now that we have our passenger side frame
rail prepped, we are going to move over to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.560
the driver side.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:02:00.650
Here we are going to 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.560
need to remove the tow hook.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:03:15.180
We are going to move over to disconnect our
electrical.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:04:01.430
This 
is a 7-way plug installed by the manufacturer.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:22.780
We are going to remove 
it 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:34.350
and 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:51.270
its bracket.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:05:08.080
