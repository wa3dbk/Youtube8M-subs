00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.930
Implying depth is one of the easy ways to
increase visual drama in a comic panel — or

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.219
painting, or storyboard, or whatever. Now
when I say depth, don’t just think linear

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.789
perspective, because relying on linear perspective
to create space is silly, because it’s both

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:22.789
easier and more effective to use simpler tools:
size, overlapping, and contrast.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.370
Linear perspective is also only available
in urban settings or around rectilinear objects.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.079
When we want to draw scenes in the open ocean,
for instance, we have no references to create

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.620
vanishing points, and if we want to populate
that scene with cartilaginous carnivores,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.530
their curvaceous bodies create confusing linear
perspectives — but that doesn’t mean we

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.370
don’t still need to have visual drama.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.070
Okay first, what do I mean by visual drama?
A picture can be exciting just based on content,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.989
like how when I draw a shipwrecked sloth here,
now there is dramatic tension between these

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.680
characters, ie. we fear for the safety of
the representation of a sloth because we assume

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.730
that this representation of a shark is filled
with teeth that are controlled by a desire

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.500
to rend and tear. We infer all this although
the picture itself is admittedly rather banal,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.670
which is pretty cool from a psychological
standpoint, but it’s not the only way to

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.590
create drama.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.490
I can also make a picture more or less dramatic
by manipulating strictly formal, or abstract,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.959
elements. Take this picture of Thomas and
James, who are, as you can see, nothing more

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:25.100
than rectangles without any anthropomorphizable
emotions or personalities. Without employing

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.179
any fancy linear perspective, as these are flat characters, I can imply that Thomas is close and James is far away

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.459
just by changing their size. See how this
arrangement has inherently more dramatic tension,

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.810
even before we introduce content.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.670
See how this drawing is becoming increasingly
more exciting now that I have implied a deep

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.709
field of view.

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:46.929
Depth is just one formal tool that influences
visual drama, of course. I am also a fan of

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.609
cropping, contrast and sequential rhythm,
which are topics that I’ll be addressing

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:55.840
in future videos, not to mention the wide
world of motion and soundtracks if you’re

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.789
working in games or film.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.439
Now, being able to draw with low visual drama
is just as important as amping it up. For

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.609
instance, comic panels meant to communicate
calmness should, obviously, have lower visual

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:11.940
drama. In my situation with long-form comics
or film, where I have an overall story arc

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.470
to worry about, the majority of the story
needs to have reduced visual drama, or else

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.270
the climaxes won’t feel dramatic.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.850
But is it possible to intentionally decrease
visual drama in spite of dramatic content?

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.980
Well, take this awesome picture of Tyrannosaurs
in F-14s. Just by removing the implication

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.250
of depth, now I draw a panel of Tyrannosaurs
in F-14s that is totally bereft of awesome,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.560
without even removing that supposedly dramatic
diagonal composition that you learned about

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.530
in art history if you didn’t sleep through
the Baroque lecture.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.610
Okay, but when creating depth, size doesn’t
always win out, however. We can actually undercut

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.920
our size-ist assumptions using this clever
new technology called overlapping. For those

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.950
unfamiliar with Christopher and Claire, I
can eschew obfuscation by moving Christopher

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.440
in front, and now we are clear where Claire
is.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.370
Applying that concept to a real-life situation, like sloths in the water, we can see that this shark that

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.940
we thought was in the foreground is, in fact,
a megashark.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.140
But what if we don’t have the option of
overlapping? What if we think overlapping

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.900
is guileless and unsophisticated? Nothing
says class like atmosphere. To invoke science,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.700
when light passes through air or water or
whatnot, it gets fucked with, and if it is

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.290
traveling a long way, it gets fucked with
a lot. Distance will take away detail as well

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.010
as decrease the intensity of highlights and
shadows, so objects appear to have less contrast.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.450
Said another way, objects with less contrast
appear to be further away.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.200
If you’re working in color, you can take
atmospheric perspective one step further even.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.900
Distance also removes low frequency light.
Some artists say this makes distant things

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.620
‘more blue’, but I personally think that’s
misleading and prefer to think of it as distant

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.930
things being ‘less red’, because the way
atmosphere removes contrast also makes bright

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.010
blue objects less and less blue when they
move away because they are losing some of

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.040
that too. All this may sound like minutiae,
but our eyes are so trained to recognize this

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.120
difference that we actually respond very readily
to it. Hans Hofmann really liked to prove

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.140
this point with his theory of visual push-pull
on a flat canvas, and because I’m getting

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.730
bored of drawing sharks now, I’m going to
repaint this scene totally abstractly to show

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.690
how the implication of depth is maintained
just using the atmospheric perspective concepts

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.680
of color warmth and intensity.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.560
At this point I’d like to make a shout-out
to David Malky for teaching me how to draw

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:28.560
sharks, because I actually didn't know how to draw sharks before, and to JD Saxon for correcting my shark anatomy because Malky apparently gave me incomplete

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.529
information. I should probably also thank
Danielle Corsetto for not hating me for continuing to terrorize

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:35.960
sloths with sharks.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.909
Thank you for watching, this has been Daxplains, a how-to series where I, Dax, attempt to illustrate an illustration topic, whether

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:45.120
I know shit about it or not, in a
time shorter than my attention span. If

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.930
this free video was useful to you, I still need patreon patrons for my eisner-nominated graphic

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.270
novel, Failing Sky.
