00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.930
Let me hear your voice...

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.060
Let your hair flow in the wind…

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.460
Ah… Lesson of the night

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.530
Slowly, slowly

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.560
The gentle left hand

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.460
Is entwined with the right hand

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.960
Searching for

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.300
The destination of love

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.610
Now, pretend you can’t see the clock

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.160
Come with me, just the way you are now

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.300
Try putting your ear on my chest

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.930
Because we’re so close, my heartbeats are

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.330
Feeling, feeling, feeling

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.700
I want to drive you crazy with my poison kiss

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.300
Rocking hard, rocking hard

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.260
Melt in the poison kiss

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.230
More and more...and

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.300
Forever, poison kiss

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.100
Ah…　Following my heart

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.860
I’ll give you a poison kiss

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.800
Feel the love

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.800
Burn with love

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.660
Believe in love

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.630
Love is all! Quartet Night!

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.900
The pain left behind

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.800
On your upper lip

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.630
Rewrite over it with another kiss

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.430
Game is starting

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.300
This time

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.230
Tiptoe properly

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.900
There is no logic

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.130
In these feelings of love

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.530
It’s better when we use fewer words

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.100
Let’s find out what is in the other person’s heart

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.200
A love song of soft, heated breaths…your watery eyes

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.800
Now, let me listen to your song

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.160
Ready? Ready? Ready?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.500
Just like this, poison kiss

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.230
Wanna be U, Wanna be U

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Wet your lips with the poison kiss

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.130
Ride on, Ride on

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.960
More of the poison kiss

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.900
Ah…　On your trembling skin

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.630
I won’t stop, poison kiss

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.760
Feel the love

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.700
Burn with love

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.400
Believe in love

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.560
Love is all! Quartet Night!

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.700
It’s better when it’s rough, give in to your instincts, all right

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.530
Do what I’ve taught you, come on

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.500
A dance at midnight, show me your everything

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.300
Sing into my ears

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.660
A-ga-in

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.960
I want to drive you crazy with my poison kiss

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.630
Rocking hard, Rocking hard

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.800
Melt in the poison kiss

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.530
More and more...and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.760
Forever, poison kiss

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.500
Ah…　Go down on your knees

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.230
I’ll give you a poison kiss

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.350
Feel the love

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.200
Burn with love

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.030
Believe in love

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.960
Love is all! Quartet Night!

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.300
