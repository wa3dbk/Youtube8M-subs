00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.717
Let's see if we can
figure out 3 times 60.

00:00:04.717 --> 00:00:07.050
Well, there's a couple of
ways you could think about it.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.870
You could literally view
this as 60 three times.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.495
So you could view this
as 60 plus 60 plus 60.

00:00:14.495 --> 00:00:16.620
And you might be able to
compute this in your head.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.620
60 plus 60 is 120,
plus another 60 is 180.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.770
And you'd be done.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.060
But another way to think
about this is that 3 times 60

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.770
is the same thing as 3
times-- instead of thinking

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.420
of it as 60, you could
think of 60 as 6 times 10.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.980
3 times 6 times 10.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.240
Now, when you're multiplying
three numbers like this,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.710
it doesn't matter what
order you multiply them in.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.910
So we could multiply
the 3 times 6 first

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.470
and get 18 and then
multiply that times 10.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.720
And 18 times 10 is
just going to be 180.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.140
It's going to be 18
with another zero.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.110
So this is going to be 180.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.810
Now, the more practice you
get here, you'll realize,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.379
hey, I could have just
said 3 times 6 is 18,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.366
but I have to worry about
this 0 right over here.

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.240
So I'm going to put one
more zero at the end.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.710
It's going to be 180.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.740
Same answer that we
got right over there.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.590
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.286
So let's say we want
to multiply 50 times 7.

00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:25.660
And I encourage you to pause
the video and think about it

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.480
yourself, and then unpause
it and see what I do.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.020
So 50, well, there's a couple of
ways you could think about it.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.920
One, you could literally
try to add 50 seven times.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.280
Adding 7 fifty times
would take forever,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.510
but you could literally say 50
plus 50 plus 50 plus 50-- let's

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.370
see, that's four--
plus 50 plus 50.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.475
Let's see, that is six.

00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:48.850
I'll do one more
right over here.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.090
50 right over here.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.130
So this is 50 seven times.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.760
If you add together 50 plus
50 is 100, 150, 200, 250, 300,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.710
350.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.010
So you could do it that way.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.900
But you could imagine that
there is an easier way to do it.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.770
You just need to
realize that 50 is

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.100
the same thing as 10 times 5.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.470
So we could write
this as 10 times 5,

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.340
and then we're
multiplying that times 7.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.210
Once again, the order that
we multiply does not matter.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.760
So we can multiply the
5 times the 7 first.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.840
We know that that
is 35, and we're

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.970
going to multiply that times 10.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.950
10 times 35, well,
we're just going

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.140
to stick a zero at
the end of the 35.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.330
It's going to be equal to 350.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.050
Now I want to do that
zero in that same color.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.500
It's going to be 350.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.420
Now, you might
realize, hey, look,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.030
I could have just looked
at this 5 right over here,

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.070
multiplied the 5 times the
7, and have gotten the 35.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.616
And then, not forgetting
that it's actually not a 5,

00:02:53.616 --> 00:02:54.115
it's a 50.

00:02:54.115 --> 00:02:56.500
So I have to
multiply by 10 again,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.530
or I have to throw
that 0 at the end of it

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.580
to get that 0 right over here.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.610
So 50 times 7 is 350.
