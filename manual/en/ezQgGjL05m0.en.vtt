about our enter

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.129
last thursday

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.139
a racial bias complaint was filed

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.330
against the eight local high schools

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.740
and

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.439
you can actually it's interesting

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:24.370
uh...

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.480
chris hayes in his book

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.570
the and america chrissy

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.410
twilight of the elites

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.160
he talks about his experience as going i
think it was to uh... stuyvesant

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.990
and started seeing high school

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.170
is a public school in new york city

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.540
but you have to test into it

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.520
and i don't know what the numbers are

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.300
one out of

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.790
thousands

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.060
said ten thousand get and what is it i
don't know the numbers either but its

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.360
verdict is the heart and i remember it's
incredibly hard to get wasn't that long

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.660
ago when i had friends who try to get
into that school it's it's

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.800
it's extremely hard you have to be

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.460
very vary

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.180
intel

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.780
and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.760
back when he went to you well you wrote
about this i believe very eager to talk

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.620
about is written about it

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.719
begin fine excerpt online actually read
talks about this

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.210
when he went

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.750
the school was much more diverse than it
is today

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.930
you take the standardized test and

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.110
if you did well enough on it you get it

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.459
was impossible for anybody to get in

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.050
unless they did well on this test

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.600
he says today however the school as a
lot less diverse

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.680
and the reason is

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.500
because of test prep

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.229
wealthy people

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.160
can afford it

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.140
private tutors to test you

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.880
to to you for this test

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.370
um...

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.840
upper middle class people can get you
into a non private tutoring session

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.340
we go to a class to learn how to take
the test

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.379
this is rapid in new york

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.689
very uh... poor kids they can afford to
do this

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:19.529
uh... kids whose parents are just not
tuned in they may not be aware of it

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.489
uh... and sell

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.819
it is creating heyyy

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.849
serta these tests are biased against
these kids

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.839
these are very specific tutors to for
for the stats remember correctly korea

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:35.769
they have previous versions of this
testimonial already going with the you

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.459
recall your head start in people who
don't had

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.459
didn't happen only absolutely

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.429
miler to did the gifted talented test

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:49.129
and we had to turn

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.590
comment when she was young

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.290
uh...

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.019
to basically an end

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.209
you know there's only so much of the
keys but you can teach them to feel

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.139
comfortable taking a test

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.239
a standardized test

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.300
which are

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.989
rather easy to get confused on

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.279
and

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:10.649
unconvinced

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:12.599
you know she did well on it

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.359
hud convinced if she hadn't had a tutor
she would not have

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.329
she would've been able to get into the
the gifted counter programming in korea

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.609
'cause he did she just

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:20.649
made it by

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:22.519
the skin a pretty

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.949
uh...

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.949
but i'm convinced that had she not have
that to drink she would not have been

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.889
eligible for that program

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.969
we're already into of very good public
schools so we were just

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.699
we were happy with that

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.559
this makes a huge difference is no doubt
about it

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:45.419
and so how does that bloomberg racked

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.939
the n_ double a_c_p_ legal defense fund
filed the complaint against the city

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.689
saying the admissions test is for a
specialized high schools in the air

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.669
is biased against black and latino
students

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.219
citing u_s_ education statistics showing
that among the nine hundred sixty seven

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.309
students offer spot

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:04.419
at these uh... active status in high
school

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:09.289
on the ninety one black and thirty two
were latino

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:12.459
according to the new york times seven
percent of public school students in the

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.569
city are black or latino

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.590
and double a_c_p_ attorney damon hewitt
told the newspaper i refuse to believe

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.440
there are only nineteen billion america
african-americans in the city it's

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.849
simply cannot be the case

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.349
it's a shameful practice in a must be
changed

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.249
bloomberg defended the admissions
process

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:39.059
saying was not subjective designed to
the best and brightest

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:44.929
i don't care what some people say
bloomberg told w n_b_c_t_v_

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:48.530
isn't always fair

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.850
i don't know how you would take away the
right

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.850
to get tutoring or how the public could
pay for tutoring

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.859
life's not fair

00:05:00.859 --> 00:05:03.580
rich people are gonna get the better

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.430
public education

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.819
people could afford to pay for tutoring
are getting at the better public

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.269
education

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.819
is not

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.839
susan enhancing someone's education

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:19.830
this is getting them admitted to a
school which is going to fundamentally

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.379
change the rest of their life

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.650
on date

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:31.300
not because necessarily the school is
that much better

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.259
but because they are now have that
imprimatur or

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.770
which will get them into any college
they want to get into

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.330
and a story

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.690
life's not fair

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.150
well how about this

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.149
how about getting rid of the school

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:54.919
life's not fair about cameras cool

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.459
business what are you know when it was a
loop here's the argument

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:00.509
counter-argument to that why would you
punish these very well i'll be very

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.179
smart kids

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:03.330
life's not fair

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:10.330
but this is based upon their own merit

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.259
i mean

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:21.289
life's not fair for these kids because
they can afford the tutor

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.389
but if it's not fair for other people

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.150
well it's a different story

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.229
business coming from the same guy who
likes his last year said something like

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.549
it's not fair that i keep my while she
is making getting to work more difficult

00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:38.680
for these people working on wall street
