00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.400
&gt;&gt; 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.770
I decided to come to Bournemouth to study
mainly because of the ranking of the university

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:39.449
because it’s ranked pretty high in The Guardian.
I also liked the location of Bournemouth as

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:57.220
it is situated in the South. I come from Bulgaria
and I chose to come to England because the

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.830
British education is famous and it also gives
me international experience because I’m

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:13.159
meeting lots of international people here
and also British and it improves my language.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.320
&gt;&gt; I decided to come to Bournemouth because
they had a great programme and I just thought

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.370
that it’s very focused for the three years
that I’d be here and I’d get like the

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.560
balance of the practical and the lectures.
I just like the facilities, the labs. It’s

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.200
great to get that international experience
somewhere else away from home.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:41.250
&gt;&gt; 
The first time I came to The Media School

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.870
it was amazing I just couldn’t believe it
I was really happy when I came into the building.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.130
The facilities here are really great. We have
different types of studios, this is one of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.740
them the HD studio, we also have the Green
Screen studio.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:05.020
&gt;&gt; The library at Talbot Campus is amazing
it’s got loads of books but also you’ve

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.509
got all the online journals and resources
available to you. There is a dedicated postgraduate

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.920
study area which is great too, you can really
get your work done and they’ve got huge

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.250
techno booths which are basically a giant
screen so you can sit and do group work on

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.989
a big screen. There’s also the Language
Centre where you can study a foreign language

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.129
at BU as part of your tuition.
&gt;&gt; Ever since I arrive at the university with

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.299
all my classmates and everything I’ve felt
so welcome and it’s always hard to take

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:41.769
the decision of going abroad but if you have
the support of the university, like giving

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:49.430
you the information about the place, the facilities
you get really involved in the culture, the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.150
sports, the different events. It’s really
good and you feel more welcome and integrated

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:04.011
with the other students.
&gt;&gt; I participate in a club, it’s International

00:03:04.011 --> 00:03:09.989
Students Association. It is organised by students,
for students.

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.540
&gt;&gt; The range of events we organise goes from
club nights, it’s mostly club nights, but

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.549
also dinners or maybe movie screenings or
simply coffee and a chat honestly. In the

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.829
building behind me we have the medical centre
and every student here is entitled to free

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.230
medical care so you register with a doctor
and can use it any time you need it and we

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.049
also have a multi-faith chaplaincy. The second
thing that we do is we actually try and provide

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.150
some support. For example if you are, I don’t
know, a Polish student and you want to find

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.879
a Polish shop because you need specific ingredients
we can help with that.

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.319
&gt;&gt; When I first came here they had loads of
different programmes that you could get to

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.780
know people but I found the best way was just
living in the dorms, you could just meet loads

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.719
of people from the beginning. There’s several
different types of accommodation that they

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:02.319
offer and you can look online and see what
they’re like and once you choose your accommodation

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:09.769
then they guarantee you you’re first choice
or second choice to make sure you get accommodation

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.639
when you arrive.
&gt;&gt; My accommodation for example is ten minutes

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.379
away from the university and the university
bus travels every fifteen minutes.

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:25.740
&gt;&gt; I’m living here on campus in the student
village. You have all the facilities of the

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.310
university really close if you want to go
to the library, to the gym you can just walk

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.620
and that’s it.
&gt;&gt; The dorms are based in town which is great

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.320
because it’s easy to find a part time job
there, it’s fun to live by the beach, there’s

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.150
loads of places to go out, the university’s
club is right down by Cranborne.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:50.090
&gt;&gt; If you want to travel everything is really
close. London, for example is two hours by

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.730
train and if you want to go to the Jurassic
Coast it’s also one hour driving and it’s

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:02.289
a lovely place to visit.
&gt;&gt; If you think about coming here to do your

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.740
studies, absolutely don’t be afraid and
go for it.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.280
&gt;&gt; I always wanted to come here to England
to study film directing. The first time I

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.020
got to the Bournemouth University website
I was like ‘man this is the kind of university

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.879
I would like to be in’ then when I contacted
the admissions office they were like ‘hi

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:24.710
Christina how are you?’ and they were quite
friendly and I was like ‘that’s exactly

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.411
what I want, that’s the kind of treatment
that I want to get from my university’.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:32.770
&gt;&gt; I would definitely recommend Bournemouth
University and it’s been a great experience

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.789
for me to be here most of all because of the
education I received and the people I met.

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:43.860
&gt;&gt; It’s a really, really, really nice place.
There is a bunch of lovely people and you’re

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.970
bound to meet a lot of very interesting people
who will probably become your friends for

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:48.280
life.
