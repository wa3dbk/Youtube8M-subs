00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.560
Everywhere people say

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.400
I'm ordinary

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.400
like a concert that

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.840
has been heard a thousand times

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.720
If that's the case

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.120
I'd rather syncopate

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.760
to guarantee you harmonies

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.800
You're always on beat

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.800
with an impassive face

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.800
I can't deny it

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.800
It's clear you've got talent

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.320
But everything in my world is impromptu

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.760
and your formality has bored me

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.400
Ah, if you're gonna waste

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.240
your life following a pattern

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.680
note by note, without a change

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.520
I think I'll better leave

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.560
lost in a swirl of

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.400
jazz and passion

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.440
But if at last

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.800
you make your fingers

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.880
give with that piano 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.520
a proof that you're also

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.360
capable of love

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.800
Whispering it softly 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.800
Your serenade would be enough for me

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.360
It's been always the same

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.200
When I close my eyes

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.400
You're the only thing

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.640
I seem to care about lately

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.120
Come on, I can't keep living like this anymore

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.560
All my friends have already said so

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.000
Ah, those are only words

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.600
your promises can't 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.760
by themselves quench my thirst 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.880
no, they won't

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.120
That's why I'll ruin 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.520
your facade of

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.200
stiff and unpolluted perfection

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.400
I'd like to know

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.840
if in your scores

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.480
it's written the rythm

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.120
of the beat that will 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.920
make you fall to my feet

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.160
Your icy kisses on my skin

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.680
are the perfect rhapsody for me

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.800
I've decided it

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.600
I want to this cruel love's

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.440
burning  rythm 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.280
turn you into an object

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.880
of my possession

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.400
from piano to fortissimo it's all right

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.160
Stronger each time I'll give you my love

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.640
Our voices

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.800
start to merge

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.160
their echoes melting

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.240
into the night and as 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.640
the hours pass by they grow louder

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.720
Darling, you won't regret this.
