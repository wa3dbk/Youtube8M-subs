00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.310
The Research Library has been part of
the American Museum of Natural History

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.439
since its founding in 1869.

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.089
In fact, the first books entered the
collection when the Museum was still

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.679
housed at the Central Park Armory prior
to 1877.

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:35.600
Natural Histories came about

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.970
because we wanted to let people outside
of the Museum know about the rich

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.570
rare book collection contained here.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.190
The Rare Book Collection is comprised of
over 14,000 volumes used by

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.200
researchers from all around the world. Many unique or unusual or hard to find

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.340
volumes

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.140
can only be found here.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.090
Natural Histories contains

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.839
40 essays written by one of the
Museum's curators, librarians,

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.840
or scientific associates

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.330
based on 40 works contained in the
Museum's rare book collection.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.670
And each essay

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.820
is accompanied by multiple illustrations
from that work. In figuring out which

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.340
works to include

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.580
we wanted examples that weren't

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.310
incredibly widely known. We wanted to
find some hidden gems within the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.139
collection. We also wanted to cover all of
the scientific disciplines

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:28.659
studied at the Museum.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.920
So, the works contained in this volume
begin in the 16th century

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.570
and continue up to the early 20th
century.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.510
In the days before photography and other
forms of documentation developed,

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.590
original art

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.340
was the only way to capture

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.230
the likeness

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.100
of organisms, people, or places

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.729
and therefore was the only way to
transmit or share this information. So

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.600
a natural history illustration

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.090
would enable someone

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.809
who'd never seen an elephant to try to
begin to understand what an elephant

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:03.460
looked like and

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.700
and how its unusual features might function.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.270
You might wonder why

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.280
modern scientists would need to look at
an old book.  What are they looking for?

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.060
In a lot of cases they're looking
for an early description or the first

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.260
description a specific species.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.099
In some cases the species described in
some of these volumes are extinct.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.599
So, the only way scientists can see these
species is to

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.989
take a look at one of these volumes and examine the illustrations.

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.769
In the earliest days of scientific
illustration many of the illustrators had

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.610
never even seen the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.560
object

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.180
of their work. It was described to them.
That could work...

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.850
but it also might not.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.349
This is one of the volumes

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.559
from Conrad Gessner's

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:49.609
Historia Anamalium from the 16th
century. You can see woodcut

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:50.770
illustrations

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.970
of some animals

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.450
that would have been hardly known

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.860
to readers in Europe

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.529
in the 16th century.

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:02.819
Here's a fairly good depiction of a
walrus, recognizable as a walrus because of

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.770
his large front teeth.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.630
But he also seems to have an additional
fin behind his forelegs. So, it's not

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.290
the best but it tells us something
about what animals were being discovered

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.699
at this time.

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:18.190
This is Hooke's Micrographia

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.289
from 1667. Micrographia consists of 60 essays by Hooke

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:27.509
 and many spectacular illustrations.

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:32.719
The illustrations depict comment objects and
animals, but seen through a microscopic

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:33.319
view.

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.410
This was the first time many people

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.139
had seen any of these

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.409
familiar

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:42.019
objects through a microscope. They were
able to see

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.059
such things as the head of a fly,

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:47.840
spores of mold on a piece of bread,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.119
even crystals in the author's own frozen
urine.

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:56.309
Imagine their horror upon seeing this
microscopic view of a louse clinging to a

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:58.819
single hair.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.859
Maria Sybilla Merian was the well
known

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.649
18th century artist

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:06.810
who took the unusual step at the time as
a woman

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.860
of traveling to Dutch Suriname

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.699
to collect

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:10.670
and illustrate

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.869
insects,

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:13.190
their life cycles,

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.760
and the plants they live on.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.590
The fanciful frontispiece depicts Merian

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.189
attended up by a troupe of cherubs

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:24.880
who are assisting her in her collection

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.240
of plants

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.229
and insect specimens.

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.939
As we start to digitize our collection,
versions that are available online are

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.350
excellent conveying the content but

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.910
one really has to view the volume in person
to appreciate

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.910
the illustration that went into creating these
fantastic works.
