Rise of the Guardians is a game in which Santa
Claus beats things up.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.750
Over and over and over.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.220
Being on the naughty list has never been so
dangerous.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.960
It’s Rise of the Guardians for the Nintendo
3DS.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:49.079
Now, this is obviously based on the animated
movie Rise of the Guardians.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.860
That’s a movie I have not seen, nor do I
plan to, but I’m assuming the basic idea

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.570
is that all the holiday heroes have to join
together to fight evil.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.570
You know, because Santa’s in such great
shape, what with the milk and cookies.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.750
Must’ve bought a thigh master...from Suzanne
Somers.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.770
So this game falls into that obvious category
of “kid-friendly beat ‘em up based on

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.000
popular movies.”

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.850
You play as five characters from the movie...North,
Tooth, Sandman, Bunnymund and Jack Frost.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.740
I have no idea what that means.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.000
You can switch between them at any point and
play as a holiday hero, which I guess is supposed

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.720
to make mashing B less tiresome.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.920
I honestly couldn’t believe how repetitive
this game is.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.009
Like, I kept thinking I was in some extended
tutorial or something.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.630
That seemed like the only explanation for
me having the same missions and enemies despite

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.299
being in different levels...and even THAT
doesn’t make sense.

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.290
Nonetheless, each of the game’s handful
of worlds is basically a little hub filled

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.360
with challenges.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.479
Walk over here, and you can defend the little
character from these black creatures.

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.660
Go over there, and you have to fight off a
horde of...the same little black creatures.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.630
In fact, no matter where I went, those things
followed me.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.350
So did the same two or three missions.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.620
Who knew missions could walk?

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:29.200
You earn points that you can use to upgrade
each character individually, but the changes

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.350
don’t even seem to matter.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.660
Of course, that could be because I was eventually
playing through this on a mental autopilot.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.370
I don’t even remember coming to this place,
let’s see if it was any different.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.440
Well, maybe the air is lighter.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.280
Until technology allows us to physically enter
the game world, we’ll never know.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.170
Only the movie’s biggest fans and naughty
list members looking for brownie points need

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.660
apply.
