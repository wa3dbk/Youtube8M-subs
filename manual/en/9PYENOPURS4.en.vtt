00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:09.950
The truth is not preached in churches because
the truth is hard, it hurts, it hurts our

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.590
flesh.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:22.030
It hurts our ego but if we listen to the truth
and we do it, we apply it, then it will set

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.090
us free.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:31.050
People love lies and that is why they go to
these popular churches, these Mega churches.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.300
Churches cannot afford to speak the truth
because their doors will close.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.510
People don't want the truth, they love lies.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.590
As Paul also predicted and wrote in 2 Timothy
4:3,4.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:56.829
“For the time will come when they will not
endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.590
their ears tickled, they will accumulate for
themselves teachers in accordance to their

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:12.180
own desires; 4and will turn away their ears
from the truth, and will turn aside to myths.”

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.690
SOUND DOCTRINE is, the WORDS OF JESUS because
those are the words of life.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.150
Churches will not preach the words of Jesus
(The words Jesus spoke as recorded in the

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.150
gospels Matthew, Mark, Luke and John).

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:33.170
They preach myths, they preach their own interpretation
of the words of Paul, their own thoughts and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.470
their own doctrines, which are doctrines of
demons.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.070
They are lies, because those lies will take
you to hell.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.830
The truth will set you free but people love
those lies and that is why they support and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.530
build these churches and why there are myriads
of preachers that are supported by people

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:03.460
who LOVE LIES and who love to pay for lies,
for entertainment, dancing girls and entertainment,

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.009
lovely music, but THEY ARE NOT HEARING THE
TRUTH.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.900
They are being accepted by the church but
they don't know God, they don't know Jesus.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.080
They don't know the truth.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.049
They are on their way to hell.

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.769
Paul also wrote in 2 Timothy 3:1-5.

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.099
“But realize this, that in the last days
difficult times will come.

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:37.579
2For men will be lovers of self, lovers of
money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:46.010
to parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3unloving,
irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:56.329
self-control, brutal, haters of good, 4treacherous,
reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:04.260
than lovers of God; 5HOLDING TO A FORM OF
GODLINESS, although they have denied its power;

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.469
and AVOID SUCH MEN AS THESE.”

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.290
He is talking about the MODERN DAY CHURCH.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.080
They are not believers, they are not followers
of Jesus Christ, they are FAKES.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.200
That is why Paul said: AVOID SUCH MEN AS THESE
because if you associate with them and go

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.719
with them you will go into the same place
where they are going, YOU WILL GO INTO THE

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:31.420
DEPTHS OF HELL.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.980
Paul writes:”AVOID SUCH MEN AS THESE.”

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.060
COME OUT FROM AMONGST THEM!

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:45.439
He writes in 2 Corinthians 6:14 “Do not
be bound together with unbelievers; for what

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:53.439
partnership have righteousness and lawlessness,
or what fellowship has light with darkness?”

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.260
These preachers say:”We are all sinners!”

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.379
They are unrepented sinners that are running
churches.

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:09.579
THEY ARE NOT FOLLOWERS OF JESUS CHRIST, THEY
ARE DECEIVERS, WORKERS OF SATAN, they are

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:10.579
unbelievers.

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.709
They don't believe the words of Jesus, neither
do they preach them, THEY PREACH LIES.

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:21.810
I read verse 15”Or what harmony has Christ
with Belial, or what has a believer in common

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.440
with an unbeliever?

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.140
16Or what agreement has the temple of God
with idols?

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.600
For we are the temple of the living God; just
as God said, “I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND WALK

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.250
AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY
SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.210
17“ Therefore, COME OUT FROM THEIR MIDST
AND BE SEPARATE,” says the Lord.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.170
“AND DO NOT TOUCH WHAT IS UNCLEAN; And I
will welcome you.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:56.090
18“ And I will be a father to you, And you
shall be sons and daughters to Me,” Says

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.620
the Lord Almighty.”

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:05.130
The followers of Jesus has never been many,
He calls then a SMALL FLOCK.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.010
NOT MANY WILL BE SAVED.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.190
Few will be saved.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:16.920
Only few are willing to accept the truth and
to live the truth, to follow Jesus Christ.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.390
Do not be deceived by all the churches that
you see and all the deceived souls that go

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.390
there.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.620
Don't be one of them.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.650
If you want eternal life you need to follow
Jesus, read His words in the gospels Matthew,

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.020
Mark, Luke and John and DO them.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.000
And COME OUT FROM AMONGST THESE DECEIVERS.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.460
Be separate, REPENT!

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.770
Cleanse yourself of all unholiness and seek
Jesus, and YOU will be a temple of the Holy

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.940
Spirit.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:59.110
You will not go to a filthy temple where they
have got temple whores and all types of unholiness,

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.370
entertainment for the flesh, but you yourself
will be a temple of the Holy Spirit in which

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.220
Christ dwells.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.730
SEPARATE YOURSELF, COME OUT FROM AMONGST THEM
and BE a child of God.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:24.630
Seek Jesus, follow Him, OBEY Him, KNOW HIM
FOR REAL and STAY WITH HIM, ENDURE UNTIL THE

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.300
VERY END.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:34.940
Many are called but FEW are chosen, very few
will go in through the NARROW DOOR.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.440
Will YOU be one of them?

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.380
May Jesus bless you.
