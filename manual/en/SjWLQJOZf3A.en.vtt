00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:25.080
It’s not like the game tells you what’s
going on, you know?

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.460
There’s no cinematic intro explaining why
you’re on this...motorcycle spaceship thing.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.659
All you know is that you’re going from meadows
to deserts to this freaking Circuit Board

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:42.239
Land, and unless you shoot the other flying...things...they’re
going to shoot you.

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.469
That’s all we know.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.239
That’s all we need to know.

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.629
And so imagine my surprise when I learned
that...no, the game does have a story.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.399
In fact, you’re playing as some hot young
coed.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.920
And that spaceship thing?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.570
It’s actually a hovercraft.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.079
A long, cylindrical hovercraft...with two
thrusters.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.000
I’m sure that its design has nothing to
do with the fact that, uh...she’s not wearing

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
pants.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.680
Hopefully, there’s a saddle.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.820
She should really be using protection.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:24.300
But the most surprising thing about Burning
Force isn’t the deftness with which your

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.070
coed rides her rocket.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.060
It’s the fact that...the whole freaking
thing is a lie.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.329
All the worlds and robots and lasers...it’s
all some kind of test she has to pass in order

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:35.329
to graduate.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.190
There’s no crazy future war here.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.090
And finding that out before you play?

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.369
It’s like an M. Night Shyamalan movie in
reverse.

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.679
So you’re only doing this to graduate...and
since it’s 1990, you can’t even see your

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:50.759
coed’s cleavage.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.159
Not a great start for Burning Force, but surprisingly,
the game does make up ground in other areas.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.149
The game is pretty much Space Harrier: The
Tribute Album, as its heavily inspired by

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.659
SEGA’s groundbreaking shooter.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.289
It’s also nowhere near as good, but it is
a decent game in its own right.

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.929
So her little test is six days long.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.909
That’s just another way of saying the game
has six worlds, each of which is divided into

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:14.909
three levels.

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.239
Some of them have you driving the hovercraft,
others pull a Redbull and give you wings.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.680
But across them all, the game is always on-rails.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:34.739
So you steer, shoot what you can and avoid
what you can’t.

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.900
The game plays well enough, and since it only
uses three buttons, the controls are pretty

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.060
simple, as well.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.099
But I couldn’t help but feel there’s just
not much here.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.680
There’s only a few different weapons to
collect, which makes the game feel limited,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.700
and the enemy placement can sometimes be a
bit erratic and messy.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.840
So it’s far from a great game, but as an
early Genesis release, I guess some of its

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.280
problems are kind of understandable.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.689
So if you’re really into Space Harrier or
even rail shooters in general, it’s at least

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:04.689
worth a try.

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:10.069
Thanks to our pal Benjamin from New York for
sending us Burning Force for the SEGA Genesis.
