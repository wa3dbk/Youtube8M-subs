00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:19.757
We're not going to make it!

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:24.301
Come on, just a little further!

00:00:28.357 --> 00:00:29.566
(slam)

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.521
NOooo

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:36.179
Aah... We have to get to the cheese!

00:00:37.146 --> 00:00:39.328
(splash)

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:43.276
What!?

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.649
Nooooo

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.641
No no no no WAIT!

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:05.451
Why are you smiling?!

00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:07.313
You're meant to be evil.

00:01:11.127 --> 00:01:12.690
Ugh

00:01:12.777 --> 00:01:14.761
Dan! ... Chrisi!

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:17.367
Jason? Where have you been?

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:19.211
We haven't seen you in ages.

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:21.690
Yea, we already replaced you.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.940
This is Jeff.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.292
Hi Jeff!

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:25.655
Say hi Jeff.

00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:30.069
Wow, he's so polite!

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.983
Anyway, I need one of you to be my evil guy.

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:33.993
I'll do it!

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.579
Woohoo! Come on! Let's go!

00:01:39.802 --> 00:01:41.064
You coming?

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.153
Really... Over there, on that toy boat.

00:01:44.153 --> 00:01:47.439
Yea... No. You go. You have fun...

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.464
All right, suit yourself!

00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:52.836
Pff. I don't need them.

00:01:53.027 --> 00:01:55.820
I can have my own fun with...

00:01:55.845 --> 00:01:56.915
Jeff

00:02:01.764 --> 00:02:14.187
(Gun noises)
(heavy music playing)

00:02:14.187 --> 00:02:17.615
Ugh. Come on! It's like
you're not even trying.

00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:21.519
(Splat)

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.165
Ugh... This sucks!

00:02:24.938 --> 00:02:28.434
Hey, that looks like fu... NO... NO...

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:29.668
I don't want to go over there!

00:02:29.747 --> 00:02:30.733
Why not?

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.629
Ah! Did you just talk?

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:37.315
Yes, I did. And you're actually
pretty bad at this game.

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:39.103
Oh my God, are you Morgan Freeman?

00:02:39.103 --> 00:02:39.983
No, but...

00:02:39.983 --> 00:02:41.353
Say you're Morgan Freeman!

00:02:41.353 --> 00:02:43.076
You're Morgan Freeman.

00:02:43.076 --> 00:02:44.091
I'm Morgan Freeman?

00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:45.005
No...

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:46.130
Oh....

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:47.633
You should probably
go over there and

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:49.649
spend some time
with your friends.

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:53.561
But I don't want to.
They're just imagining things. It's so boring.

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:58.607
I need something more visually stimulating,
like this XCUBE ONE WITH ADDED KINOCT.

00:02:58.607 --> 00:03:02.272
You do know the NSA spies on you with those.

00:03:02.272 --> 00:03:03.267
No, we don't.

00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:04.434
XCUBE off.

00:03:05.022 --> 00:03:09.006
The fact is using your imagination
isn't such a bad thing at all.

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:12.221
Why, you're using yours right now.

00:03:12.404 --> 00:03:13.273
I am?

00:03:13.983 --> 00:03:16.258
(orchestral music plays)

00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:17.201
AWAY!

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:19.226
(orchestral music plays)

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:23.365
Ugh

00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:29.563
Uh. Hey guys, do you mind if I join in?

00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:34.684
I DON'T KNOW, YOU SURE YOU CAN TAKE IT.

00:03:34.684 --> 00:03:38.152
I don't think there's much you
can do that can suprise me.

00:03:39.057 --> 00:03:40.110
Alright ...

00:03:44.532 --> 00:03:47.136
(Music changing -&gt; dramatic)

00:03:47.438 --> 00:03:49.270
Wah! Where are we?

00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:53.086
You're in my brain now!

00:03:55.684 --> 00:03:59.772
(Dubstep music plays)

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.816
Wah, what's going on?!

00:04:06.202 --> 00:04:09.712
THE BASS IS DROPPING
