[Opening jingle]

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.659
Hi and welcome to The Bread Kitchen.

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:15.750
Today, I'm going to make a slipper out of dough

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.009
or what the Italians call: Ciabatta.

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.429
The first thing I need to do is a starter or what's known as a biga

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.650
and for that I've got 240 g of strong white flour.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.260
A teaspoon of yeast added to half a cup of lukewarm water.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I'm gonna add the water into the flour a bit at a time and mix it in.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.290
Don't worry. I'm always throwing my whisks around! Makes me feel more...

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.810
...Italian!

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.080
What you're looking for is to add in enough water to make a firm dough.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.800
It's not at all sticky. It's quite firm.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.180
Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes until it's nice and elastic.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.790
Once it's nice and smooth and elastic,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.280
pop it into a lightly oiled bowl,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.960
cover it with some plastic film and leave it in a warm place overnight.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.040
Here's my biga. The reason it's called biga is because it gets bigga!

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.240
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.460
Here I've got 2 teaspoons of yeast which I've suspended in 250 ml of water.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.370
I'm gonna mix this altogether.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.310
You might need to whisk it to make it smooooooth.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.439
Once it is nice and smooth, add in 3 tablespoons of milk.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:03.439
Gradually, mix in 340 g of strong flour.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.120
Dee-dee-dee-dee... Oh, this is lovely and messy!

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.079
You can have great fun with the kids with this.

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:19.079
What you'll end up with is this incredibly... sticky, wet dough!

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:26.329
Add in a teaspoon of salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.179
and mix that in.

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:39.029
It's really sticky but make sure it's well mixed by pulling the bottom up to the top and pressing it in.

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:41.609
Right. I think I'm done here.

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.010
'Cause the hardest part is getting it off your hands.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.259
I'll transfer the dough to a nice, clean, oiled bowl.

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:59.319
I'll cover it and leave it in a nice, warm place until it's doubled in size.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.109
[gibberish]

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.629
Look! It's got a little knobbly bit on the side.

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:12.629
I just take off this plastic. ... [whispers]

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:17.029
OK. That's looking quite good. I'm gonna take that away

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.280
and replace it with a very well floured baking sheet

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.229
 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:28.589
and then I'm gonna pour about half the dough onto this sheet 'cause I'm gonna make two Ciabattas.

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:34.769
The reason I'm making two is obviously because you have to have slippers in pairs!

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.799
Quite tricky this bit, actually.

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.199
Cut it with a spoon or a knife or something.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.009
Alrighty.

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:47.139
I've covered my hands in flour.

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.079
I'm just gonna pour this into a longish shape

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.919
and press it out to about an inch thick.

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.409
I'm not gonna knock the dough back.

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.829
I want to keep whatever air is in there.

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.579
[rubs hands together]

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:11.579
OK. I'll do the same with the other half of the dough.

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.119
I'll sprinkle these with flour

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:22.180
and then just leave them in a warm place for about half an hour to rise.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.710
These are just lovely so now I'm gonna stick them in my fan oven

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.360
at 190 degrees Celsius for about 20 minutes.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.689
After about 20 minutes, your slippers should be this lovely and golden colour.

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:36.840
Now leave them to cool.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.610
This bread is absolutely delicious and has this wonderful open structure inside.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.750
I always think one of the nicest ways to eat Ciabattas is as Bruschetta

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.520
and underneath this video there's a link to my recipe for Bruschetta.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.930
I hope you enjoy making your Ciabatta.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.520
Thanks for watching and do join me next time in The Bread Kitchen.
