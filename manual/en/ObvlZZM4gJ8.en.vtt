Dad!

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.300
Walter? My Walter

00:00:26.477 --> 00:00:28.477
So glad to be back home again!

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.250
Look what I've just bought for myself!

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.000
My goodness, it looks great!

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.900
I knew you would love this watch too!

00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:43.761
Do you remember the days when we used to practice together?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.602
It's been a while since you last held your crossbow?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Ages!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And it's high time to do it again!

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:55.165
What do you mean?

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.870
How about a little contest?

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.699
I really like this watch ...

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.300
Forget it, I'm not going to give this watch away so easily.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.000
Come on! Are you scared of your old father?

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:11.005
Alright then, go and get your crossbow.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Not bad, Dad!

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.464
I told you. Now it's your turn!

00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:45.780
Here you go, you deserve it! At least it stays 
 in the family. Take good care of it, ok?

00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:54.390
Thank yo so much! But wait, I've got something for you too!

00:01:56.644 --> 00:01:58.640
Good luck for tomorrow!

00:01:59.584 --> 00:02:01.580
Thank you!!

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:08.760
