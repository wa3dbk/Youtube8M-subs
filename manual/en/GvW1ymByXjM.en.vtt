Hello. I'm Donna Beth Joy Shapiro on behalf
of Expert Village. Today, I'm going to show

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.110
you how to iron a pair of jeans. In this clip
I want to talk about the difference between

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.330
starch and sizing. There is a difference;
you cannot use starch on synthetic fabrics.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.369
So, like a shirt that is half poly, half cotton,
you can't use starch. You need to use sizing.

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.190
It does almost the same thing. You don't get
as stiff of an appearance from sizing, but

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:34.290
it definitely does give the garment some body.
And you could also use this on one hundred

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.982
percent cotton. Again, it isn't going to give
you the same effect, but you can use it. It

00:00:37.982 --> 00:00:45.040
isn't going to hurt one hundred percent cotton
fabric. Starch; different kinds of starch;

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.770
different ways of using starch. Some people
put starch in the washing machine...the kind

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.950
of starch here with me. You would put it in
the final cycle. Some people use corn starch

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.530
right from their kitchen. It's a lot of work
to do that. And if you put too much in, your

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.130
laundry can get gummy. So, what most people
do is they use the liquid starch. This is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.290
actually my favorite way of starching. There's
a recipe on the back of the bottle that tells

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.681
you the ratio of starch in the bottle to water.
So, if you wanted napkins (or whatever you

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:29.509
are using it for) to be really stiff or medium
or less, it does give you that formula. This

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.549
is another kind of starch in powder form.
It's pretty hard to find this. Most people

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:44.439
don't use this, though some people do swear
by it because it does last a really, really

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.290
long time. But you do have to be really careful
when you mix it up...it's kind of like making

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.490
gravy. Okay, so we have the spray starches.
This is what I use when I'm in a hurry. We've

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.330
got three brands. They all do the same thing.
These are all heavy starch. There also is

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.629
light starch. I never use it. I like garments
to have a really nice starched feel. If I'm

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.730
going to go to the trouble of starching something,
I want it to look starched. This, I think

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.370
is pretty cool. It's the same starch as this,
except this does not have an aerosol. This

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.269
has a spray bottle. One of the most frustrating
things about using starch is that the aerosol

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.379
cans can get clogged; the nozzles. And no
matter how hard you try, you can't unclog

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.959
that nozzle and you wind up tossing the can
in the trash can. So, that's a little frustrating.

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:37.959
Why do you use starch, other than to give
a garment a beautiful appearance? It actually

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:38.959
helps a garment or a napkin or tablecloth
or whatever repel dirt. I don't understand

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:39.959
the science, but it definitely does. And a
garment that maybe you want to wear more than

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:40.959
once because it costs you some money to take
it and have it sent to the dry cleaner, like

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:40.962
a tuxedo shirt.
