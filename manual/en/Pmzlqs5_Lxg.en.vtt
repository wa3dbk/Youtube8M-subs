00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.320
They say an eco-friendly house can’t be
built in a 150 days for $150,000 and I say

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.320
it can.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.981
I’m Allen Smith, join me as I push the limits
with time, budget and creativity with The

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:19.310
Garden Home Challenge, exclusively on eHow
Home.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:26.420
It is a very cold day and I’m glad that
part of that money went to the purchase of

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.720
this firebox, and everybody’s enjoying it.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.180
Tony is, all the guys working on the house
and certainly the crew and I are enjoying

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.180
it today.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.940
It’s really cold outside, but let’s take
a look at the kitchen because it’s coming

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.940
along.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.470
We’re working on some electrical and I just
wanted to point out over here, you know, before

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.670
we walk through to make sure we had receptacles
and switches in the right place.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.300
So, we’ve gotten some of those added, there
was not one here, so that’s in place.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.510
I really wanted to have 2 light fixtures from
the ceiling and I wanted them centered in

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.839
the room and I spread them out just a little
bit and the electrician did that.

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.510
He moved them out because I want to have a
pot rack to hang down here because I found

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.969
this fantastic butcher block to go in the
middle of a kitchen.

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.789
It’s about 42 inches in diameter.

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.229
And I just want to show you these really cool
lights that I found at Chuck’s.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.390
These are metal and what’s cool is they
hold 3 light bulbs and I think I might even

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.530
be able to–there’s a stem, it’ll come
down from the ceiling.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.200
And even though they’re bronze colored,
we might use the bronze, but I could paint

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.200
this.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.390
We’re using a barn roofing, metal roofing
here for the ceiling, so I may go white with

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.729
this, hadn’t worked that out, yet, but that’s
just an option.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.679
Here’s the deal, I got these for 15 bucks
a piece.

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.810
And so when you’re working on a house, I
find that if you can shop around a little

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.140
bit you can find some good deals and you can
go ahead and buy them if you’ve already

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.560
started thinking about where the placement
of the lights might need to go, sort of the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.909
scale of the room.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.409
Once you’re informed and you’ve got that
kind of information to work from, you can

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.569
make intelligent choices.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.340
And I think this is really great, I was really
happy to find these.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.390
You think about it, 30 bucks for two lights
for in here, it’s just perfect.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.730
So you see, if you wait until the last minute
to find your fixtures, or really furnishings,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.060
often you don’t get what you want and you’re
going to end up paying full price.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.770
So, it’s good to kind of shop around.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.090
The other thing that we’re doing in the
kitchen is we got the dimensions on the refrigerator

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.320
and it was apparent to me that I didn’t
really want to see the refrigerator door open.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.830
So, we just extended a little bit of wall
here, so Tony added a series of studs here

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.390
and just pulled the wall out about another
10 inches.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.360
You see, it hardly took the guys any time
to add this.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.680
This is the time when you really need to think
through all these little details because if

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.430
you think of them later, it gets really costly,
We got our mini split in up here.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.390
We got our plumbing roughed in.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.580
Now all we have to do with the kitchen is
really focus on how the cabinetry is going

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.580
to work.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.610
So, that’s going to be my next little project
for this space.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.920
