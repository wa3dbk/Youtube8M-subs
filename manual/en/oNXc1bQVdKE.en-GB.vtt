00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.330
Fire Security is a Norwegian company specializing
in repair and protection of electrical cables

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.559
from fire damage.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.480
We produce two coating systems. FS1, which
protects the cables from fire damage, and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.189
FS5 which repairs and protects cables that
have been damaged by UV,

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:33.300
ozone, oil, mud, chemicals, water, salt and
mechanical stress. This gives the cables a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.200
fire resistant property under an oil fire.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.670
We can repair cracks in the cables to prevent
water or oil ingress. The coating will restore

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.930
the cable value and add fire resistance.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.900
FS1 coating system has been tested on an 1100 degrees Celsius oil fire -- for more than 1 hour -

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.100
without any problem to the insulation
or the electrical properties.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.900
Normal cables such as flame retardant and
fire resistant cables cannot withstand such a fire

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.200
and vital cables are often routed through
high risk areas.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.900
As we can see in this test a short circuit
has occurred in the unprotected cable after

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.929
less than two minutes.

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:20.600
FS1 is an intumescent coating system that
will expand 100 times its thickness in high temperature -

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.770
approximately starting at 220 degrees Celsius -

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.100
or upon direct flame contact, ensuring that
the electrical wires are shielded against the fire.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.300
Our coating systems will guarantee that your cables

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.500
will function properly under such a
fire and be reusable afterwards.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.300
FS1 is a water based system that does not contain any toxic material.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.400
Doctor Engineer Rudi Krause, one of Europe's
leading experts in passive fire protection

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.800
of electrical cables,
wants to point out the following:

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.800
The IEC 331 standard cables are produced to manage only
750 and 830 degrees celsius. This is the temperature

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.750
of an I.S.O fire, which is a normal fire in
a room or in a building. The red curve shows

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.720
the temperature of an oil fire. This is the
temperature you will have to cope with if

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.720
you had such a fire. It is to these temperatures
Fire Security has tested their coatings.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.500
In our laboratory we examine new areas of
application and conduct tests to make sure

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.700
that the Fire Security coating system meets
the standards of the I.S.O 9000 series.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.300
We run a 10 year ageing test after the German
DIN standard and also conduct regular elasticity

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.330
tests of our products. Testing for possible
environmental disturbances is a high priority.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The ability of FS5 to repair damaged cables
is also tested at our laboratory.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.700
The environment on an oil installation is
very tough, and cables are exposed to a lot

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.690
of stress. By using FS products you can extend
the lifetime of your cables, as well as repair

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.200
existing damage before replacement is necessary.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.500
Existing cables can be upgraded to the highest
level of fire safety, with no interruption

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.200
of the operation.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.700
Fire Security offers an onsite inspection
and will focus on the following:

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.600
- Define high risk areas.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.200
- Evaluate cable routings in high risk areas.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.300
- Inspect the general condition of the cables
with regards to damage.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.400
Based on our inspection we will make a written report that will include suggestions as to

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.300
what we can do, what you will gain and a price quote.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.700
When our team performs a repair and fire protection, we clean the cables using special cleaning materials or water.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.400
If the outer sheath and the cable's screen is damaged,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.100
we clean the affected area, and rebuild the screen by use of a metal shielding tape.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.000
We then apply FS-5 coating.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.000
A fibre mesh is used to gain mechanical strength and as support for the coating.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.100
The repaired cable is tied in place and coated with the other cables on the tray. The excellent properties

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.000
of the FS-5 coating ensure that the insulation
property is completely rebuilt.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.300
A normal cable will degrade over time, depending on the environment.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.400
FS coated cables slow down this process dramatically.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.400
A typical example is what Fire Security have
done for the Senipah terminal in Indonesia

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.580
for the oil company Total.
The outer sheath of the cables was damaged,

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:02.500
mainly by UV, and had a lot of cracks which
led to short circuiting and sometimes loss of production.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.700
 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.400
Fire Security repaired all the cracks and
coated the cables without any stop in the production.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.200
We have extended the lifetime of the cables and at the same time

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.000
made the cables fire resistant.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.200
Advantages with the Fire Security coating system:

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.600
- Your cables can be upgraded to the highest
level of fire safety.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.700
- Already damaged cables can be repaired and the life expectancy can be extended.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.400
- It is a very cost effective system compared
to rerouting or replacing cables and

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.700
the application does not interrupt the operation.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.000
- Ageing tests show the long term benefits.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.900
Our coating systems have been approved by
leading international classification societies

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:55.900
and authorities such as:
DNV, NMD, ABS, US Coast Guard, FM Global, UL and Lloyds.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.900
Fire Security is the only cable-coating producer offering a turn-key operation, for application worldwide.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.100
 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.400
Our customers includes the world's largest
drilling, and oil companies, such as

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:20.400
