00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.629
This is a good example of how confusing terminology
causes a lot of problems in understanding

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:14.020
different aspects of psychiatric treatment.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.119
Why would you use an antipsychotic on somebody
who's not psychotic?

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.480
The answer to that question is that the effects
of medications that are used to treat psychotic

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.570
symptoms are not limited to just stopping
psychotic symptoms.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.510
In other words, when you take a medication
that's classified as an antipsychotic it can

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:41.620
have other effects that are positive and some
of those effects are antidepressant effects.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.160
So, in an individual who is not responding
to a primary antidepressant, sometimes it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.580
can make sense to add a so called antipsychotic
as a second or third medication to try to

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.220
get benefit for that person for their depression
symptoms; and it reflects a general trend

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.269
in psychiatry where medications that are referred
to as a certain class, when moved to a different

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.140
context, that classification causes confusion.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.380
What's more useful in general in understanding
why a certain medication is used for a certain

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.360
disorder is understanding what the effects
are of that particular medication, what the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.380
potential benefits are, and what the side
effects are; and then evaluating whether the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.440
side effects or the risks justify the benefits
or the effects.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.149
If each medication is approached this way,
it's easier to avoid the confusion that comes

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.479
from thinking about medications in general
classes.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:48.140
So the reason that antipsychotics are used
to treat depression is they're not just antipsychotic.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.929
This holds true for many classes of psychiatric
medications.

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.590
So, when working with your doctor, focus on
a particular medication, find out what it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.590
can do, find out what the side effects are,
and then you can make an informed decision

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.130
about whether it makes sense to take that
medication.
