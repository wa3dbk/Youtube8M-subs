00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.170
the innovation in Janome Sewing Machines does not happen by chance

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.480
it is painstakingly created

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.890
here at the world's first research center for sewing machines

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.539
everyday highly experienced
designers

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.400
assess the sewing needs for the entire
range if Janome Customers

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.599
from the brand new sewist to the highly
skilled

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.399
expert embroiderer working as a team

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:34.180
they look for ways to improve the
performance and durability and existing

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.340
Janome machine

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.379
and in some of their most important

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.170
they create new designs

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.539
for machine that will allow customers
more creative freedom then

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:53.010
ever before it's the responsibility of
the engineers at the Research Center

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.910
to test these new designs to assess

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.269
which materials will give the best
performance

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.949
using some of the most high precision
analysis technology

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.949
in the industrya lot goes into making janome quality the best in the industry

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.450
but nothing is possible without

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.660
our loyal team employees the commitment
of a skilled team

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.280
is what drives both quality and
innovation

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.380
strong employee loyalty and a
fierce

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.030
pride of craftsmanship transmission has led did
enviable retention rates

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.600
Janome has extremely low employee
turnover

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.470
which means our experience in sewing
machine production in general

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.250
and the Janome way in particular is

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.370
top tier. few companies

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.370
can bolster the workforce with so many
years devoted to a single product

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.130
once a finished prototype has been
thoroughly tested

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.220
Janome begins production at one if
its

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.410
3 factories the most advanced computerized

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.710
models are produced here at the Janome Tokyo factory

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.020
it's one of three state of the art Janome
factories

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.910
which have been producing machines over
30 years.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.080
continually retooled to stay on the
forefront of technology

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.819
these factories have been on the cutting
edge of sewing machine production for decades

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.730
state-of-the-art machine robots

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.850
guided by three-dimensional computer
models carve components added aluminum

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.540
and steel

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.360
Any outside vendor whose products are
used in production

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.920
is subjected to rigorous testing

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.319
only those who meet Janome's exacting
specifications and quality requirements are accepted

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.490
These outstanding vendors

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.770
then become a part of the Janome Product family

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.560
many been working with the company the
decades

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.790
the parts which require paint are taken
through that

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.430
process by high-precision robots so the
coating

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.630
is perfectly even

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.940
A single sewing machine requires thousand

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.180
of separate parts for assembly. These are stored in an automated warehouse

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.819
until the component is needed for assembly

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.580
each machine its carefully completed
by hand

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.920
the craftsmen and women with him for
them ensure

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.920
each part meets tolerance specifications

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.590
for a long life of trouble free sewing

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.709
finally every finished machine is carefully
inspected by a

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.750
quality control expert. This rigorous
process

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.340
allows Janome to cover each machine with an extensive warranty

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.310
because of this careful process no machine is rushed to market

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.590
before it can be thoroughly tested for quality.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.599
And to make sure each new feature

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:19.669
will be truly useful to the customers
in their sewing rooms

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.129
Janome makes every machine we sell. 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:29.409
Most of our  competitors can't not make this claim

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.460
Now Janome designers and engineers 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.759
are proud to introduce a machine they've been working on for years

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.400
A new machine

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.680
that has set a new standard for precision

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.569
advanced features and ease of use

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.180
it's with great pride that we
offer it

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.479
to customers worldwide
