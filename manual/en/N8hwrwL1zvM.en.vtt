(music intro)

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.490
Hi I'm Rodney Croes of One Step Papers, global
producer of unique papers and coatings for

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.960
the textile transfer industry.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.960
I'm here to demonstrate how to create a foil
effect using a remarkable break through in

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.740
laser transfer paper technology...One Step
No Weed.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.040
Creating a foil design is easy and can be
achieved on both light and dark fabrics.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.140
No Weed transfer paper does not leave a polymer
residue so foil adheres only to the image

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.530
on the fabric.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.600
For ease of application simply create your
image in the color black.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.410
Mirror the image.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.510
We recommend using the heavy paper or label
paper option.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.829
Next, place the transfer paper into your by-pass
tray.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.850
Now your graphic is ready to be printed onto
the transfer paper.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.590
Now your transfer is ready for application.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.430
Place your garment on the heat press and preheat
for 7 to 10 seconds to remove any wrinkles

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.770
and moisture.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.440
Allow the garment to cool.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.070
Position transfer on your garment.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.590
Using medium to heavy pressure heat apply
for 25 seconds at 330 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.960
Allow the transfer to cool for 10 seconds
before removing the transfer carrier.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.590
Remove paper carrier in a smooth continuous
motion.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.640
For foil application, place a piece of foil
over the desired area of the design.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.230
Placer cover sheet over foil and heat apply
for an additional 25 seconds at 330 degrees.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:56.390
(music)

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.920
Allow the garment to cool completely before
removing the foil.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:10.410
Remove foil in a continuous motion.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.630
Look at that....the foil adheres to only the
image and nothing else.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.120
Unique decorating techniques don't get much
easier then this.
