00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.700
Here are some routine questions I think that
are important for breast cancer patient to

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.970
ask her future oncologist.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.320
Since breast cancer treatment is tend to be
very comprehensive, I think it is important

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.920
to find oncologist you can truly trust who
is well trained, usually require fellowship

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.760
treating, and also they need to be board certified.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.129
I think another important issue to ask is
to see if this medical oncologist or any oncologist

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.240
who have a support team around him and they
need to take multidisciplinary approach by

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:59.350
which I mean a few oncology specialists who
work together, with the best plan for them

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:08.640
and also equally important for them to have
a dedicated care team to decrease the potential

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.170
side effects.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.700
The bottom line is that the team approach
is the best approach for breast cancer patients.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.890
Without a dedicated team of professional staffs,
it is almost impossible for any medical oncologist

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.710
to deliver the best quality of care.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:37.670

with you important information that I believe

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.940
