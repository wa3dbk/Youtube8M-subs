Hello again!

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.589
This is Matt from Kenhub, and in this tutorial,
we will discuss the function and anatomy of

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.600
the temporalis muscle.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.860
The temporal muscle, also known as the temporalis,
is a flat, fan-shaped muscle of mastication

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.330
on the lateral side of the skull.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.000
It arises from the temporal fossa, a large
depression on the side of the skull and the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.520
temporal fascia, which completely covers the
surface of muscle.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.530
From there, the muscle descends through the
gap between the zygomatic arch and the skull,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.140
forms a thick tendon, and inserts at the coronoid
process of the mandible.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.300
The temporalis is innervated by the deep temporal
nerves branching off from the mandibular nerve.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.440
You can see the mandibular nerve, highlighted
in green, on the image on your screen.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.440
Functionally, the muscle can be divided into
two parts.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.390
The anterior part runs almost vertically and
moves the mandible forward, which is known

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.110
as protrusion.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.880
In contrast, the fibers of the posterior part
course almost horizontally and pull the mandible

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.900
backwards, which is known as retrusion.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.650
The activation of the entire muscle moves
the mandible dorsocranially, leading to a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.140
strong jaw closure known as elevation.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.000
Due to its size, it can be palpated without
difficulty, especially when the mouth is opened

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.369
and closed.

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.920
The temporal is the most powerful muscle of
the temporomandibular joint.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.290
This video is more fun than reading a textbook,
right?

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.990

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.680
It is time to say goodbye to your old textbooks
and say hello to your new anatomy learning

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.550
partner, Kenhub!

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.550
See you there!
