00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:35.190
Deep and dark oceans have many secrets; most
who dare to explore them will never return,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.390
those who return become legends.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.320
Legends became myths.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.579
And after a thousand years, nobody is sure
of the truth.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.180
Nor did people care too much -- because sometimes
it's far smarter to leave some secrets unrevealed.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.789
And in this case, people have made the right
choice in deciding not to dwell; for what

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.049
would be discovered could bring an end to
the known and great civilizations, just like

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.910
that particular night, when the people of
Trembling Isle lost their friends and homes

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.159
in the single strike.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.260
Some say that the Roar of the Beast can still
be heard in the mist surrounding the Trembling

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.360
Isle; as a clear sign of what happens when
you challenge the powers of the deep ocean.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.700
The Tidehunter known as Leviathan was once
the champion of the Sunken Isles, but his

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.060
motives are as mysterious as those of his
people.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.650
Some say that his people were once like us;
they were building great cities and discovering

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.870
the hidden energies and powers connecting
the material world.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.530
Over time, their lust for power became too
great; some say they even dared to challenge

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.840
their gods and are now their eternal servants,
disfigured and transformed into the water

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.890
creatures.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.910
Others say they are simply the ancient creatures
of the Deep Oceans, taking care of their civilization

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.140
with no desire to connect with the land folks.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.140
But we all agree that this Leviathan nation
is one of the most mysterious secret of the

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.710
world -- but a secret that should be hidden
and untouched.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.130
We can only guess of their true origin and
tell the stories about these monsters that

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.129
could be seen or heard during the storms on
the open seas.

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.480
But if compared to the known nations, it is
clear that even the Sunken Isles have their

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.620
own civilizations and clans, fighting, rising
and crumbling separated from us; much like

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.272
the world within the world.

00:02:24.272 --> 00:02:29.540
The warring tribes of the Meranthic Diaspora
have carved out habitations through endless

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.750
undersea skirmishes, having their own complex
policies and customs.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.319
It would seem that Tidehunter grew tired of
such petty strife, and set off on his own,

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.219
loyal only to his abyssal god, Maelrawn the
Tentacular.

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:52.249
But what's known to all of us is the endless
hate between the two figures -- the Tidehunter

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:54.709
and his nemesis, Admiral Kunkka.

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.109
The true reasons behind this hatred are sadly
unknown, but the tavern stories talk of a

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:04.120
war between the Kunkka's people and the Demons
from the underworld, a war that could be won

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.489
if the ancient God was not awaken to bring
an end to Kunkka's people.

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.769
Kunkka saw Tidehunter in the distance, right
before his ship got destroyed.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.569
He presumed that Tide was responsible for
summoning the terrific creature.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.719
Other people say that it was Kunkka's fault,
or more the fault of his people and their

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:24.930
lust for power that brought Demons to the
world and they claimed that Tide was here

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.749
only to protect his own people.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:32.139
Some stories focus on Tide's blind love to
his God who was merely awakened to feed on

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.719
souls of the land folks, while Tide would
watch and feed his sadistic needs.

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:42.059
In any case, the real reasons are forever
lost in the deep seas, but the hate is all

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:46.529
too real.

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:50.749
Separated from his people, this Leviathan
creature now cares only about himself and

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:55.219
his God, who gave him great powers as a reward
for his services.

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:00.620
If not searching for his nemesis, Tidehunter
can be seen in the shallow seas, laying traps

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.709
for unsuspecting ships and merchants.

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.049
These poor sailors don't stand a chance if
Tide decides to engage and can only pray for

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.180
the quick death.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.790
Endless ship wrecks and dead bodies on the
bottom of the sea provide a sick reminder

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.940
of the monster dwelling in the waters, waiting
for the only Hero who survived his attack.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.260
Maybe one day, the fight between them will
be resolved and hundreds of lives will be

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.260
saved.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.010
But as it seems for now, many will still fall
before the bones of Tidehunter or Kunkka rest

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:42.139
in peace on the bottom of 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:42.610
the sea.
