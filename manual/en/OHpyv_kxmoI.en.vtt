This is Ed with AtticFoil.com.
One of the common questions we get from customers

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.220
is they want to know if they install a radiant
barrier will it cause damage to their shingles

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.430
or roof's? Or cause them (the shingles/roof)
to age or curl prematurely. It makes sense

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.259
because all that heat that would normally
be going into the attic is now being reflected

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.189
upward. So we decided to put it to the test.
Probably the worst case scenario: we used

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.189
a HOT day in Texas, West-facing slope about
4 in the afternoon, medium-dark shingles.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.440
Probably the hottest, worst-case scenario
for a roof and the results from the test are

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.829
really gonna surprise you. First we installed
radiant barrier in part of the attic. You

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.579
can see from these pictures we put about three
rows of AtticFoil on one side of the attic.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.030
Then we came in and put one strip off to the
side so that when we do the thermal imagining

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.109
you can get a really good picture of what
it looks like. We also left the end near the

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.909
gable end open (uncovered) so you can see
that too. So lets take a look at what the

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:08.909
actual thermal imaging looks like. Over the
radiant barrier about 173/174 degrees, without

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.200
the radiant barrier about 166/167 degrees.
The tests show an increase of about 6 to 7

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.899
degrees over the radiant barrier, which is
exactly what the Department of Energy determined

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.310
in their studies - about 2 to 10 degrees increase
over radiant barrier. Now lets look at the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.700
specific areas. Over the radiant barrier it
was reading about 173 degrees, over the area

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.200
without the radiant barrier (the upper right
 - the bare roof) it was reading about 166

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.680
or 167 degrees. If you look at the area to
the far left, near the gable end where we

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.329
had no radiant barrier, it was also reading
about 168 degrees. So this clearly shows that

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:02.729
radiant barrier only causes the shingle temperatures
to go up about 6 - 8 degrees which is in line

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.160
with the 2 to 10 degrees that's normally accepted.
After doing these tests we went out and measured

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.600
the roof temperatures of a bunch of different
roofs and, as expected, light colored shingles

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.470
were as much as 20 or 30 degrees cooler than
darker colored shingles. Bottom line is this:

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.660
whatever your roof temperatures starting point,
when you install a radiant barrier it's only

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.790
gonna increase about 2 to 10 degrees, which
is really considered nominal when you consider

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.470
the fact that most roofs are designed to handle
temperatures close to 200 degrees. So the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.420
bottom line is installing a radiant barrier
will NOT have a long-term negative impact

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.830
on your roofing system. For more information
