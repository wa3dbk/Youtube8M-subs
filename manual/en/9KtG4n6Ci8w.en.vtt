um... and has leads to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.780

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.600
whether or not

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.670
so that's where she's at around eleven
they're asking that question

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.640
you know it

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.810
interrupting him that much enforce what
you meant easy out

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.890
and i i wish that he down the back just
a nice but that's okay we're gonna get

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.670
an answer anyway

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.320
but ek ninety gives his credit he was
like everyone's ratio to just until this

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.150
week for exit by the conspiracy not is
was she seemed to be implying she walked

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.480
away say i don't take non serious
questions when in fact is the most

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.240
serious question meretz right so please
give the knowledge is that there was try

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.890
it

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.780
answer that question is is a very hard
question so let's continue that

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.090
and wants anything else how would you
defend killers again i think he said he

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.830
believed he is happy to talk about

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.690
taking a fight to outsider

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.610
uh... making sure that those who pledged
to do harm

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.170
to people in this country and bring
teradata shores uh... what we have to do

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.020
uh... to make sure that doesn't sound

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.030
almost identical to resolve your bush

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.950
we have to hit them over there before
they come over here

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.280
now or all the more we can in yemen

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.789
we know the civilians were commonly
killed

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.319
all one of civilians in those strikes
and we'll show you the numbers on them

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.209
in the past over and over again

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.490
and probably a salon turns it on the war
had a great does that's

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.229
these are the killer sets president
mama's maybe

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.659
oftentimes people were not on the list
it till

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.589
but even if you put the civilians inside

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.659
really every milton that we put on those
lists those hundreds of milton surf

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.110
alesha mills is that we claim we put on
remember

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.969
we've killed almost three thousand e
withdrawn straight so for right

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.469
every one of the was coming to our
shores

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.899
or could it be that they were fighting
us in pakistan

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.809
because work in pakistan

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:44.769
newer hitting the hot connie network and
you might say hey we should have become

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:45.690
a network

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.959
because they're heading our troops fear
or they're helping people in our troops

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.389
in afghanistan

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.980
also had connie network stock in the
mountains of pakistan afghanistan

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.729
and account or shorts

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:59.159
no they have no intention of coming to
our shores ishaan if i discovered there

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.869
inouye figures out of afghanistan

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:04.500
so it's bush like ideology i don't like
it

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.989
but so far has an anti terribly ugly

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.919
but it's about time

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.779
now remember here

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.599
uh... on world la ke was put on the kya
list

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.980
the administration has a knowledge into
the press

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.209
anonymously

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.579
anne and we did kill 'em we had
withdrawn strike

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.929
in a separate drone strike we also
killed a sixteen-year-old son

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:26.699
that he was not a killers

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.430
the government has never told us why we
kill the mother was a mistake or if they

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.849
intend to kill them they also killed his
young cousin as well is work kids he

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.449
hadn't gone to go find is that

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.649
and now his that was up to no good
according to our information

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:45.589
but he says the sixteen-year-old can try
to find is that

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:48.679
doesn't know re when he's looking for
right

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.399
as we can but is that had been killed
two weeks earlier

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:52.399
so what happened

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:56.169
he was saying goodbye to his cousin and
they were having dinner

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.439
he was about to go back home to the
united states america worries an

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.949
american citizen

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.799
when they dropped a drone bomb

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.019
and they kill them all

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.860
gives his ass about that and listen to
this

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.699
honestly

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.369
heinous things

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.839
do you think that they killing out of
them are like a sixteen year old son is

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:15.979
american citizen is justifiable

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:22.329
pride i came here in a row are concerned
i know but en route one

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:24.280
pronounces citizenship

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.089
prisoners and their considers a great
harm to the people in this country

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:32.530
uh... and was a regional outside a
commander

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.239
hoping to inflict

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:36.179
and destruction

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:38.280
want people to share his religion

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.280
uh... and others in this country in the
end of an american citizen that's been

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.620
targeted without due process of all
about

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.199
trial any is under its his minor eyes i
would suggest that you to have a far

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.060
more responsible fathers there

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.259
uh... truly concerned about the
well-being of their children

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.429
uh... i don't think becoming impending
al-qaeda jihad is terrorist is the best

00:04:58.429 --> 00:04:59.199
way

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.619
to go about doing some local excellent
use a hard question

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:06.090
in the reason is hard it is because they
shouldn't be doing in the first place

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.009
over gives a stock trying even answer

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.710
something that has no answer

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.659
so what does he say he says something
terrible

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.139
well he shouldn't have that terrorist
off

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.429
is that we do now

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:19.959
the united states of america

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:25.749
we kill sixteen-year-old kids 'cause we
liked their dat

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:27.800
sends a chill up my spine man

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.069
and that's a democratic administration

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.710
those are the guys who were supposed to
be progressives

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.289
his boss the guy who were as these
killings was a constitutional law

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.539
professor

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.139
these are the guys who are supposed to
bring us change

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.550
as i would like to change to

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.749
even george w_ bush

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:50.080
never assassinate a u_s_ citizen abroad

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.669
any due process heeded warrantless
wiretapping without due process yes he

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.559
ordered bombings abroad

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:00.779
but this is a different level killing
u_s_ citizens without a trial without

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.740
going to judiciary at all without due
process

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.900
and then

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.419
executing sixteen-year-olds and when
asked about it you say

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.719
is that should have been a tear

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.650
his dad wasn't killed in that struck

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.789
is that was killed two weeks earlier

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.590
this was a different strike they didn't
have to do

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.910
that's of sick cancer
