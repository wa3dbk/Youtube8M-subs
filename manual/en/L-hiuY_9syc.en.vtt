00:00:00.055 --> 00:00:01.721
- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley,

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:03.916
and as y'all know I try my darnedest

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:07.189
to share just who I am here
on this YouTube channel.

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:08.896
I felt, you know what, I
been doing it for so long,

00:00:08.896 --> 00:00:10.785
it's now your turn.

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:12.634
So I asked you to submit some videos

00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:14.564
and share what makes you you.

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:19.521
Honestly, blown away by
how many submissions I got.

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:20.781
Some of them were hilarious.

00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:21.919
Some of them were brave.

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.215
All of them were just really inspiring.

00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:25.983
- (claps) Let's go.

00:00:25.983 --> 00:00:28.197
- This video's actually for Tyler Oakley's

00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:29.761
Dare to Be You Campaign.

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:32.199
- This is Tyler Oakley's #daretobeyou.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.821
- Let's just start off with
the fact that I have one hand.

00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:35.775
That is very different.

00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:38.741
- I have way too many
bottles with straws in them.

00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:40.631
Like, it's just getting weird now.

00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:42.562
- Ummm, I'm afraid of the dark.

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:44.227
- Still love The Backstreet Boys.

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:45.811
I'm 27 years old.

00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:48.229
- I'm 25 and I still watch "Degrassi".

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.302
- Nick Carter, I'm coming for you.

00:00:50.302 --> 00:00:52.557
- Sometimes I put salt and
pepper on my ice cream.

00:00:52.557 --> 00:00:55.686
- And I don't wash my hair for two weeks.

00:00:55.686 --> 00:00:56.925
- Grandma, that's gross.

00:00:56.925 --> 00:00:58.652
- A lot of times when I'm trying to write,

00:00:58.652 --> 00:01:01.496
if I feel stuck I will

00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:03.877
put these fake glasses on.

00:01:03.877 --> 00:01:08.347
- Most days I really
feel like this. (laughs)

00:01:08.347 --> 00:01:11.191
- Tyler Oakley is such
an inspiration to me.

00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:15.146
- This is something I haven't
talked about with anyone ever.

00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:17.301
- Like, you have no idea.

00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:19.413
- I'm not afraid of being flamboyant.

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:22.013
- I will dance on a random table.

00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:23.426
- I don't know how to...

00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:26.809
- I can make people laugh,

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:28.799
and they really laugh hard.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.039
(laughs)

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.701
- I really love mustard.

00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:35.606
- I like to do really colorful eye shadow.

00:01:35.606 --> 00:01:37.251
- I like to wear green.

00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:38.308
I wear green a lot.

00:01:38.308 --> 00:01:40.827
- I have really short, stubby thumbs.

00:01:40.827 --> 00:01:42.574
- I have a lot of freckles.

00:01:42.574 --> 00:01:44.322
- I have acne.

00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:46.425
I have circles under my eyes.

00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:49.462
- And I am gender fluid.

00:01:49.462 --> 00:01:50.728
- I am gay.

00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:55.222
(exhales)

00:01:55.222 --> 00:01:57.873
- Discovered what makes me me is me.

00:01:57.873 --> 00:02:01.247
- I've really come to accept
them and embrace them.

00:02:01.247 --> 00:02:02.993
- I'm proud to say that I have

00:02:02.993 --> 00:02:05.187
a bigger body than most girls.

00:02:05.187 --> 00:02:07.280
- Life's too short to not stand out

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.377
as best as you can.

00:02:08.377 --> 00:02:10.023
- Tyler, if you're watching this,

00:02:10.023 --> 00:02:11.059
I want to thank you.

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:12.522
- I love everything that you stand for.

00:02:12.522 --> 00:02:13.720
You're such an inspiration.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.158
- I love you, and thank
you for doing what you do.

00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:18.312
- If he feels confident for who he is,

00:02:18.312 --> 00:02:20.304
then I should feel confident for who I am.

00:02:20.304 --> 00:02:21.888
- Oh my gosh, you guys!

00:02:21.888 --> 00:02:24.204
I am blown away by all those videos.

00:02:24.204 --> 00:02:25.565
They like warm my heart.

00:02:25.565 --> 00:02:27.984
I could watch them all day long.

00:02:27.984 --> 00:02:30.136
No matter who you are, no matter
what you're going through,

00:02:30.136 --> 00:02:32.046
at the end of the day if you just remember

00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:33.915
to stay true to who you are.

00:02:33.915 --> 00:02:36.150
Nobody does you, like you.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.548
Be yourself, keep sharing who you are

00:02:38.548 --> 00:02:40.518
here online and in real life.

00:02:40.518 --> 00:02:43.431
Own it, rock it, and dare to be you.
