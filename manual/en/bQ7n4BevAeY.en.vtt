00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.910
%um

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.330
this is Paul tsongas our world magazine and
this month will be looking at yamaha the brand-new

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.960
see PX nine hundred copper series of acoustic

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.859
now the top issues that could take are meant
to be beautiful

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.070
arthur what did you talk with

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.290
really beautiful looking in ladies

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.769
bass player voting

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:58.900
great set up

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.280
but the real need to take as a discus cars
it's brand new pick up system which is the

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.799
N E R T

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.530
system

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.990
otherwise known as the acoustical resonance
strands do serve preamble far system

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.560
and it's a revolutionary new system for them
because it tries to recreate

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.030
a more natural sounding acoustic

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.330
so let's take a look at what this pickup in
do and let's hear what this good talking to

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.690
you as well

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.530
so let's talk about be on the hot new secret
weapon which is the yamaha acoustic

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.880
resonance trans dniester

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.460
pick up a system which consists of for contact
the gaps

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.330
which amounted on the underside of the sound
board

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.840
basically it's a three-way system we have
a pair of transistors which are just underneath

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.290
the bridge

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.120
roughly around this area

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.950
and then you have

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.420
to subject ups which are also trend is that
which amounted to the top

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.649
right about here on the trouble side

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.409
and right about here

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.070
on the base i'd

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.260
let me talk about

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.170
how these are all working together

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.280
the idea of using for contact pickups under
the sound board is that the dramatically reduce

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.930
feedback

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.939
while preserving did not rule enriched own
of the acoustic

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.339
so the main pair of trans dniester is are
controlled

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:16.409
the buyer this master volume knob now these
are always on

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:22.090
and of course you control the overall buying
level of the crews that with this not as well

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.360
over here we have a three day in day care
which

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.620
increases all the trouble made and a frequent
use of the guitar

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.549
and moving over here is the two other

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:32.049
controls

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.900
for the other two transfusions what on the
base on Tuesday showed you before by the bridge

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.799
and one of the troubles side of the bridge

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.129
now the zone no pretty mcveigh is done

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.270
bass will travel

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.609
what they do is you can bowl and these in

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.109
I had a little more of the natural properties
of the acoustic

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.449
for today side

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:54.699
and it's trouble side and all demonstrate
that you can hear how that works

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:58.949
the other great function is this is a really
great to know what you can

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.189
and starting your guitar

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.719
and turn it off

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:07.249
okay so let's see how this pickup system works
and how it sounds up i'll start with right

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.659
now I'm plugged in to increase the camp

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.799
and on directly into a mixer as well and I've
said all the controls plot try to get even

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:14.579
town

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.619
so right now I have the subject ups read about

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:19.559
twelve o'clock

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:21.139
and the main by and up

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:27.609
so it does have an actual acoustic sound

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:33.099
now on the move that they scheduled to get
to hear how the character of the base frequencies

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.939
change

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.299
from this chance to serve

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:42.299
so if you're appear that

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.119
so as you heard I used all the base and travel
plans to use it to create a rich not a since

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:02.179
that time

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:03.959
and now nobody is the you

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.689
to find it in that town

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.549
so let's see right now have it set lot

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.730
and now let's move some of the bass frequencies
in the high-frequency silly get the here

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.730
how it changes

00:04:23.799 --> 00:04:25.189
now based in trouble

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:32.189
and a little bit of minutes

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.999
but is another set of my actors to tell let's
hear this guitar for a variety of styles let's

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:50.999
start with strongly

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:16.139
okay so now let's say the parking ticket

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:45.739
finally let's hear the to talk like taken
as I said before these guitars are set up

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:48.069
great with little action so when it comes
time

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:51.270
to do that single note so as you can really
get around the front door

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:58.270
so let's hear that

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.710
finally the one great thing about this pickup
system is because if you have controllable

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.680
based in trouble side of the acoustic

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.680
they intervals between those some really clear
so let me demonstrate that

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.889
nazi it's not but it may be the ultimate guitar
playing a lot but with its revolutionary electronics

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.359
you put all that in great set up

00:06:58.359 --> 00:07:01.169
here to talk about the for more overall control

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:05.419
in your crew sticks out the compass series
of the critics will push in the right direction
