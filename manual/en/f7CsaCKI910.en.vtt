00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:11.799
Hi, I'm Rick Tobey on behalf of Expert Village
and this is blues progressions part three.

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:22.720
So with 'Tin Pan Alley' we start on a A minor
chord. It's a very slow song, and you can

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:33.100
lift up your index finger if you want to kind
of get that B string to play open a few times.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:44.600
It changes to a D minor and the way we do
that is you've got your A minor chord, and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.989
you simply lift up all your fingers but you
keep them low close to the strings. Your index

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.809
finger is going from the first fret of the
B string to the first fret of the E string.

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:07.260
The third finger is going from the second
fret of the G string to the third fret of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:16.759
the B string and your second finger is going
from the second fret of the D string to the

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:29.140
second fret of the G string. And then you
simply go back to the A minor again. So lift

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.220
your fingers up and keep them close. Notice
how these two fingers can kind of move together.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.459
You can see that, they're just kind of sliding
over there and as your doing that this finger

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:46.720
is sliding to over there. So with practice
this becomes a very smooth and easy maneuver.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:58.780
It would be a good idea to simply practice
going back and forth. Then it goes to through

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.890
E minor chord from the A minor and this is
very simple. You simply lift these two fingers

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:17.620
up and you place them on the A and the D strings,
and you lift up your index finger. So you'd

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:39.070
be going from here, to here. Now there's a
place in this song where it goes from an A

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:52.990
minor to an E, seventh chord. So in that case
you would go from A minor, and you would keep

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:00.940
your fingers in the same exact formation and
simply move them down the next set of strings.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:11.490
So from the A minor to the E chord it just
simply moving your fingers down to the next

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:19.690
set of strings and to make the seventh chord
you add your little finger to the third fret

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:27.870
on the B string. That's how you change between
the chords.
