00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.909
Hi this is Julie from WowToyz and today I
would like to

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.839
introduce the E-Z Build 3D Puzzle Kit series
from WowToyz, where you build your own detailed

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:10.919
collectible using sturdy plastic interlocking
pieces.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:11.919
No need to paint!

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:12.919
No need to glue!

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.240
Everything you need is included.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.640
Here we have the Triceratops Skeleton Fossil.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.410
Measuring approximately 8 inches long once
complete.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.109
With 26 pieces it's fun &amp; challenging for
ages 8 and up.

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.500
Instructions are included for your reference-
but the challenge of putting it together is

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.980
part of the fun!

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.360
Separate the pieces into similar piles by
shape or size, that's a good place to start.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.220
And because it is a puzzle, remember, you
can even take it apart and put it together

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.220
again.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.650
See how fast you can put it together each
time!

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.140
You may need to turn the pieces a few times
to make it fit just right, similar to any

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.710
common jigsaw puzzle.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.050
The Triceratops had a large body and a huge
skull- its skull alone could reach lengths

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.400
of over 7 feet!

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.800
One Triceratops skull that was discovered
weighed over 3 tons!

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.050
This is one of the largest skulls of any land
animal ever discovered!

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.050
Triceratops had between 400-800 teeth- and
only a small percentage of them were used

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.390
at any time as they were constantly replaced
throughout its lifetime.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.609
Triceratops is one of the most recognizable
dinosaurs.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:11.950
Its name means "three-horned face" for the
2 large horns found on top of its skull and

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.840
the third horn located on its nose.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.460
"Tri" means three in Greek, and "Keratops"
means horned face.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.109
Scientists believe that Triceratops used its
3 horns to protect itself from deadly predators

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:27.460
like the Trex, which lived during the same
era- the late cretaceous period (68-65 million

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.460
years ago).

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.109
Triceratops probably defended itself by charging
into its enemy with these horns, like rhinoceros

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:34.109
do today.

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:38.520
Similarly, the Triceratops was also an herbivore,
believed to have fed on plants and the woody

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.759
growth of trees.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.110
Behind its horns was a 6 ft wide head frill
made of bone.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.850
There are many theories behind the real purpose
of the head frill.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.750
It may have protected its neck from predators.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.229
It may have attracted mates during mating
rituals.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.159
It may have even served to regulate body temperature.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.619
Numerous Triceratops remains have been documented
since 1889, including at least one complete

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.960
individual skeleton.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.020
47 complete or partial skulls have been discovered
since the year 2000 in the Hell Creek Rock

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.362
Formation - which occurs in Montana and portions
of North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:13.320
In fact, Wyoming lists the Triceratops as
its state dinosaur.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.150
Some fossils have also been found further
north in Saskatchewan and Alberta Canada.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.870
The world's largest collection of Hell Creek
fossils is housed and exhibited at the Museum

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.940
of the Rockies, in Bozeman Montana, and now
you can have your very own museum quality

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.890
Triceratops Skeleton replica.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.170
Thank you for joining us and come back for
the next session of our E-Z Build 3D Puzzle

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.330
Kits.
