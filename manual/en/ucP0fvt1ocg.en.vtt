Getting involved is a vital part of the college
experience, especially at Loyola because so

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.340
much is offered.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.580
There are over 170 different clubs and organizations
run by students at Loyola and that keeps campus

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.760
from ever being dull.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.480
If there's something here that doesn't interest
you, then all it takes is three people and

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.779
a moderator to start your own club.

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.689
I think involving yourself in clubs and organizations
allows you to meet people on campus, students

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.100
and professors alike, whom you would not have
the opportunity to interact with otherwise.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.720
It also allows you to learn more in an area
of interest, whether it's an academic club

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.100
or finance, or psychology or something like
that or a club that students do just for fun.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.850
My radio show is so much fun!

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.540
It's me and my twin sister and it's called
a "double dose of entertainment with Jordan

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.410
and Joelle."

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.089
We talk about entertainment and news and we
play r&amp;b and hip hop music and it's on Friday

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.320
nights and it's just a good way that a lot
of people listen to it on Fridays before they

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.770
go out or if they're just hanging out in their
room; it's a lot of fun and the energy is

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.859
good and it's a good vibe.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.030
Loyolapalooza is the festival of the year
at Loyola!

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.579
The whole school comes together for the day
and we're able to meet on the quad, listen

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.490
to great music, eat really fun food and participate
in carnival activities.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.570
There are rides here that they provide on
campus and it's just an all-day amazing event

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.570
that everybody attends.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.960
As a freshman, I would say, get involved right
away.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.420
There are so many different activities that
fit anyone.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.899
Sign up for as many as you want and then narrow
it down.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.350
I signed up for all different kinds of sports,
clubs, organizations, and then I realized

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.569
I signed for too many so I narrowed it down
to what fit me and my interests and as well

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.729
as what kind of people I was meeting.

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.569
Try new things; try anything that you want
to do!

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.129
Even if it's something that scares you; go
try it and you'll meet new people.
