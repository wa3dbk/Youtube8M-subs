Hi, I'm Chris Faircloth, Artistic Director
and co-owner of Salon Teez. For Expert Village,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:13.070
this is how to trim women's hair. The next
type of technique that we'll do is a technique

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.660
called back cutting. What we'll do here is
actually use a horizontal piece or a horizontal

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:28.199
section of hair. This particular technique
actually creates a lot of weight in the hair

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.870
and a lot of movement as far as volume is
concerned. For those clients that are looking

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.620
for a lot of volume, this is a great technique
to use. We'll take our section that will be

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.820
about an inch and a half section. Again that's
horizontal because we do want to create some

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.010
weight and some fullness. We'll use our shear
but typically with this, we don't want to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.449
close down. We're still kind of talking but
as we move towards the scalp, we're gradually

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.489
closing the blade of the shear but not all
the way to the scalp and not all the way closed.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.820
I'll do this is slow motion so you that you
can see what the effect will be and we'll

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:16.420
work all the way through the hair shaft. Notice
that I'm kind of talking my shear through,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:25.369
at the same time I'm not slide cutting. It's
almost a teasing motion that I would be using

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:36.270
here like as if we were teasing the hair with
a comb.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.530
Now you'll have short and long pieces in there
and that's okay because what that will give

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.880
us is a lot of volume and a lot of movement
underneath, almost like a support structure

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:58.509
in the hair shaft. Once you've had some practice
at this,

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.100
you move at a faster pace because you want
to work through the hair very, very quickly.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:14.080
We can also weave out hair with the bottom
blade so that we're not taking all of that

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:22.560
hair and now we'll just talk the hair, again,
I'm not pushing the blade, I'm talking the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.819
blade through so I'm not creating a slide
cutting type of effect. The layers blend in

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.959
very nicely and that gives us more support
underneath so that we can get a good amount

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.720
of volume. This technique would only want
to be used in the top of the head although

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.480
we could use it around the middle section
of the hair to give us some more movement

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.959
and some more volume as well.
