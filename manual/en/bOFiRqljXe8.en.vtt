Hi Girls! Today's video topic is Bandanas!

00:00:33.296 --> 00:00:35.796
So, I am no Bandanas specialist

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:39.785
But I like to use it sometimes and I think it's a fun change

00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:43.761
I'll share with you some ideas I had 
 and I hope you will enjoy it!

00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:59.251
You will pass the Bandana underneath the hair like this

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:03.125
And then you will tie the bandana to the head

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:05.155
When I started to do this hairstyle

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.530
I had a bit of a hard time

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:10.975
because the Bandana slipped from my head

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:13.999
But then I realized we shouldn't tighten much

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
You leave it more loose

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630
Cause then the bandana will hold at the top of the head

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.444
Tie the ends into a knot

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And then the ends should look like this

00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:24.505
At the top of the forehead

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.069
I pull the hair at the front

00:01:25.827 --> 00:01:28.827
And here, because I'm a bit self concious about my ears

00:01:28.228 --> 00:01:31.228
I pull some hairs to cover the ears

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:03.740
For the other bandana hairstyle you will need a hairband

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:06.060
You will tie your hair up

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.640
Like a ponytail

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.400
Then, you will do a sort of mohawk

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.100
Now, put some bobby pins to fasten it

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.100
You will fasten your hair like this

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:18.910
In the top of the head

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.300
Looks weird in the beggining but it's like this

00:02:22.913 --> 00:02:25.910
For now you leave it messy like this

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And now we put the Bandana

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:40.760
You will fasten like this at the front

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.930
If there are some loose hairs you also fasten it

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.800
That's how the second bandana is supposed to look

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.710
The mohawk and the side bandana

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
If you want, you can fold the bandana a bit more

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.800
I like it when the bandana is thinner like this

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:03.220
Now, another bandana

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
You will put your hair to the side like this

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.900
And now you will tie the bandana and twist it like this

00:03:09.363 --> 00:03:13.360
Now you put it down and fasten the ribbon's end

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:19.930
And this hair on the side you will 
 fasten in the back of the head

00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:23.800
You will twist you hair like this and 
 fasten with bobby pins all the way

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.540
Now as I already taught you the other day

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.500
If you think your hair looks too volumous in one side

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:36.960
You get some hairs from the back, twist it, make a bun

00:03:35.942 --> 00:03:37.940
And hide it on the nape

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:46.680
Now you make a hair bun

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.890
Spray on it a few times to fix

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So there's no frizz

00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:54.330
I will use a folded bandana the way we did before

00:03:55.015 --> 00:03:58.520
Put first at the front, then go all the way like this

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.900
Not so tight

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.460
Then you turn and tie the ends into a knot

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:10.880
So, the hairstyle looks like this

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.900
Very cute!

00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:21.080
The other hairstyle we can do is with the ribbon again

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.200
Take the ribbon and pass in the back of the head

00:04:24.672 --> 00:04:28.670
turn it and then twist it

00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:32.890
And fasten the ends in the back of the head

00:04:35.462 --> 00:04:39.460
Some people like to use on the forehead, I don't

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:42.740
Then I do it like this, then pull some hairs up

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:45.980
Looks a bit like a quiff at the front

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:48.970
That's how our other hair bun looks like!

00:04:53.854 --> 00:04:58.350
Or you can also make it on the 
 side and tie into a pretty bow

00:04:58.609 --> 00:05:01.610
We can go out with a girly bow, why not?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
