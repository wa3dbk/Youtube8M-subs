00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.200
abercrombie and fitch is under fire
again for saying terrible things about

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.550
overweight people

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.719
um... apparently there is a book written
called the new rules of retail bobby

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.309
lewis wrote that book and in the book
uh... it turns out that c_e_o_ that work

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.410
on the infinite shot my geoffrey said
some pretty despicable things about

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.140
people who are not skinny okay

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.539
so according to the bookmark jeffries
doesn't lot larger people shopping in a

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.179
store

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.039
he wants then and beautiful people he
doesn't want his core customers to see

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.890
people who are as hot as band wearing
his clothing

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.109
people who where his clothing should
feel like

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.170
there one of the cool kids

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.550
i think's cross the line

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.140
uh... he's crossed the line with a
billion times

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.800
that shopping abercrombie and fit yet
no-no is on a moral ethical level it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.749
certainly you're writing course that but
the long time ago

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.510
but i mean in terms of marketing leaky
sayings

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.860
all that you know i'll create this of
bible the cool kids here are not the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.239
fact is a setter

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.080
but if he keeps admitting that stuff in
public

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.899
i think that

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.590
even the so-called cool kids seem to me
like

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.900
that's not cool man

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.820
especially right now when bullying is
such a huge problem why are you feeding

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.230
into that you note any because younger
people are typically people who shop at

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.360
abercrombie fitch i remember when i was
in college if i have a copy infection is

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.790
so cool

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.860
uh... and endorsing was working and and
i think well it didn't work in the sense

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.640
that i thought like away yet

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.880
bigger people can fit into these clothes
on so-called now i did

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.070
believe that i need to know that that
was part of their marketing no no i know

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.490
i know but they were trying to give off
a cool violinists always at work at it

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.259
doesn't work for me but they don't want
me that serves them over weight

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.139
because everytime i walk by the store
there's a guy hang out with his shirt

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:41.710
open in l_a_ the literally literally

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.680
and he's got a six-pack on yet that i
think that tells me don't come into and

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.020
usually he's like twelve by the way
write me a anne details we go come in

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.340
here for several different suspect
record but

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.559
but it says basically if you're
overweight you're not welcome here

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:56.539
and at but i'm saying look

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.530
he caught some more line a long time ago

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.330
but in terms of marketing and and smart
capitalism it's cetera

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.170
he's not a smart as he thinks he is
cassie's crossing that line and i think

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.340
is knows a lot of customers 'cause
that's gonna turn to shopping n ever

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.770
comprehend pitch me zero asl definitely
and so it's not gonna be cool anymore

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.280
cell outlook i think that you know your
right but

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.140
part of me once disagree with you a
little bit because

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.040
it's not the first time he made comments
like this in bad back in two thousand

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.160
six he actually had an interview with
salon and he said allot of people don't

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.739
belong in our clothes

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.349
and they can't belong are we
exclusionary absolutely

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.889
now look see that's devastating

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.099
because they know you want to create
that pollution of its was a lot of the

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.860
rope line you you can't cross

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.510
followed i don't know what u_n_ i get
all that but he saw over the top another

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.169
heavy set them back in two thousand six

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.590
maybe i'm wrong maybe it's working
screens in and yet there but it looked

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.679
on

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.730
there are no worse in this race
expedition texans are good news

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.330
scrub oak even if you see any i wouldn't
go there has given a real have you ever

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.709
gotten a headache by walking past and
abercrombie fitch star

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.429
really what this is a different reasons
ok they love the techno music which by

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:11.179
the way i love but i can imagine most
people would hate right

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.569
and also this pay-per-view money
everything of another legal really

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.459
strong smelling perfume or cologne or
something straight

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.860
everywhere all their clothes how like
they have the that cloner uh... if there

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.590
is a how missus possibly send me down
and recovery effort

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.849
an israeli documents in sierra leone
looking ahead and are places are likely

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:30.680
prices

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.269
constraint for fuming but is there like
perfume

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.560
it allowed me to know what i can talk to
anybody so far no idea anonymity you are

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.599
really tight shirt so that i might just
hanging out i don't like

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.649
hopefully expected stuff but once upon a
story in teases

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:48.349
non-profits order id

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.089
so let if you try to give me away from
shopping this sort of relative are

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.569
