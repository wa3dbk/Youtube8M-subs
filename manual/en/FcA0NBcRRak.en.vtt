00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.430
You're watching Inside Yellowstone.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.860 position:58%
Yellowstone is home to two species of

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.020 position:67%
bears. Many visitors are sometimes rewarded

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.810 position:64%
with sightings of black bears and grizzly

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.580
bears in the wild. Though it's

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.130 position:56%
dangerous and unlawful to feed bears

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.900 position:56%
this used to be a common practice in

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.260 position:56%
the past. In fact bears often waited

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.180 position:58%
along the roadsides for handouts from

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.630
passing motorists and entered

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.190
campgrounds in search of food.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.310 position:61%
Bears fed nightly at open garbage dumps

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.320
in the park while visitors watched.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.950
The close proximity of humans and

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.980 position:58%
bears was dangerous for both species.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.640
Many park visitors were injured

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.080
by bears or suffered property

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.920 position:56%
damage and many bears were killed or

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.140 position:58%
removed from the park. Eventually the

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.830 position:56%
park decided that human foods should

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.990
not be available to bears. Now we

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.700 position:56%
have special bear-proof garbage cans

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.270
and visitors are very good about

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.890 position:58%
keeping a clean camp and not allowing

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.640 position:56%
bears to get human foods. The number

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.270 position:58%
of injuries and incidents of property

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.700 position:58%
damage due to bears has plummeted and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.890
bears are safer now as well.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.250
Though bears no longer line up

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.440
along the roadsides or congregate

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.880
at open garbage dumps, many people

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.500
still see them from their cars.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.110 position:58%
It’s all the more exciting to glimpse

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.090 position:61%
bears in their natural habitat foraging

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.330 position:66%
for food and interacting with their young.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.440 position:59%
In 2006, bears caused over 700 traffic

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.290 position:63%
jams while visitors got to peek at bears

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.410 position:64%
in the wild doing what they do naturally.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.750
If you would like to see a bear,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.930
think like a bear. Grizzlies often

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.770
forage in open meadows while black

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.260 position:58%
bears prefer to stick to the trees or

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.890
the edges of forests where there is

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.630 position:58%
more cover. During the summer months,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.290
bears often nap during the heat of

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.270
the day and are more active at dusk

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.310 position:63%
and dawn. Think about what foods they’re

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.010 position:63%
searching for: in the spring it might be

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.570 position:58%
winter-killed animals, newly born elk

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.120 position:63%
calves, and flowers. They may be fishing

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.140 position:61%
for spawning trout or rooting for grubs

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.230 position:56%
and insects, roots, tubers and other

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.720 position:56%
vegetation or small mammals. Berries

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.500 position:61%
and whitebark pinenuts are tasty treats

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.580 position:58%
in the fall as are army cutworm moths

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.610
in the high elevation talus slopes.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.150
They are amazing to watch.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.890 position:59%
Just remember that Yellowstone’s bears

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.440 position:59%
are wild and you should never surprise

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.360
or approach them. Keep at least 100

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.400 position:56%
yards from bears at all times and do

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.420 position:64%
not disturb their natural behaviors. They

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.180 position:63%
have a lot of eating to do in the summer

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.110 position:66%
and fall to be healthy enough to have cubs

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.680
and sleep all winter long.
