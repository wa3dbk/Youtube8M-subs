hi my name is rob frankie and this is my
collection of the 100 best research paper

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.339
topics i've ever seen as an english
professor

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.679
i think that how you're better off
honestly picking your own topic i think

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.599
it's going to be more enjoyable for you
that way

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.980
it really should be interesting

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.489
or demanded and scholarly

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:25.619
so i also recommend picking the topic
within your major or field of interest

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.619
and on

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.019
i have some tapes and describe lines for
picking your own but i also have my

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:36.039
collection here of my top one hundred of
discontent identities well these are

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.720
actually based off of real research
papers

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.120
and

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.180
broke down by the topic

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.950
the medicine healthcare biology i think
the first one maggot therapy is

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.980
effective for cleaning wounds is one of
the best

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.830
for education

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.680
the last one making more money will not
make you any happier

research to support that too

offshore wind turbines were to go into

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.530
because

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.580
that works well for buyer mental science
you'd even

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.370
