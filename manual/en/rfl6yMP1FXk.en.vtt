00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
Welcome to Pins and Things. Today we're going to be making this snowman wreath

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.640
So what you're going to need is three different wooden wreaths. Small, medium and a large

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.540
Some wire. This is just floral wire, some white spray paint, hot glue and glue sticks

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.699
Red Ribbon or whatever kind of Ribbon you want for the scarf

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.840
I got this little dangly bell thing from the dollar store, some black Foam sheets and some ribbon to go on the hat

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.160
So I've taken the floral wire and I'm just wrapping it around to the two and then twisting them together right here

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.480
and folding them down into the rest of the wire

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.540
I'm going to do the exact same thing from this wreath to this wreath

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.739
and this is perfect because it's really bendable, it's not too thick of wire

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.820
It's just the floral wire you can get it in any craft section

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.500
Now that I have those little bells, I've just actually taken them off of the rest of those decorations

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.160
I'm going to layer them, one two three, like that

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.360
and just glue this one on hanging down the lowest. I can cover up this little spot with the wire on it

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.640
Now I'm just going on this second one right on top of the last one

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.740
and it does help if you make it, bring you all the way back past the back side here

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.400
so that it has something it's like hooking over and here's the last one, I'm just gluing on

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.600
I've kind of made sure that they look good when you're hanging like that, and then I'm gonna glue the Ribbon together

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.508
So it hangs evenly on the door. Now I just I'm taking my ribbon, this is pretty thick ribbon

00:01:30.508 --> 00:01:31.940
we want it to look like a scarf

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.140
and I'm just gonna put a ton of hot glue on here to get it in the right place

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.640
and glue it on and that will kind of cover up the rest of our mess underneath here from gluing on the bells

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.680
I'm gluing on the back side too

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.640
So I have the one from underneath going a little bit longer about three inches longer and now I'm just going to

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.280
put this one underneath like you would tie a scarf, and it's gonna have the wrong side showing

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.340
and you just need to grab it and flip it to the other direction. So it will be sparkly on all sides

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.360
I'm just cutting this one on top

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.480
a little bit shorter just to make it look kind of like a real scarf

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.000
So I've just cut a little rectangle right here, and it's about two inches tall and I'm going to fold it and glue it

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm just gonna freehand it

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.040
and make a little circle around the outside of the hat. After cutting out the bottom

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.260
it doesn't have to be perfectly round because we're actually gonna snip off the back to make it lay flat against the door

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.550
kinda like that and I just took this round tube part and flipped it

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.160
So the top is down here. Drew a circle around that and I'm gonna cut that out

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.840
and now I'm just gonna glue it onto the top. So now I'm just gonna take the top

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.140
that's not quite even and trim it

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.000
Now that this is done putting the top on I'm gonna make sure that all of the ugly parts are in the back

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.380
and this part is where I'm gonna probably trim cause' this part is pretty round and it looks good

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.580
So I'm just gonna glue that down now, make sure all the ugly parts are matching up in the back and make it centered

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.860
and now i'm gonna put it on

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.420
the top of this. I just want it to be this whole part cut off all the way up till

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.860
the tube on the hat

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.599
So to finish off the little top hat, I'm just gonna grab a little bit of Ribbon

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.220
that I like, that's good contrast to the hat and put in some glue

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.660
Just on the front and the bottom of the hat and I'm matching that with the ugly parts of the ribbon with the ugly parts of the back

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.040
and now I'm just gonna glue it down and trim it

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.580
There we go

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.820
Cute. All right, so I'm gonna put two globs of glue, one right here, and one right here

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.900
to glue it on to the the wreath and I'm making it

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.519
opposite of wherever I tight it though, so it's gonna go on this side

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.200
just to give it a little bit more variety. So to finish it all off, I have this package

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.960
It was a package of six snowflakes from the dollar store

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.420
They're just really shiny and cute and so I'm gonna just place them all over here

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.160
and hot glue them on in a lot of different places kind of give it a final

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.709
memory look. So I just finished it off by adding four of the snow flakes

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.229
I didn't even use all them, use this for a different craft. Someday. I think it looks great

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.380
It's turned out so good

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.629
It's gorgeous, and I just love it so much

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.010
