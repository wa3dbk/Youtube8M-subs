Whether it’s all of our scanned or digital
camera photos, or our huge collection of movies

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.230
we seem to be downloading, it seems like we’re
all running out of hard disc space.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.429
Hey, it’s Curtis, from Scan Your Entire
Life, and if you use iPhoto for Mac, I would

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.990
like to show you how to fix this problem.
By default, iPhoto likes to store all of your

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.520
photos in a single file called the iPhoto
Library. This is actually a good thing for

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.999
most people. It makes it easier, more of a
hands-off approach to managing all of your

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.140
photos.
So what we’re going to be doing to free

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.460
up hard disc space, is actually moving this
iPhoto Library file to a separate hard drive.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.700
It’s very important that you have a backup
copy of your iPhoto Library file, before you

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.850
do what I am about to show you. Your photos
are irreplaceable so please make a backup.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.830
So the first thing we need to do is make sure
we close out iPhoto. I’m going to close

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.410
out that window (command-Q) or you can go
to the iPhoto menu option and hit “Quit

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.370
iPhoto.”
Next, we need to find our iPhoto library,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.300
and for most people, you will find that on
your hard drive, and in your user home folder.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.070
And then I will click here on my pictures
folder. And you will see right here at the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.310
bottom is my iPhoto Library. It looks like
a single file but it’s actually a folder.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.260
And if you look over here, you will see that
my iPhoto Library is 1.33 gigabytes, which

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.969
is actually really small. You might find that
your iPhoto Library is 20, 30, 40, 60 gigabytes

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.979
- and that’s why your hard drive is so full.
So even though my iPhoto library is really

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.310
small, and you can see I have 205 gigabytes
free on my hard drive, we’re going to pretend

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.049
like my hard drive is actually empty, and
we’re going to move this iPhoto Library

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.650
to an external hard drive.
Especially for laptop users, I wouldn’t

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.280
really recommend having your iPhoto Library
on an external hard drive for a very long

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.350
time. It’s a good temporary solution but
your best decision really is to replace your

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.610
small hard drive with a larger one, and then
use your external hard drive as a backup.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.460
Because what this means is, anytime you load
up iPhoto, you’re gonna have to make sure

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.889
your external hard drive is plugged in. But,
for certain circumstances, this might be the

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.920
best solution for you right now.
And it’s simply a matter of going over to

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.940
your iPhoto Library, left clicking, and dragging
the iPhoto Library over to your external hard

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.959
drive.
Because my test library is so small, it’s

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.499
only going to take a couple minutes for it
to finish copying. But don’t be surprised

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:34.249
if yours takes 20 minutes, 30, 40, even an
hour to copy depending on how large it is.

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:38.810
[“Ding” sound effect]
It’s important to note right now that we

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.049
have 2 copies of our iPhoto Library. One is
right here in the pictures folder, and another

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:51.290
is in our external hard drive. If I move this
down you can see both copies. Here and right

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.870
here. This is important because we don’t
want to delete the original version before

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.150
we have tested out the new version to make
sure everything is working correctly.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.349
So what I am going to do is go up to my pictures
folder here, I’m gonna single click here

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.071
where it says iPhoto Library, so that it’s
highlighted with all blue. I’m going to

00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:14.510
right cursor over, and add word “old”
to the end of the filename. And I’ll show

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.469
you in a second why that’s important.
So what we wanna do now is boot into iPhoto,

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:24.620
but we want to tell it to load from the new
iPhoto Library and not from the one we just

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.239
labeled “old.” And the way you do that,
is you hold down the option key, keep it held

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.749
down, and them move down to your dock, and
click on iPhoto. And now a window will pop

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:41.319
up and say, “What photo library do you want
iPhoto to use?” And because we labeled the

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.180
old iPhoto Library “old,” it’s a lot
easier now to find the new one by clicking

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.989
on the one that is obviously not labeled “old.”
And for users with the latest iPhoto, you’ll

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.409
be able to see a path description here on
the bottom that will help validate that we

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:00.849
have selected the correct external hard drive.
So now we click on choose. And now iPhoto

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.889
will launch using the newest iPhoto Library.
And now we can quit out of iPhoto. I’m going

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.439
to hit Command-Q.
So now it’s safe to delete the old iPhoto

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.079
library. So I’m going to right-click on
it, and then select “Move to Trash.” [Sound

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.640
effect paper hitting trash can]
Now if you are paranoid like me, maybe not

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.460
Jack Nicholson in “As Good As It Gets”
kind of paranoid, but just a good healthy

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.560
case of paranoia, you will load up iPhoto
one more time just to make sure everything

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.729
is there and loads fine. I mean, I am just
saying here, this is your entire photo collection

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.881
here!
Everything seems good. Let’s empty that

00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:39.080
trash! [Sound effect paper being wadded up]
So I hope you found this to be useful. Enjoy

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.330
scanning the rest of your life! Cheers!
