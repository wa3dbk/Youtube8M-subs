00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.010
(heavy rock music)

00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:34.762
- Perfect.

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:37.368
- Ya said I couldn't do it.

00:00:37.368 --> 00:00:39.202
Ya questioned my skills.

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:40.129
Now ya know.

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:41.797
I'm a bartender.

00:00:41.797 --> 00:00:44.299
Okay, this drink works on
the oil and water principle.

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:46.319
Each of these liquids
has a different density.

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:47.155
Are you nervous?

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:48.281
- Yes.

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.337
- You can do this.

00:00:49.337 --> 00:00:51.542
She's gonna make the
drink that I just made.

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:52.406
That's how easy it is.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:53.296
- I'm gonna have to try it.

00:00:53.296 --> 00:00:55.125
- Grenadine.

00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.456
Perfect.

00:00:58.456 --> 00:00:59.019
- Ice.

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.469
- Then you put in your ice cubes, okay?

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:01.991
I don't like to drop 'em
in 'cause I don't want

00:01:01.991 --> 00:01:03.652
the grenadine to splash everywhere

00:01:03.652 --> 00:01:05.566
and mix with the other
layers that come in.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.348
Sweet and sour.

00:01:07.348 --> 00:01:08.713
- I'm gonna layer it on a spoon, right?

00:01:08.713 --> 00:01:10.233
- Yeah.

00:01:10.773 --> 00:01:12.351
- Orange juice.

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:15.283
- Now...

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:16.361
- For the liquor.

00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:17.925
- Vodka.

00:01:19.823 --> 00:01:20.658
There.

00:01:20.658 --> 00:01:22.092
Okay, stop.

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:24.002
- This is the tricky part.

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:26.695
- Now this is the tricky part
about this whole drink, okay?

00:01:26.695 --> 00:01:28.680
Because the Blue Curacao, the density--

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.862
- Sinks.
- [Skyy] Yeah, that's right.

00:01:29.862 --> 00:01:30.780
It sinks.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.501
So once you add that, it's a
race to start pouring, okay?

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:35.637
So here.

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:36.668
- You want to add the Blue?

00:01:36.668 --> 00:01:37.520
- Hm?

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.243
No, I'm not making this goddamn drink.

00:01:39.243 --> 00:01:39.948
What do I look like?

00:01:39.948 --> 00:01:42.146
I'm not working here.

00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:44.689
So add your Blue, and then go for it.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.604
Try to put the Blue like on the rim

00:01:46.604 --> 00:01:49.331
so that it's ready to
pour as soon as you go.

00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:50.713
- Can you hold the glass for me so I can

00:01:50.713 --> 00:01:52.188
push this in without it moving?

00:01:52.188 --> 00:01:53.523
- No.

00:01:53.523 --> 00:01:54.923
Nobody helps you make your own drinks.

00:01:54.923 --> 00:01:56.065
- You're mean.

00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:57.227
- You can do this.

00:01:57.227 --> 00:01:58.072
(sigh)

00:01:58.072 --> 00:01:59.680
- Okay.

00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:01.010
- Why are we waiting?

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.592
Jesus Christ.

00:02:01.592 --> 00:02:02.207
The clock is ticking.

00:02:02.207 --> 00:02:03.228
These people watch this on the internet.

00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:04.165
They got to go!

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:04.837
- Okay, okay.

00:02:04.837 --> 00:02:06.908
- These boys got porn to watch.

00:02:06.908 --> 00:02:09.017
- I'll make us a drink.

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:15.598
Ah!

00:02:19.945 --> 00:02:21.576
Yuck.

00:02:22.627 --> 00:02:26.139
(laughs)

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.321
My bad.

00:02:29.987 --> 00:02:32.362
It's kind of a rainbow.

00:02:33.702 --> 00:02:35.176
(laughs)

00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:40.116
