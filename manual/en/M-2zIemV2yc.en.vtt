00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.660
Indie is about small teams working on
tight artistic visions. You have the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.700
freedom to explore crazy ideas. What's great about indies is that they don't have the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.120
same money at stake so that gives them the flexibility to really really try new things. Indie video games are

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.130
really helping, I think, to push the
boundaries of game design.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.029
Indies are pretty much the saviors of video games.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.429
In the beginning video games were
actually independent ventures. They

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.710
started out in  people's basements and
garages. These were one and two man teams.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.100
And then video games got huge and you ended up having

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.059
hundreds of people working on a single
title.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.690
I think what's great about independent video games now is that you're seeing this return to really really small

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.820
teams, so teams under the size of ten.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.520
I think one of the biggest problems in
the past, for indies, has been distribution. Let's

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.749
say you struck a publishing deal with

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:54.309
a Microsoft or Sony. That process is
going to be a lot longer, you might have a little more cash to play

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.600
with, but you also have to deal with the
reality that your game needs to be put on a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.739
schedule and released at a certain time. One of the great things is that there's some new

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.640
platforms such as crowd funding, so Kickstarter or Indie GoGo. 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.710
Those are places where you can put your prototype out there and say "Hey, I really want to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.460
finish up this product."  It allows you to garner a new audience and it puts cash in your pocket.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.240
So that's what's really exciting is that it's
not the difference between me

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.520
purchasing it and not purchasing it. It's really a difference between something existing

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.520
and not existing and I think that that's a really exciting thing for independent game design.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.710
The jumping or the running or the bouncing off enemies, these are mechanics. This is different than

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.570
something like having three lives which is
a rule but it's not particularly

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.710
a mechanic because it doesn't push
you towards the interaction in the game

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.690
on a moment to moment basis. For me,
the mechanics in the game are the small systems

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.770
that lead to the emotional feeling you
get from playing a game. What you really

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.520
want when you have a game is systemic
significance; learning that it's okay to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.100
try again in certain context, learning
how to approach a situation where you're

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.790
uncomfortable because the game's making
you uncomfortable but you decide that

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.480
you're going to tackle it anyway.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.700
That's the purest and most exciting
motivation of a system. And I think indie

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.569
video games

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.819
have the possibility to create the most
interesting and unique systems because

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.819
they're driven by the want to make
something and to express yourself.

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.209
I feel like a lot of Triple A games approach sound design

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.619
from just a hyper-realistic perspective
whereas a big thing for indie games is vibe

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:32.509
and tone and thinking about how I want
the player to feel and what kind of feel I want the music

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:33.569
to convey.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.879
Sorta like an animated film or something,
you're responsible for the entire soundscape.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.349
It's not like there's any

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.700
physical space that the game is taking place in so you have to

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.439
create all of that from scratch. For Bastion, a lot of it took place on like floating islands in the sky.

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.920
So, yeah, I had to make up what that would sound like and I

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.209
asked myself really weird questions
throughout the process like "What does it

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.069
sound like when you hit a genie with a
hammer?"

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.359
Like I had to figure that out, you know, so. You have to make it so that it'll play over

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.989
and over again without the player either
getting sick of it or even really noticing that it's

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.969
happening. How you swing your hammer, that sound has to be a big, satisfying hear because you're gonna

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:10.150
hear it like thousands of

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.680
times throughout the game. All of your
senses that you use to play a video game

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.449
should be tantalized. It shouldn't detract, it shouldn't draw attention away from other things.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.769
Everything should hold up the gameplay and the feeling of what's happening. And if music

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:23.699
doesn't  do that then

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:29.759
it's not doing it's complete job.

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:34.799
The visuals that I love the most are the ones that just blend seamlessly in with this world and make it come alive.

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:41.469
In Osmos, there's definitely a spacey kind of feel or like a deep underwater feel and so, sort of a dark blue

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:46.069
seemed to be the right choice. And when you start going into abstraction, that space

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.669
opens up so much more than realism.
Realism feels so focused. Like Andreas

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.659
Illiger, Tiny Wings, the mix of this beautiful
watercolors  but mixed with this procedural

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.319
coloration that changes everyday. You want to
be artistically resonant and beautiful

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.889
and aesthetically pleasing but you're trying to
convey information. I'd say like a third

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:04.880
of the time spent on the

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.570
visuals in Osmos were spent on making sure that things look good at

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.590
all magnifications. A lot of games don't have to deal with that. And so you don't want to overwhelm the

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.150
player. You want them to have enough
information to do what is they need to do

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.199
and you want it to look good. How do you render
the things that the player needs to see and how do you render them in

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.129
such a way

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:26.849
that they actually have a dynamic feel of what's
going on in the game? Almost all visuals in video

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.020
games are somewhat related to info-graphics
because they're conveying information

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.119
you need to be able to play. Some of it's window-dressing but it all has to be harmonious and it can't compete or

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:37.810
take away too much attention or interfere
with what's happening at the systemic level.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.379
And in the independent game design space we
don't need an army of content creation but

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:49.279
would have to basically implement that
vision.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:53.449
Indies are extremely interested in advancing our emotional engagement with

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.449
games and they have the freedom to try
to do that outside of what get's funded in the commercial 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.399
sphere.

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:02.319
Interactivity adds a third dimension to
storytelling. You actually get to be part of

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.829
the story. Your actions determine what
happens and you're able to experience a greater

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:08.780
emotional and personal impact, I think,

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.220
then you would by observing or viewing a passive story in which you're not participating.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.179
One of our primary ways of interacting with a
game is by exploring.

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:20.329
So the story can be on the walls, the story
can be in the environment, you can see a

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:23.999
place that's ruined, for example, and that
prompts the player to wonder how that

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:25.169
place came to be.

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.219
And the decisions that indie games ask
players to make on a moment to moment basis

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.509
can create some interesting themes. For
example, there are games that are very

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.399
violent that ask you to question violence.
We have games about the impact of choice. You know,

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:38.180
what do you do when you can

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.629
take one path or the other? Do you arm yourself or do you help someone else? But games

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:45.689
where there are memorable relationships
between the protagonist and other characters

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:50.520
are some of the ones that remain, I think, most relevant to the canon of the world of gaming. One of

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.120
the most oft cited examples in the indie space
is this game called Passage.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.890
You start on one side and walk to the other
and then you die. But along the way, as you're

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.090
playing Passage, you meet a woman ages alongside you. It's really the capsule of what means

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.660
something in someone's life.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.610
People are trying to find ways to make
those relationships feel more real, to

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.489
make those interactions feel better
understood.

00:06:10.489 --> 00:06:14.069
Storytelling in games is still such a new frontier. I think we're all very eager to

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:15.150
see what people with

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.110
the freedom to experiment will develop

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.810
and when unique things happen,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.429
it's going to be the indie space that produces them.

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:26.250
Indie video games are really important to you

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.649
the evolution of games

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:32.119
because indie games have the opportunity to take risks. Because they're designed by

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:32.710
people

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.340
who have a drive to express something really
specific as opposed to

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.979
a drive to make money. They try to push
the envelope of the medium and

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.449
provide new experiences that we haven't seen
before.

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.979
So that means new art styles, new mechanics, new methods of storytelling. We play, humans play.

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:49.340
It's always gonna be with us, it's not going
away.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.770
And indie videogames contribute in a much more personal way, and they're much more focused,

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.300
they're much more emotional. They speak to you.
