00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480
today we have treats from Australia

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.230
it's here this yes I hear this stuff
tastes like I heard it tastes terrible

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.390
for those who don't like it but on the
other hand Australians love it

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.380
wait to the end of the video to catch my
reaction to that stuff

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.490
first item on these meant slice cookies

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.030
it looks like it's just like a cookie
and then have a cream filling inside

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.010
no wonder that's what has a mint flavor
in it and it has a chocolate coating so

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.670
pretty basic could be 25 blue nice mint
smell

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.100
I don't smell the chocolate here we go
that's really good i'm sure the mint is

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.670
coming from that white cream filling in
there or the chocolate cookie chocolate

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.500
cookie maybe a mint cookie

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.720
so I would give these guys 3 video

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.590
okay so check things out I'm not sure
what they are

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.720
I don't think it's licorice I think it's
just like a like a gummy kind of fruit

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.620
cute

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:16.500
what are you doing in Australia nice
apricot smell their little cubes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.490
yeah it has like sugar I think it's
sugar can be solved

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.740
it's a sugar-coated like sprinkled all
around the outside of it and i are there

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.250
a little bit part so they're not like a
gummy jelly fruit candy

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.240
so I would give these guys three Vivian
has more cookies

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.840
these are just like a cookie and on the
bottom of the cookie it looks like he

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.660
just has like chocolate milk chocolate
at the bottom

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.940
ok so let's see wow I can smell the
biscuit and the topper usually the

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.820
chocolate overpowers and you know
they're there because there's two here

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.600
see how they have the chocolate on the
bottom and then you can break these in

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.920
half then you have to look too good

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.640
oh I didn't expect them to be that good
you guys so the cookie on top

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.989
it's like a shortbread cookie and then
the chocolate at the bottom is just like

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.430
the icing on the cake

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.420
it's really really good cookie is
excellent so I'm going to get these guys

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.240
five billion

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.580
here's your drink says a passion fruit
drink is not an alcoholic

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.280
look at the cloudiness e you get rid of
it by you know what

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.140
shaking it only God we're going to do
this while I borrow some times that of

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.310
an option sometimes it's hard to find
these things so i just have to buy what

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.030
I can find

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.060
I think it's ready to explode so let's
open it

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.350
okay this is just a twist top i don't
have to use my we don't need this guy

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.520
today

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.880
the twist top my favorite wow wow

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.990
oh I haven't smoked that passion fruit
flavor in a long time

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.300
oh it's so so good so good here's my cup
again

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.849
guys beautiful color

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:20.379
the smell is dead on I hope this is like
it says it only contains three point

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:28.090
five percent passion fruit juice water
it so good guys

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.959
the passion for flavor is right on the
line even though it's not but

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.209
three-point-five percent juice

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.640
it is feel just like you're having
passion fruit juice and it has the

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.640
carbonation in there which just takes it
to another level

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.470
excellent so i would give this guy five
million heads

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.989
ok so I saw this at the store and I just
had to pick it up

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.470
