00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.880
Another working day starts.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.160
But are you getting what is required

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.920
in terms of operational
and commercial efficiency?

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.400
Perhaps a closer look
at the new robust and flexible Volvo FE

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.360
can help you make up your mind.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.640
The truck comes
with a stunning new look

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.840
that reflects
classic Volvo design heritage.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.160
Another major update
is that the Volvo FE

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.480
now is available with our acclaimed
I-Shift transmission system.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.120
For the driver,
this means a more comfortable,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.160
less demanding working shift,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.400
and for the operator,
better fuel economy.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.600
A completely new
Euro 6 compatible engine program

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.520
ensures the right kind of power
is always available.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.200
While a stable, robust chassis

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.720
means that the truck
can access more places

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.360
more easily and more efficiently.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.000
So from city street to suburban lane
or even lighter off-road situations,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.520
the new Volvo FE won't let you down.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.280
A carefully designed cab
makes the new Volvo FE ideal

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.720
for comfortable, intuitive operation
and multiple entries and exits.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.080
And this is a truck
that shows equal consideration

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.680
to pedestrians and other road users.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.320
From regional haulage
to light construction,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.360
utilities and refrigerated transport,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.520
all these features
enable the new Volvo FE

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.000
to meet a wider range of challenges,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.960
good news for you,
great news for your business.
