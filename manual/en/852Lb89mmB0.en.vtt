00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.600
In the beginning, I remember that God made man

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.600
crafted in his image, with his own hands

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.600
then out of mans rib, came the woman

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.600
the creatures we love, like or don’t understand

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.600
but its amazing, I see God's beauty through her physical

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600
design plus her mind combined defines miracle

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.600
and I’m not convinced that a mineral or bang from the sky can derive such individuals

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
and as the world turns, I wonder with concern

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.600
the time we'll meet and complete each other words

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600
I’m kidding, but who says fantasies forbidden

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600
see I’m the type of cat, that express myself from within

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.400
driven, to promote love in every essence

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.600
living by this mission its hard to miss the blessings

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.600
caressing the mic like a newlywed wife

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600
ink flows from my pen in hopes to truly shed light

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.470
upon this situation that I’m faced with

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.300
one that takes patience to build on foundation

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.600
that we both share now that’s stimulation

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600
anything less don’t impress know what I’m sayin?

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.600
I look into the mirror and everyday it gets clear

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.600
I gotta steer from the places I’ve veered

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.600
I said I look into the mirror and everyday it gets clear

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.600
I gotta steer...

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.600
Cause I’ve been lookin for love lookin for love yall

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
In all the wrong places

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:45.600
lookin for love lookin for love yall in all the wrong places

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.600
And in the summer, heat waves rise from the street pave

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
warm nights mixed drinks dope DJs

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.600
females super fly, showing mad thigh

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
thoughts of lust rush guys don't ask why

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600
is it her presence or feminine vibe?

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.600
when her body rebels against a vertical line?

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.600
that got guys lying for personal time

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.600
and once they get their catch, they back on the grind

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.600
and I'm just kicking my feet up like Bruce Lee

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.600
reclined, when this dime approaches within few feet

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.600
style, not unique, but def got the beauty

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600
so who cares when this cutie now pursues me

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.600
and with charm I’m on her arm like Coachbag

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.600
one of the few effortless things life threw back

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.600
then like annoyed smokers we found no match

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.600
and fell apart, without knowing romance

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.600
but what I found, proved to be more special

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.600
a lesson from experience, a jewel for the mental

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.600
shining from my notepad with rhymes signed in pencil

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.600
outlining my finding using life as a stencil

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.600
and for this I feel mad fortunate

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.600
for real, I’m done with that short term fix

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600
and I ask can I be fortunate?

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.600
to know that I’m done with this

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.600
Cause I’ve been lookin for love lookin for love yall

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.600
In all the wrong places

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:10.600
lookin for love lookin for love yall in all the wrong places

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.600
Cause I’ve been lookin for love lookin for love yall

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.600
In all the wrong places

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:53.600
lookin for love lookin for love yall in all the wrong places

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.600
And now I ponder, about the times that we might have

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.600
caressing questions that sing from my mic stand

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.600
like damn whats these feelings I’m revealing

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.600
like if I’d tell tha fellas I’d get smacked in my melon

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.600
but its unique love only women can provide

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.600
I seent it in my moms, I seent it in her eyes

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.600
I seent it in these guys when proposing to their brides

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.600
down on bended knee with diamonds shining near her thighs

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.600
it makes me visualize, the way that we'd get down

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.600
I’d take the lead, and no doubt you'd wear the crown

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.600
the one I’d serve, cause she feels my vibe

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.600
supports my wings, till the day that we fly

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.600
and I know that right now, that we’d grow despite how

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.600
the world is on our shoulders trying to control our lifestyles

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.600
we wont get wiped out, if on the right route

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.780
soon we'll reunite and then I’ll recite out...

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.600
since the beginning of man our separation is fact

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.600
I said you came from mans rib now I’m taking it back

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.600
I said you came from mans rib and now I’m taking it back

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.780
I said you came from mans rib so join me as...

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:24.600
we find love, we’ll find love girl in all the right places...
