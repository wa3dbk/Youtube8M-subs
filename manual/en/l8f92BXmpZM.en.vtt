00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.099
That this is something I did not want to miss,
and I was not disappointed.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.590
Please remember, form follows performance.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.000
So, you have to change your performance if
you want to change your form.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.540
But before you do that you have to change
your thoughts.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.920
Before you can change your body, you have
to change your thoughts.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.649
Because every object that you see around us,
at first it was somebody’s idea, and then

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:39.649
it materialized.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.340
The same thing with your body.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.720
You have to start thinking different ideas.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.820
One of the best ways to do it, is to read
books, because you have to get a new perspective

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.280
on familiar things.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.220
Tonya Zavasta’s book is what changed my
life.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.280
Every joint in my body hurt, and I knew that
there was probably a correlation with what

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.280
I was eating.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.309
I have three books.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.630
The first book Your Right to Be Beautiful,
and you already understand I do not talk about

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.030
superficial beauty.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.250
It will explain to you, it will give you every
reason why to go raw.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.500
There are chapters about meat, dairy, sugar,
salt, any imaginable question that you might

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.130
have as a beginner is answered in that book.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.290
Also, there are times when we need to defend
our diet, am I correct?

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.200
It’s sad but it’s the reality.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.930
And there’s nothing negative you can tell
me, that I do not have a good snappy answer

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.930
for.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.710
I’ve heard it all.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.140
And I always dress up naked truth for you.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.030
Because people do not like naked truth.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.210
They want it given to them in a story.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.780
So with humor, with a story, with a tale I
dress up all this truth for you so you will

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.580
be ready to retaliate when time calls for
that.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.390
And I give some beauty tips.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:15.260
I give you my word, I will never tell you
to use Preparation H to remove your eye bags.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.850
But do you know this is what mainstream magazines
do?

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.690
And they call it the model’s best kept secret.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.870
I wish they kept it.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.260
All my beauty tips will complement your healthy
lifestyle.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.930
Because I believe that health and beauty are
two connected vessels.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.850
You rob one, you steal from the other.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:53.560
So I will give you tips how to eliminate your
crows’ feet, how to avoid wrinkles in the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.430
future and how to deal with them in the meantime
and what else can be done to improve outside

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.810
appearance.
