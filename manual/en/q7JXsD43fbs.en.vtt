00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.160
Item #: SCP-666-J

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.269
Object Class: Euclid

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.230
Special Containment Procedures: D-Class and
Gerald are the only ones allowed to get on

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.070
any vehicle that Dr. Gerald happens to be
driving.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.880
Prepare a number of body bags equivalent to
the number of passengers on any vehicle that

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.789
he happens to drive, minus himself.

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.720
Additionally, medical teams must be on standby
if Dr. Gerald will be traveling through a

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.600
populated area, or any form of potentially
hazardous environment (e.g., a nuclear power

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.140
plant, chemical refining plant).

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.519
Description: All individuals who board any
vehicle or form of transportation that Dr.

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.970
Gerald himself is controlling in any form
are assured to die.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.160
Testing has shown that even those who escape
vehicles he's been driving are doomed; they

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.040
are generally struck by another moving vehicle
within minutes.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.950
Dr. Gerald himself, oddly enough, always survives
whatever horrors he puts a vehicle through.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.860
Additionally, all potentially hazardous objects
seem to become even more dangerous if he is

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.250
manning a vehicle in their general vicinity.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.689
Knives penetrate more than their sharpness
would accord, normally benign oil tankers

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.400
become moving bombs that will detonate with
the slightest touch, buildings lose any significant

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.390
rigidity, and pedestrians seem to lose all
forms of self-preservation, throwing themselves

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.910
into his path.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.970
A mere bicycle ride can inflict the devastation
of a T3 tornado.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.790
Addendum 666-1: Dr. Gerald is never to come
within 25 meters of SCP-462.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:02:34.200
Addendum 666-2: Plans are being made to construct
a vehicle which can contain SCP-682 long enough

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:59.749
for Dr. Gerald to actually drive it.
