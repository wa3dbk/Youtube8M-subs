DADDY CLAY: Welcome back to the Lab, this
week on DadLabs is brought to you by Boon

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.100
-- innovations for modern parents.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.750
DADDY BRAD: You know, Daddy Clay, when it
comes to the disgusting side of parenting,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.470
dirty diapers get all the ink.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.300
DADDY CLAY: It’s true. Poopy diapers, throwing
up, snot, that’s gross, but what nobody

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.801
is brave enough to talk about...

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:21.880
DADDY BRAD: Except DadLabs.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:33.180
DADDY CLAY: Except DadLabs, is just how nasty
it is to give your small children...food.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:46.420
DADDY BRAD: See, they fool you at first, about
the food thing, because of breastfeeding.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.250
It’s so natural and beautiful. Really healthy
for the baby. And very few spills. And Dad

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.420
can’t do it. Perfect.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.350
DADDY CLAY: And at about four months, when
you start the baby on cereal, it’s still

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:13.539
so cute and neat, even when you add in some
pureed fruit at six months still cute. Then

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:24.539
at about seven to eight months the child grows
a pair of claws. This action. And everything

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.999
changes. Sure, they can pick up those cute
little rice puffs and eat those, but also

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:31.299
carpet fuzz, and snails, loose change and
bottle caps.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:44.729
DADDY BRAD: Then comes the phase where they
want to 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.259
wrestle you for the spoon. They see that thing
with the food coming so they grab it. Then

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.569
it’s not covered in food anymore, and not
they’re pissed. But if you take the spoon

00:01:53.569 --> 00:02:00.969
back, they’re double pissed. My strategy
was to just keep that spoon moving, never

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.649
slow down, if the food doesn’t exactly get
in the mouth, no big deal. But if you drop

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.450
some on the tray, time to fingerpaint. That’s
when it starts to get sloppy.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:22.100
DADDY CLAY: By sixteen months, the child is
eating big boy food and feeding himself. But

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:31.470
he may have developed some bad habits. If
you child has begun to drop food on the floor

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:39.360
or otherwise fling it you may want to spread
out a shower curtain underneath the chair.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.980
If the child misbehaves in this way it’s
best not to react in any way as this reaction

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:55.690
may reinforce the behavior. Encourage the
child to use utensils # as this makes the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:08.530
food harder to fling. Patience is key.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:31.599
DADDY BRAD: The there is the question of when
to move the kid from the high chair to the

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.774
family table. And the answer is, how soon
do you want to replace your rug? We kept the

00:03:35.774 --> 00:03:41.670
kids in highchairs as long as possible -- three
to three and a half -- and you negotiating

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.549
power here because you have the food.

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:54.450
DADDY CLAY: When they seemed to keep most
of the food on the plate, and really wanted

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:02.800
to come eat with us, we made a big deal of
it. So feeding is gross. And like lots of

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.249
other gross things in parenting, if you miss
one minute of it you will be sorry, because

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:11.159
disgusting as it is, it’s the best.

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.650
DADDY BRAD: So get in there and do your half
-- after the breast feeding, anyway. You’ll

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.479
never regret one minute you spent feeding
your kid, no matter the splatter.

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:25.280
DADDY CLAY: If you have a hilarious feeding
nightmare or tip, drop us a comment and you’ll

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.670
automatically be registered for this week’s
drawing, a super cool Boon Flair highchair.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:41.250
DADDY BRAD: That’s all for us here in the
Lab -- special thanks to our sponsor, Boon

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:59.400

and life...Dude, you smell funny.
