[MUSIC]

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.100
Awake my children

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.270
Our day is nigh. We have waited long enough,
crawling beneath the world.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:36.600
Rise, and meet your destiny. Sing your song!
EMERGE!”

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.840
They may look weird and scary, crawling out
of the ground with their red, beady eyes,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.559
but this is no zombie plague. It’s the rise
of the periodical cicadas.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.900
Cicadas are nothing to be afraid of. They’re
not locusts, they’re not gonna wipe out

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.909
your crops or eat your baby. Cicada mouthparts
are more like straws than jaws, specially

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:03.049
adapted for sucking up plant juices, and that’s
exactly what they’ve been doing, underground,

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:04.860
for more than a decade.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.110
Some cicada species show up every year, giving
a buzz to summer afternoons, but a genus known

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.400
as Magicicada, or the periodical cicadas,
is special. Magicicada have the longest confirmed

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.790
life cycle of any insect, only emerging every
13 or 17 years. You might notice something

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.590
special about those numbers. They’re primes.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.520
The U.S. is home to 15 of these geographically
distinct populations, or broods. 12 are on

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.680
a 17 year cycle, and 3 follow a 13 year cycle.
There’s usually several species in a brood,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.600
but in any one place they’ll all emerge
on the same schedule, which is what’s going on

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.160
this year in the midwestern United States.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.680
[CICADA NOISE]

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.630
Wow, we have some periodical cicadas watching
you’re probably feeling kind of out of the loop.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.410
So, let's see.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.630
When you were last awake, we were playing Golden Eye,

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.850
throwing away all those AOL trial
CDs, and preparing for the certain

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.580
and that year 2000 computer bug was a thing.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.100
Computer bug, get it? [CICADA NOISE]

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.840
Anyway, so since then, we built that international space
station thing

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.629
all movies are about superheroes, oh and invented the Smart Phones... pretty much so we can watch

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.339
YouTube videos about cicadas in the  bathroom.

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:15.199
[CICADANOISE]

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.480
Don't worry, not everything has changed. Our presidential candidates are still

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.260
named Bush, Clinton and

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.580
we're all really excited about the next Star Wars trilogy. Another one.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.760
[CICADA NOISE]

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.769
How was the last one? Don't
ask.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.240
No one is precisely sure how our cicada friends
know it’s time to rise, but in the late

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.610
spring on their scheduled year, when the soil
temperature hits 64 degrees fahrenheit, juvenile cicadas

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.850
emerge from the ground, climb upward into
the trees, and achieve their final form. There,

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.910
the males will spend a couple weeks singing
their deafening love song.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:47.850
[CICADA NOISE]

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.500
Now this synchronized emergence is part of cicadas’
survival strategy. They come out in force,

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.349
millions per square mile in some areas. Pretty
much everything eats cicadas–birds, possums,

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:05.140
squirrels, reptiles, even dogs and people,
it’s a feeding frenzy, crunchy death on

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.319
a massive scale. But hungry predators can
only make a tiny dent in the population by

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.680
the time they’ve eaten their fill, and since
every female can lay hundreds of eggs at a

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.790
time, the cicadas persist.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.459
We see this strategy of predator satiation
throughout nature, huge herds of wildebeest,

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.690
salmon swimming up river, even plants do it
by producing all their fruit at once.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:34.160
But why prime numbers? Why not 4 or 8 or 14-year
cycles? This is where it gets interesting.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.920
Predator populations also move in cycles,
depending on how much food and competition

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.120
is around, and that cycle will often shift
to fit the pattern of their prey.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Now if cicadas had settled on, say, a 12 year
pattern, then any predator with a 2, 3, 4,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.110
or 6 year cycle could also adapt to depend
on the feast.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.970
But by emerging every 17 years, cicadas minimize
these deadly coincidences. A predator whose

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.690
population cycles every 5 years would only
align with the cicadas every 85 years!

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.940
2015 is a special year for periodical cicadas,
because a 13 year brood and 17 year brood

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.750
are both emerging at the same time. These
cicadas also use prime numbers to protect

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.629
themselves from one another.

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:21.000
We know there’s something in the cicadas’
genes that keeps each brood on its 13 or 17

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.500
year cycle. Broods are usually geographically
separated, but if they happen to overlap and

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.120
swap genes, it could throw off the whole synchronized
cycle of each group. So the cicadas use their

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.460
prime number patterns to minimize that chance,
only showing up to the same party every 221

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.270
years. The broods emerging this year won’t
sing simultaneously again until 2236!

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.800
The big question is how did they come to calculate
prime numbers? How do cicadas know how to

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.879
do math? Well… they don’t.

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.360
Stephen Jay Gould once compared evolution’s
strategy of synchronized satiation to Adam

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.659
Smith’s invisible hand in economics.
Each cicada aims to help itself, to pass on

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:05.029
its genes to the next generation. No individual
makes a choice to fall in with the group,

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:11.849
but any who don’t follow the cycle and emerge
alone, well they're easy prey, and, sorry, no reproduction

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:12.680
for you!

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.199
In the end, this accidental cooperation, based
on individual choices, ends up helping the

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.509
population as a whole. As Gould wrote,

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:26.089
“It is sometimes advantageous to put all
your eggs in one basket, but be sure to make

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:28.849
enough of them, and don’t do it too often.”

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Stay curious.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.920
Now, even with their prime number strategy

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.920
that doesn't mean cicadas are immune from all threats.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.620

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.980
who's mastered their mathematics, head over to Gross Science
