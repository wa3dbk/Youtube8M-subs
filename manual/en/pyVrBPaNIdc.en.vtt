00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.080
Hi and welcome back to my Food Fest series.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.080
I am Johnny.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.999
Today's episode I am going to show you how
to make a crackin sausage sandwich.

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:08.599
[Music]

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:18.380
First up what I am going to do is I am going
to get the sausages cooking.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.380
Okay?

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.330
So, just above standard package of sausages.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.660
A bit of oil in the pan.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.630
I got this on the medium heat because we are
going to be cooking everything out and I do

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.929
not want the sausages to burn or overcook
straight away.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:33.650
So, all of them in.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.410
Just a little tip on the sausages, put them
on like a clock.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.660
So, then now I know that's the one I first
put down.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.830
So, I can change them and their I know their
always going to be cooked well.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.830
Okay?

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.300
So, I got my sausages cooking and I am going
to crack on with some crispy onions.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:01:01.190
Tuck and tail, make a little incision there
and you can hear your sausages frying, so

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.120
just take a quick look if they need turning.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.799
Look at them now.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.490
Make sure you have got a steady hand for this
okay?

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.100
Sharp red knife, however big you want them
and just straight down, okay?

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.530
And again, slowly.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.329
Now, gently sprinkle them over with a good
coating, a good coating.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.720
Do not worry you are not going to use all
the flour.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.940
Do not worry.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.990
Salt and pepper.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.920
Get a bit of seasoning in there early on.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.210
Again, you can hear your sausages.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.560
Just give them a quick look.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.479
Give these a mix.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.700
Be really delicate like fairy fingers.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.899
Give them a toss.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.819
Oils hot and then just drop them in.

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:55.350
Make sure, quick little tip, that you lay
away, to avoid the splash backs.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.350
Okay?

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.749
Oils hot, lay away.

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:02.389
These onions are going to be done really,
really, really fast.

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.859
I did tell you how quick and easy they were.

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.100
So, get your fork, all out.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.940
Essential, quickly, a bit of seasoning.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.490
Give them a toss.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.810
Now, leave them to one side.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.810
Okay?

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.810
Just leave them.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.260
Let them crispen up and let them do their
business.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.870
Now, we are going to crack on with the bread.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.780
Knife in, gently does it.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.920
Make sure your hands away.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.310
The most important thing is when you are griddling
something is to never put oil on the pan.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.420
Always put oil on the food because if you
put it on that pan which has been hot and

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.330
sizzling for ages, you are going to have a
fire.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.330
Okay?

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.720
So, oil on top.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.680
At an angle give it a quick push.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.280
This is not going to take long.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.950
That is done.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.950
Them two are done.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.350
Again, move to one side.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.350
Let them crispen up.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.760
I am going to crack on with the filling.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.390
So, I am going to do some mustard, mayo, a
little bit of lettuce, a little bit of tomatoes,

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.910
a little bit of whole grain, two teaspoons.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.050
So, a little bit of mayo.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.910
This to me, this is my perfect sausage sandwich.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.900
A little bit of mid-morning snacks, but you
know let me know.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.340
Write in the comment box and let me know what
your favorite is.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.820
Touch of seasoning.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.120
Touch of salt.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.120
A little mix.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.340
So, now we're going to look at starting to
finishing off the dish.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.760
Sausage is nearly cooked.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.230
Bread is done.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.920
I am going to do this.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.140
Put little lovely dollops of it on.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.140
Give that a spread.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.480
Now it is time to fill our sandwich.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.200

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.240
Yeah.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.240
Position on the base.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.010
We are going to build from the bottom.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.380
The best thing about this dish is that you
can use anything.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.400
I mean all I had in the fridge was tomatoes
and lettuce.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.440
I mean you can go peppers, onions,I mean we
are going onions, but I mean you can red onions,raw

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.440
onions.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.590
Anything you can put sun-dried tomatoes on
there, maybe a little bit of fennel would

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.590
be nice.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.590
Anything.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.590
Sandwich is ready.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.420
Move it over, layer it on.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.600
How good does that look?

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.900
How appetizing does that look?

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.849
No one is going to turn that away when they're
hungry really.Crispy onions layer that on

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:23.849
top.

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:32.460
Bun on top, give it a press.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.919
So, that is it people.

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.719
That is my mega sandwich.

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:36.940
It does not just feed one.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.560
That could feed easily four.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.969
Hope to see you back next time.

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.899
I hope you enjoy the recipe.
