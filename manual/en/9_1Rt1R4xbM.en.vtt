MARK RUFFALO: Hello, I'm Mark.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.610
MURRAY: And I'm Murray.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.610
MARK RUFFALO: And we're
here to tell you

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.400
about the word empathy.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.700
MURRAY: Empathy.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.915
Yes, empathy.

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:08.598
MARK RUFFALO: Tell them about
the word empathy.

00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:09.882
MURRAY: Um.

00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:10.740
Oh.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.960
MARK RUFFALO: What's wrong?

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.020
MURRAY: Well, you're not going
to believe this, Mark.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.410
MARK RUFFALO: What?

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.320
MURRAY: But I can't remember
what empathy means.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.660
MARK RUFFALO: No.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.660
That's OK.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.160
That's OK.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.510
I'll tell them what
empathy means.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.140
MURRAY: Oh boy.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.960
This is so exciting.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.910
Mark Ruffalo is going to
tell us about empathy.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.341
Oh boy, oh boy, oh
boy, oh boy.

00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:30.600
[GIGGLING].

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.510
MARK RUFFALO: Can I do it?

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.900
MURRAY: Please.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.830
Go for it, Mark.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.620
MARK RUFFALO: All right.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.060
Empathy is when you're able to
understand and care about how

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.930
someone else is feeling.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:39.884
MURRAY: Oh.

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:40.838
Right.

00:00:40.838 --> 00:00:43.223
That's what empathy is.

00:00:43.223 --> 00:00:43.700
MARK RUFFALO: Yes.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.350
Yes.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.660
MURRAY: I don't get it.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.050
MARK RUFFALO: What?

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.810
MURRAY: Hm.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.300
Sorry.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.560
MARK RUFFALO: OK.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.210
OK.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.500
Let me see if I can explain
it to you in some way.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.680
MURRAY: OK.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.080
I'm going to listen.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.590
MARK RUFFALO: Let's say I'm
walking along, and oh, ow.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.870
MURRAY: What?

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.770
MARK RUFFALO: I stubbed
my toe.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.100
Ahh.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.870
That hurts.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.230
MURRAY: Oh, you poor thing.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.750
MARK RUFFALO: Murray.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.692
Murray.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:00.634
MURRAY: That hurts.

00:01:00.634 --> 00:01:01.105
MARK RUFFALO: It
hurts so much.

00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:02.518
MURRAY: I can imagine exactly
how you feel.

00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:03.560
MARK RUFFALO: That's it!

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.985
MURRAY: What?

00:01:03.985 --> 00:01:04.410
What?

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.780
What's it?

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.570
MARK RUFFALO: That's it.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.100
That's empathy.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.870
MURRAY: What's empathy?

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.100
MARK RUFFALO: You could imagine
exactly how I feel.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.280
You could understand
just how it felt.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.450
That's empathy.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.460
MURRAY: I still don't get it.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.100
MARK RUFFALO: What?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.320
MURRAY: I still don't get it.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.713
MARK RUFFALO: OK.

00:01:17.713 --> 00:01:19.380
OK.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.530
Let's think of another way.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.810
MURRAY: OK.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.990
Let's think of another way.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.460
MARK RUFFALO: Um.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.682
MURRAY: Thinking.

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:25.460
MARK RUFFALO: Oh, Murray.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.310
MURRAY: What?

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.910
Did I tell you about that
time when I lost my

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.359
favorite teddy bear?

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:32.810
MURRAY: Oh no.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.136
MARK RUFFALO: It was--

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:35.790
MURRAY: This is very sad.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.320
Did you love that teddy bear?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.970
MARK RUFFALO: I loved
that teddy bear.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.102
MURRAY: I can imagine exactly
how you feel.

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.350
It's a really sad feeling.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.786
It makes me want to
cry like this.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.022
MARK RUFFALO: It was sad.

00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:52.230
It was so sad.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.356
But you know what?

00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:54.322
MURRAY: What?

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:55.970
MARK RUFFALO: You know
what empathy is.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.040
MURRAY: I do?

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.200
MARK RUFFALO: That
was empathy.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.760
MURRAY: What?

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.180
MARK RUFFALO: You could
understand how I was feeling,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.740
exactly how I was feeling,
and understood it.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.015
That's empathy.

00:02:05.015 --> 00:02:07.102
MURRAY: I get it now.

00:02:07.102 --> 00:02:08.010
Yes.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.918
Yes, I get it.

00:02:08.918 --> 00:02:09.372
MARK RUFFALO: Yes.

00:02:09.372 --> 00:02:09.830
Yes.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.850
MURRAY: I understand empathy.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.020
MARK RUFFALO: You understand
empathy.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.390
MURRAY: I'm so happy
right now.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.465
MARK RUFFALO: I'm happy too.

00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:16.410
MURRAY: It makes me want to
dance the dance of happiness.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.477
MARK RUFFALO: I can imagine
exactly how you feel.

00:02:18.477 --> 00:02:20.830
I want to dance the dance
of happiness too.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.140
MURRAY: Then what are
we waiting for?

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.390
BOTH: Let's do it.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.840
Empathy!
