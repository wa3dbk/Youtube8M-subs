00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:11.079
The Full Moon of The Guru is the most important 
time for everyone who seeks enlightenment.

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:23.330
Enlightenment is the Ultimate Goal of Life.
We have been given this body in order to experience

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:33.860
consciousness. Without the body, there won’t
be any consciousness. That’s why, in evolution

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:44.640
itself, the body has been given by God, to
evolve ourselves through the body.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:57.859
So the body is a precious gift from God. You
can feel every different organ, and it will

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:13.390
process consciousness, ultimately to realize
that how we just created this flesh, how we

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:24.060
collapsed the waves into particles.
And that’s modern quantum physics through

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:36.560
our own decision, our own decision being here,
creating this matter. Any material reality,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:50.640
for that matter, is our own creation. Everything
happens because you collapse through observation,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:02:02.430
the waves into particles. You create time,
you create space; and I will explain this

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:17.540
to you through appropriate meditation practices
during the Guru Purnima Program in Mt. Shasta.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:28.500
It is a matter of understanding the body,
understanding consciousness, understanding

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:42.299
creation. That’s what life is about.
If life is lived in unconsciousness, in partying

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:56.810
with the other external reality as being important,
we are not going anywhere. We have to detach

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:16.489
ourselves from the horrible communion with
the unconscious group of human beings and

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:28.200
be in Satsang.
Satsang is the communion with The Guru who

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:45.650
represents the Truth. So it will be a Satsang.
What I will teach is not theory. It’s not

00:03:45.650 --> 00:04:02.099
simply practice either. It is transmission.
It is sharing my consciousness with you, my

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:17.400
awakening with you, so that you will not become
a prey to unconsciousness and death.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:29.130
I said that I’m going to talk about the
Now-ization of the Mind, of the Body and of

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:46.420
relationships. You won’t be able to know
or experience the Now until the mind dies.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:05:01.820
The Now is a non-mind experience, a non-space
experience and a non-time experience. It’s

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:20.230
often given to you.
And for those of you who want to feel my consciousness

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:34.840
in a more intimate way, I have structured
a Premier Program. I will give three (3) Sessions

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:51.670
and impart wisdom that will guide you for
the rest of your life, not that what I am

00:05:51.670 --> 00:06:01.790
going to give you will be the Ultimate. You
know my definition of ultimate is it is only

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:12.940
ultimate for the time I am giving now. So,
it is a process that you will go on doing

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:23.610
it on a regular basis and forever, until the
body turns into Light. For the Premier Program,

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:37.430
I’ll teach you how not to allow the body
to die by remaining alert and not allowing

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:51.190
the mind to become goofy, because if you are
not alert, the mind will become goofy.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:07:04.690
Mount Shasta is a great place. It is pulling
me again to come, and embrace the energy there.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:18.020
I want to extend a personal invitation for
all of the seekers to take this opportunity.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:26.080
Astrologically, this Full Moon is a very,
very special Full Moon because of the energy

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:36.340
that it brings in from space. God Bless.
