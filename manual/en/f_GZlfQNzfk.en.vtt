00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:13.034
hello

00:00:13.034 --> 00:00:15.092
This is one more video from E ai ta Servido

00:00:15.092 --> 00:00:19.007
Today i'll going to teach you an easy and tasty recipe

00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:21.092
It's a peanut candy

00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:23.087
and for that we gonna need:

00:00:23.087 --> 00:00:29.075
2 cups of peanuts (roasted, peeled and salty)

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:33.079
1 cup of corn bran (Pre-cooked)

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.054
1 cup of white sugar

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.085
I'll going beat all this in multiprocessor

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:43.076
if you don't have a multiprocessor you can do it in blender

00:00:47.044 --> 00:00:49.042
well, once triturated

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:51.044
i'll  mix by hand

00:00:51.044 --> 00:00:55.072
why? because the heat of the hand

00:00:55.072 --> 00:00:59.000
will release the peanut oil.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.049
and will add better

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:04.043
Like this

00:01:12.093 --> 00:01:17.055
done that, we will shape it

00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:20.050
you can give the shape that you want

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.058
but i did what, I cut a piece of plastic pipe

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:29.065
and I will give shape with the pipe.

00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:36.096
You put it here, squeezes.

00:01:37.058 --> 00:01:39.098
cleans

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:47.083
and thereby loosens

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:52.057
Our peanut candy is ready.

00:01:52.057 --> 00:02:00.094
As you can see I did some examples and here the amount that's left.

00:02:00.094 --> 00:02:02.067
Easy right?

00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:07.079
