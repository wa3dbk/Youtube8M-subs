00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.070
What's up guy and girl players of World of
Warcraft. This is Ryutarou aka Tarou and in

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.920
this video I'll be showing an unreleased video
from Wrath. For the free complete guide, and

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.800
many others, go to tarouwowguides.com

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.220
In this video, I'll be giving a glimpse of
what I did to reach the gold cap twice in

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.689
Wrath in one month, on one character, with
only using Auction House smarts, Alchemy,

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.949
and Jewelcrafting. This video is inside look
of what I did back in Wrath and it's being

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.239
released for all the 100's of people who asked
for it. Enjoy everyone.

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.980
During the entire video I'll be emptying 3,243
mails which I amassed in one month last September.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.020
Due to the insane amount of sold items the
entire mail looting process took around 1

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.640
and a 1/2 hours. Yeah, I know, retardedly
long right. Even with using an addon like

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.760
Postal, the server can only process 50 mails
every minute which is why you'll see it constantly

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.300
refreshing. If your computer is fast enough,
you can use /reload ui to get a new set of

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.660
mails. Most people hope their classes is buffed
or new abilities are added each patch, I cross

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.330
my fingers they'll update it to 100 or more
mails at a time. Someday Tarou, someday.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.770
Everything in this video was taught in the
tons of different gold making guides I had

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.910
for Wrath. Naturally, I'll be doing the same
in Cataclysm so be sure to subscribe and visit

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.170
my website or you'll miss out on it.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.830
So what did I sell anyway right. That's what
I'm sure most of you want to know. Well, a

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.460
lot of it was simple things you make with
professions. Gems from Jewelcrafting, Flasks

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.490
from Alchemy and them some combos of both
by transmuting metas and then cutting them.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.470
I even made stuff from other professions like
Blacksmithing and Leatherworking. I just bought

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.191
the mats, asked in trade who could make what
I wanted, tipped them and sold the item on

00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:53.780
the Auction House for some nice profit. I
even dabbled in some rep items when Zul'Gurub

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:03.170
was being removed.
Sometimes I even sold mats I had bought a

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.810
few days prior or from farmers. That's why
you may see me looting gold from Lichbloom.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.560
I didn't farm it, I bought it for cheap and
realized it was more profitable to resell

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.530
it instead of making it into flask. Basically,
I was very versatile, adapted to different

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.370
economic changes, and looked for profit in
anything everyday between raids. I could spend

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.970
1-2 hours on the Auction House and crafting
items that would rake in a lot of dough everyday.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.340
Sometimes though markets weren't ideal and
I'd break even or in rare cases, lose gold.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.060
No big deal though I just learned my lesson
from it and moved on to something else. It

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.840
didn't mean I totally disregarded that way
of making gold though as sometimes things

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.650
were just temporary. Maybe someone decided
they were going to ruin a market for a few

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.310
days. After that, things return to normal
so always make sure you're watching everything

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.070
and you'll come out ahead everyday. Same goes
for IRL as well.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.180
I don't think I've ever shown this but this
is what my 'Wealth' screen looked like back

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.560
when I did this video. This is for all-time
since this pane was put in game. I posted

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:18.270
more than 162,000 auctions, bought over 39,000,
most expensive auction sold was over 33,000

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.569
and that was the lowbie Spectral Tiger that
I had bought for 17,000 gold. It's funny cause

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.599
now that mount is worth 150k on my server
since its mount speed changes with the player

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.569
now instead of the mount. Well, all mounts
for that matter. My Wealth pane also shows

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.620
the most gold ever owned as 214,748g 36s 46c
which was the old gold cap and while you'll

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.040
see me put my gold in the guild bank since
I couldn't hold it all at the time. These

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.410
stats are really buggy though and you can
tell that by look at the top, 'Gold earned

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:59.069
from auctions'. It says 5,060 but you just
watched me loot over 400,000. What happens

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.210
is the system lapses over at the gold cap
of 214k, goes negative and then loops back

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.680
around. This isn't fixed in Cataclysm so it
still does the same.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:16.060
Alright, so after an insane hour and 15 minutes
or so looting 3,243 mails, I ended up with

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:24.449
458,812 gold, in one month, on one character,
with a 190,000 gold starting budget, with

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:33.280
only using Auction House smarts and two professions.
The total gold 458,812 is more than hitting

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.199
the oldschool gold cap twice. Pretty crazy
right. Also count in the mats I had left in

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.909
my guild bank and on the AH and my net worth
at the time was somewhere around 525,000 gold.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:50.639
Oh and if you're wondering why I have a ticket
open, I once again got auto banned for trading

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.240
too much gold to an alt. Since Cata's launch
my account has been fixed to prevent it from

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.960
happening again. Pretty funny stuff though.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.099
This is just a random video that I never released
and decided to get out this week. It's just

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:08.099
for fun and not a whole lot of point but a
bit of insight into what I was doing in Wrath.

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:15.120
My new Cataclysm series, Cataclysm Gold Capped
will be coming out soon and offer an inside

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.509
look into what I've done for the month showing
stats on everything as well as what I profited

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:20.509
on.

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.639
