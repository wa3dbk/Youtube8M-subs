[door unlocking]

00:00:05.937 --> 00:00:07.507
[door slams]

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:17.543
[keys dropped on surface]

00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:36.738
[music plays]

00:00:59.898 --> 00:01:01.747
I got in. 
[screaming] I got in!

00:01:01.757 --> 00:01:07.232
Woo-hoo! [laughs]
Woo! 

00:01:07.242 --> 00:01:10.532
[narrator] When your Humber College 
acceptance package arrives in the mail,

00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:12.127
it's easy to get excited.

00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:15.392
And whether you're the type who likes 
to woo-hoo, yippee, or yee-haw,

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:17.943
it's easy to share the good news 
with friends and family. 

00:01:18.858 --> 00:01:21.268
Take a selfie 
with your Future Humber Student sleeve,

00:01:22.818 --> 00:01:24.343
post it to our Facebook page,

00:01:24.353 --> 00:01:26.588
or tweet it using our hashtag,
WeAreHumber.

00:01:26.598 --> 00:01:29.932
[whistle] And presto, you've just 
joined the thousands of students

00:01:29.942 --> 00:01:32.027
who will be sharing 
the same great news.

00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:36.115
And by the way,

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:39.073
your selfie enters you 
in a draw to win a 16 Gig iPad.

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:41.438
Yee-haw.

00:01:45.043 --> 00:01:49.993
[music continues] 

00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:01.903
[music fades out]
