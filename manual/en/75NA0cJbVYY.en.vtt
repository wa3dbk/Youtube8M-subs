00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:10.279
0:00:07.270,0:00:11.679
Hi this Julie with Beadaholique.com and today

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:11.279
I'm going to show you how to cut

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.950
0:00:11.679,0:00:16.279
LillyPilly copper sheets.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.180
So I've laid out
an assortment here.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.250
I have a couple different

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.430
0:00:16.279,0:00:21.019
styles going obviously.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.560
You see I have different
embossed patterns and I also have

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.230
0:00:21.019,0:00:23.410
different patinas on top of them.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.500
0:00:23.410,0:00:27.560
One thing I do want to let you know is that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.570
this is actually the same patina but

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.919
0:00:27.560,0:00:31.070
it's a different coverage.

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.230
These are
all are going to vary.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.350
Of these are different

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.970
0:00:31.070,0:00:33.910
sheets because one is embossed and one

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.970
isn't.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.809
0:00:33.910,0:00:38.480
But the patina you'll see even if it's the

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.600
same style of patina the actual pattern

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.050
0:00:38.480,0:00:42.760
in the amount it covers is gonna vary

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.260
which makes for really unique art pieces.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.350
0:00:42.760,0:00:46.830
So I've got these wonderful embossed

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.510
sheets and a couple of solid ones too

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.530
0:00:46.830,0:00:49.280
that are 36 gauge.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.129
0:00:49.280,0:00:52.960
36 gauge it's going to be really

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:52.530
flexible so I can just bend it

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.949
0:00:52.960,0:00:55.700
with my hands.

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:54.949
It's not taking any strength.

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.270
0:00:55.700,0:01:00.910
Then I also got a much stronger very

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.839
sturdy 24 gauge sheet as well.

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:01.879
0:01:00.910,0:01:04.960
These are all in the copper.

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.430
You can see
they've got a nice copper back.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.440
0:01:04.960,0:01:08.140
I have an inspiration project here

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.440
that I've done.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.440
It's a little

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.580
0:01:08.140,0:01:12.550
headband where I've taken the Lillypilly

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.750
copper sheets I've actually cut a round to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.979
0:01:12.550,0:01:16.510
fit within the bezel setting here and

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.840
then I took a little ones that are hole

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.049
0:01:16.510,0:01:19.540
punched and then I just curl edges with my

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.049
fingers.

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.340
0:01:19.540,0:01:22.800
Some I want to show you how easy this is to

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.340
cut.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.479
0:01:22.800,0:01:26.990
I've got some sheets here that I've been working

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.479
on.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.850
I've been working with the 36 gauge.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.880
0:01:26.990,0:01:31.020
You can cut it with a pair of scissors.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.111
0:01:31.020,0:01:33.650
You can just do it like that.

00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:35.680
0:01:33.650,0:01:35.860
You can it gives nice curves to it.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.700
0:01:35.860,0:01:40.370
If you like you can cut it with a pair

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.700
metal shears.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.950
0:01:40.370,0:01:43.720
It's going to cut really see as well.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.479
0:01:43.720,0:01:47.960
What's great about the 36

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.430
gauge is you can actually

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.870
0:01:47.960,0:01:50.170
hole punch it with a paper punch.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.060
0:01:50.170,0:01:54.370
Now bear in mind paper punches were not

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.620
intended for this purpose so it is gonna

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.310
0:01:54.370,0:01:59.600
wear down your paper punch a lot quicker

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.509
than if you're using paper.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.170
0:01:59.600,0:02:00.790
All you have to do

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.530
0:02:00.790,0:02:04.840
put it in there.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.370
What's nice is you can see where
you're going to punch it.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.320
0:02:04.840,0:02:08.589
I like to use both hands.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.289
So I put it over it,

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.600
0:02:08.589,0:02:11.569
squeeze,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.510
0:02:11.569,0:02:15.059
and it punched a little circle or whatever

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.730
shape punch you have.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.550
0:02:15.059,0:02:18.979
You can tell it does ruffle the edges

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.550
a little bit.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.560
You can just flattened that out

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.159
0:02:18.979,0:02:22.989
with your fingers or if you like you

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.159
can curve it up

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.090
0:02:22.989,0:02:25.529
into whatever shape you desire.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.940
0:02:25.529,0:02:29.599
The edges will be a little bit sharp.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.670
This is nice and round here but if you had

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.670
0:02:29.599,0:02:30.509
a

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.160
0:02:30.509,0:02:32.639
paper cutter that had

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.080
0:02:32.639,0:02:36.540
square corners they are going to be a

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.970
little bit sharp so bear that in mind.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.150
0:02:36.540,0:02:40.700
Now if you wanted to use the 24 gauge

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.760
copper sheeting what you need

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.840
0:02:40.700,0:02:44.779
to cut it with is not a pair of scissors

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.040
but you will need your metal shears or a

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040
0:02:44.779,0:02:46.400
jeweler saw.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.480
0:02:46.400,0:02:48.029
So to cut this

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.680
0:02:48.029,0:02:52.089
you can see I've already cut a little notch.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.070
0:02:52.089,0:02:55.679
Just cut it like so.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.620
0:02:55.679,0:02:59.179
It's very easy to cut and again it

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.330
will have some sharp edges so you might

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.400
0:02:59.179,0:03:02.079
want to file those down with a diamond file.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.900
0:03:02.079,0:03:06.669
Now another option in addition to the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.189
paper punches are metal hole punches.

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.290
0:03:06.669,0:03:09.549
I've got a little round one here, a 1.8 millimeter

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.500
0:03:09.549,0:03:14.469
and you see all you have to do put the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.010
sheet between the two noses and punch.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.310
0:03:14.469,0:03:17.040
You have a perfect little hole.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.760
0:03:17.040,0:03:18.040
And that's

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.330
0:03:18.040,0:03:21.439
is all there is to cutting and using the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.530
Lillypilly copper sheet

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.530
0:03:22.040,0:03:26.439
