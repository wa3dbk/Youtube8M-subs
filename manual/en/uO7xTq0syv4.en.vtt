00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.690
I'm going to show you a few piping techniques,
with three piping tips.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.050
The first one is a star tip.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.050
The second one is a petal tip, and the third
one is a leaf tip.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.150
With our star tip, I'm going to show you a
real simple border.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.160
It's called a shell border.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.250
It's really popular in cakes, and cupcakes,
and it's really simple to do.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.070
All you're going to do is hold it on a 45
degree angle.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.690
You're going to squeeze.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.320
Put a lot of pressure in the beginning, and
then, as you're going back, you're going to

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.210
release pressure, because you want that big
bulb up there.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.940
You're going to squeeze, go forward a little
bit, and come back, and release pressure.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.810
Do that in a row, and that makes for a really
pretty border around your cakes.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.820
And that's the first one.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.950
The second one I'm going to show you is a
petal.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.930
It's how to make petals for flowers.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.370
It's really simple.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.900
When you put them together, it makes a really
pretty flower.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.060
You're always going to have the narrow end
of the petal tip facing up, and the fatter

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.460
end facing down.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.070
You want this end facing up, because it makes
really delicate, nice, fragile petals.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:24.650
The motion for this is, you're going to start,
with a lot of pressure, at a 45 degree angle.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.710
Go in an arch, bring it right back to where
you started.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.640
Do that a few times, get the hang of that
motion, that nice arch.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.330
Always end back where you first started.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.090
Then, with our leaf tip, this makes our leaves.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.960
Our leaf tip looks like a prong, and you're
going to want to hold it so that it's vertical.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.740
When you hold it to the side, it looks like
a little mouth.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.940
You're going to hold it, 45 degree angle,
these are all held at 45 degree angles.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.310
You're just going to squeeze.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.520
Put a lot of pressure, and then, as you pull
away, you're going to slowly ease the pressure

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.159
off, so you get a nice point at the end.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.890
Depending on how big you want your leaves,
if you want them bigger, you squeeze harder,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:10.890
pull away.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.210
If you want them smaller, squeeze a little
softer, and pull away.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.860
There you have three tips.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.870
With these tips, you can experiment with them,
have fun with them.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.970
You can put them together with this petal
tip.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.780
You'll make a lot of different flowers, and
then add the leaf, and then put a nice border

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.780
around it.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.780
Just have fun with it.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.780
Mix and match.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.940
Those are three piping techniques.
