00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:03.780
Hi.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.830
So Chicago style pizza.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.869
Really simple to make and when you think about
pizza pie this is what you have to think about

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.420
because it's actually built like a pie.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.160
So, a lot of people like to use cake pans.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.790
I actually really dig to use cast iron.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.980
Cast iron is really even heat throughout.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.700
It's cheap, you can buy it anywhere and it
looks really sexy too.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.240
So we're going to start with, it's a totally
cool, we didnâ€™t pre-heated or anything.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.840
So a little bit of olive oil at the bottom
of that pan and just kind of get it all over.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.940
This is just going to help with stickage,
right?

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.420
Any extra oil will just go right on top of
your pizza, just kind of rub it in all the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.420
way through.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.809
This is going to kind of make an [unctuous]
dough, keep it nice and crisp .

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.150
So then I'm just going to take this whole
pizza and put it right on top.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.190
All right.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.340
And I'm just going to let the edges kind of
fall where they may.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.399
Again, this is like making a pie, all right?

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.070
So we're going to let all those in.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.060
Any extra edges just kind of fall behind it.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.219
Just kind of press up.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.560
No one is really going to see the inside of
the dough, so it's OK if that looks a little

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.740
bit scrappy.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.250
The outside is what counts here.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.250
Awesome.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.390
So we have this nice little bed and you really
want to kind of reach it all the way to the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.390
top.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.520
It's so much like making a pie, all right?

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.520
Beautiful.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.950
Big pinch of salt.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.610
Now, what's cool about Chicago-style deep
dish pizza is that normally with any other

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.509
type of pizza, the sauce goes on first but
the Chicago style the sauce goes on last.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.950
And the reason why is because this is going
to take 25 minutes to bake at about 425 degrees,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.090
which means that anything on top is going
to be there too long and it will burn.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.209
So the tomato sauce actually acts as kind
of like a little barrier.

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:03.319
So this I have a little bit of sausage, just
going to kind sprinkle throughout.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.600
Some caramelized onions, absolutely gorgeous.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.720
Fantastic.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.620
I've got a little bit of mozzarella, that
I'm just going to tear and just dot throughout.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.930
Awesome, lots of cheese in this.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.990
Chicago, we have to do it right.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.990
Beautiful.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.860
And then just a touch of basil.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.640
You can use oregano, you can use any nice,
soft herb.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.000
Beautiful.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.530
So that's our base.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.010
Now, I grab a little bit of our homemade tomato
sauce and this is just going to go right on

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.010
top.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.000
And it seems kind of weird, right?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.340
To kind of just spoon sauce over the top of
your beautiful toppings but, again, it kind

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.690
of shields the heat from the ingredients so
nothing burns.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.870
Awesome.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.270
Tuck that little basil leaf down.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.760
Beautiful.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.170
And then I just kind of spread that around.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.390
Awesome.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.430
And this is going to get one more little touch
of olive oil.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.080
Beautiful.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.850
So 425 degrees for about 25 minutes until
the outside is kind of curled up around the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:21.330
middle and it's going to come up really crispy
on the bottom, hard shell, beautiful.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.330
All right.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.170
So it's been about 25 minutes, 425 degrees.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.640
Let's check out our Chicago deep dish, yes.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.140
That's what I'm looking for.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.090
The toppings are just set.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.150
A nice crust throughout, nice and brown and
the only way to really know is to let it set

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.000
up and grab a little spatula.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.470
But I'm going to dig in right away and if
you're olive oiled you'll see it's an easy,

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.130
easy release, right out of the cairn.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.100
You can see it's cooked throughout.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.819
That is exactly what you're looking for.

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.170
So, I finish this off just like any other
pizza.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.900
Lots of olive oil on the outside to give it
a little bit of a sheen, little richness,

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.100
some smoked salt, lay it around.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.230
And then my good friend parmesan reggiano
right over the top.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.750
Hey, if you like things a little thicker and
a little bit more pie like, check out our

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.680
