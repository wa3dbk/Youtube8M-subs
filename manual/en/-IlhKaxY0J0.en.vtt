00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.520
Are we alone in the universe?

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.000
For thousands of years, people gazed up at
the sky and asked this question.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.439
But the answers
been beyond our grasp.

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.000
Until now. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.070
Thanks to incredible recent discoveries

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.260
we now have evidence that there are
billions of other planets that could

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.270
sustain life

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.390
The challenge we're taking on is finding
out many of them actually do.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.070
Justin Crepp is a professor astrophysics
at the University of Notre Dame

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.000
and the recipient NASA early career
fellowship. He is the inventor of the i-Locater

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.300
He is the inventor of the iLocater spectrograph,

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.129
an infrared device that will identify
planets with earth-like qualities.

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.519
Although we've discovered planets that hold
the potential for life

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.000
they've been too far away to study in
any detail. 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.120
iLocater will allow us to search for planets

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.909
much closer to the Earth and measure their
internal structure and atmospheric

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.000
properties with unmatched precision.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.800
Upon its completion, iLocater will be installed at the large binocular telescope

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.410
on Arizona's Mt. Graham. There it will
use the world's most advanced adaptive

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.610
optics system

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.690
to provide unprecedented view planets
orbiting

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.770
our nearest stars. Professor Crepp's
innovative technology

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.280
will be very helpful in aiding future and
current NASA Missions

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.390
in looking for planets that are like our own.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.860
Exploration is at the heart of the mission of  the University of Notre Dame.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.950
We strive to enable our faculty and
students to ask the biggest questions,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.900
and solve our greatest mysteries.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.450
It's my hope that in our pursuit to find life on other worlds

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.880
we will ultimately be able to further
comprehend the beauty

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.610
and the significance of our own.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.370
The University of Notre Dame asks, "what
would you fight for?"

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.800
Fighting to explore our Universe.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.009
We are the Fighting Irish.
