Ladies and gentlemen, the worlds first bad breath detector for the iPhone. Lets test it out. Come on.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.509
Hey, do either of you have a second? We're testing out an iPhone App

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.949
Its a bad breath detector.

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:15.079
No way! Way! Look it says bad breath detector right there. "Oh gosh. I don't know if my breath will stand up to the test." 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:19.719
Is this the Orabrush thing? Let's give it a shot, see how effective that is. 

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:25.880
You hit the button, you blow on the bottom for 3 seconds. Ready, set go. "Way to go dragon breath. You just voided the warranty on this

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.179
iPhone

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.640
Wait, did it really just smell my breath?

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.240
Ready, Set, go. "You just...... I feel violated."

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.310
Please

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.550
..Please

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.950
Blow again...

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.729
How does it decide? It tests your breath

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.760
But what makes a good breath or bad breath?

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.490
Well I just drank some root beer so its probably  pretty bad actually. 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:55.490
it smells like a skunk...that crawled out of the sewer into your mouth and farted, then died...and then farted again.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.700
Okay 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.370
Good job...

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.710
It was good for me... How was it for you? 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.070
Perfect

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.610
Thats good isn't it?

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.050
Just because its sterile, doesn't mean you

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.330
should drink it. Gross! That's awful...Thats so embarrassing

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.260
"mmmmmm... mmmmm... Good"

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.920
Just getting better and better every time. "I smell dead people."

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.400
(Laughs)

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.680
This is crushing my hopes and dreams..... "You ever made out with a phone? 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.579
Now's your chance."

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:31.579
Alright! certifiably smooch-able. "They should make 'Your Breath' scented candles." This is so biased! How is it biased, this is a scientific test!

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.150
"Oh how was it? I have always wondered what sh$* tastes like."

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.650
Do you have good or bad breath? It's excellent. Excellent?

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.420
Well we will have to try it out, ok blow. 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.850
"It's as if fresh bread and flowers married and consummated in your mouth." I told you it was good!

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.850
Fresh bread and fresh flowers consummated in my mouth. "Has any one ever told you that your breath smells wonderful?"

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.100
"They never will..."

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.100
Excuse me, were making a youtube video....Just breath into the microphone......
