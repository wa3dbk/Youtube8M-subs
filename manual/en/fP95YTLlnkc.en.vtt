00:00:01.091 --> 00:00:03.091
Hey guys! This is Isopanzer!

00:00:03.553 --> 00:00:09.242
In my last video about E-50 I was telling you about a 
 sort of a very cautious, conservative and defensive style of play

00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:13.468
But in this battle, we'll have a totally different approach.

00:00:13.886 --> 00:00:17.183
We are in a squad of two E-50's and a 
 Patton. Gleborg and Skyline are with me today.

00:00:17.786 --> 00:00:24.706
This is a Widepark map. It is a very small map 
 with huge number of different structures, obstacles and hideouts.

00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:32.183
That is why using E-50's as a long-range sniper is absolutely 
 ineffective, so we'll be playing as aggresively as we can.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:40.774
We are planning to go to the Zero line in order 
 to intercept enemy's MTs which may also go there.

00:00:40.635 --> 00:00:46.115
This area here along the zero line is very comfortable for the enemy attack.

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:48.948
We know about it and are beginning to move for interception.

00:00:49.087 --> 00:00:52.709
Gleborg's Patton immediately rushes to the center in order 
 to scout and light up the enemy.

00:00:53.406 --> 00:01:00.140
We also notice that Object 704 is moving towards the railroad. 
 He should now accordingly take a firing position there.

00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:08.592
At the same time, we will move closer to these houses, intercept 
 enemy's MT's and scout the enemies for Object 704 to destroy.

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:14.350
Gleborg and Skyline are moving forward to try and light up the enemy.

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.273
But here we encounter an unexpected problem.

00:01:19.923 --> 00:01:29.072
Enemy's French drum-type tanks, Lorraine and AMX 13 90 have quickly rushed 
 towards the railroad and onto our side of the map.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.482
We didn't expected this, and, as you see, we are now in a situation 
 where they are behind the railroad cars and we cannot hit them.

00:01:35.573 --> 00:01:40.220
Moreover, Object 704 has not yet taken a firing position.

00:01:41.053 --> 00:01:56.420
The situation is bad and we are forced to turn around and chase the French tanks. What is even more 
 annoying is that they have already loaded their drums and can now deal serious damage with their cannons.

00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:04.020
Object 704 is lost. It was unable to make even a single 
 shot  in this battle, as far as I can see.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.520
However we do succeed in destroying the Enemy's French tanks.

00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:14.260
It was clear that their intention was to give up their tanks in 
 exchange for ours and, I must admit, that was a successful exchange.

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:21.180
Two French tier-7 and tier-8 tanks in exchange for Object 704 
 and GWTiger make more than a fair deal, I guess.

00:02:22.617 --> 00:02:31.440
We continue to move forward and make a decision to push in this direction. We will 
 now group together and in no circumstances we will advance one at at time.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:41.890
We coordinate our actions in TeamSpeak and as soon as it is confirmed that everybody is 
 ready to attack, we choose our next target, the KV-4, and begin focus fire.

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:50.480
My shot tracks him without any damage which is why we 
 spend a little bit more time destroying the KV-4.

00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:56.050
Next focus is Patton. We simply press and destroy him with our three barrels.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:03:11.010
Note that whenever it is time to deal damage, we three group together and under 
 no circumstances we split up, which helps us to quickly destroy three enemy tanks.

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:12.630
And here comes an important part.

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:16.350
In battle there will be a lot of 
 times when you have to act agrresively.

00:03:17.904 --> 00:03:19.780
In our case, we need to decide what to do next.

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:33.950
One option is to now move to the opposite flank and attack enemy forces who are on a breakthrough there and 
 have already destroyed our tier-10 heavy tank. It is clear that without our help the team will not last long.

00:03:34.924 --> 00:03:37.010
However we decide to eliminate enemy's SPG first.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:48.950
Why? Because it would be very problematic to defend when the enemy 
 still has four... well, actually three SPGs (one is AFK)... online.

00:03:49.478 --> 00:03:53.660
That is why we have to move very fast to  the enemy's rear. Here I get 
 hit by Patton from behind, inform my squadmates about it and try to hide myself.

00:03:57.587 --> 00:04:01.900
The guys turn around to face Patton and 
 we will now quickly annihilate it. 

00:04:02.323 --> 00:04:17.930
Our main objective here is to act as fast as possible. I ram into Patton. My E-50 crew 
 has Controlled Impact skill at 100% mastery, which allows me to increase my DPM by ramming.

00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:30.510
Now we are rushing at full speed. We must not waste too much time and destroy all 
 the SPGs. I shoot on the move and we continue to search for the remaining SPGs.

00:04:31.256 --> 00:04:34.260
We need to destroy them ASAP and return to base.

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:42.120
Unfortunately the enemy's SPGs were already expecting Gleborg. He gets two 
 shots and this is battle over for him.  

00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:54.150
However we manage to kill the SPGs. I ram into one of them, lose some HP 
 because of it, but it help me to fire a missed shot at Object 261.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.420
We now return to base. Theoretically speaking, we could also attempt to capture enemy's base. 
 But the problem is that, first of all, the enemy still has one SPG.

00:05:04.948 --> 00:05:08.850
Secondly there is still one enemy's MT in battle and we do 
 not know where it is. Plus there is also T110.

00:05:10.846 --> 00:05:20.500
So, we thought that if we go for the enemy's base, we would have problems if the enemy 
 decided to come back and interrupt the base capturing process with the support of their SPGs.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.380
That is why we decide not to go to the 
 enemy's base, quickly destroy the most dangerous enemy, T110.

00:05:28.214 --> 00:05:38.430
I hide in order to stop being lighted up, because I am basically a 
 one shot for the enemy's SPG. After that, we gang up on T-54.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:51.130
I cross the railroad, try to aim at T-54 but unfortunately hit the bridge arm. That was a 
 pretty big mistake on my part, since because of it we could have lost Skyline's Patton.

00:05:51.875 --> 00:06:01.840
However he plays skillfully and destroys the T-54 while I cover him from IS-8 
 by not letting him advance forward and finish off my squadmate.

00:06:04.298 --> 00:06:09.850
And now it is basically just a matter of finishing off the remaining tanks. We 
 will come at IS-8 from two sides and then go for the SPG.

00:06:12.007 --> 00:06:24.570
The battle turned out to be quite fast-paced. As you see, we constantly had to make quick decisions. I 
 would say that playing in such aggressive style  requires quite an experience and knowledge of the game.

00:06:26.055 --> 00:06:39.430
Each of such decisions in the course of battle must be taken by you in split seconds, in which you 
 must understand what you will do next, because such actions will practically always determine the outcome of the battle.

00:06:39.755 --> 00:06:52.480
When you play defensively, this is usually not the case, because the only 
 decision you have to take when defending is basically when to counterattack.

00:06:52.897 --> 00:06:54.900
Here, on the other hand, you must  constantly move 
 on the battlefield, focus-fire and coordinate your actions.

00:06:59.074 --> 00:07:14.650
Of course, I would say that this style is much more interesting. But 
 it is also more difficult. You must understand that if your

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.620
This require certain experience.

00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:35.600
Well, not so much EXP after this battle for me, but as i already said numerous times in my other videos: 
 it's the squad's EXP that counts. And our squad's total EXP after this battle is over 5k with 12 frags.

00:07:35.924 --> 00:07:45.000
