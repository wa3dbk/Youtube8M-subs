00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.170
for Republican lawmaker in Colorado
while debating solutions for poverty

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.690
with other lawmakers

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.900
said some unfortunate things by forcing
and the point is to discuss ways to

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.150
decrease the poverty rate in Colorado

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.640
now racial disparities were discussed
but when the topic

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.740
%uh minorities in infant mortality came
up

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.859
that's when senator marble shared her
philosophy

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.070
when you look at my pics that in

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.779
be there certain term there are problems
in the black grey

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.040
and ago Narnia in something that comes
up

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.520
arm baby did here and

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.760
something that prevalent in the genetic
makeup

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.500
although i cud hey and I'm never had

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.930
at better barbecuing better kick in

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.320
a better night and when you go down now
the new

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.859
I'm I'm love it now representative field
says that those comments about food and

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.039
african-americans

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.089
were insensitive and germane to the
discussion

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.920
she shared her thoughts right after at
the center finished up

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.939
and when everything I will not tolerate

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.369
is way them and implanted into

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.750
we mark about african-american

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.610
the color a bit again what you mentioned

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.700
that we eek I would highly offended by
your remarks and what we're trying to do

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.170
with the come up with meaningful

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.390
pollution and not about kickin it's not
about you can kick in

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.820
representative fields didn't stay for
the entire committee meeting but we had

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.509
a chance to speak with senator marble
about her comments after the meeting

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:44.040
ended

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.960
she says she has these types of
conversations with her black friends and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.780
family members

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.729
and doesn't see the issue it's not
racist

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.270
its its bringing out the back so that
you can be aware

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.509
and take better care of yourself all
that so down

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.770
now understand whenever there's a
scientist

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.780
or a doctor or a researcher now want to
talk about genetics and talk about minor

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.110
differences between

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.810
on average between white people and
black people how white people

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.819
are up more often succumb to certain
diseases in certain

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.310
genetic issues and black people succumb
to other ones

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.220
%uh ball s fine and there's no problem
with that and not just a

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.890
open dialogue about a biology but
whatever you hear somebody who's not

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.430
a scientist or a doctor or researcher
bring up genetics

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.140
run for the hills guaranteed

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.000
to be not true and likely offensive

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.080
so this is not that remember

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.250
the debate they were having was about
poverty

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.290
and in the middle of a party to me sure
you guys got understand there are

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.269
certain things that some races just do
so for example most part people

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.980
they get sick in these ways so it should
be clear I mean

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.340
we can maybe do something to try to fix
poverty but at the end of the day does

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.019
it really matter cuz black people are
gonna be poor anyway

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.980
hello their black all

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.019
all that sold on man and then put the
icing on the cake

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.150
she's like well well

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.940
people from Mexico they are center
because they had a lot of fresh

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.640
vegetables

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.379
they are you any if there were just

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.260
articles out two weeks ago talking about
how Mexico

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.239
has now surpassed the United States as
officially

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.950
the fattest country in the world hero
everything this one

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.560
nah man look clearly

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.580
there is nothing inherent in

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.170
somebody skin a collar that would lead
to

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.120
determining pre determining their level
of work ethic or

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.530
where they fall in terms of any income

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.640
distribution you know it reminds me of
West Point

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.909
when I was in college want to thank the
first or is in sociology that shows a

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:06.549
graph

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.580
and showed how murderers and iced ice
cream sales rose

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.930
together right so a in idiot would look
at that and say it will always love you

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.979
I was going on

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.000
owns you leading to the gruesome and
murders or ice cream is dangerous he got

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.840
a ban it right

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.880
much ridiculous nobody would say that

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.130
prophetically dumb right well this is

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.410
exactly what she's doing so she is going
well look since there's

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.780
are you know statistically speaking
there's up more people

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.650
better black that are poor will
obviously that means their inferior and

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.139
then no matter what they do they're
gonna be poor

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.090
causation correlation you fall
