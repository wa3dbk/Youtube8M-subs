Hello and welcome to Todd's kitchen. If you love pancakes or hotcakes depending on your country

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.460
then your going to love todays recipe, it not only tastes fantastic it looks fantastic to

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:16.460
So join me today as i make my version of Red velvet pancakes

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.340
To start of we are going to shift two cups

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.970
of plain flour

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.230
Then one cup of ice sugar or powdered sugar

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.040
Then half a cup of cocoa

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.670
Then our baking powder

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.480
Our Bi-Carb soda

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.910
and a pinch of salt

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.210
Then give it a quick mix to combine the ingredients 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.640
Next into a bowl we are going to crack in

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.330
Two eggs

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.280
Then add in half a cup of super fine sugar

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.640
Then one and a half cups of butter milk. Or normal milk with cream added

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.640
Now whisk until the sugar is completely dissolved

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.400
Next add in two tablespoons of red food colouring 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.030
Then mix that though. next using a spoon or a stand mixer on low

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.880
We are going to start mixing

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.880
and adding the liquid mixture in as we go

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.690
We don't want to over beat this, just beat it until its well combined 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.239
Now i have a fry pan on the stove on a medium heat

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:52.869
For each pancake we want to use cooking spray oil to grease the pan

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.869
it's just a simple matter of pouring

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.680
your pancake

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.490
into the pan

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.800
We are going to cook this side for 2 - 3 minutes until bubbles start forming on top

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:18.299
and it starts to go dry on the outside. That means its ready to turn

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.849
Now we have our stack of rev velvet pancakes

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.439
Next to add some flair we are going to use some more icing sugar

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:32.349
and we are going to sprinkle some just on top

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.519
Now you can use some whipping cream or ice cream, but personally I'm going to use some

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.969
maple syrup

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.549
yummy

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:49.549
Now to give this a try

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.189
That is SO good

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.079
there is nothing better then red velvet pancakes

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.569
You have that lovely pancake taste with the added chocolate

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.589
and adding that red food colouring really does set it off

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:15.219
You can get a much deeper red by using the powdered food colouring

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.869
as opposed to the liquid food colouring that i have used

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.519
But i only have liquid so thats what i used

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.339
But to be honest it still works out just fine. but if if you the liquid or the powder, it will still taste 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:27.829
Simply Delicious 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.510
and they are so much better then regular old pancakes

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.559
So make these for your friends or family one morning because they are going to love them

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:39.389
