00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Do you want to have a really nice feast but your table is too small?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000
We have the solution.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Today we are going to build an oak dining table for at least 6 persons.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
To do this, we will need a tabletop made of wood, board material for the table legs...

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.000
...the router, the cordless screwdriver and the drill.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Have the legs cut to size at a DIY store or by a carpenter.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.500
The legs each have two narrow and two wide parts,...

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
...which are joined using tongues and grooves. 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:58.000
In order to fit them, we first need to know which part belongs to which leg.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.500
Secondly: Where are the parts situated â€“ outside or inside?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.500
To do this, we will mark the backs with a triangle and a number...

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
...so that we know which leg is which.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
For the tongue and groove joints of the legs...

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.000
...we will clamp the piece of wood.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We will then use the router to rout...

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
...grooves 11 millimetres deep.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.000
We have now routed the wide parts on the inside...

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
... and the short ones on the front side.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
To glue them, we will apply glue into the groove and the front side.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Now we will put the tongues into the grooves and then all parts into each other.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
When everything is fitted firmly, we will leave it to dry.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
To do this, we will put a piece of scrap wood onto the wide side...

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.000
... and clamp the whole thing in three clamps.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
When doing so, observe the drying times defined by the manufacturer.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
This is what the table leg looks like once the glue has dried.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
When the legs are finished, we will join them to the tabletop.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
We have laid the tabletop with the face on the work surface.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.000
We will fit these brackets onto the insides of the legs to secure them.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.000
To do this, we have pre-drilled these holes, namely...

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.000
...always one millimetre smaller than the screw diameter.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The edges of the legs are sharp but the brackets are rounded on the inside. 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.500
To make sure that they fit together, we will sand a small curve on the table leg.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.500
Once the brackets are fitted,...

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.500
...we will position the legs flush to the corners of the tabletop.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.000
We have placed the legs on the table.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.000
We will use these beams to stabilise the entire frame.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
We will bolt the pre-drilled beams to the outsides of the brackets.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.000
Before you begin with the surface treatment...

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.500
...you should chamfer the table edges.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.500
To do this, go over the edges at a 45 degree angle using sanding paper with a grit of 180.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.000
This prevents you from cutting yourself later.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.500
And the result simply looks better.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
To treat the surface, first sand the area with a grit of 180,...

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.500
...then with sanding paper with a grit of 240.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Then apply water to the board using a damp cloth.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.500
The wood fibres will protrude while the wood is drying;...

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
...sand them down using sanding pa
