00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.100
the piece that broke off this one these

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.900
plastic nubs

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.930
Real Usage. Real Reviews. Mobile Reviews - eh.ca

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:17.930
 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.280
 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.680
We were filming our intro video

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.010
for a Mobile Reviews - eh.ca website wand this is a hundred-dollar

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.510
case from Otterbox and I dropped it three
times

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.260
They say you can drop this from 10 feet

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.370
I dropped it from 4.5 feet

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.590
closer to 5feet and this piece came out

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.820
this thing is kind of flapping around

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.309
in this just really annoys me because

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.440
well you pay hundred dollars for a iPhone 5 protective case and they tell you it is waterproof

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.019
you can drop it from 10feet and then you drop it three times in front of a camera, the case breaks

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.489
so you think I'm gonna say about this  case in our reviews

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.740
its an absolute piece of crap nobody should really buy

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.619
nobody should spend a hundred dollars drop it about
half dozen times have the case break

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.009
great that's ridiculous i paid like $700 on this iPhone

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.350
100 alt case anything raise up to 3
drops who in the right mind would never

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.450
lie about this case

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.070
so watches videos tell your friends your
family go when you are

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.179
loss pieces rap I'm

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.820
so as you can see the piece that broke
off is one of these plastic not be

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.110
famous on this court

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.740
best piece that kinda came off and
that's piece actually fits into

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.800
be sold if it's for a hearing

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.090
I guess it's a pretty poor design
advocates I'm

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.740
take that kinda drop iPhone is fine it
still works

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.680
so yeah awesome case on her box

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.080
thanks hi I'm here

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.340

gonna be awesome

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.830
