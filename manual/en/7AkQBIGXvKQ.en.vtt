00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.619
You can say this about most games, but I think
it’s especially true of on-rails shooters.

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.160
And that is...you get into this zone when
you play them, this rhythm in which you almost

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.160
stop thinking.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.200
You just react.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.940
Things seem to happen automatically...which
is fitting for a genre in which movement is,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.710
in fact, automatic.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.120
So for a good on-rails shooter, the last thing
you want is something that breaks your rhythm.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.890
Something like...oh, I don’t know...controls
that take decades of precedence and instead

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:48.890
do the opposite.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.880
I mean, that’s like shooting rhythm in the
face.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.780
Heavy Fire: Shattered Spear does precisely
that.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:07.240
From 200 yards.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.470
Just released to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation
3, Heavy Fire: Shattered Spear is like gaming

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.470
popcorn.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.060
Which is to say...it’s not the hearty steak
dinner you get from games like Halo or more

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.560
large-scale shooters.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.100
This is meant to be a between-meals snack,
right?

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.990
At first glance, it looks like it might be
a tasty one.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.280
And it could be.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.799
If you can, like, chew with your tongue and
taste with your teeth.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.439
So the problem right up front with Heavy Fire:
Shattered Spear...is its controls.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.409
Now, much of gaming is built on precedent,
right?

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.509
Things that are just repeated from game to
game, whether it’s certain design concepts

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.359
or ideas...or controls.

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:53.619
And for any shooter in which aiming and movement
are done independently, the standard is...right

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.850
stick aims, left stick moves.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.319
You don’t even think about it.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.950
Heavy Fire did.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:11.620
And it shouldn’t have.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.170
So in this game, you aim your cursor with
the left stick...but there are also movements

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.640
you have to make, like ducking or taking cover.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.980
And you move...with the right stick.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.400
The exact opposite of what you’d expect,
and as a result, the game never achieves rhythm.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.020
There’s always a degree of awkwardness,
like trying to write with your offhand.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.810
Fortunately, the PS3 version does support
the Move for pointer control, but if you go

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.570
with the Xbox 360, it’s those controls only.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.890
Which, by the way, you can’t customize.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.710
But awkwardness aside, this is an on-rails
shooter set in the Middle East.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.240
There are Iranian gunfights, there are machine
guns.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.760
Frankly, this is a pretty unambitious game
conceptually, but it does do some things fairly

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.760
well.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.820
For starters, the gameplay mixes classic light
gun design with cover-based combat, like Time

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.820
Crisis.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.250
And that makes Shattered Spear feel different
from most rail shooters.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.870
It’s a fun mechanic.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.500
There’s also four-player local coop, which
is great.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.240
But ultimately, Heavy Fire misfires more than
it hits its target.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.780
The price is nice, but the game lasts less
than two hours.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:35.359
As it is, it’s only recommended for the
genre’s most dedicated and forgiving fans.
