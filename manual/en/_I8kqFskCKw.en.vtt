00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:18.874
Right. Whenever you're ready.

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:22.996
I THINK I FIN'LY FOUND HIM
/ HASHTAG "PERFECT GUY"

00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:26.899
PEETA BUFF BUT WITH A
GALE TWINKLE IN HIS EYE...

00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:30.531
You're off pitch. If you want
to be a star... wouldn't it make

00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:33.691
sense to take some singing lessons
before you make your record?

00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:39.625
Dear Liza... being a star... is all about how you
look. And Alex... can fix the way that I sound.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:43.833
Almost there. One more little minute.
There we are!

00:00:44.417 --> 00:00:48.444
I THINK I FIN'LY FOUND HIM / HASHTAG
"PERFECT GUY" / PEETA BUFF BUT WITH A

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.441
GALE TWINKLE IN HIS EYE / I THINK I
SAW HIM WINK / AS HE WENT WALKING BY...

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:01.958
Rosie! Hey! Wake up, you're famous!

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.792
The diva's still sleeping.
Try again this afternoon.

00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:10.090
But... Uh... look here! You're a big star! Over
five thousand hits! I can't believe this

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:14.066
is happening! All thanks to my mixing skills!...
Oh, and, y-your beauty and stuff.

00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:21.609
This is it! The first day of my new life!
I guess I better start practicing

00:01:21.634 --> 00:01:25.607
autograph signing. Liza... this means
you'll be doing my chores from now on.

00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:28.999
There's no way I'm going to do your chores!

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.667
Stars never do menial labor. Our purpose
is to shine so everybody can adore us!

00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:45.566
We'll see how much they adore you
when they find out that without the

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:49.125
assistance of computer tricks you
sing just like a wounded camel...

00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:54.851
Hey Big Star Big Sister! I hope you
don't mind, but your fans are so

00:01:54.852 --> 00:01:58.167
desperate for more of you, I promised
them you'll do a live web-cast!

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.195
Of course, since the performance
is live, nobody will be able

00:02:00.196 --> 00:02:02.203
to fix your voice. But that really
shouldn't be a problem for a

00:02:02.204 --> 00:02:04.211
star like you, right? Because all
that matters is how you look.

00:02:04.212 --> 00:02:06.250
Hey, you really had better get
going, don't make your fans wait.

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:16.875
Just darn her! She just wants me to fail!

00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:19.250
This really isn't a problem at all.
Because once

00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:21.416
again, technology has your back.
I have a recording

00:02:21.417 --> 00:02:25.208
of your improved performance. I'll just play
the disc. And all you have to do is lip-sync.

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:30.000
Oh, we'll just have to see about that...

00:02:30.042 --> 00:02:31.813
That?

00:02:31.814 --> 00:02:36.708
Plug that... That should do it...

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.542
Well, just imagine that. Little Miss Jealous
is trying to stand in my way again!

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:48.417
Lip synching is dishonest! It's... It's...
W-well, it's just wrong is what!

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:52.875
Would it still seem as wrong... If my pink
purse were to become your pink purse?

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:57.042
Stop trying to ruin my stardom, and it's yours.

00:02:57.542 --> 00:02:59.708
That's a good girl. Now please go away!

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.917
Hello, adoring public! Now
watch me while I shine!

00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:10.042
Now I will sing for you all!

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:12.360

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:26.458
People! It's not her! She can't really sing!
She's... She's just lip

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:37.416
TWINKLE IN HIS EYE / I THINK
I SAW HIM WINK / AS HE WENT...

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:41.000

00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:03.458
Some sister you are. You
sabotaged my entire career.

00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:07.503
It's never too late to learn
how to actually sing. Know

00:04:07.528 --> 00:04:11.066
what? I could teach you if
you really wanted to learn

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:14.992
Rosie! Your web hits are through the roof!
They think you created a new kind of music!

00:04:15.017 --> 00:04:19.149
They're calling it "anti-pop" or "un-pop"! And
it's sweeping across the whole showbiz world!

00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:27.708
You don't need to worry about your
out-of-date ideas about music and singing.

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:31.732
Dear Liza. And if you like... I could teach
you how to actually sing, you know.
