00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:08.130
So, this is the trash can. This is my kitchen,
of which you can see the checkered floors.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.770
The trick is Possum every now and then will
get into the trash. I don't know quite how

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.189
to stop her from doing that because she doesn't
when I'm not here. When I come home she always

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.789
appears very guilty. I feel terrible about
it, but I have to spank her butt a little

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.259
bit. Never be afraid to spank your dog's butt
a little bit, because it's not like a human.

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.250
They're not going to hold a regret or resent
you later in life because of it. This is just

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.960
a dog or just a cat or whatever. In this case,
I have ignorantly put the dog food next to

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.460
the trash can. That's going to teach the dog
is a source of food. They're going to see

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.500
you taking food out and putting it in their
bowl. Another thing. That's a no no. Don't

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.080
put their dog food next to any kind of trash
cans. They just get used to and they're going

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.290
to want to eat it. In this case, I feed Possum
twice a day, one cup a day for a large to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.430
medium size breed of Science Diet. Whatever
kind of dog food you're feeding your dog,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:18.460
always do it the same kind of day everyday,
always the same food. Their stomachs are very

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.289
adept at the same kind of food over and over.
If you keep changing their food, then it's

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.900
going to mess them all up. Don't ask me why,
but talk to your vet; they'll agree with me.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.579
I usually take just like a handful so I can
feel exactly how much she wants. I feed her

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.850
a little bit more than that. That's about
a cup. It's right next to her water. Put this

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.999
is up and we will be moving this from the
trash can. Let's see if Possum will get into

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:56.579
the trash. Possum come. What's this? What's
in here? Come on, what's in here? You know

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.599
it's bad girl. You know it's bad girl to get
in there don't you? Come on, what's in here?

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:08.470
What's in here? See now, watch this. Let's
see if she'll get into the closet here. Possum,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.220
what's in here? What's in here? Good girl.
What's in here. See, she'll get in here. She'll

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.610
look all the way inside here. Come on. What's
in there? Now, watch this. Let's see if she'll

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.650
get into the trash can. Possum come. Come
here, what's in here? She won't even get near

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.560
it. Possum, come, what's in here? What's in
here? Oh, you bad girl, you bad girl. You

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.210
shouldn't do it, you shouldn't do it. She's
going to eat her meal. She shouldn't be eating

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.200
right now, but she's being a good girl for
the show so I'll let her have a little nibble.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.230
That's enough of that Ms. Possum. That's the
trash trick. Spank their butts when they get

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:58.010
into the trash, a little bit. Never too much,
because then you go prison.
