00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.160
I got you!

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.400
Now I can put you in lye.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.598
Then I will soak you in water.

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:30.000
Then I can eat you on Christmas Eve.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.200
Follow me these 24 days and I
will tell you some stories.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.920
Welcome!

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.280
We're at the Fox Cape. The border towards
RÃ¥lund is only 200 meters east.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.680
To me this is a fantastic
spot for moose hunting.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.640
You also meet the Siberian Jay, I've fed
them butter straight from my hand.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.480
This is one of our more distant outposts.
Some people don't like walking so far.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.560
I'm the opposite, nice
to have it to myelf.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.520
It has almost become "My post".

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.160
I started shooting more moose,
getting back into the game.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.320
But that's not todays story.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.000
I begun hunting moose
at the age of 18.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.640
I've been privileged to shoot moose
most years, sometimes even four.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.800
I mostly shot them while
they were moving.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.680
I had to aim for the head or
their body at an angle.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.040
Never a standing still one.
Which was what we were tought.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.680
Ideally the moose would stand still and
you would aim for the target area.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.920
One would hear experienced hunters
talking about aiming for the neck.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.040
But I never got the opportunity.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:32.520
Now I'll tell you what happened here.
Just where the dark dot and the ice is.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:42.080
I thought 150 meters but
it apparantely was 175.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.840
Up there where the bushes are in the way,
about 500 meters out, I noticed a moose.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.760
It had no horns so I assumed
it was a cow or heifer.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.160
But at that distance it's hard to tell.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.240
I saw no calf.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.840
It came closer, and even closer!

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.600
This was getting interesting, perhaps I
was about to shoot another moose.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.240
There it put its head out again.
There was lots of vegetation.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.560
I only saw the head.
And no calf.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.920
I judged it to be a cow or heifer.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.200
Well, I thought, time to
do like the big boys.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.200
I had great support, aimed for the
neck and squeeezed the trigger.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.720
Right after the shot she rolled
over and fell into the river.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.640
This river is quite flooded during spring,
it creates underground holes under the bank.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.920
There was a large hole
she slipped in under.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.160
I only saw the hoves twitch a bit.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.880
I was surprised, having
shot for the neck.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:10.560
I picked my microphone up and
reported a perfect neck shot.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.440
The hunting team organised tools
while I was sitting here at front row.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.280
They tied the moose to the canoe
and brought it downriver.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.520
They took it up while I wandered over
the mountain, far away, to my car.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.960
We then skinned it.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.600
Then came the discusssion.
"Where did you shoot?"

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.000
Maybe I was a bad marksman

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.560
I actually think she broke her neck.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.480
The shot frightened her so
she fell over the river edge

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.160
and jerked her spine off.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.080
I don't know what else to think.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.080
Right here the bullet had cut the fur
and barely graced the skin.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.440
There wasn't even blood.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.120
I call it the perfect
neck shot.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.360
Even if it was bad.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.120
So, I've shot a moose without
shooting a moose.
