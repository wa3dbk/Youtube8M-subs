00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.980
Somehow hello, it's OMINE.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.080
A picture is always worked in a hobby using Photoshop this time, and.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.580
I'll introduce recommended arrangement to the person drawing an illustration.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.560
The one as the recommendation arrangement I say here?

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.140
A performance of Photoshop can't become bad and concentrate on work during work and.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.060
Please make me the more comfortable environment.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.160
For what person who would like to be immersed in production work, a hardware face.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.120
I'd like to speak about the environment that it's recommended by both of them of software phase or setting.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.600
It was turned to 3-note-type PC which has passed for about 4 years from sale as the premise.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.380
Because arrangement is being introduced in the center.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.760
For the person who uses the latest high-performance PC

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.960
I'll decline that there may be no dramatic improvement so much.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.880
Then I'll begin, the hardware side will be explained first.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.220
After there is something which can't add a memory in Mac even if I say a laptop computer before a decade.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.220
MacBook Air I'm using?

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.340
By the machine which doesn't also face to the production work as only 4 GB by the state that a memory was shipped most.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.200
I say that I deal with big data for behavior sometimes to become unstable.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.700
When I'll arrange the hardware side, and such stress can be improved.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.960
It's utilization of the outside bill storage to want to try first.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.680
After this isn't talk limited to Photoshop.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.380
It isn't used by a mechanical element by most application for business use.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.920
By connecting other various machinery and materials of the outside bill storage.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.220
It's the mechanism that it's possible to give the performance.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.420
Even a PC element can continue the production work of course.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.300
If it's that, a load concentrates on storage had by a PC built-in.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.280
As well as deterioration of the worst performance.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.360
I shorten life of the storage, said, because it can be.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.900
At least 1 of outside bill storage will be connected, and I suggest hard that it's used.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.960
With the outside bill HDD to keep the data work has finished as an ideal.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.980
The HDD which should be for "virtual storage disks", and is high-speed or SSD explained from later.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.180
The high-speed storage which preserves only the data which is working when it's possible, is added, 1.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.080
When total of 3 can be prepared, it's perfect.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.880
By the way, my environment is using 12 core model of Mac Pro2013.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.760
It isn't used by an element as expected.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.380
Make serve concurrently as "virtual storage disk" and preservation of data during work by the high-speed HDD I composed in RAID.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.500
Work is using the low-speed HDD and these 2 to preserve the data which has ended.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.520
Next setting on the application side will be explained.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.080
I make a "environment configuration" screen indicate first.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.700
To make them speed movement up in recent Photoshop.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.460
It corresponds to a lye selah ration using GPU.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.620
When this GPU function is used fully.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.660
Because a question on the performance is sometimes given when the cash level is low.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.620
I may hope that you establish it a little more highly than 4 of default or that from a environment configuration.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.260
When the cash level is made short.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.500
A performance of the occasion with which a small picture for webs is made improves.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.100
Because the difference can't be sensed by the PC which is nowadays if it's such light work.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.680
The restrictive default which has no complete things.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.520
Or I think the condition such as being slightly rather more expensive than that is fine.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200
Next "setting of a graphic processor" well.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.680
It'll be established about processing using GPU.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.900
When it's GPU to be equipped with by a PC for these several years.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.260
I think a remaining check box is made a check on except for "of OpenCL, use".

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.220
The place where I pay attention here?

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.860
By the setting item as the "basis" in "drawing mode" "the standard" "details".

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.920
"Basis" but when movement is lightest and "details" are heaviest, it'll be.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.580
Unless low performance GPU is being used, it "is much standard".

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.160
Or it's all right with "details".

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.620
When an awkward movement is conspicuous for usual movement a zooming of a screen and a revolution.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.480
I hope that it's set as "basis".

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.080
Next "the use situation of the memory" will be established.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.700
The item which decides one how many % of a equipped memory to use here.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.300
Because a performance sometimes falls reversely even if it's established so rather highly.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.500
The person who says "He works all the while only in Photoshop.", in about 70 %.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.800
I'm the person who says "He works while also using other applications as well as Photoshop."

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.940
I may hope that you set it as rather a little low 50-about 60 %.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.900
Next "the cashier tile size" will be established.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.100
When a picture with large size and an illustration are edited.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.180
The person who made its size big is able to get a performance.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.420
Because consumption of a memory becomes intense.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.460
The PC onto which so many memories aren't being loaded.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.680
For example 2GB and about 4GB of PC.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.540
When working by such PC, please be careful.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.060
That the cash tile size was set to 1024K on probation.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.760
It was set as 128K and it was compared.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.780
The memory consumption in the time when a picture for tests was read and.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.600
I find out that the difference has gone out to a paint performance by a brush.

00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:38.371
The one set to 1024K here.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.760
A paint performance comes near and consumes a memory and is a good result.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.760
The "number of histories which isn't being introduced this time, but.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.180
Because it doesn't influence a performance so much.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.660
When hanging on the degree which isn't interfered by its environment, it's no problem.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.400
Next "virtual storage disk" is established.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.840
While this virtual storage disk is working.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.740
When it's being lacking in a memory of a PC.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.260
By something for which the application side uses storage of a PC for a memory.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.320
A little PC of a memory is the important item.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.800
When it's used while making here built-in storage of default.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.400
As well as a decline of a performance.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.280
I shorten life of the storage, said, because it can be.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.340
Please be sure to set it as the outside storage.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.100
When shipping a memory about 16GB, it isn't necessary to worry about it to there.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.440
When it's the PC only about 4GB I don't go along is shipping.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.740
A considerable performance rise can expect to designate high-speed storage to the utmost.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.640
Last

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.640
It's a small part, but the thumbnail shown to a layer panel is made hidden.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.740
It's shown by default and is convenient for confirmation of an object.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.560
Please shut a renewal of a thumbnail picture out by putting this out.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.880
A performance is raised.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.620
The point important by having spoken to here?

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.960
Storage, more than one, with preparing it and making a load to built-in storage disperse.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.160
A memory certain degree of is needed to plan for a performance rise.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.660
When there are few memories.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.240
It's said to be whether however high-speed outside storage can be prepared to make up that.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.000
The element important at the top using Photoshop, first, "CPU".

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.480
Next please come with "memory".

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.800
Next it's the outside bill storage and the condition such as GPU's coming.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.460
If you use a desktop-type PC.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.260
Because there is also something it's possible to exchange parts such as CPU and a memory for which.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.720
It's easy to upgrade.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.660
I don't also go so by notebook-size, so first, "memory".

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.760
And next I think I hope that you're adding "the outside bill storage".

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.280
That's it.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.120
Photoshop where the expensive special didn't also have so much information in the past.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.360
It can have been used now by the monthly amount of about 2000 yen in now.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.020
In all except for the person who uses on business

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.600
I think the user and information are increasing.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.040
I think there are a lot of met users, too, with using only the superficial function easily.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.480
It's the best tool hard as picture edit software.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.480
I think when I devote myself, and you'd manage Photoshop by all means when being remembered.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.520
It was taken up by a program this time for building of the production environment that the stress doesn't build up first.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.840
There are also still several small parts by all except for setting introduced this time.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.200
I may hope that you confirm the environment that you use it first.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.460
Then saying good-bye which will meet you next week again.
