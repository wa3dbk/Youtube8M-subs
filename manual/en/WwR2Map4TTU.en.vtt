00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.290
If you’ve been to my website or read my
book, you’ll know that I advocate eating

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.800
more whole foods and eating less processed
foods.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.689
Processed foods are foods like breads, pastas,
anything that comes out of a box, anything

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.820
that comes out of a can, anything that comes
out of the freezer for that matter.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.970
And a whole food is something you find in
the produce section.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.820
The problem is most people don't know what
to do with whole foods once they get them.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.300
So in my opinion, one of the easiest ways
to eat more whole foods is to make stir fries.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.190
So in this video, I want to share with you
a few tips that I have on how to make really

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.940
delicious stir fries.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.059
My first tip is to use a pan that doesn't
have a toxic coating on it.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.199
Most pans have some sort of a toxic coating
where when you heat it up, when you put food

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.880
into it there’s some sort of toxin being
released into the food.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.930
So, for example, I use a pan called Green
Pan.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.300
It has a nontoxic coating on it.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.160
There are other pans out there that have nontoxic
coatings.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.839
There’s one made by Cuisinart and there's
others.

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.510
And you can also use a stainless steel pan
although there’re more expensive, but the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.120
idea is to use a pan that isn't going to put
toxins into your food, and above all, you

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.190
want to stay away from aluminum pans because
they definitely put toxins into your food.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.190
So, first off find a pan that has nontoxic
coding.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.980
Okay, the next thing you need is something
to fry your food in, like some sort of an

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.211
oil, and there are several good oils out there.

00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:34.130
There are several good oils out there, and
there's several bad oil, and unfortunately

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.890
most people use the bad oils.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.240
I talk a lot about oil in my book and on my
website so I won’t go into it too much here,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.510
but basically stay away from anything that
you buy in the conventional grocery store

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.790
for the most part.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.030
You need to go to health food store and get
a properly processed oil; cold-processed is

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.360
what you want.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.920
And what I recommend is coconut oil.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.920
I love coconut oil.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.270
It's very, very good for you.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.890
It works very well in high temperature.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.340
It doesn't matter which brand you buy as long
as you get it at health food store, and I

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.049
think if you start frying with coconut oil,
you are going to absolutely love it.

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.910
So, that's the first thing.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.300
Get coconut oil, melt that into your pan and
fry it with coconut oil.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.350
So, you next question is probably what should
you stir fry.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.890
And, this video isn't really about a recipe
per se it's about philosophy, or a way to

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.330
approach creating your stir fry.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.510
So, the basic idea is you start with dense
food first and then you work with less dense

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.510
food.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.340
So, if you have potatoes or burdock root or
something dense, you put that in first and

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.200
then something less dense like say broccoli,
and then something even less dense like leafy

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.200
greens.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.209
So, it doesn't matter.

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.710
Choose a bunch of vegetables.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.410
Dense goes in first, less dense next, leafy
greens or very, very light goes in last.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.760
So, as you put the vegetables into the pan,
you want to continually be stirring the vegetables

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.130
around so that they’re browning on all sides.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.390
Not dark brown, but you know just a little
bit brown so that's kind of the point of a

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.390
stir fry.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.270
Everything gets just a little bit of browned.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.080
Okay, now here's the fun part.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.530
Once your vegetables are slightly browned
what you want to do is add a little bit of

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.480
water and add a little bit of shoyu sauce.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.709
Now, shoyu sauce is basically a soy sauce.

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.060
There's tamari sauce and shoyu sauce.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.070
They're both different types of soy sauce.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.599
You add the soy sauce, the shoyu sauce, the
tamari sauce…You add the shoyu sauce to

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.319
your pan where the water is, and you add (oh,
I don’t know) maybe a tablespoon full, and

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.980
then you stir it all up.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.170
Stir all your vegetables, and then simultaneously
right after you’ve added your shoyu sauce,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.820
add a spice.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.180
And I like cumin.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.060
Cumin is an awesome earthy flavor.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.660
You can add any other spice as well like Mexican
spice seasoning, which is another favorite

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.340
of mine or any other kind of spice.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.560
And, once you blend all these flavors together
and you cook it for just another moment or

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.660
two, you will have an amazing stir fry.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.450
I guarantee it, and if you go to my website
and look under healthy recipes, you’ll actually

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.060
see me using these ingredients in stir fry
recipes that I’ve produced.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.970
And, feel free to watch any of those videos
as well because there I actually show you

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.139
how to do it, but this video is more about
philosophy so I hope that helps you.

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.849
You start off with a Green Pan or some sort
of non-toxic, nonstick pan.

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.889
Put coconut oil in, add some vegetables.

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.919
Stir fry it until they are slightly browned.

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:35.919
Add a little bit of water.

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.009
Add shoyu sauce.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.360
Add cumin or some other spice.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.419
Stir it a little bit more.

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.660
You'll have a delicious stir fry.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.050
I guarantee it.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.550
Okay, that’s it for now.
