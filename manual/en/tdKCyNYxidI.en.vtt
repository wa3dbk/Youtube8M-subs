00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.900
Hey, I'm Keri Glassman, here with some quick
and simple tips to help you feel just a little

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.270
bit better.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.380
The saying goes: We eat with our eyes first.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.269
And that can actually be a good thing.

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.890
Because the way your food looks is equally
as important as it being delicious.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.070
The colors of fruits and veggies you eat hold
a clue about their nutritional value, which

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.310
can tell you a lot about exactly how they
can benefit you.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.080
When it comes to general health, you can’t
really go wrong with vegetables.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.080
We know that.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.700
But if you’re interested in something specific,
like foods that will help your skin, for example,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.030
the color test is a great way to make sure
you’re getting what your body needs.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.489
And it’s way simple.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.820
Just eat at least one orange veggie and one
green veggie every day.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.320
As part of your daily vegetable consumption.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.320
No loopholes.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.340
You still gotta get in other fruits and veggies.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.469
So for beautiful skin, choose one orange and
one green.

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.660
Here’s why: Orange veggies, such as carrots,
squash, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes, contain

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.580
something called, carotenoids.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.250
Carotenoids are great for your skin.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.130
They help defend you from UV damage, prevent
acne breakouts, and even act, as what I call,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.070
a natural exfoliant.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.700
Green veggies, such as kale and spinach, are
full of vitamin C, which can help repair skin

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.689
by building collagen.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.600
Aka, reducing those fine lines.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.200
In general, choosing a variety of colors in
your fruits and vegetables will help you meet

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.560
your nutrient needs.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.560
We know that.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.180
But it will also keep your meals interesting.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.899
So remember: Color matters when it comes to
vegetables.

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.520
For healthier skin, make sure you eat at least
one green and one orange vegetable every day.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.020
And in general, a broad spectrum of color
in your produce will help you feel just a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.560
little bit better.
