00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.349
One cup of oatmeal and two bananas...

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.450
You may think I'm crazy but I wanna show

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.689

name is Paulo and welcome to my youtube

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:29.699
channel!  Today

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.150
as I said before, I'm gonna show you how
to bake delicious

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.980
Oatmeal cookies using just bananas and
a cup of

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.920
Oatmeal.  In today's world as people are getting used to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.430
eating more and more Whole Foods which
is

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.350
healthier for you,  these cookies that i'm
gonna bake here today

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.690
are just a great healthy treat without
all the sugar

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.289
and all the preservatives that exist out
there

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.890
nowadays.... so without further ado

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.609
I hope you guys are ready... let's get to
this!  So the first thing we're going to

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:04.080
do

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.420
is to peel the bananas...

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.680
and put them in a bowl

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.689
then get your Oatmeal and

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.940
dumped it in there... get your fork

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.070
and we're gonna start mashing... when you
do this

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.900
there's really not a right way

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.600
or wrong way to do this...  actually

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.540
using your hands probably will be the
best way

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.080
here's... so I'll mash first the banana with the fork

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.430
and then using my hands I'm gonna

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.340
mix it in with the oatmeal... and like I said

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.220
there's no wrong or right way to do this

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.250
just make sure it's all nice and mixed

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.350
getting in there... let me see if I can show you

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.280
and all that mixed in there

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.230
after you mixed it all up and you have a
nice

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.959
little consistent little mix right here
where the banana is all mixed into

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.080
the oatmeal, you're ready to put it on a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.150
baking tray which I have one

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.700
right here... pretty simple with a fork
just

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.180
grab a little bit and put it on one
side

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.640
a little bit more

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.050
and you go on that way

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.300
while you doing all this

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.220
you have preheated your oven to
about 400

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.350
degrees... right now all you have to do is

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.690
put them in the oven and let them cook
for about five minutes

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.910
and I'll be right back, I'll show you what
they look like!

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.390
