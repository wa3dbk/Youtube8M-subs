Hi, today on Wondermint Kids, we're making
Magical 4th of July Fruit Kabobs...This is what they will look like!

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.019
 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:16.618
 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.140
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.500
Alright!  This is what you'll need: Watermelon, a cookie cutter, skewers...

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.500
...raspberries, blueberries, and mini marshmallows.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.900
But you can use any kind of food that is red, white or blue!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.180
First, take your skewer...

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.520
...and a mini marshmallow...

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.239
...and slide the mini marshmallow on.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.269
Make sure you're sliding it onto the pointy
tip...

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.000
...and bringing it all the way to the bottom.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.500
Now, take a raspberry and put that on, too!

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.189
Then another marshmallow.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.100
And a blueberry.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.400
But you can put them in any order you like.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.090
 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.800
Now, take your cookie cutter and press that
into the watermelon.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.000
You might want to keep it near the edge, so that it's easier to take out.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.100
Put your star on to the skewer, too!

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.100
And, voila!  Here is your magic fruit kabob!

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.000
