Drones Are Not Toys! My drone just fell from the sky. I was flying
it, treating it not how it should be treated

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.290
and it fell from the sky because I didn't
see the battery indicators on there. So my

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:22.009
drone is completely broken and I need to stop
treating it like a toy. It's pretty clear

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.860
that I have been treating it like a toy. I
was flying it indoors, in Las Vegas, I let

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.860
it cut my hand because I tried to catch it.
Just really disappointed but it fell from

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.860
up there, hit the roof, snapped lost the GoPro
and a lot of stuff is damaged. Quite scared

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.880
to Amazon all this stuff and figure out how
much it's going to cost but got to 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:32.539
treat 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:51.329
her 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:04.939
with 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.790
more respect and she'll treat 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:56.269
me 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.440
with 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:18.900
more respect.
