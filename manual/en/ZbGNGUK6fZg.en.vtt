00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:09.900
I'm your roommate. I'm

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.880
basically a nice guy, but

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.929
me and you just never quite, hit it off.
Whatever,

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.509
different strokes.

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.589
But the thing is, there's been a tension
building between a since move in day.

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:22.980
We both know it,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.340
but everytime I try to talk to you about
it,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.740
you ain't jivin'.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.490
"Can't we just chill, broseph?"

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.099
When I try to talk to you about
how you turn on the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.190
heater like a sauna, how you

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.860
blast music at 6:30 in the morning every 
Sunday, and how,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.140
well, you just leave

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.350
your sweaty laundry laying around the room.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.280
Even though I don't even think it's
yours.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.250
Gotta hand it to you man,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.950
you're perfect at irretating me.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.660
"My bad bro."

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.940
"But we don't need to talk about it."

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.540
"Let's just have a laugh."

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.820
And then you keep doing it.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.720
You have a laugh with your friends, telling
them how much of a tightwad I am.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.530
and well, how you call me your B!@#%.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.860
My neighbors have told me everything.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.030
Well, let's play it your way,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.810
cowboy. I've licked five things in this
room that you are going to put in your mouth

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.810
in the next 24 hours.
Ahhhhhh.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.040
I've done things to your pillow 
that uh,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.270
no man should be proud of.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.430
Guess what these are for. 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.820
Have fun with pink eye.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.710
Also, you left your facebook open last night.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.950
Have fun explaining to your girlfriend why you are
hitting on her mom. 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.630
And then have fun explaining to her mom,

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.550
why you have to cancel this Friday
dates.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.189
Or maybe not,

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.190
that's your call. Now 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.110
you could have just talked about it, but you

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.460
don't want to.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.460
So let's just have a laugh, bro.

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:17.499
Talk to your roommate, you're an adult now
and you need to work out your problems on your own.

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.549
You'd be surprised how far a few words can take you.
