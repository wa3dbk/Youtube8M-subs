00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.800
Are you sure that new computer works?

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.120
Wait, I think I remember what that key is for.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.140
Yes, before the Decepticons betrayed me Megatron said something about a key that unlocks a powerful item.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.860
But, I do not remember what that item was.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:45.660
Windstorm, stay and watch the key. The Decepticons will stop at nothing to get their servos on that key. And Fusion, you guard the base. 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.620
This is the spot.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.440
Who...are you?

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.380
Why are you here?

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.440
Yes, that is correct.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.080
The Decepticons just want to destroy and conquer.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.160
Human, I must get you somewhere safe.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:56.220
Human, if I hurt you I am very, very sorry. This is actually my first time handling a human.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.160
You know you can't defeat me Lockdown.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.200
NO!!!

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.660
heh heh, got you back....

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.280
If you don't want to get killed, I suggest you stay away from us.
