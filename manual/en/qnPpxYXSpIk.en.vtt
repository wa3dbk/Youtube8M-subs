00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.320
Music... This is a button battery.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.410 position:72%
These coin sized batteries can increasingly be
found in products used in and around the home.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.290 position:63%
As button battery use increases, so
does battery related injuries and death.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.400 position:69%
Injuries from button batteries have
increased nearly seven fold in recent years.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.950 position:61%
When children swallow button batteries,
the batteries often pass right

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.930
through the gastro-intestinal
tract without any problem at all.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.280 position:58%
The catch is if that battery is large
enough to be stuck in the esophagus.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.330 position:69%
When they get stuck in the esophagus, they
can burn a hole right through the esophagus.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.450
The external current is generating
these small amounts of the alkali,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.090
or cause erosion right through
that Childs esophagus.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.980 position:63%
Imagine if it goes through a blood
vessel, you would have massive bleeding.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.810
So it's a very, very serious case.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.410 position:73%
It's especially a problem in younger children,
children 4 years of age or younger are the ones

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.500 position:58%
at most risk, although older children
occasionally swallow batteries

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.650
and have complications too.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.980 position:73%
The 20 millimeter lithium cell almost 13
percent of the time gets stuck in the esophagus

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.650
and causes a serious complication.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.150 position:75%
So that's why we are focusing on the problems
associated with this 20 millimeter lithium cell.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.050
Look around your home to see if
you have any button batteries.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.880 position:70%
They can be found in remote controls, games,
toys, electronic thermometers, talking books,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.960
bathroom scales, and hearing
aid s. Just to name a few.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.550
How accessible are your button
batteries in your home?

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.830 position:69%
Here are a few safety tips to help keep your
kids safe.Keep remotes and other electronics

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.900 position:75%
out of your child's reach if the battery
compartments do not have a screw to secure them.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.420
Tape may be used to help
secure the battery compartment.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.260 position:75%
Keep button batteries out of your child's reach.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.860
Discard batteries carefully.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.190
Do not allow children to
play with button batteries.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.310 position:73%
Never put your batteries in your mouth for any
reason, they are easily swallowed accidentally.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.720 position:73%
Always check medications before ingesting them.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.250 position:63%
Adults have swallowed batteries mistaken
for pills or tablets.If you suspect

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.300 position:73%
that your child has swallowed a button battery,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.750
then your child needs urgent
medical intervention.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.250 position:70%
You need to take your child to the
emergency department for an x-ray right away.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.580
Don't wait; go straight to
the emergency department.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.590 position:58%
You can call the battery ingestion
hotline at 202-625-3333 for guidance,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:39.950 position:69%
but get yourself on the way to the emergency
department as you make that phone call.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.090
