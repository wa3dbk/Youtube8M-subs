00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:07.380
Alright guys, this is my review for the Lenovo
G570 laptop. I just picked this up a few days

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.650
ago, here it is getting out of the box. Nothing
fancy here, just kind of throw in there as

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:21.680
you can see. Some Styrofoam and bubble wrap.
Not the greatest pack job but this is a budget

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.600
laptop. This is something that’s cheap and
dirty. So there’s the 6 cell lithium ion

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.599
battery and the wall adapter. The wall adapter
is pretty compact but you still need this

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.330
power cord. The manual.. this is the Japanese
model so I’m not really going to be reading

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.290
that. This is a size comparison with my Macbook
Pro power brick. As you can see, the Lenovo’s…

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.310
you know it’s not too bad. But not too elegant.
So I’m just checking out the laptop here.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.390
Oh yea, I’m going to pop in the battery
for the first time. This is real easy. The

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:05.619
battery sits flush with the unit. And brings
the overall weight to around 2.6 kilograms.

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.079
So I’ll just plug in the power here and
fire it up. Oh yea, ok, here’s some ports:

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.770
Headphone jacks, DVD slot drive, and a USB
port. On the front you got the WiFi switch,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.590
a row of LED light. Gods knows what they mean,
and you have (what is this) a memory card

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.719
slot. So on the left side you have the hole
for the lock, VGA out, LAN, HDMI out, USB

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:37.450
plus e-SATA, USB and USB. All the USB ports
are 2.0. So you can see the hinge is pretty

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.960
strong on this sucker. It might loosen up
over time, who knows. It’s quite a handsome

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.969
unit, the keyboard has these island style
keys I really like. The trackpad is an average

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.909
size with two good buttons on there. I’m
just trying out the DVD drive here. You can

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:01.109
actually get a Blu-ray drive in this thing
if you want. So the trackpad has a nice textured

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.729
surface so your finger won’t stick to it.
The trackpad buttons are pretty large and

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.500
well placed. And the keyboard is really nice.
You have these sort of curved keys. And here’s

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.750
a better shot at it. You can see that textured
surface so that your finger never really sticks

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.049
to it. And this is brushed aluminum on the
deck of the laptop and it’s a really nice

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.560
feature for a budget laptop. It feels great
on the wrists. I’m going to power it up

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.909
for the first time. Or the second time – I
think this is when I installed an English

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.629
copy of Windows. So I just rebooted the machine
holding down F12 and it booted off the DVD

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.730
and here it is with everything installed.
And I’m just kind of man-handling the unit,

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.689
just seeing if there are any creaks or shakes
or rattles and there isn’t. It’s actually

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.859
quite a solid unit. You know, I was kind of
surprised considering it’s just a hunk of

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:54.500
plastic. But it feels quite solid and it’s
not too bad. The lid on the other hand, it’s

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.780
got this glossy, plastic lid. It just looks
kind of cheap and I wish they went with something

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.790
with a matte finish on it, but, you know,
you can’t ask for everything.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.780
Ok, here’s a little viewing angle comparison
with my MacBook Pro from four years ago. The

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.620
display just isn’t very good on this budget
laptop. The Lenovo, you can see the angles

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.930
just aren’t too great. Here’s the light
diffusion from my overhead light. You can

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.390
see, it just reflects it back into your face
because it’s a glossy screen, whereas the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.159
matte display on the Macbook Pro diffuses
it much better. Well, this notebook has a

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.900
Synaptics trackpad which I’m quite happy
about. You can do two-finger scrolling. You

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.660
can do pinch-to-zoom, and some other gestures.
Unfortunately, the trackpad isn’t that large.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.110
So using these advanced gestures feels a little
bit constrained. As I mentioned before, it’s

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.549
quite a handsome unit when you look at it
with the lid open. But these are the function

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.519
keys. You can see the function key on the
left hand side, but the brightness and volume

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.069
controls are over the arrow keys. This means
you can only adjust these settings with two

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.829
hands! Some of the other functions are adjustable
with one hand, but they’re not really vital

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.359
function, like setting the video out, like
I’m doing right here. I’m just going to

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.280
test out the HDMI out. You can see right now
it works just fine if you’re going to use

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.280
this as an HTPC. It’s really just plug-and-play.
So here’s a video stress test. This is a

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:24.620
little clip. HD 1080p and it spikes up to
42 megabits per second. So this is really

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.130
stressing the video capabilities. And of course
the core i5 Sandy Bridge processor handles

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.280
it no problem as long as you have the right
codecs. I noticed that VideoLan player couldn’t

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.780
play this clip smoothly, but Media Player
Classic did the job just fine for it.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.090
So here’s a little gaming stress test. This
is (let me see) Battlefield Bad Company 2.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.610
So this is a fairly modern game. I got it
on native resolution, lowest settings possible,

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.650
and unfortunately it’s just not really playable.
I know it looks kinda OK in this video but

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.652
it’s choppy. As soon as the effects go,
here I am in a multiplayer game, as soon as

00:04:58.652 --> 00:05:04.120
the guns start firing and the particle effects
and the dust, the frame rate takes a hit and

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.259
you can’t play competitively online. So
maybe you can play single player, but this

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:14.479
game was meant for online play of course and
I just found it unplayable. My Xbox 360 version

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.870
looked much better as well as much smoother
and all that. So this is going to sort of

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.389
wrap up my review. As you can see the unit,
has this minimalist kind of understated look,

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:31.090
and it’s much nicer than the other budget
15 inch notebooks that I looked at. Now things

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.009
that I like about this laptop, I like the
fact that it’s pretty powerful. It has the

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:39.730
Sandy Bridge Core i5 processor, so it’s
going to handle everything I want to do as

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.759
long as it doesn’t involve heavy gaming.
What I also really like is the keyboard and

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.460
Synaptics trackpad; although I wish the trackpad
was a little bit bigger. What I really didn’t

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.849
like about this laptop is the poor display.
It’s LED backlit, but the viewing angles

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.490
are pretty atrocious, the contrast is not
very good and the brightness is also pretty

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.590
poor. But it is par for the course for a budget
15-inch notebook. So that’s my review of

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.919
the Lenovo G570. I hope you enjoyed it. Visit
