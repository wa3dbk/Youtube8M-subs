HORRIFYING SEMI TRUCK CRASH

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.740
LEFT TWO PEOPLE DEAD.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.140
TROOPERS SAY A SEMI TRUCK

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.350
PULLED OFF AND GETTING BACK ON

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.210
THE ROAD IN THE NORTHBOUND

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.850
LANES NEAR STATE ROAD 50 WHEN

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.680

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.880
ANOTHER TRUCK.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.560
TWO PEOPLE FROM THAT TRUCK WERE

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.090
EJECTED AND KILLED.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.520

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.360
DETAILS.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.560
Reporter: AN EARLY START

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.760
AFTER THE DAY THAT A SEMI TRUCK

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.160
REAR ENDED ANOTHER ONE ON THE

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.020
TURNPIKE.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.340
A SEVERE COLLISION THAT KILLED

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.930
TWO SOUTH FLORIDA MEN IN THIS

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.690
SEMI TRUCK.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.870
THEIR FIRST CAB COMPLETELY

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.730
DISINTEGRATED AS TROOPERS SAY

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.110
THE DRIVER GOING FULL SPEED

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.430
NEVER SLOWED DOWN AS THE SEMI

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.770
TRIED GETTING BACK ON THE ROAD.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.270
THAT TRUCK HAD PULLED OVER TO

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.770
CHECK A TIRE.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.880
HE SAID HE WAS GOING ABOUT

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.320
BETWEEN 40 AND 45 MILES PER

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.380
HOUR WHEN ANOTHER NORTHBOUND

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.180
SEMI OR WHATEVER REASON DOESN'T

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.950
NOTICE HE IS GOING SLOWER AND

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.790
REAR ENDS HIM.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.020
Reporter: THE ONLY THING LEFT

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.680
ON THIS FRONT CAB, THE

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.920
PASSENGER DOOR.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.830
UNFORTUNATELY THAT -- IN

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.490
THIS TYPE OF CRASH, SEAT BELTS

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.630
PROBABLY WOULD NOT PLAY A ROLE

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.660
IN SAVING SOMEBODY BECAUSE OF

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.460
THE SEVERITY OF THE CRASH.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.660

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.170
AND THE DRIVER 35 YEARS OLD

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.810
FROM MIAMI WERE HE EJECTED FROM

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.940
THE TRUCK CARRYING FLOWERS AND

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.910
COMING FROM SOUTH FLORIDA.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.050
ONE OF THE WORST SEM I

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.120
COLLISIONS HE HAS EVER SEEN

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.320
BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE SEMI

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.090
THAT REAR-ENDED THE ONE GETTING

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.360
BACK ON THE ROAD IS COMPLETELY

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.220
DEMOLISHED.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.630
Reporter: THE SIGNIFICANT

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.560
DEBRIS FIELD SHUT DOWN THREE

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.650
LANES BETWEEN THE WEST COLONIAL

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.990
RIDE AND AVALON 429 EXITS

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.870
CAUSING LONG DELAYS FOR HOURS

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.040
DURING THE MORNING COMMUTE.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.370
TROOPERS NOW LOOKING TO

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.310
DETERMINE WHETHER 54-YEAR-OLD

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.230
LARRY JONES FROM ORLANDO

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.900
DRIVING THIS RECYCLE

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.900
DRIVING THIS RECYCLING TRUCK

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.580
HAD A LEGITIMATE KNOWLEDGE STOP

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.240
ON THE SIDE OF THE LIMITED

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.500
ACCESS HIGHWAY.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.670
HE THOUGHT HE HAD A SAFETY

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.580
ISSUE WITH THE TIRE.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.090
SO THAT IS A LEGITIMATE REASON

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.940
TO BE STOPPED ON THE SIDE ROAD.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.090
THEY CAN'T STAY THERE.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.410
WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG HE WAS

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.360
THERE.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.510
WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT.
