00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.740
With Allison we really get inside

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.770
that world.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.660
You go from the very very personal intimate detail

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.820
really detailed, that's what people relate to "oh this is

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.369
what she was like as a kid" and this
is you know

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.539
looking at maps of Pennsylvania those
kinds of specifics

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.030
playing duets with her father on
the piano in the points of connection and

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.070
you know what she wants to wear and all
those details

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.169
help people get inside

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.340
a very specific experience and it moves from there

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.750
out into the world.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.920
It's like knowing a life, it's life writing

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.840
it's very vivid and you learn about
yourself, you learn about other people

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.559
from reading it.

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.670
There's often those moments when you see sort of layers

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.170
time or layers of generation all in one
frame

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.920
and so you get a sense that something's
being handed to you in this kind of

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.360
digestible nugget

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.410
but also invited to kinda go quite
literally

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.600
deep into each individual frame.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.399
It's obvious that she's like obsessive. She goes over things

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.060
again and again in her head and she even
talks about her obsessions when she was a

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.000
young kid like 10 or 12

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.960
and it's funny I mean I think so many
cartoonists that I know they have this

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.520
real attention to detail whether it's verbal

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.100
or factual or details of events or

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.050
images where it's like you experience
things and you have to

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.350
in order to keep them alive and
understand them you have to constantly be

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.630
turning them around in your head.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.600
Part of what's interesting about relationships in

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.729
Alison Bechdel's work is the way, not only do different characters

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:59.880
have relationships

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.880
but there's relationships within one
character across time

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.850
and there's something really interesting
tout the way those characters are sort of

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.640
thinking back on earlier versions of
themselves and not just in some

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.000
judgment oriented way

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.129
"oh I was young and I wish I knew better" but really reveling

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.010
in moments a younger self realized
something.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.319
Alison takes up a kind of space

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.879
in the work that is not defensive

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.769
that is expansive that opens windows

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.280
so that lots of people can see

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.859
themselves through this specifically

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.659
lesbian story.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.500
She managed to examine her life

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.609
I think intellectually

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.109
and her intellect gave voice to her
heart in a sense

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.919
and it's very powerful.

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.950
All of her work takes really seriously

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.169
that one's personal life and daily life
is

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:13.269
actually a way to make change and so
that's another reason I think of it as

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.829
an important feminist intervention that probably

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.140
could only happen through some sort of
popular form like this.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.960
One of the things that was so
great about Dykes to Watch Out For

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.940
is that you could drop into it

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.310
at any moment and understand what was
going on.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.489
They were and they remain sort of

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.930
the one of the few cultural
representations

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.299
of lesbian life as we've really
experienced it

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.849
and it was amazing how in just

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.919
a few short images, she could really

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.109
capture a story in a sense of a
community, in a sense of a

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.659
world, in a sense of politics and I feel like
she's made the world larger.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.739
She's made the world larger

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.979
and she's I think

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.790
a huge imaginative gift

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.830
to everyone that reads it.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.540
So Alison I want to know what Moe from Dykes to Watch Out For is up to now

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.950
I think if you were Spice Girl you
would be Sporty Spice

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.450
not Posh, not Scary, but Sporty Spice

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.030
Am i right?
