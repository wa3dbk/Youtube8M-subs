The opportunites for recreational use
of Assateague are endless.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:41.000
I think it's really special because it's one of kind on the east coast.  It's almost wilderness out on the island.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:52.000
Of course the biggest draw here at Assateague seems to be the wild horses but there are many other animals that frequent the island.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It's our favorite place!

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.290
Assateague state parks a great place to
bring the family, spend some time in nature.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.670
It's also nice to get the distinction between Ocean City and Assateague.

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.500
Came down here today to get some surfing in, spread out a little bit, and just take in something different.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.000
Be prepared to love it!

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.500
It's a great place for a family to be a family again.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.000
We've been to state parks all over Maryland but this one's on the beach.  Definately one of the best.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This is very nice...
