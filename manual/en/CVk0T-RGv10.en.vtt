&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;PEGGY: It works like this.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.559
First you download the free app on your phone,
register your security information, then scan

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.280
your credit card of choice.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.089
You only need to do this set up once.

to reward you as the customer.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.119
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: Bill says it saved him money because
unlike credit card companies that charge the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.039
merchant a swipe fee plus up to 5Êpercent
of each sale, level up charges a 2Êpercent

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.189
flat rate per sale.

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.159
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: It doesn't cost me anything to use,
the system hasÊ as opposed to a credit card

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.560
trans action.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.689

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.450
But is it secure?

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.780
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: By default you're linking your credit
card.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.940
So you start with all the pro protections
of your credit card then we layer a bunch

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.960
of security on top of that.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.490
You can pin lock the app.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.330
If someone happens to get your phone, it needs
your special pin to access it.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:48.940
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;PEGGY: The evolution of money is nothing
new.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.220

mungtds, it has 2500 merchants nationwide.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.780
Level up does not partner with banks because
pre pf batch says his ult ultimate goal is

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.220
to improve the nation's economy.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.670
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: Credit card processing fees in 2011
were 50 billion dollars.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.710
That's 50Êbillion dollars out of businesses
and consumer pockets that kind of goes to

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.710
waste.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.420
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;PEGGY: Financial institutions aren't
likely to let go of those kinds of profits.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:01.140
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: They may seek other sources of revenue,
higher fees elsewhere to make up for any revenue

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.280
they lose from the transactions fees.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.890
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;PEGGY: Mean while, the market for mobile
payment is projected to nearly triple in value

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:19.320
