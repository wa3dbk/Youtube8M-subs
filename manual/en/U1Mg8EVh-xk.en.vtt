00:00:03.822 --> 00:00:05.295
- Hello, everybody!

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:08.465
Today we are going to make really cold

00:00:08.465 --> 00:00:11.299
summer food, side dish.

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.432
It's called Oi-naengguk.

00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:16.531
Oi is a cucumber. It's cold cucumber soup.

00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:19.141
Today I don't cook, just I mix.

00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:21.773
First, you need English cucumber.

00:00:21.773 --> 00:00:23.510
Seedless cucumber is the best,

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.537
but English cucumber is not
available in your country,

00:00:26.537 --> 00:00:30.042
any type of cucumber without seed.

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:32.754
If you have seeds,
scrape out with a spoon,

00:00:32.754 --> 00:00:35.792
and then just a seeds are not pretty, eh?

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:38.595
And then, only a flesh you can use.

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:41.267
This is around 12 ounce cucumber.

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:44.894
I just take it out from my
refrigerator and wash this.

00:00:44.894 --> 00:00:47.566
And very clean and cold right now.

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:51.436
This recipe, just before
serving, you gotta make this.

00:00:51.436 --> 00:00:53.626
So easy. Let's start.

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:57.863
My mixing bowl is in the fridge
right now. I'll bring it.

00:00:58.151 --> 00:00:59.965
This is cold.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.485
Let's tip this guy

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:06.605
and cut thinly, diagonally, like this.

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:12.126
So this inch, it's going
the be around three inches

00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:13.645
from here and here.

00:01:14.127 --> 00:01:17.607
(chopping)

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:23.940
to make nice
matchsticks, thin matchstick,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.695
from the beginning you
should cut this thinly

00:01:39.524 --> 00:01:42.740
(fast chopping)

00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:57.084
Put this in my mixing bowl.

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:01.828
One garlic clove.

00:02:06.404 --> 00:02:08.635
Green onion, one green onion.

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:14.974
(chopping)

00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:23.253
All minced garlic and green onion.

00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:25.722
And let's add.

00:02:28.936 --> 00:02:31.943
Next, I will use this red chili pepper.

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:33.914
It's very hot, spicy.

00:02:33.914 --> 00:02:37.042
So you should not use whole one chili.

00:02:37.042 --> 00:02:38.912
And this is optional.

00:02:38.912 --> 00:02:41.848
So if you like to make a non
spicy version, skip this.

00:02:41.848 --> 00:02:44.139
But I will use just a little bit.

00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:49.706
gives a little spicy
kick and good flavor.

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:55.968
So far, too easy, isn't it?

00:02:55.968 --> 00:02:57.620
And then, let's season!

00:02:57.797 --> 00:03:00.397
I'm going to add one
and half teaspoons salt,

00:03:00.397 --> 00:03:02.415
one and half.

00:03:04.603 --> 00:03:07.129
And then, soy sauce, one teaspoon.

00:03:07.448 --> 00:03:09.587
And sugar, two teaspoons.

00:03:11.714 --> 00:03:14.866
We made a sweet and salty.
We need sour stuff.

00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:17.459
This a white vinegar, four teaspoons.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.002
One tablespoon plus one teaspoon, right?

00:03:21.308 --> 00:03:22.974
And then, mix.

00:03:30.363 --> 00:03:34.920
Mix well until sugar,
salt is well combined.

00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:38.239
Later, I'm going to garnish
on top, sesame seeds.

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.205
This is toasted, home toasted sesame seeds.

00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:45.981
And also, the small cherry
tomatoes are really pretty,

00:03:45.981 --> 00:03:49.137
so I'm going to also use
cherry tomato on top.

00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:50.640
Now, let's cut it.

00:03:51.518 --> 00:03:54.907
(chopping)

00:03:57.826 --> 00:04:00.366
Sesame seeds, these toasted sesame seeds,

00:04:00.366 --> 00:04:02.343
I'm going to grind these.

00:04:07.436 --> 00:04:10.257
It gives really nutty flavor, really tasty.

00:04:13.176 --> 00:04:15.015
If you don't have like mortar and pestle,

00:04:15.015 --> 00:04:17.138
your two finger, index and thumb,

00:04:17.138 --> 00:04:19.877
and using just crush like this.

00:04:19.877 --> 00:04:23.902
You know, make around one
tablespoon amount like this.

00:04:23.902 --> 00:04:25.608
Easily, you can do.

00:04:26.587 --> 00:04:29.025
This is our serving bowl?

00:04:29.025 --> 00:04:31.017
And this is cold water.

00:04:39.817 --> 00:04:43.464
And then pour one cup water. Cold water.

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:51.964
Slightly mix this.

00:04:52.577 --> 00:04:55.732
This is ice. We need ice.

00:04:55.747 --> 00:05:00.405
Ice cube, seven to eight,
around one cup amount.

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.465
Then, I'm going to just
crush this, like this.

00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:21.424
Sesame seeds.

00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:30.317
Today, we made Oi-naengguk,
it's a cold cucumber soup.

00:05:30.317 --> 00:05:32.084
Really, really, really cold.

00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:35.091
You have to serve right
now, when it's really cold.

00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:39.490
And I made gimbap because I
felt like eating some gimbap,

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.359
you know, today, so I made this.

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:43.899
It goes well with Oi-naengguk.

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:45.754
So, gimbap.

00:05:51.173 --> 00:05:53.844
Something like a ladle or any large spoon,

00:05:53.844 --> 00:05:57.248
for the people individual,
you can share together.

00:05:57.248 --> 00:05:59.062
So like this.

00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:09.505
Mmm!

00:06:12.056 --> 00:06:12.978
(slurp)

00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:19.918
Mmm!

00:06:20.203 --> 00:06:24.744
Cold, very refreshing and
sweet, sour, little salty.

00:06:24.744 --> 00:06:29.041
This a perfect when you eat
with rice or gimbap like this.

00:06:29.041 --> 00:06:33.145
When I traveled Europe, I was
crazy about gazpacho soup.

00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:36.487
You guys, if you are Europeans,
probably you know that.

00:06:36.487 --> 00:06:39.352
It reminded me of Oi-naengguk,

00:06:39.352 --> 00:06:42.522
even though usually Oi-naengguk,
we don't add tomatoes.

00:06:42.522 --> 00:06:45.589
But ever since I came back from travel

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:48.129
and then I was thinking
about gazpacho soup,

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:51.634
is that also, I started adding tomato.

00:06:51.634 --> 00:06:53.838
I just always realized when I travel,

00:06:53.838 --> 00:06:57.008
so many different kinds of
food from different cultures,

00:06:57.008 --> 00:06:59.903
but similar kind of way of making it.

00:06:59.903 --> 00:07:02.077
So you probably, all
of you guys know this.

00:07:02.077 --> 00:07:05.978
Today, we made Oi-naengguk,
cold cucumber soup.

00:07:05.978 --> 00:07:07.512
Enjoy my recipe.

00:07:07.512 --> 00:07:10.373
See you next time. Bye!

00:07:11.525 --> 00:07:15.239
(upbeat music)
