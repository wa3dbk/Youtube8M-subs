00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.928
400 art objects are on exhibition at Bad Ragartz in Heidiland.

00:00:18.146 --> 00:00:21.263
Around 80 artists from 17 countries

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:24.820
will be presenting their works in Europe's biggest sculpture park

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.881
until the end of November.

00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:30.270
This is the fifth year Bad Ragartz has taken place.

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:35.052
This year's motto is 'See values, worth seeing'.

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:38.475
The open-air exhibition is free of charge.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.805
Stroll through the natural surroundings

00:00:41.964 --> 00:00:43.842
and let the works sink in along the

00:00:44.013 --> 00:00:46.095
ten-kilometre sculpture trail.

00:00:46.256 --> 00:00:52.635
This art spectacular is all thanks
to the hard work of the doctor and patron of the arts

00:00:52.787 --> 00:00:56.040
Rolf Hohenmeister and his wife Esther.

00:00:56.205 --> 00:01:00.619
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
Great art is putting the right art
in the right landscape.

00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:03.249
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
To create a symphony

00:01:03.403 --> 00:01:08.429
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
of impressions, and in Bad Ragaz
the result is especially lovely,

00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:13.493
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
as we're in the Bündner
Herrschaft, the Rhine Valley.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.592
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
The weather and the
climate here are great.

00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:18.878
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
Not to mention the
lanscape with its hills,

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:20.863
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
plateaus and parks.

00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:25.971
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
We're also very grateful to the
municipality, Grand Resorts,

00:01:26.093 --> 00:01:31.567
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
and individuals who've opened
up the streets and squares.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:36.314
When organising this art event, everyone sticks together.

00:01:36.507 --> 00:01:39.931
A lot of passion goes into the exhibition.

00:01:40.123 --> 00:01:42.173
That's felt not just by the artists

00:01:42.244 --> 00:01:43.337
but by visitors too.

00:01:43.975 --> 00:01:49.982
At the last exhibition there were over 400,000 visitors.

00:01:50.328 --> 00:01:52.229
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
Our aim is to bring people joy.

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:56.336
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
We can feel that now.
The joy returning.

00:01:56.517 --> 00:02:01.509
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
It's lovely
to experience that.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.874
The international response to
the sculpture exhibition is positive.

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:10.742
It takes a great deal to present
visitors with

00:02:10.904 --> 00:02:12.224
 a treat like this.

00:02:12.562 --> 00:02:14.303
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
It takes more than idealism.

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:20.569
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
It takes perseverance and a lot of money.

00:02:20.734 --> 00:02:21.939
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
Quality comes at a price,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.292
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
you can't get it for free.

00:02:24.454 --> 00:02:27.212
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
What we want, as my dear
wife Esther says,

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.530
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
is to offer people
a gift.

00:02:29.595 --> 00:02:30.956
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
The doors are all open,

00:02:31.286 --> 00:02:33.232
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
no barriers,
no charge,

00:02:33.304 --> 00:02:35.570
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
you can see it all for free.

00:02:35.644 --> 00:02:38.155
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
You just have to be prepared
to encounter art.

00:02:38.687 --> 00:02:42.321
The sculptures at Bad Ragartz
are not the only way

00:02:42.322 --> 00:02:45.725
to gain a fresh perspective
and a special experience, for free:

00:02:45.883 --> 00:02:50.013
another way is the innovative
Swiss air-cushioned shoe, the kyBoot.

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:54.184
Throughout the exhibition
the Thergofit back therapy centre

00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:57.700
in Bad Ragaz is hiring out shoes
to visitors for free.

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.652
These special shoes with their soft, supple soles

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:03.934
will stop the tour being spoiled by painful feet

00:03:04.507 --> 00:03:07.078
and knees, tired, heavy legs or a tense back.

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:12.524
Dr Rolf Hohmeister and his wife
tried out this great experience.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:15.129
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
For me, as a doctor, it was my

00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:17.705
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
dream that something like this would be developed.

00:03:17.887 --> 00:03:30.018
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
This footwear with its
cushioning can reduce the force,

00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:33.803
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
the jolting and the
shocks.

00:03:34.586 --> 00:03:37.584
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
It's a feeling that goes through your muscles,

00:03:37.724 --> 00:03:42.151
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
tendons and joints into your
spine and thus up to your head.

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:44.582
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
My first, spontaneous feeling was really:

00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:50.221
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
isn't it nice that you can discover
something new at 70.

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:54.064
When Rolf Hohmeister describes the feeling of walking in kyBoots

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.493
he cannot hide his delight.

00:03:56.702 --> 00:04:04.162
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
You float, you sail through the
countryside with a bounce in your step;

00:04:04.314 --> 00:04:07.966
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
when you stop you feel
fine standing about:

00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:15.078
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
you're relaxed and have
a coordination and balance

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:21.127
[ Rolf &amp; Esther Hohmeister ]
that I'd say goes up to your brain
and makes it feel all the better.“

00:04:21.334 --> 00:04:24.391
Bad Ragartz is certainly
well worth a visit.

00:04:24.548 --> 00:04:26.409
As well as amazing art,

00:04:26.602 --> 00:04:28.019
a lovely landscape

00:04:28.192 --> 00:04:30.583
and unique experiences
you can also experience

00:04:30.584 --> 00:04:33.272
a special way of walking
free of charge, at no obligation.

00:04:33.453 --> 00:04:36.396
It appeals to all the senses.

00:04:36.574 --> 00:04:41.729
It will make your trip to Bad Ragaz
an unforgettable experience.
