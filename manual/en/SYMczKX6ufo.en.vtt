00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.370
Shut Up! Cartoons

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.430
I need more pressure!

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.500
We're losing him!

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.510
Not on my watch! Forceps!

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.199
Forceps!

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:14.270
This is a can opener!

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.240
Pressure's dropping!!

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.970
Don't you die on me, dammit! DON'T. YOU.
DIE. ON. ME!

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.700
It's no use. We lost 'im.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.280
Guys, forget the TV. This is a good chance
to engage in some old-fashioned conversation.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.320
What do you say?

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.789
Why do you guys always have to be such colossal
jerks?!

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.699
All right, Tanzy, relax: Tonight will be "Conversation
Night". How 'bout you kick things off and

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:42.699
we'll try not to die of boredom.

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.489
What's on your mind, Tanzy?

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.489
I was just thinking back to the time Rogi
competed in that big dance contest.

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:09.679
I'm king of the world!

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.430
Tanzy, what the hell are you talking about?

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.590
I ain't never been in no dance contest! Though
I have been known to bust a move.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.840
That's ridiculous! I remember it vividly!

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.200
Maybe Ninja girl confused with time she start
riot at karaoke bar.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.659
Now THAT I would have remembered!

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.659
I will swear to the fact that I've never
sung karaoke!

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.850
Well, there's no way you guys could forget
that time Andre fell in love with Bartleby.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.660
That's ridiculous! My relationship with Andre
has always been completely professional. The

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.250
very idea that he might have romantic feelings
towards me is absurd!

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.580
This is crazy. Why are we all having memories
no one else can recall?

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.860
Well, while you losers sort out your brain
farts I gotta go drop some kids off at the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.330
pool if you know what I mean. Laterz!

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.420
Great news, Ninjas! I've successfully tested my
latest invention: The "Flash Forwarder!"

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.380
A device that allows people see brief flashes
of the future!

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.690
That explains it! We're not remembering
the past. We're seeing things that are yet

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.210
to happen!

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.210
Wow, guys! While I was on the crapper just
now I had the greatest memory of all!

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.980
Look out!

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.980
Thank you, Mr. Gay Zombie Centaurcorn!

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.980
Holy ----! It's Zombie Megan Fox!

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:56.910
Then what happened?

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.950
That's just it. The memory ends right there!

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.010
Dr. Braynes, are these future events that
will happen, or might happen?

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.060
I'm not sure. The machine needs more work
to enable longer glimpses into the future.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.060
And for that to happen, someone is going to
have to come up with a lot of money.

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.889
What the ---- are we looking at?
