00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.220
Today on our 2004 Ford Expedition, we&amp;#39;ll
be installing the universal kit for trailer

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.470
break controller 7 way RV and 4 way flat with
10 gauge wires. Part number ETBC7. This vehicle

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.290
already has a 4 way flat installed on the
back. We&amp;#39;re going to go ahead and do a

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.430
quick test to make sure everything&amp;#39;s working
fine here. Now that we&amp;#39;ve done that, we&amp;#39;re

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.530
going to go ahead and mount our bracket. We&amp;#39;ll
need to mount the bracket that will hold the

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.840
7 and 4 way. Now because this has a factory
hitch on it, there&amp;#39;s a little tab here

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.800
that the 4 flat used used to sit up in. we&amp;#39;re
going to go ahead and drill a couple small

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.550
holes to attach our bracket that holds the
7 and 4 way to the factory 4 way bracket that&amp;#39;s

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.519
part of the hitch. We&amp;#39;ll go ahead and
use a paint marker and mark our holes, then

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.540
we&amp;#39;ll drill the holes on the bracket on
the hitch, followed by drilling the on the

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.309
bracket that hold the 7 and 4 way. Once that&amp;#39;s
done, we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and use 2 of the

00:00:51.309 --> 00:01:36.270
bolts, washers, lock washers and knots that
come with the kit to hold it in place. Next

00:01:36.270 --> 00:02:42.040
we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and attach 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:03:16.730
our 7 and 4 way plug to 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:49.340
the bracket 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:04:10.680
we just installed.
