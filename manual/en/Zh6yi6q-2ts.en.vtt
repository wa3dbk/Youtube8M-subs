00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.800
habits hehe

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.640
without these candies in america

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.400
right here

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.919
scare pc

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.239
is very much

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:16.119
and he can't

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.300
elected statewide in two hundred

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.900
expect that but he affordable care abt
is it

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.410
the reality

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.990
it's time for a bomb

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.990
talents

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.990
cantonese at that point

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.200
to have you used to be

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.200
treaties will be that he says

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.389
are long back live

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:53.570
because it's got what i like to call

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.740
the full republican

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.400
which is three things you have no
nothingness rights as an awakening all

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.480
you have over the top rhetoric

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.650
and you have up comparisons that make no
sense

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.160
look you got the hunger games in their
and then i got health care is somewhere

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.540
and then you got rich districts in

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.840
and uh... district one that look

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.980
i don't see the connection

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.520
i can see in a tent at making a
connection but i don't see a connection

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.310
it's like when i was given a human

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.460
uh... you know opt-out stalin tyler

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.540
revolutionary more bad things

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.120
i rest my case

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.450
i_c_i_ several of those were the same
sentence obviously they're connected

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.110
no nude they're not connected

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.710
you're just making it up as you go along
like republicans always do

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.490
but actually i i know it's useless to
even try the breakdown proclaims in and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.090
described how

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.610
they're wrong villains do anywhere from
a hell of it because of course it's

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.830
deepak and they haven't said anything
true the entire time has been going on

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.020
first on the affordable care act is
uh... is on a portable

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.369
it carts the deficit

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.490
it cuts the deficit by two hundred
twenty seven billion dollars over ten

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.300
years

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.329
it's not unaffordable it's unaffordable
knocked to do it if anything

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.069
what these guys are making into a little
bit a research is a little bit before

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.829
you go out there talk about something
you know nothing about

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.409
and by the way i can explain why it cuts
the deficit to this is what a lot of

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.579
people with guys on the right sale
socialized medicine is going to the

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:24.140
deficit

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.709
well no it's not socialized medicine and
it's not going to the deficit

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.959
that obama's plan the affordable
character obama care as it's called

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.379
it came from a right wing think tank the
heritage foundation

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.579
they'd birth the idea and came up with
the idea of the individual mandate why

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.999
because it's a pro-business idea it's a
very business from the idea and makes

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:45.829
people go into the private market

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.379
and by their insurance that way now i'm
in favor of the medicare for all system

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.120
on the fear of a single-payer system so
it's not my favorite you know system but

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.709
it's better than nothing spend what we
have a four and again it cuts the

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.159
deficit because of people have to pay
for their own pocket then the taxpayer

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.760
stopped picking up the slack in the
temporal people that don't pay for other

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.249
pocket

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.459
a little bit of research please

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:10.999
and then

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:15.379
uh... they go to of the logo kill people

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.849
okay did you know that before obon the
care was passed

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.079
forty five thousand people die every
year in the united states of america do

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.939
tell lacking basic coverage

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.389
so beloit won't kill people

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:32.189
buggin

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.110
black of the law

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.479
would kill people

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:38.989
now again i have massive issues with the
vomit care you guys know it really is

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.089
not my favorite

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:42.729
my favorite system

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:46.209
and i could point to or whole bunch of
provisions that make sense that are

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.969
absolutely perfect my point to a bunch
that are going to be problematic right

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:54.819
but to just go out there in the black
and white didactic way of saying

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.529
i mean uh... essentially what this
speech one of them too and republican or

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:03.049
the other speech did see pat boil down
to and i will just go out there and go

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.409
obama

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.489
badge

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.089
