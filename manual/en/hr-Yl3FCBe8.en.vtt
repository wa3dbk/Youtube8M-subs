How To Hold A Guitar Pick For "Smooth As Silk"
Rhythm Guitar

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.390
Hey there, I'm Tomas Michaud.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.620
Would you like to know how to get that smoothest
silk rhythm guitar sound?

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.380
Well, the pick has a lot to do that when you're
using a pick and how you hold it.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.759
Keep watching and I'll show you the best way
to hold the pick and how to use it properly.

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.029
Hi there.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.919
When you're using a pick to get a smooth rhythm
sound it's best that in the beginning stages

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.550
you use a pick that's slightly thin.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.860
It's easier to get a nice, smooth sound.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.070
I like to use a medium pick though a lot of
beginners use a thin pick.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.860
However, when you're playing melody it's kind
a better to have a stiffer pick.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.410
As you get more experienced, it's easier to
get a smooth sound with a stiffer pick.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.600
So right now I have a medium, red pick.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.690
I chose red because it's easy to see.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.210
Let's focus it on a little bit.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.670
So here's my pick.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.200
I have a medium pick and I'm going to put
the pick on my first knuckle of my finger,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.369
can you see that?

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.210
And then place my thumb over it.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.539
Now the real key is to put a little pressure
on the back of the pick as opposed to the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:18.740
front.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.800
So the back of the pick, it allows the pick
to wobble a little bit but still keeps from

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.979
falling out.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.619
Now there's a balance there between making
a wobble and slipping out into your hand.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.080
Of course, if you don't put enough pressure,
it's gonna fall right out but if you put too

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.860
much and choked up on the pick, you can hold
it better but it'll be a tight, rough strum.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.860
See.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:02:00.399
Here is a smooth strum and my pick is wobbling
back and forth.

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.360
So you have to play around with it.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.170
First knuckle, thumb over the pick, roll the
pick back a little bit so it tightens up on

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.939
the back of the pick and can wobble a little
bit.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.310
Now when I'm playing a melody, I actually
choked up more on the pick because I want

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.510
the pick to be stiffer.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.239
When I'm playing a fast melody especially
I need the pick to bounce back really fast.

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:29.150
If it wobbles too much, I can't get back in
time to play the next melody note.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.819
So for strumming, wobble.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.340
Now let me show you one more, I have a small
pick which is stiff.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.730
This is a really heavy pick and it's great
for melodies.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.510
However, it's a little harder to play a smooth
rhythm.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.060
I really have to back up on the back of the
pick and let it wobble.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:57.110
See, I can do it but it's harder.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.319
So you can experiment.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.660
I'd recommend again starting with a thinner
pick but if you wanna try a thicker pick just

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.629
experiment a little bit.

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.750
As you get experienced of course, you'll get
better.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.660
I hope you enjoyed this video.
