MICKEY DENONCOURT: So this particular frame,
you know, it's a well-made, super high-end

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.080
cyclocross bike, so they think of the little
tweaks that are going to make your brakes

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.950
work a little bit better. Sometimes if you,
you know, have lower end, more generic bike,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.310
it doesn't have stuff like these built in.
So just like running the front brake can be

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.591
a bit of a pain in the butt to get a nice
and straight cable run. Here on the rear of

00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:26.560
the bike, you know, you have to figure out
how do you anchor your cable. Some bikes have

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.500
these, you know, hangers built in here, and
this is nice. It's got a little barrel that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.989
you can turn to slightly adjust the brake.
Sometimes, you know, bikes don't have something

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.670
built in, so there's a--instead there will
be a hanger that's attached to your seat post.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.769
So what you can do, you know, you want to
make sure that you got a nice, straight line.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.620
I think this cable is probably a little bit
too short, probably binds a little bit because

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:57.640
of that stiff bend in it. But, you know, things
that you can do to avoid that sort of thing

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.620
are, you know, maybe since this angle is so
steep here, maybe running a cable hanger from

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.640
the seat clamp would have worked a little
bit better for this particular bike. You just

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.030
have to keep into account the fact that there's
no standards with this style of bikes. So

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.210
little things like, you know, a straighter
cable angle or, you know, a more consistent

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.920
angle going down to the brakes is going to
make a big difference. Other things with your

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.110
brakes that you need to do, different types
of rim braking surfaces require different

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.500
pads. This is, you know, a carbon rim. So
there are carbon-specific brake pads that

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.750
are going to work a lot better. Because it's
carbon fiber versus metal, obviously the coefficient

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.060
of friction, all those sort of stuff can be
way different. So you want to make sure that

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.890
you're using the right little things like
that, you know, the right brake pad and stuff

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.970
like that. So you can see I've been using
the wrong pads on this bike, so there's all

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.250
these weird, white marks and stuff on the
rim. I should probably change out my pads

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.250
sooner rather than later to avoid that. But,
you know, just make sure you're using good

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.060
brake pads and a nice, clean, straight cable
runs. Anything you can do to make your cable

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.229
run straighter and shorter, it's going to
be good.
