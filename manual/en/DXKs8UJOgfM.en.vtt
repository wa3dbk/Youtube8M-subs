Alright so we have our knight but in this
next couple of clips we're going to learn

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.589
how to draw maybe the object of his quest
or his battle and now we're going to learn

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.469
how to draw one of the fair maidens from that
time. So we'll start with her face; getting

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:23.370
out your fine tipped pen and we're going to
move up to this portion of the page, and in

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.470
this case we'll be staring again with the
eyes and what I will; well not again, I guess

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.410
with the last one we didn't start with the
eyes but in this one we will. What we're going

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:40.301
to do is again try and follow sort of the
same rough idea that I introduced to you when

00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:45.300
I had you draw the other guy; I mean we're
going to want to make them look fairly, we

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.630
want them to look real and more real than
cartoony but we don't want them to look; I

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.989
don't know the more detail you add then more,
the more likely it is that it's not going

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.220
to come off looking believable. So just kind
of be careful what kind of detail you add;

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:16.860
I'm going to get start to her eyes here, we
want our maiden to be beautiful and unlike

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.780
our soldier they're not; there's isn't going
to be very much about her that's rigid or

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.410
dirty. So we'll draw her face here as we continue
on down we're going to; one of the harder

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.340
things to do about drawing a woman is to get
their face looking exactly the way you want

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:44.420
it to, it's not easy at all especially with
the lips for some reason; really take your

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.580
time and draw I would say start with the upper
lip, and work your way down from there. And

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.280
the best way to kind of get a really get a
good lip definition is do what I just did;

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.299
you draw the upper lip and color that one
in, don't really color in the bottom too much;

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.530
it, it separates them and it helps you especially
in a black and white drawing really see the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.189
difference between them. And then what we'll
do I guess is just come on down the side of

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:15.489
her face; again take your time, you do not
really want to rush this part because this;

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.980
I mean honestly you can completely screw up
your entire drawing right here if you get

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:30.241
her face wrong. You do not want to have to
start over; I mean there's nothing wrong with

00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:34.300
starting over and don't get me wrong it's
not like I'm saying don't feel, don't feel

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.100
like you can't make mistakes but try your
best to not make mistakes. I'd say it should

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.069
be the goal that everybody to try their best
to not make mistakes when they're drawing

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:48.343
a character like this; try and nail it if
you can the first time. So what I've done

00:02:48.343 --> 00:02:51.790
here is I'm kind of drawing the outline of
her face because it's; in a second we're going

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.560
to go onto the next clip and learn how to
draw her hair and a large part of what we

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.310
end up doing with her face will like, her
hair will sort of dictate that a bit. So I

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.040
would say at this point if you got the rough
outline for her face done; I would say well

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.500
move on now to the next clip where we learn
how to draw her hair, alright so let's move

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.600
on.
