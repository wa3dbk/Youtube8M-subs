MICKEY DENONCOURT: Some regions of the country
and of the world have cyclocross races that

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:12.629
are full of sand. Sand is really a big feature
of a lot of races than other ones, and so

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.810
people put a lot courses together here in
the U.S. with sand. They will run you through

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.009
like volleyball pits and stuff like that.
Riding through sand is pretty hard. It always

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.529
wants to grab your front wheel and move it
around when you're pedaling in a straight

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.349
line. Cornering in sand can be almost impossible.
The things to remember when you're riding

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.850
through sand is you usually want to ride a
slightly lighter gear, move as much of your

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.180
weight back on your bike as you can. It's
like sort of over the back wheel, so your

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.079
front wheel sort of floats, then you usually
want to ride on the tops with your hands super

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.820
light on the bars. So as you're riding through
this deep sand, you just really let your front

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.570
wheel sort of hydroplane, like on a boat,
sort of pick your way through. For sections

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.700
longer than 15 or 20 yards, it's almost impossible
to usually make it through there without a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.550
lot of horsepower. Like sometimes you just
end up getting off and running through sand.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.470
Cornering through sand is--well, I think it's
pretty fun. Sand, loose in general, you usually

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.030
have to stick a foot out to really catch yourself
in case you crash. As I come through this

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.700
corner right here, this is sort of make a
left-hand corner right here through this loose

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.520
dirt, you'll see what I'm talking about. The
front wheel ought to slide out as I move my

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:50.080
foot. So watch as I come through.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.220
So yeah, you know, the sharper the corner
is, the more likely you are going to slide.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.280
I moved my foot enough that it really pushed
my wheels into the ground. But in a loose

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.490
sandy corner, what you want to do is pick
a nice, wide arc through it and usually, just

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.620
for the sake of safety, you want to take your
inside foot off so you stick it out and forward

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.870
to move your weight through the corner and
that usually helps you stay up. And also if

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.280
your front wheel starts to wash out, so if
I'm taking the right-hand corner, take my

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.260
right foot out, my wheel is likely to wash
that way. Being able to put a foot down and

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.290
sort of push off, keeps you from going down
and it keeps your momentum up.
