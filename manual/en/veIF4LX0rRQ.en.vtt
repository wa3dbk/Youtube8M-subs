Alright, Let's see.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.200
Who could the guilty dog be, that ate a loaf of bread?

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.259
Doesn't look like it's Shelby.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.240
I know it's not Oakley, cause Oakley's in here. 
I'll let you out now though

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.150

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.529
I know it wasn't you.  Who could have done that?

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.099
Hey Shiloh!

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.550
Shiloh.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.829
Where are you?
Shiloh?

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.190

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.569

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.630
Come on Shi!

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.290
What?  Well I know it wasn't you.
And I know it wasn't you!

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.300
I think it was you!

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.690
I think it was!
Was it you?

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.690
Shiloh, did you do this?
Hey!  Hey!

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.800
Did you eat that loaf of bread?

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.300
Did you eat this loaf of bread Shi?

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.360
Look at me.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.590
Was that you?

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.850
Pull your bed away from the wall.
Did you do this?  Hey?

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.950
What were you thinking?

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.600
What were you thinking?

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.000
I bet you didn't share any with Shelby!

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.079
Did you get some Shelby?

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.700
We got . . oh look! Oakley found a crumb!
What's this! There's Bread crumbs

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.000
everywhere!

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.000
I cannot believe you ate a half a loaf of bread Shiloh.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.900
Seriously?

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.900
Seriously?  What?

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.549
I'm not really yelling at her.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.829
Really?

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.800
It was you wasn't it?

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.210
It was you.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.810
Cause I know it wasn't you.  You didn't even give me that
guilty look when I walked in.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.200
And you were in the box.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.000
So it was you.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.149
It was you!  You were a bad dog!

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:12.689
Look at that!

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.909
And it's white bread!  Not even real good for you!

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.949
What are you thinking?

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:21.529
Hey, come here!

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:25.259
Come over here, come over here.
This is where you were a bad dog.

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:29.100
Are you a bad dog?  Huh?  Hey!

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.539
Are you a bad dog?

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:35.200
Are you sorry?  Look at me!  Look at me 
when I am talking to you. You're in trouble!

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.039
You're in trouble. You're a bad

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:38.400
dog.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.329
You ate all that bread!
Look it!  Look.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.489
You didn't eat any of the plastic did you?

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:46.700
Doesn't look like it.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.759
You just ripped open the bag.

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.959
Are you sorry?

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.999
You won't even look at me will you.

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.879
Them other dogs are going crazy!

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.609
Yeah it had to be you, cause you are guilty!

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:01.280
Guilty

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.939
as charged!

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.600
It's alright.  I won't really be mad at you.

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:09.500
Who can stay mad at that face.

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:11.600
Bad Dog!

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.000
Bad Dog!

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.949
You bad dog!

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:19.149
How do you manage to look so cute
when you are in trouble?

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:24.500
Hm? How do you manage to look so cute?
How do you manage to look so cute when you are in trouble?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.429
Next time you should at least share with your sisters.  Right?

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:30.019
She should share.

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.799
That would be nice of her.

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.600
Bad Dog.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.300
[Music] Turn around and roll over Shelby.  Sing a song with your sweet voice

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:47.319
Shiloh, you've been a good little girl.  Come and join us for a new adventure.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.700
Lots of fun, Lots of walks, won't you come into our Siberian World. See Oakley run watch her dance in the sun.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:04.900
