00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:06.509
Hello, this is Michelle Mead with the National
Weather Service in Sacramento California.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.840
This presentation will give you an overview
of the updated drought monitor and seasonal

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.320
outlooks for Northern California.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.400
This presentation was prepared Thursday January
16, 2014.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.650
As you can see on the map on the right, the
US drought monitor is now indicating an extreme

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.410
drought (classification D3) for all of interior
Northern California.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.480
This is due in large part to the precipitation
deficit, decreasing reservoir levels and increasing

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.300
local impacts.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.740
2013 was the driest calendar year in 119 years
of record, which can be seen on the map to

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.050
the left.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.960
So why have we been so dry?

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.580
Well, a very persistent ridge of high pressure
has been over or very close to the west coast

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.420
since the fall of 2013.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.059
This ridge has blocked storm systems from
moving into northern California, by shifting

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.610
the storm track well north of the state.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.070
The ridge is expected to hold strong through
the rest of the month.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.560
This will result in little to no rain or mountain
snow for the state of California from now

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.850
through January 31st.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.420
The Climate Prediction Center displays this
trend with their 8-14 day outlook showing

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.159
a 50-60% probability CA will receive below
normal precipitation through the end of the

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.200
month.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.810
The Climate Prediction Centers outlook for
February through April indicates an increased

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.770
probability of seeing below normal precipitation.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.080
Typically California's heaviest rain months
are December through March.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.310
Average precipitation amounts drop off radically
beginning in April.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.030
To help you keep tabs on weather and water
conditions related to the drought, NWS Sacramento

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.060
has developed a section on our webpage to
help you do just that.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.400
Please visit our webpage, weather.gov/sacramento
and click on the Drought info tab above our

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.870
point and click map to access the page shown
here.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.780
We'll keep you updated to the latest conditions
and outlooks for Northern California through

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.400
our website and social media.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.260
Thanks for listening.
