My favorite food is bimbimbap
The ingredients are:

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.160
The zucchini, mushrooms, spinach, white onion,
carrot, rice, soybeans, meat, sesame oil,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.770
garlic, spices, and pepper.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:52.370
Gather all the ingredients we cut with the
help of family.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:09.060
As already prepared ingredients, we now turn
to sautÃ© in a little oil.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:34.090
The bibimbap is our favorite food because
it is a very nice food for the palate, very

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.150
economical and easy to prepare, for the amount
of vegetables is very nutritious and has ingredients

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.250
grown in our country.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.230
It's taste spicy for my family, which adds
to your food daily to give a special flavor.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:56.480
I started to prepare the bibimbap because
I ate several times in Korea, being a typical

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.420
food is delicious and there, it is very easy
to prepare, although the kimchi is the main

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.600
dish, we prepare Colombian style, because
in Colombia is difficult to get in the province

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.230
Korean cabbage and make the process of fermentation,
as in Korea for their preparation.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.351
The ingredients and dishes are varied, rice
and vegetables are the key element in the

00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:25.970
kitchen that is accompanied with fermented
foods, the main dish is kimchi.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:33.310
The Koreans have great respect culturar heritage
and there are many efforts to preserve it.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.730
When you visit their country met friends who
are not forgotten, despite the distance still

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.709
contact and may influence our lives, trying
to follow his example, his discipline, kindness,

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.709
housekeeping to live.

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:57.019
South Korea is in my house, my region, my
students know their culture and education!
