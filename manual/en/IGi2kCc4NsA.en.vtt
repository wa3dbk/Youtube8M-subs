00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.100
Good grief, I've given up hope on you.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.570
Eh? W-Why!?

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.770
You thought of ways to persuade people, but your real intention is this?

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.640
I've been belittled.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.050
...Huh?

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.620
I won't allow a person like you to suddenly see my sisters, isn't that right?

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.320
■ I'm just asking...? ■
I won't allow a person like you to suddenly see my sisters, isn't that right?

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.670
I'm just asking a normal question, whether or not your sisters are around?

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.850
That seems to be the case, however...

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.720
From your speech earlier, you have already given yourself away very clearly.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.640
What have I given away?

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.770
...You are a true siscon.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.560
■ I'm not! ■
...You are a true siscon.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.950
...You are a true siscon.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.190
...You're hopeless if you're saying that for real.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.400
Half of it is a joke.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.820
Not entirely?!

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.970
Half of it is being serious.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.950
...Do I really look like a siscon?

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.440
Yes, you do.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.470
That's why I do not wish to let you see my sisters.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.670
That means...

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.270
...Are your sisters really that cute?

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.450
...I despise you.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.490
I'm terribly sorry.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:29.100
As the elder sister, I'm obliged to take care of my sisters. That's why I allowed my sisters to go out.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.350
Is that so... They'll properly call you 'onee-chan', right?

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.370
Of course.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.750
How could I allow a pervert like you get close to my sisters?

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.600
■ Don't treat me like I'm some dangerous person! ■

Don't take me for some dangerous person.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.840
Weren't we chatting pretty nicely just now?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.950
...I'm sorry about that. But this can't be helped.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.340
What can't be helped?

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.670
Evidence is solid that you're a dangerous person. Please give up.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.920
Guh...

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.770
...However.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.620
Anyway, did you really come here just to see my sisters? How about the original purpose?

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.720
■ Yes. ■

Ah! But... yes. I'm here to help...

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.750
It's good that you know, Then it's about time we start.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.190
Heh, heh... You look dejected just when I said nobody was at home.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.140
...Don't you wish to be alone with me?

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.890
T-There's nothing of that sort.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.900
...I-Is that so. That's good.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.150
