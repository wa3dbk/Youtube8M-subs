My name is Christine Marquette, and I'm a
registered dietitian with The Austin Regional

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.809
Clinic, and I'm going to talk to you about
the side effects of kidney dialysis. There

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.360
are many different side effects associated
with kidney dialysis, and some of them depend

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.290
on the type of dialysis that you're getting.
There are two main types, hemodialysis and

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.490
peritoneal dialysis, or PD. PD is the type
of dialysis that a person can actually do

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.800
at home or on the job. With this particular
type there's actually a couple of other subtypes.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.319
One involves basically what is called ambulatory
dialysis, and this particular person has a

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:46.110
catheter that's been implanted into their
abdomen. They are doing exchanges with the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.289
diasolate solution where they basically pour
in the diasolate solution, go on about their

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.019
business for four or five hours, and then
drain out the diasolate solution, and exchange

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:04.180
it with a new solution. The risk in this particular
type is infection in that particular area

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.830
where the catheter is, because again, you
have exposure from your outside skin. There

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.370
could be any source of bacteria that may enter
into the diasolate solution, so you have a

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.160
very high risk of infection, not just on the
catheter area, but also inside your peritoneal

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.960
cavity, or your peritoneum, so there is a
very high risk for that source of infection.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.630
Another type of side effect that could be
associated with PD is actually developing

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.500
hernias. The reason why is because your muscles
in your abdomen become weak when using this

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.850
form of dialysis, and because you have all
of that liquid solution in there it is pushing

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.540
putting even more pressure on these already
weak muscles, so you have a very high risk

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.020
of developing a hernia. If you're using hemodialysis
that's a type of dialysis where you actually

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.950
are going into a dialysis center about three
days a week, and you're in there for about

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.980
four hours, and there you could also have
infection, but more common side effects are

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.670
things like low blood pressure, having very
dry skin, itchy skin, and you can actually

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.010
also become malnourished if you're not consuming
enough high quality protein. And another possible

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.250
side effect would be actually having excess
levels of phosphorus if you aren't following

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.450
the renal diet that's been prescribed for
you. So, there's actually several different

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.400
side effects that can occur, depending on
whether you're using peritoneal dialysis or

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.540
hemodialysis.
