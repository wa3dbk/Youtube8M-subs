00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.600
Alright, check it out. 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.950
Here's the EVGA For The Win Version 
of the P55 Motherboard.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.970
I have already reviewed 
the LE and the SLI 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.030
and this is the 
For The Win. 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.290
Very sweet. 
Feature packed.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.270
Tons of stuff. 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.400
It comes with the little...
Where's the little board?

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.500
They call it the ECP V2. 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.030
It's a little debugging board.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.830
It's got tons of 
stuff in the box 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.420
as far as little 
brackets and stuff. 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.040
Tons of stuff on the board.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.340
I can't even begin 
to tell you but... 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.010
We should just get started 
before I get carried away.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.980
Starting with socket, 
right there. 1156.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.190
Gonna do all your 
Lynnfield stuff. 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.530
Your 750 Core i5s and
your 860 Core i7s

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.630
will work right here 
on this socket. 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.060
Also, while we're talking 
about the socket, 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.400
note that it does have holes 
for both 1156 and for 775.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.710
Which is really cool. 
That means you can 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.080
reuse your old 
CPU cooler. 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.520
Also, while we're here 
talking about the socket,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.980
I want to mention the 
hardware as far as the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.690
very nice solid state
capacitors. 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.990
100 percent solid state caps. 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.670
And 12 plus two phase 
pulse width modulation. 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.590
Where you can adjust the 
switching frequencies in the BIOS,

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.840
I think, above 1100 KHz.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.660
And it's going to give 
you very clean power. 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.280
It's going to produce a 
little heat, but clean power.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.770
And that's very good 
for overclocking. 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.630
Especially with extreme cooling. 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.390
You do have for dims 
right over here. 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.290
EVGA specifies that these dims 
can go up to 2600 MHz. 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.030
So basically they're saying that 
guys know how to overclock

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.320
so we're going to put 2600 numbers 
on the box, because, why not?

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.970
Now, basically will support 
1333 and 1600 native

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.540
but if you're going to overclock, it will 
go as high as you want to take it.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.960
At least 2600 MHz if you had 
some pretty extreme cooling 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.950
and some pretty extreme memory 
to take that type of frequency.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.890
Really good stuff. 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.840
Also, you will note, 
right over here, 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.080
this is that little, famous, E that 
will light up inside your board.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.900
People talk a lot about that 
for some reason, they like it. 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.340
I just think it's a light. 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.430
But, hey, light's are 
important too. 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.190
Also, what's important about 
this board is this right here.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.980
PCI Express. 
Lots of it. 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.690
You're running x16, straight up.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.950
Or if you pop it in two, it's going 
to bifurcate down to x8, x8.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.060
A PCI Express 2.0. 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.700
You're going to also add 
a third down here. 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.680
This is for PhysX. 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.400
You can run a 
dedicated PhysX card. 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.930
It's going to give you a 
performance boost in PhysX games.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.340
Basically, if you want to know 
how much performance you get 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.520
from a PhysX card, 
turn PhysX off, 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.410
and see what kind of 
frame rate boost you get. 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.030
And that's the type of 
frame rate boost you get

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.610
if you add a dedicated 
PhysX card. 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.190
That's pretty 
important to know. 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.330
Also, if you look 
right over here. 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.700
A bunch of SATA ports. 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.110
There are six right here. 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.970
So that's, two, four six.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.870
And rate 0, 1, 0+1 
and 5 as well. 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.120
So that's a lot of rate options. 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.180
Basically going to give you 
a lot of versatility as far as

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.690
striping and getting some 
performance upgrades.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.690
Or if it's for a work station, you 
want to be a little more redundant,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.150
you want to have backups, 
you can do rate 1. 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.820
It's really up to you. 
Lot's of good features.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.590
Also, I want you 
guys to notice, 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.770
look at the ridiculous 
bottom on this thing. 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.120
Starting from over here, 
front panel connector.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.810
But you will notice you 
have three USB 2.0 headers.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.110
Which is rare. 
That's a lot. 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.640
That's six USB ports. 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.980
You have a FireWire header.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.250
That's also a little bit rare. 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.030
You also have all the 
buttons for overclocking. 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.380
Or, that's what I use 
them for, anyway. 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.140
Clearing your CMOS. 
Turning it on. 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.320
Resetting it. 
Those are very nice. 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.670
Also, if you notice, BIOS selector.
Triple BIOS's!

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.450
OK, we saw the 
SLI board in EVGA. 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.520
That would have dual BIOS's. 
This is triple BIOS's. 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.590
That means that 
you can backup, 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.000
you can compare profiles, 
you can make separate profiles, 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.200
you can write three 
different BIOS's. 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.600
That's ingenious and very cool. 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.940
Also, right over here, you 
do have an LCD poster.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.970
That's pretty cool. 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.470
It's going to give you post 
codes during the post sequence

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.850
and once the post sequence 
has completed it will give you

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.330
temperatures of your CPU. 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.580
So you don't need to really 
run a software inside your OS,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.860
it takes up, you know, 
memory and stuff. 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.250
You can just, literally, 
look right there. 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.690
That's very, very nice.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.730
Another great 
overclocking feature, 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.880
you have dual 8-pin 
CPU power connectors. 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.350
That means you 
can do 600 Watts. 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.210
Because they do 300 a pop 
and you have two of them. 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.250
Now you'll probably 
never use that unless 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.830
you'll use liquid 
nitrogen, but, 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.360
if anyone wants to 
use liquid nitrogen, 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.960
you can definitely use those to 
send more power to your CPU.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.650
Moving on to the back panel. 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.790
A lot of good stuff 
going on over here. 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.490
Starting from over here. 
You got PS2.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.040
USB 2.0's. 
Clear your CMOS buttons. 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.590
You got, SP/DIFF in optical. 
You have SP/DIFF in coaxial. 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.220
You have two eSATA ports. 
One in red and one in black. 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.340
This is for the fashionable 
people and this is for not.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.830
For the emo kids. 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.810
You got FireWire 400, 
the big one, right there. 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.060
For USB 2.0 ports, 
Dual Gigabit Ethernet. 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.420
And, an entire eight 
channels of audio 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.670
with a very, very nice 
controller on here. 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.510
Basically, you're not going to
need to have a sound card 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.800
if you don't really, really, 
really, really want one. 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:47.780
Or have a really good...

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.720
This is the ALC889A Chipset for 
the audio, very, very good stuff. 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.980
Also, I will go ahead 
and mention, that

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.620
on this board, I don't 
know if you can see it, 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.140
look on the back, yeah. 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.620
That's some really 
good stuff in there. 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.340
They put a lot of gold in these sockets
for the For The Win for overclocking.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.970
And they put a very strong 
bracket on here. 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.940
They have capacitors in 
there that are incredible. 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.720
They have a lot of 
really good stuff. 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:13.880
Another thing I'll 
tell you about it, 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.970
this board has dual 
clock generators. 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.340
Now, I couldn't tell you... 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.800
I don't know enough about the 
P55 to tell you where they are. 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.580
I'm pretty sure they're inside 
the P55 Chipset down here. 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.610
But, that means that you have 
two different clock generators.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.650
One is going for 
your PCI Express. 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.130
Which is going to stay at 100. 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.230
But then there's a separate 
one for your CPU. 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.110
That's going to give you a 
cleaner signal for your CPU.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.500
It's going to give you 
a better overclock. 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.860
And overclocking is very, very
important on this board.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.160
It's basically what 
they made it for

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.530
and what they want 
you to use it for. 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.990
12 plus two phase power for
your memory and your CPU

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.760
is not normal. 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.350
You're not going to use that 
for not overclocking. 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.610
Let's just say that. 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.280
Now, this is really cool. 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.440
Check this out, 
this is the ECP V2. 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.420
Zoom in on that. 
Come here, check it out. 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.130
Very cool stuff. 
First of all, 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.380
this has got your...
It's got more buttons. 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.080
Power and reset. 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.380
It's got a clear CMOS jumper. 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.060
But, here's where 
it gets cool. 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.300
PCI Express enable 
and disable jumpers. 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.130
Let's say you have a 
full watercooling loop, 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.230
and one of your 
video cards breaks. 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.760
Well, guess what happens? 
You're in trouble. 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.850
You have to take apart the 
whole loop to get it to work.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.020
Not anymore! 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.470
You pull that out, PCI Express 
slot gets turned off, 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.620
and then in turn you can figure out 
which is the card that's broken. 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.700
Great for trouble shooting. 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.900
Also, right here, each one of these 
gives you 0.1 increase in CPU VCore.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.760
So, start at 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5. 
And so on and so forth. 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.070
That's also very cool. 
And then again, over here, 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.400
same little post code device. 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.760
Gives you post codes and then after
that it gives you temperatures.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.830
That is very, very useful when 
something goes wrong. 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.130
It tells you right off the bat 
if you need anything else. 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.770
Also, you guys need to know, 
as far as overclocking goes, 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.670
you do have Vdroop control. 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:01.760
You do have Dummy OC, you 
do have the Elite tuning utility. 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.290
Which lets you overclock 
from the BIOS. 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.290
Very easy to use, 
works very well. 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.540
Really good stuff. 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.220
You have a board 
here that is... 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.050
I mean, it's laid out. 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.580
They gave you every option.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.140
You have every advantage to maximize 
the efficieny and the performance 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.480
of your computer with 
something like this 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.590
as far as overclocking goes, as 
far as system configuration goes, 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.310
keeping temps down, 
clean power. 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.070
I mean, it's just an 
incredible board. 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.610
It's got all the features, 
and that's why 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.600
it's basically, except 
for the Classified, 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.820
their highest board.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.950
It's For The Win and 
I concur with them. 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.080
Really, really nice board.  
The EVGA P55 FTW Board.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.470
And if you have 
any questions on it 

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.470

I'll see you guys next time. 

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.530
