00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:02.387
This looks like a vagina.

00:01:02.387 --> 00:01:04.602
- Stop talking like Borat.

00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:07.263

00:01:07.263 --> 00:01:12.263
Babe, some idiot sold me
these katanas for $1000.

groceries like I asked?

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:22.182

much longer I can do this job.

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:51.392

do to make you feel better?

00:01:51.392 --> 00:01:53.999

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:04.821
Don't ruffle my blouse.

00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:07.138
- You're wearing a blouse,
that's a woman's blouse.

00:02:07.138 --> 00:02:08.641
- It's a very expensive blouse.

00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:09.576
- I caught it.

00:02:09.576 --> 00:02:11.567

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:13.294

00:02:13.294 --> 00:02:13.883
(laughs)

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:14.756
- Don't look at us.

00:02:14.756 --> 00:02:16.869
She's taken.

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.962

I need to tell you.

00:02:21.095 --> 00:02:22.375
Oh no!

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.879
No, no!

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:24.935

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:27.008
