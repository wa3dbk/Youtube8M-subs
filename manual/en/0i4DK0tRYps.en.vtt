Cancer.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.210
Help reduce your chances of developing breast
cancer by eating foods that have shown promise

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.670
in preventing it.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.619
You will need Cruciferous vegetables High-fiber
foods Green tea and a healthy weight.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.740
Step 1.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.710
Eat broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower,
and other cruciferous vegetables.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.990
They're high in indoles, which reduce levels
of estrogen, a hormone that can feed breast

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.020
tumors.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.119
Step 2.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.410
Getting at least 20 grams of fiber a day can
cut your risk, especially if you're postmenopausal.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.410
Look for cereals and breads whose first ingredient
is a whole grain.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.410
Step 3.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.040
Sip green tea.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.370
It contains catechins, cancer-fighting antioxidants.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.370
Step 4.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.370
Limit alcoholic beverages.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.550
In one study, having two to five drinks a
day increased the risk of breast cancer 1.5

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.470
times compared with teetotalers.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.760
Step 5.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.250
Eat less trans fat, which is found in processed
foods like cakes, crackers, and cookies.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.159
High blood levels of trans fat can double
your risk.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.590
The American Heart Association recommends
a daily trans fat intake of less than two

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.850
grams per day.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.159
Check food labels for amounts.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.270
Step 6.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.659
Don't have red meat more than twice a week.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.630
In one study, women who ate more than five
servings a week for 12 years were 42 percent

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.700
more likely to get breast cancer than those
who ate fewer than three servings per week.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.700
Step 7.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.000
Go easy on the soy, especially if you are
at a high risk for breast cancer.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.880
Some research indicates it may stimulate the
growth of breast cancer cells.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.380
Limit consumption to two servings a day, at
most.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.439
Step 8.

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.729
No matter what you eat, try to maintain a
healthy weight.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.100
Overweight women are at a higher risk of developing
breast cancer.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.670
The good news: Postmenopausal women who shed
an average of 22 pounds reduced their risk

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.359
by 57 percent!

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:01.499
Did you know Israeli researchers found that
pomegranate seed oil causes breast cancer

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:04.869
cells to self-destruct, while leaving healthy
cells unharmed.
