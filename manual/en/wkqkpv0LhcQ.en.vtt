00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.860
Today I will be making peanut chikkis or peanut brittle.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.600
This is a delicious homemade candy.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.620
Peanut chikki is quick and easy to make with very few ingredients.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.540
Peanuts, sugar, salt and ginger.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.820
Ginger adds a very nice tangy flavor to chikkis.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.660
This recipe will make 12 chikkis and will serve 6.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.420
To make peanut chikkis we will need:

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.820
1 cup unsalted raw peanuts. I am using the Spanish peanuts.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.680
1 cup sugar

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.960
2 teaspoons of clarified butter or ghee

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.380
1/4 teaspoon of salt

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.640
2 teaspoons of ginger juice

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.000
It’s very easy to make ginger juice. Use the fine shredder.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.220
Shred it and then squeeze it with your fingers.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.360
First I will roast the peanuts over low medium heat.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.600
Heat is on.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.600
So here are peanuts.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.100
Keep stirring till they are golden brown.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.320
You can roast them also in oven or toaster oven.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.200
Peanuts are nicely roasted. It has taken me 6 minutes.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.780
And as you see the skin is coming off

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.080
And I am going to remove all the skin after this has cooled off.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.660
After roasting it makes it easier to remove
these skin.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.330
So I have turned off the heat and just let
it cool off.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.160
Peanuts are now just little warm.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.660
So I can just rub it between my palms so skin will come off.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.339
Most of the skin we have to take it off. Not all.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.640
Skin is off. I am just going to put them over the paper towel

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.580
and lightly crush them.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.840
They are not crushed too much. Just slightly.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.040
This is looking good.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.410
And now I will remove rest of the skin. Whatever will come out easily.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.300
I am ready to make the chikkis.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.780
Heat is on, low medium.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.680
So first I will put the butter and let this melt.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.240
So ghee is melted. I will just cover the bottom of the pan.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.320
And then let’s put the sugar.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.460
Salt

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.200
And ginger juice.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.420
And then keep stirring slowly

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.540
till all the sugar is melted and it will start caramelizing.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.120
And will come to very light golden brown color.

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.899
You need to do this on very low heat.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.720
Just low medium is good.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.620
Sugar has started melting as you see and now you have to really work quickly

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.540
because it was going to melt just in a minute.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.060
And if you don’t keep stirring it will get burned.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.040
As you see sugar is caramelizing and it has almost melted all the way.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.780
So it has taken me about 3.5 minutes.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.580
Just scrape this spatula one time.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.880
As soon as sugar is melted, turn off the heat.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.200
And add the peanuts.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.160
You can also use the roasted unsalted peanuts for this.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.720
Just stir it.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.879
I have already greased the 5 x 7 pan.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.740
It’s a Pyrex pan.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.480
So I am just going to pour. Now it's ready to pour it in.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.160
Make it flat.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:40.000
Now let it cool off. It should be little bit
warm when we slice the chikkis.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.190
If you let them cool off to room temperature it will be very difficult.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.440
You can just break them still but you can’t slice them.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.600
The chikki is ready. It is just slightly warm.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.400
So first I will remove it from this pan.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.840
And then just cut them with big knife.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.940
So I am making them about little bigger than
1 inch pieces.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.540
I have cut them in about 1 inch square.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.940
So they are ready.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.380
And your young kids will be waiting for them.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.760
Peanut chikkis are ready.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.080
My grandkids really like this homemade candy.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.200
Enjoy.
