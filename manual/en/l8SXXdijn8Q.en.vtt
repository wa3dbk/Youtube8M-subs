Hello - and welcome to an introduction to
RadioDNS.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.830
Radio as we know it is becoming more multi-platform.
More than ever before, radio is reaching people

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.080
in new and different ways.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.840
If the experience of the UK is anything to
go by, people are now expecting radio everywhere

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.910
 - where where they want it, how they want
it.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.460
So we already know that the future of radio
is multiplatform. But broadcast radio is scalable,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.610
cheap, and portable - it's the primary part
of our multi-platform broadcast future.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.089
And with this comes a problem.

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:44.449
Radio faces being left behind, as people experience
visuals and more information on the same device

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.339
that also picks up radio. To the left, this
Samsung phone is playing an MP3. To the right,

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:56.710
we're hearing the same song... on the radio.
It's all a bit 87.5.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.639
So we need more functionality. Bookmarking,
visuals, ways to contact broadcasters and

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:05.369
advertisers, and more.

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.229
Looking at radio receivers these days, many
of them now have the internet built-in. From

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.960
mobile phones with FM chips inside them, to
internet radio sets, FM-equipped laptops and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.280
music players - they all have access to radio,
and the internet, in one box.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.859
So if we want rich radio, we can use web services
over the internet: use broadcast radio for

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:34.560
portability and scalability, and the internet
for visuals, data and feedback.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.759
But there's a problem. When your radio tunes
into a station, it has no idea where to find

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.829
the online web services. So it can't connect.

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:51.719
Broadcast radio works really well. The internet
is great for additional information, personalisation,

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.039
and the back channel that could change the
way advertising is sold on the radio. But

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.649
how can we link them?

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:06.079
How can we tell a connected radio where to
find a radio station's web services? The obvious

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.970
answer is to add this information into a radio
station's broadcasts, in additional metadata.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.350
But changing the broadcast chain is expensive,
requires additional standards setting, and

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.420
is a lot of hard work.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.350
The good news is: we're already broadcasting
metadata that can be used. In FM RDS, or DAB,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.690
or HD, or more - we are already broadcasting
unique identifiers that can be used to help

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.510
link broadcasting with the internet.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.570
So, in London, an FM radio might see these
identifiers for Capital FM.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.560
Or, in Switzerland, a DAB+ radio might see
these identifiers for Radio Swiss Pop.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.440
And this works just fine for DAB, for HD,
or for DRM.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:01.280
What RadioDNS does is create a CNAME - an
alias - that points the radio to the broadcaster.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.260
The radio then knows how to find which services
the broadcaster supports, using service records

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.690
that the broadcaster controls on their own
domain.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.780
So, for the first time, your radio can use
IP to enhance broadcast radio.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:24.000
Those services might be...
- RadioVIS is visualising radio - adding personalised

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.650
slideshow to more platforms than just DAB.
- RadioEPG - is a way of supplying the radio

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.370
with an electronic programme guide and more
information about the radio station being

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.070
listened to.
- RadioTAG - is a method of providing "deferred

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.560
interaction" - a way to respond to advertising
or programming elements, or a way of buying

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.210
music from any music store, in any format,
for any device.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.060
It's our intention to work together with others
on these specifications, to ensure that broadcast

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.570
radio isn't left behind in a world of IP-delivered
audio. And Radio DNS is extensible, to allow

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.760
almost unlimited new ideas.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:15.050
RadioDNS itself is, along with RadioVIS, already
in use in products like the PURE Sensia connected

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.880
radio; and there are more products being built
as we speak that use RadioDNS technology.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.120
And, the documentation is open, so you can
work on it right now. Please download it - you'll

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.410
find it at radiodns.org.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.510
And you can now become a member of RadioDNS,
to help the project move forward. There's

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.320
more details on the RadioDNS website.
