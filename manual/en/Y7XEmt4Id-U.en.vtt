Hello my name is Adam Berzowski. 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.580
I'm here with Kraft Music today, with the Casio Celviano AP-250 digital piano.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.480
For the best deals on our digital pianos
or any of our products, be sure to look at our bundle offers.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.260
Our bundles are going to include
accessories you may be looking for

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.220
such as a lamp or a pair of headphones.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.600
Without any further adieu,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.920
let's take a listen to the sounds of the
grand piano,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.580
on the Casio AP-250.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.380
Just like an acoustic grand piano, 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.880
the AP-250 has 88 hammer weighted keys, and they're graded.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.620
From left to right they start out heavier
and gradually become lighter

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.220
and this would be true with an acoustic grand piano as well.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.360
If you'd like to hear more playing and a
little less talking,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.240
please check out my performance video.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.280
The Celviano AP-250

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.409
is loaded with a lot of useful features. First of all, it has a variety of sounds.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.860
Aside from the acoustic piano sounds,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.640
there are a number of electric pianos, strings, organs, and more.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.020
There's also a built-in metronome to help with your time keeping.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.500
If you'd like to practice in private,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.100
you can
connect a pair of stereo headphones to the AP-250.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.350
The speakers will automatically shut off

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.140
and you'll hear yourself, but only in your headphones.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.460
This will come in handy for late-night practice.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.160
AP-250 Features all three pedals, just like you'd find on a grand piano

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.920
the soft, the sostenuto and the sustain
pedal.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.960
Aside from the music rest,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.440
AP-250 also features a hard, sliding key
cover

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.640
 to protect your keys when you're not using your piano.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.400
If you'd like to connect your AP-250 to your
home computer,

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.110
for use with music production software.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.780
Whether it's for recording notation or lessons,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.780
there's a USB port on the back of the
piano.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.380
AP-250 has a built-in song recorder! 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.480
You
can record yourself playing and listen back.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
You can record one hand at a time as
well;

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.900
Because you can record the left, and you can record the right.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.420
When you purchase an AP-250,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.480
what you can
expect to find in the box

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.140
as standard accessories from the
manufacturer

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.140
is of course the AP-250 along with 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.160
with its dedicated matching furniture
stand, the triple pedals, and pedalboard,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.180
a matching bench, the music rest, owner's
manual and the power supply.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.360
Once again, my name is Adam Berzowski
here with Kraft Music.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.200
I'd like to thank you

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.980

Celviano AP-250 with me here today.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.220

like a lamp to light up your sheet music

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.560
or a pair of headphones.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.060
