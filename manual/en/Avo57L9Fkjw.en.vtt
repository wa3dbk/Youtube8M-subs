00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.550
Now that we have an understanding of the symptoms
of improper Gamma correction,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.910
we are going to actually enable it in 3ds
Max.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.800
This is done through the Customize menu.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.350
Go to the Customize menu and choose Preferences.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.990
You'll need to go to the tab labeled Gamma
and LUT.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.390
LUT stands for Lookup Table.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.250
We are not using a Lookup Table here.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.520
We are just using simple Gamma correction.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.650
So what I am going to do is I am going to
enable it, and I want to make sure

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.530
that I have Gamma chosen here, not LUT, but
Gamma and I want to set the value to 2.2.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.630
Additionally, in this Bitmap Files section,
this is very important as well.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.150
We need to set both of these values to 2.2
also.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.129
What this is doing is it's telling mental
ray to expect that an image applied

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.620
to a surface is going to have a Gamma of 2.2
and it's also telling mental ray

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.540
when you render out an image, make sure that
the rendered image has a Gamma of 2.2 as well.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.630
Additionally, we should also enable these
switches here, so that the colors

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.799
that we see in the Material Editor and in
color swatches will be correct and

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.180
accurate with Gamma enabled.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.899
From now on 3ds Max will remember for all
new scenes that I want to have Gamma

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.560
correction enabled and additionally when you
open a scene, if Gamma is disabled,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.359
3ds Max will ask you if you want to disable
it.

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.950
But you always want to keep Gamma enabled
from now on.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.429
So we should be good to go now as long as
we are using bitmap textures and

00:01:51.429 --> 00:02:02.030
our renderings will have the correct contrast
now that Gamma correction 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.789
is enabled.
