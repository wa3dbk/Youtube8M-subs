Hi, my name is Matthew Christian from Tampa,
Florida and on behalf of Expert Village today

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.611
I'd like to talk to you about a portable electric
sander. As I mentioned earlier there are a

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:18.161
wide variety of uses for a portable electric
sander. In this particular case I'm going

00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:23.610
to demonstrate using it on a piece of base
board. This is a piece of pre-primered base

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.820
board that I bought at a local home improvement
warehouse. It's pre-primered at the factory.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.510
It's ready to be painted but a lot of times
the primer that they put on there it's at

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.860
a factory and it doesn't always come out smooth
or to the desired texture. So you may find

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.629
it necessary to sand the base board prior
to painting. This could be done by hand with

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.379
a piece of sandpaper, any of the sandpapers
that we were using earlier, this could be

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.670
done by hand. Doing a small piece like this,
doing it by hand probably wouldn't be too

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.149
bad but if you were installing base board
in an entire house or you had a large area

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:10.439
to sand, that's where the portable electric
sander comes in. It makes it much easier and

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.459
less time consuming. So let's go ahead and
sand down our base board a little bit and

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:20.789
demonstrate how it's used. We plugged it in,
we tired our cord to make sure it doesn't

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.709
come undone while we are using it. And it
is quite simply just place the device down

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.969
onto the wood that you want to sand and while
you are holding it firmly, turn it on and

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:36.549
we are going to move back and forth in a consistent
pattern until we get the desired smoothness

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:54.689
or texture of the wood that we are looking
for. Here we go. Feels pretty good. I Didn't

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.890
need to go too far. It just had a light rough
texture on the surface. I just needed to sand

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.079
it lightly and that took care of that.
