Hi, this is Ginny with Simply Beautiful Crafts
on behalf of Expert Village and we're going

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.500
to make party hats. I'm going to show you
how to make this pop up birthday hat with

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.890
a paper plate, some curling ribbon and some
decorations. The first thing you want to do

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:27.050
to make a hat like this is to take your paper
plate, fold it in half and then draw your

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.420
design. As you can see I folded my plate in
half and drew half of a birthday cake. So

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.880
you're going to draw your design on your plate.
You can draw a castle, you can draw anything

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:59.360
that you want and then cut it out. You want
to make a straight cut down here and then

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.460
go ahead and go over. You do not want to cut
all the way because you need to leave some

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.670
of it to pop up. Then you're going to go ahead
and cut the rim of your hat big enough to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:21.590
fit the head of whoever is going to be wearing
this hat.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.390
Once you have your birthday cake cut out and
the center of your hat cut out, you're going

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.770
to open it up, go ahead and fold up your cake
a little bit and then see if it's a good fit

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.780
for your head or whatever head youâ€™re putting
it on. What I did to make this hat was to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.480
take some curling ribbon and just start in
the middle, secure the ribbon with a little

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:50.479
bit of tape and just go over and under, over
and under all the way around until I got to

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.960
the back of the hat as you can see with this
hat. So I went over and under all away around

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.890
and then I left it at the end so that I had
long strings to curl. Once you put your decoration

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.870
on it you don't have to use curling ribbon
but it's kind of a fun thing to do. Then you

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:18.650
can decorate your birthday hat with crayons
or markers or you can use glitter glue sticks

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.230
or just your good ole Elmer's glue and put
your glitter on it. I used a crayon on mine

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.170
to write Happy Birthday and then I just decorated
it with crayon. Use glitter glue for the fire

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.790
and then used confetti of stars to put around
and when I was finished I had my very own,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.230
very special pop up Happy Birthday hat.
