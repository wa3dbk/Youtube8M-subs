Hi! Karriann Graf with Creative Cooking Corner.
And today we’re going to make a jezebel

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.520
cranberry sauce. And I’ve received this
recipe from a friend many years ago and I’ve

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.490
adapted it since that time.
Okay, so I started off by turning my heat

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.660
to medium. I added sugar, orange juice, and
a little bit of water. And I’m just stirring

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.570
it to dissolve the sugar. And once the sugar
dissolves, then I’m going to add my cranberries.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.590
Once we add the cranberries, we then let it
cook on the stove top for about ten minutes

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.870
until the cranberries start popping.
I’m just going to stir the cranberries in

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.710
and I’m just going to let it cook for about
ten minutes stirring from time to time. Okay,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.120
so I’ve been cooking the cranberries, you
can see they cooked up very nicely for about

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.110
ten minutes. And I’m just going to add them
to my Pyrex bowl to let them cool. So you

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.500
cover it with saran wrap, and you let the
cranberry sauce come to room temperature.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.909
Once it becomes room temperature, then I’m
going to add some horseradish and Dijon mustard.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.159
Okay, so our cranberry sauce has cooled for
about two hours, so I am going to take the

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.150
foil off. I’m just going to stir it up a
little bit. You can see it’s gotten quite

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:36.950
a bit thicker since it has cooled. Now I’m
just going to add my Dijon mustard and my

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.140
horseradish.
Now this cranberry sauce is perfect for serving

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.140
with chicken, pork, or turkey. It’s even
a nice little garnish that you can put on

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.670
top of a brick of cream cheese and serve with
nice crackers. I’m just going to stir it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.400
up. I’m going to cover it back up and we’re
going to put it in the refrigerator and it’s

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.350
ready for our turkey dinner.
