00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.283
- [Eric] Hey, everyone.

00:00:01.283 --> 00:00:03.050
Today on GardenFork, grilled steak

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.430
in a way you've probably
never done before.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.300
This might be called
commando steak cooking,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.920
right on the coals.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.797
Here we go.

00:00:10.797 --> 00:00:13.380
(bouncy music)

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.300
I learned about this from a
New York Times food article

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.950
by Matt and Ted Lee, about
a restaurant in Dallas,

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.960
I think it's called Blaze,
that cooks right on the coals.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.680
We start out with a dry rub on your steak.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.840
This is a kind of an
adaptation of what they used.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.130
It consists of some coffee,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.590
brown sugar, salt, paprika.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.120
Theirs had some pretty
hot chili powder in it

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.803
and I can't eat that,
so I didn't put that in.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.523
So you turn it over
and kind of mush it in.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.683
And I also like to get
it along the edge there.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.893
Like that.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.930
And then ideally, you let
this sit in the fridge

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.330
for a couple hours at least.

00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:11.977
(bouncy music)

00:01:13.228 --> 00:01:14.304
Nice, huh?

00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:15.380
- [Woman Behind Camera] Very nice.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.350
- Zinfandel, steak.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.313
This is a New York Strip, with a bone-in.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.010
I've experimented with different steaks,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.000
a T-bone I don't think
works very well for this,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.760
but the bone-in New York Strip works well.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.140
There's a couple others, if they have

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.760
a small piece of bone, or
a lateral piece of bone,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.660
marbled, well marbled is good.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.280
With T-bone, because it has two different

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.560
cuts of meat on it basically,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.990
it's got the tenderloin, and then

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.287
the other part that I'm blanking
on doesn't work as well.

00:01:42.287 --> 00:01:43.863
- [Woman Behind Camera] Audience.

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:49.670
- I've found works best is a pan,

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.980
a metal pan you don't mind sacrificing.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.073
Once you do this once,
you're gonna do it a lot.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.630
Chunk charcoal.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.773
Briquettes won't work for this, okay?

00:01:58.773 --> 00:02:02.856
(hot charcoal clatters into pan)

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.190
If it bothers you, you can blow

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.440
some of the ash off
before you do this, okay?

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.720
You can also hit this with
a blow dryer real quick.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.587
I've found it's not necessary.

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:21.453
I just need to get the steak off of here.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.410
(steak sizzles on the coals)

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.407
- [Woman Behind Camera]
Sizzled immediately.

00:02:27.407 --> 00:02:28.857
- And it already smells good.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.920
Depending on your steak,
this could be three minutes,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.272
this could be five or six minutes.

00:02:35.272 --> 00:02:38.022
(coals sizzling)

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.260
So that was about five minutes,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.730
now I'm just going to take this

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.283
turn it and remove that charcoal.

00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:52.520
- [Woman Behind Camera] Not edible.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.120
- Be sure chunk charcoal, not briquettes.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.450
And the question of "well,
it's touching the wood",

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.330
You actually eat, wood is cellulose

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.361
and you eat cellulose every day,

00:03:03.361 --> 00:03:05.960
it's a plant food, basically.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.473
So it doesn't really bother me.

00:03:14.821 --> 00:03:17.404
(jaunty music)

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:28.205
All right, this is
actually a little overdone.

00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:30.231
- [Woman Behind Camera]
But what's the temperature?

00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:32.669
- 135 and climbing.

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.840
This will take a little
longer than when you think,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.030
but not as much, so just keep
checking the temperature.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.070
The thinner parts will cook
faster than the thicker parts.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.654
Cover this and let it rest, okay?

00:03:43.654 --> 00:03:44.923
- [Woman Behind Camera] Okay.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.149
- Let's cook some corn.

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:49.566
- [Woman Behind Camera] Yeah.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.550
- Oh, nice.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.523
Little overdone.

00:03:53.512 --> 00:03:55.430
- [Woman Behind Camera]
I think it looks perfect.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.470
- We put out perfect
steak videos every week,

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.680
we do cooking, DIY living,
just kind of eclectic

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.290
Eric life stuff.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.570
And this is one of those things.

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.631
(woman laughs off camera)

00:04:11.631 --> 00:04:12.920
- [Woman Behind Camera] Is it good?

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.490
- A little overdone, but man is that good.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.233
- [Woman Behind Camera]
Somebody's watching you.

00:04:20.158 --> 00:04:21.230
