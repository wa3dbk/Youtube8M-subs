00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.060
It's not always clear how banks make money
from current accounts.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:10.820
Well TSB isn't like other big banks. And they're
happy to explain exactly how they do.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.699
TSB makes money from current accounts in four
key ways:

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.060
On average a typical TSB customer keeps, over

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.330
Â£1000 in their account.
TSB uses this money to lend to other customers

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.449
and small businesses across Britain. The bank
earns income from the interest those people

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.410
pay for borrowing that money.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.410
Just over a third of TSB's customers use an
overdraft every year. Some of them pay fees

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.440
and interest when they do so.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.149
Around 15% of customers have what's known
as an 'Added Value Account', for which they

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.609
pay a monthly fee in return for additional
benefits and preferential services on top

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.870
of the basic banking service.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.579
And lastly, when customers use their debit
card in retailers to buy goods and services,

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.430
the retailer pays a small fee (called an interchange),
for the security and convenience of accepting

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.200
payment by card.
These sources of income contribute to TSB's

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.520
total income, from which they run the bank.
That includes some costs that are specific

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.600
to current accounts.
Things like paying interest to people who

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.860
have an interest bearing account, providing
secure internet and mobile banking services,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.610
running a national cash machine network and
supplying millions of debit cards. Not to

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.340
mention employing the thousands of people
in their branches and call centres who help

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.310
their current account customers on a daily
basis.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.370
Any profit the bank makes after these costs
are taken into consideration are either retained

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.110
for future investment or returned to shareholders.
The bank's board decides which.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.700
So, current accounts are a key part
of making sure that TSB are in the best possible

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.200
position to be an economic force for good
in the local communities their customers live

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.829
and work in.
Which, after all, is what Local banking for Britain

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.239
is all about.
