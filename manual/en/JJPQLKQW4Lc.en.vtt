00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.359
Today we are here to have a look at some checks that you can do yourself on your

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:06.840
vehicle

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.450
to help keep it in tip top condition and
potentially save yourself a lot of money in

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.020
the long run

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.309
first up today we'll need to open the bonnet, that varies from car to car

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.720
so your owner's manual is the best place 
to check on how to correctly open the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.990
bonnet

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.440
in your vehicle. Familiarize yourself with where each

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.730
component is, check your engine coolant,
your engine oil level etc

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.380
Now we're going to check the engine oil level

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.260
so the first thing to do is remove the, wipe it clean

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.480
then reinsert it into the engine, remove it
again

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.769
now you can get an accurate reading of
your oil level. Every dipstick

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.539
will have a marking on it indicating a high
level and a low level mark

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.460
the oil level needs to be between those two marks. If the oil level

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.789
is low it needs to be topped up to the
correct level

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.059
but you need to ensure that you are
using the correct oil

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.059
for your particular vehicle and again that's

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.929
best found in your owner's manual. Another imperative check to make is one for your

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:00.949
engine coolant level

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.019
and that needs to be done when the
engine is cold

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.100
do not attempt to check it when the engine is hot. On most vehicles there are two places

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.479
to check the engine coolant

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.950
there is the radiator cap itself that needs to be removed and there is also the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.960
coolant overflow bottle. When checking the engine coolant level

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.360
when you take the radiator cap
off it needs to be completely pull

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.210
to the top of the radiator, where as the recovery bottle or expansion tank will

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.580
generally have a high and a low mark - the coolant level needs to be

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.920
between those two marks. In an emergency clean water can be used

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.970
but ideally it needs to be the correct coolant for the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.340
vehicle. Another check we can perform is
to refill the windscreen washer water

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.580
that can be done with just good clean
tap water. Additives are available

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.500
if you want to make it soapy, but water is just fine. Having your car

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.630
serviced regularly is the best way to make sure your car is

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.600
going to be trouble-free performing
these checks in between your services

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.390
can minimise some of those costs for you at your service time
