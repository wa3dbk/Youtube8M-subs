Dave Allen, head coach, swimming and diving:
Let's see good technique!

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.690
The reason why I got into coaching is I just
love working with people in sports, being

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.580
able to work with swimmers every day that
are trying to push themselves to be the best

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.050
they can, to me is an awesome job. And it's
just fun to come to work every day and try

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.090
to figure out what we're going to do today,
both physically and mentally. It's easy to

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.729
write a set on the board, it's more challenging
to try to figure out, OK, how are we going

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:40.289
to get people to swim better through that
set and how can they really look at what they're

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:46.049
doing before and during races mentally, to
prepare themselves as well.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.260
Lydia Bowers '12: The best way to indicate
that Mount Holyoke swimming has been great

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.299
for me is that my best time in high school
for a 200 free was a 2:11. My best time at

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:04.049
NEWMAC this year as a senior was a 1:59. So,
I've dropped 12 seconds in my 200 free. Our

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.289
training worked for me, and I had a good time.

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:10.570
Allen: So briefly, we have anywhere between
90 and 95 percent of people set personal bests

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.850
over the season, and this year I think it was about 
92-93 percent. So we're pretty happy with that.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.140
Lauren Williams '14: One of the reasons that
Dave is a great coach is that he listens to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.990
what you have to say and incorporates it into
what his plan is for you, for the next four

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.520
years or for the season.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.469
Rachael Battis, diving coach: We'll choose
a dive and say this is a dive that we want

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.420
to work towards and we want to have this dive
by this meet.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.009
Allen: So for our training, one of the things
that we really focus on is quality over quantity.

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.319
We don't do "garbage yardage." We focus on
doing a lot of technique work, a lot of stroke

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.420
rate as well as pacing. And so every day in
practice it's not how far we swim, it's really

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.990
how well we swim. A lot of people, when they
actually get here, are kind of, you know,

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.100
not really thrilled about looking to go swimming
in college just because they've "been there,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.009
done that" for the last ten years. And so
we try to put a little different spin on it.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.499
We try to make it more fun, not any less work,
not any easier, but at least more fun in the

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:07.780
work that they're doing.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.349
Bowers: You should swim for Mount Holyoke
for many reasons. First and foremost, the

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.629
friendships you'll make on the team are some
of the closest and strongest you have at Mount

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.459
Holyoke. We call them "insta friendsâ€”just
add water." Second of all, I think being a

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.010
swimmer made me a better student.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.129
Williams: It's just always nice, having something
structured in the day that's other than classes

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.620
that, you know, you can go to. And you just
feel, OK, I'm here, I've got a goal, and I'm

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.300
going to go for it.
