00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.480
Hi everyone. I'm Rincey and this is Rincey
Reads. Today I'm going to be doing a review,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.520
or trying my best to do a review, of Go Set
a Watchman by Harper Lee. This book takes

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.619
place approximately 20 years after To Kill
a Mockingbird. Scout is returning home. She

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.689
is living in New York City and she's coming
back to Mobile, Alabama to visit her family

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.539
as she does. Every year she seems to return
for about two weeks and spend time with her friends

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.630
and family back home before returning back
to New York City. This time, however, she

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.250
returns and her eyes seem to be open to the
way that things are changing in her town and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.860
also things are not changing in her town.
She's learning a lot about her family and

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.690
their beliefs and it doesn't really line up
with what she knew previously. And so her

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.980
world is basically changing, her view of everything
is changing, and this book just deals with

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.110
that conflict. This is a book I went into with
pretty low expectations. I tried my best not

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.079
to be overly spoiled or to get too many opinions
in my head before I went into this book. Although

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.950
I did pick up a handful of things about the
book before reading it, which I won't really

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.140
talk about here. But I will say that I had
a certain perspective going in and just based

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.750
on the general vibe I was getting from people,
I went in with pretty low expectations. I

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.420
mean, this was meant to be the first draft.
It hasn't been overly edited and it's definitely

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.740
clear in that sense. There are definitely
some parts that could be tightened or changed

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.060
if this was properly edited. But that being
said, this book very much still has Harper

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.650
Lee's voice. There are so many passages in
here that feel so familiar if you're someone

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.490
who has read To Kill a Mockingbird, particularly
if you've read it pretty recently and you

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.500
have her style in your head. This book is
going to feel pretty familiar. It has Harper

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.460
Lee's wit and her strong, biting language.
If you've read To Kill a Mockingbird you kind

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.880
of know what vibe I'm talking about and that
is definitely still present in here. It's

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.710
also pretty interesting to see the parts of
this book that you can see directly influenced

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.450
or were put into To Kill a Mockingbird. Now
is this a book I'm going to be recommending

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.519
that everyone go out and read the way I would
To Kill a Mockingbird? Uhh.. Not necessarily.

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:17.069
But I do think that this is a good/interesting
companion to have to To Kill a Mockingbird.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.500
If you follow me on Goodreads or on like Twitter,
you may have seen that I put up like sort

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.000
of an initial review where I just said "Your
fave is problematic." I said that like half

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.209
jokingly obviously, but also mostly seriously
because that is a thought that I had in my

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.690
head when I was reading this book. If you're
someone who holds To Kill a Mockingbird on

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.489
a pedestal and holds those characters on a
pedestal and you don't want to see any new

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.550
or different or problematic layers added to
those characters then it might be good to

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.560
just ignore this book. However, I think that
as readers this is a book worth reading. I

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.360
think it's important for your thoughts and
your beliefs to be challenged sometimes and

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.870
I think this book challenges what we think
of when it comes to Atticus and Scout and

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.349
Jem and all these other characters who we've
come to know and love and, in some cases,

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.209
treat as these perfect characters. Just like
you learn in the real world, no one's perfect

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.980
and everyone has problems and everyone is
flawed. And this book definitely explores

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.379
those flaws. In this book, Scout's in her
20s and I think that this exploration that

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.930
Scout goes through is an exploration that
a lot of people who maybe grow up in a small

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.290
town or grow up in a very bubbled community,
if they go away to college and then return

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.940
home I feel like this is an experience that
a lot of people go through. They return to

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.440
their home and they realize that not everything's
as perfect as you thought it would be, the

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.769
things that you loved when you were a kid
aren't necessarily things that you can love

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.200
and enjoy anymore. And even the people that
you love, you can still love them, but there

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.909
might be different viewpoints, different perspectives
that you're seeing now that make them not

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.930
quite as perfect as you thought that they
were. There are parts of this book that were

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.800
really difficult for me to get through, not
because the writing was bad or difficult but

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.530
because the things that were being expressed
were so problematic, but also so of its time

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.519
and also so of this time that it made me want
to throw this book up against a wall in the

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.720
best possible way. The way that some of the
characters in here talk about race and segregation

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.590
and progress and change and Southern living
and small town living all felt so 1950s but

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.860
also, with current events, felt so now. Sort
of observing this as something that was written

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.830
in the 50s and hasn't been touched since and
to see what has and hasn't changed in the

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.460
minds of some people is a really interesting
experiment. I think this book forces the reader,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.810
or at least it forced me, to reconcile this
idea of someone having really problematic

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.510
thoughts and issues and beliefs and still
understanding them to a certain extent. That's

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.650
a struggle at least that Scout goes through.
I don't know if that's the right way to approach

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.290
this book. I don't know if that's the right
way to approach those situations, but I think

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.320
everyone has someone in their life that they
don't necessarily agree with but they love

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.870
them anways. So yeah, in the end I gave this
book a 3 out of 5 stars. It's hard to give

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.590
this book more than that, in my opinion, just
because its not like the best book ever written,

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.860
but I think it brings up a lot of really interesting
ideas and I think its a really interesting

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.130
companion. I think that this is actually a
more interesting layer to add to the characters

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.810
that are in To Kill a Mockingbird. Because
in To Kill a Mockingbird the Finch's are basically

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.710
like perfect people and in this book you realize
that they're not. And I feel like in To Kill

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.830
a Mockingbird racism and prejudices and biases
are so overtly clear and in this one they're

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:55.009
more like systemic and subtle and that's more
realistic to the way the world actually is.

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.380
So yeah, I kind of really liked it for that.
Even though this book was so frustrating to

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.789
read at times because of some of the things
that these characters were saying, I really

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:09.650
liked it that it actually said those things
so clearly because it really forces you to

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.080
confront these problematic thoughts that people
legitimately have. So yeah, those are my just

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.960
quick thoughts on Go Set a Watchman. This
is one of those books that I feel like I'm

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.770
going to be thinking about and wrestling with
for quite some time. I kind of want to re-read

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.020
To Kill a Mockingbird and potentially re-read
this at the same time because I think it's

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:35.680
just so interesting and such a new and complicated
and realistic layer to those characters that

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.910
I think I actually really liked. I know that
not everyone is going to feel this way. There

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.729
are going to be people who are really upset
that their characters were ruined. But I do

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.300
like that Scout had to wrestle with these
difficult issues and I do like that Atticus

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:56.550
was taken off his pedestal and I do like that
the depiction of the South was more realistic

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.970
and these characters were more realistic.
So yeah, let me know your thoughts down in

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.710
the comments below. I know a bunch of you
guys are reading this book right now just

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.789
like I was. So let me know what you guys thought.
Do you agree with me? Do you disagree with

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:10.330
me? Are you really upset by this book? Did
you like the book like I did? Yeah, there's

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.680
going to be a lot of opinions on this book
and I'd love to hear yours. So yeah, that's

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.680
all I have for now and thanks for watching.
