00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.889
The next question will be answered in 20
seconds by our host

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.980
Marko Rubel a self-made millionaire
who bought and sold over 300 properties.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.940
He is one of the foremost experts in
front of the National Real Estate

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.160
Investors Association representing

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.300
forty thousand investors nationwide he's
listed in prestigious who is who

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.990
and well known in the business world. 
Here is the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.910
next question from our listener.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.330
Yes, Bruce is asking, 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.430
Is it okay to use your cellphones as

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.910
a direct number for somebody to call

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.670
the problem I have with that is that
when you use your cell phone

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.290
you may not be available or you may
not be

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.590
in a business environment so if you
doing groceries or playing with your kids

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.930
kids or grandkids you're playing with them

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.690
this is not a time to answer the phone and
you may answer the phone because you may

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.460
think one of my friends is calling

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.360
or maybe it's a blocked number whatever
you answer the phone for that reason

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.120
I'm not really open to that
however let me give you a twist on that

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.860
you get it going on a 24-hour recorded
message

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.159
with the press 0 option so

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.659
any time during this message you can press
to talk to a live operator

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.549
and they press zero,
then it rings to your cellphone

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.920
and that's always the same number
because that number comes from

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.420
your 24 recorded message so you
recognize that number

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.460
and you can program into your cell phone
saying seller and that way you know it's

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.030
a seller

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.210
plus the seller heard the message about
your business and the recording

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.510
and then you go and  take the 
call I think that's a better way

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.890
because remember the most important
thing is the first impression

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.130
you can't answer a call
saying hi this is Bruce

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.000
NO! you have to say thank you for
calling XYZ Housing Solutions

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.700
this is Bruce

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.800
how can I help? so professional way
and obviously has to be quiet behind you

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.360
can't have

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.280
kids screaming you know in background so
that's how I'd do it

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.369
