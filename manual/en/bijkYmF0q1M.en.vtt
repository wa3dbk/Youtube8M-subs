Real borscht takes a while to prepare. But it's worth it.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Borscht begins with soup broth. Brown the meat and bones in an oven, pour water into the pot, and cook over low heat until boiling.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Then add the onion, carrot, garlic, and a bouquet of aromatic herbs and spices. Let the flavor become saturated over medium heat for 2-3 hours. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That is enough time to prepare all the other ingredients. Bake or boil the beet in its skin for 30-40 minutes.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.333
Chop up the cabbage, onions, and potatoes, and grate the carrots.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Strain the broth and slice the meat from the bones.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The cabbage goes first.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Fry the onions and carrots until soft and golden brown and a potent and full-bodied aroma fills the air. Add the onions and carrots to the broth, along with the potatoes.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Stew the beet. A squeeze of lemon juice will help preserve the deep color of the borscht, while a spoonful of tomato purÃ©e will bind all the flavors together. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
After adding the beet, leave the soup to cook for another 15-20 minutes. 
Before removing from the heat, add the garlic.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Everything will taste that bit better if the soup is left to stand... until tomorrow. Or at least for 2-3 hours.
