00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.200
These are projected to be the most populated
nations in the world in 2050, 35 years from

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.269
now, determined by combining the most up-to-date
information provided by the UN with numerous

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.730
factors, including current growth rates, migration,
fertility, population age, and mortality rates.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.481
Number twenty is Turkey with 94 million, even
though will grow by 17 million people, it

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.390
falls two spots in the ranking.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.910
19th is Iran, which also drops two spots.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.570
It will have over 100 million people.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.670
In 2015, there are only twelve countries with
more than 100 million.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.670
Vietnam is currently near capacity and will
fall five spots, only adding 12 million people

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.390
to its population.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.199
Uganda is this list’s biggest riser, jumping
21 places by nearly tripling its population

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.850
to 104 million, from just 34 million in 2015.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.879
Japan’s aging population and low birth rate
will see it lose six spots and decrease in

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.140
size by 18 million people.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.879
Number 15 is Russia, also down six spots.

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.010
It’s total will also decline significantly,
it’s aging, but it’s also hemorrhaging

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.330
people because of a declining economic future.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.360
Egypt will be the 14th most-populated nation
on the planet, ticking up a spot by adding

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.760
over 37% more people than it has now.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.060
13th is Tanzania, continuing the dominant
trend of huge sub-saharan African projected

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.450
population gains by leaping 15 spots and increasing
its population by 174%.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.950
Congo too will more than double in size, gaining
seven spots on this list.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.400
Slow development and a lack of access to birth
control are the main reasons why populations

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.450
in Africa are booming.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.100
The 11th-ranked country will be Mexico, the
same rank it held 35 years earlier by gaining

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.630
people at a relatively average rate.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.160
The Philippines will move up two spots to
enter the top-ten by adding 56 million human

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.210
beings.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.080
Ninth is Ethiopia, more than doubling its
residents by adding a staggering 97 million

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.440
to its total.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.270
Even though it will add 43 million, Bangladesh
will remain the eighth most-populated country

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.550
in the world.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.879
And as Brazil becomes an economic powerhouse,
it’s boom will slow, dropping two spots

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:13.879
in the rankings.

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.370
It is the only South American country in the
top 20.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.189
Pakistan doesn’t increase in the rankings
at all either despite adding more than 80

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.200
million people to its total.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.519
Indonesia drops one spot to fifth with a total
population of 321 million.

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.091
As it continues its high level of development,
the United States of America will fall a spot

00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:34.519
too, getting bumped out of the top three by

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.950
Nigeria, which leaps up four.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.439
It will add a society-straining 257 million
people.

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:48.379
And the top two countries will swap positions,
as China will only be the second-most populated

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:55.349
nation with 1.38 billion people, after significantly
slowing the rapid growth it experienced during

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.930
the 20th century.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.379
And India takes the top spot, increasing its
already larger-than one-billion population

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.409
another 26 percent to 1 Billion, 620 million.

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:14.879
Overall the world will add about 2.4 billion
people for a total gain of 34% over the next

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.439
35 years.

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.450
With nearly 9 and a half billion humans to
support, our planet will be pushed to its

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.450
limit.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.189
Of course, many things could change these
projections, such as mass-migration due to

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.969
climate change, war, or development, but given
the way things look now, these are roughly

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:36.129
what the populations of the world’s biggest
nations are expected to be in the near-future.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.129
