00:00:02.477 --> 00:00:06.236
We know Reault from their family cars...

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:09.633
...the Modus, the Senic and the Espace...

00:00:09.778 --> 00:00:12.920
...lots of space, well thought through...

00:00:13.754 --> 00:00:15.822
...but boring of course.

00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:17.951
But they also do different stuff.

00:00:30.183 --> 00:00:35.574
If you do go to the Renault dealer,
ask for one boasting the letters R and S.

00:00:35.596 --> 00:00:37.313
They stand for Renault Sport.

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:42.273
There are also emblems in the interior
and on the door sills.

00:00:42.512 --> 00:00:44.346
But that is not the most important thing...

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.516
...the most important is that
Renault really know how to build fast cars. 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.492
Not just enough horsepower,
but also great handling.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.472
Today we're driving the Megane RS.

00:01:01.456 --> 00:01:06.352
2-liter turbo, 250 hp, 0-62 in 6,1 seconds.

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:10.229
With 250 hp from a single-turbo 2-liter engine...

00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:14.352
...you might think that it'll be a bit hesitant
and lacking power low down.

00:01:14.372 --> 00:01:19.259
But that's not true, from 1800 rpm
there's at least 80% of the torque available...

00:01:19.297 --> 00:01:21.451
...with a maximum of 340 Nm.

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:24.090
So it keeps on going.

00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:44.825
The only disadvantage is that
you hear a beep very quickly...

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:48.395
...that indicates that you'll reach
the maximum rpm soon.

00:01:48.878 --> 00:01:53.009
Just over 6000 rpm it starts whining
that I have to change gear.

00:01:53.223 --> 00:01:57.834
But it feels like it's got more to give...

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:03.141
...but apparently the mechanics have
to be spared and that's the limit.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.788
Another fun thing is the Cup chassis...

00:02:09.017 --> 00:02:11.197
...it's lowered and a bit firmer.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.955
It costs 2000 euro, that seems like a lot...

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.200
...but you also get a limited slip differential.

00:02:16.258 --> 00:02:21.081
A real mechanical LSD,
as supposed to electronic stuff.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.875
That's very nice. 

00:02:22.913 --> 00:02:28.444
When accelerating out of corners you
sometimes feel it working in the front...

00:02:28.572 --> 00:02:31.311
...but you get lots of grip.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.684
Even more important for
a hot hatch is its handling.

00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:56.551
It's a bit nervous...

00:02:56.565 --> 00:02:59.989
...but that actually makes it fun.
Some of its German competitors...

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.380
...are a bit too clinical.
They take corners very quickly...

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:09.805
...and when you step over the line
they understeer a bit.

00:03:10.147 --> 00:03:16.379
This Megane RS constantly gives you
the feeling that the back could step out.

00:03:16.476 --> 00:03:21.350
You might think that's a bad thing,
but it isn't at all. It's very entertaining.

00:03:21.483 --> 00:03:28.075
It's fun that you really have to push it
to get the most out of the car...

00:03:28.201 --> 00:03:30.585
...instead of the car doing all the work.

00:03:37.424 --> 00:03:40.507
This car has some extra goodies...

00:03:40.552 --> 00:03:44.523
...like 19 inch wheels.
They are so beautiful.

00:03:50.303 --> 00:03:53.894
We've driven through all of Zeeland,
and everywhere jaws dropped...

00:03:53.928 --> 00:03:59.444
...and people came to us to ask what it is.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.530
So Renault did that very well.

00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:11.797
The exciting exterior
isn't really matched by the interior.

00:04:12.076 --> 00:04:14.605
There is some yellow stitching, some emblems...

00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:18.962
...and there's a yellow rev counter
that they've copied from Ferrari.

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:21.588
But next to those things it isn't very exciting.

00:04:23.056 --> 00:04:26.774
But of course, this isn't a 100 grand car...

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.732
...so you can't really expect
excessive luxury inside.

00:04:32.035 --> 00:04:33.950
Now we're on the subject of money...

00:04:34.056 --> 00:04:38.236
...it starts at 31.390 euro.

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:42.791
Of course you'll add some things
like a Cup chassis, different wheels...

00:04:42.804 --> 00:04:47.156
Ã‰and the Renault Sport Monitor
that shows lots of things on the display.

00:04:47.182 --> 00:04:49.702
If you know how to do that, which I don't.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.325
Renault Sport Monitor...

00:04:54.178 --> 00:04:56.449
...it should have it...

00:04:56.482 --> 00:04:59.788
...something fantastic and adjustable...

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:05.578
...stopwatch, best quarter mile time, 0-62 time.

00:05:08.407 --> 00:05:12.025
It's a very competitive price,
it gets you 250 hp!

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:15.592
250!
And it's very fast and it drives really well...

00:05:15.627 --> 00:05:18.098
...and the handling is fun and it looks good.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.291
It's a very good choice.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.886
A white car looks very good...

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:42.548
...but I'd think twice before
really ordering one in white.
