Hi, everybody. This is Chad with ALOE

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.190
That's, A Little Everything 4 U.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.560
Today I thought I'd do a quick video on if you happen to have

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.929
one of these. That is a

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.400
Samsung Galaxy Gear. This is the first
generation one. They have

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.449
a couple more after but that I'm assuming
this will work for the new generations too

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.599
The problem that I had was I had

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.830
I wasn't using this for a little while. I was off work. I mainly use it for work

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.780
so I can hear text messages, phone calls or whatever. I was not charging it

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.100
so it went dead. I just assumed that when I was going to go back to work I'd

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.010
charge it back up and everything would be fine. Apparently, that wasn't the case

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.760
when I plugged it in, I had it plugged in for a whole day, went back and looked at it and the screen was still

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.289
completely black. I tried a whole variety of

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.030
different clicks on the little power button on the side. Nothing would get it to come on

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.629
So, if you had the same problem, I found the solution

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.460
onine. I went through a bunch of different blogs and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.530
Googling and all kinds of stuff. most people didn't have an answer

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.270
or the answers they had didn't work for me. What did work for me

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.060
is if you have one of these you know this is the normal

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.370
charger. A little plastic case

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.970
the watch clips into and this is the
normal

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.690
cord that comes with it, which is a hardwired cord. it's hardwired onto the AC

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.880
plug and has a mini USB

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.920
plug that plugs into the case and you plug it into the wall and charge it.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.120
Even this wasn't working. When I plugged it in, normally

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.700
the screen on the watch will come up.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.780
When I plugged mine in, it didn't do anything. It was still blank so I thought my watch was dead

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.930
So, again, after Googling and whatnot, I tried some different things

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.479
The first thing I tried was getting a

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.299
different USB, mini USB plug, not one
that came with it,

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.130
and then I used by iPad charging block

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.840
and tried to charge it that way, just
plugging it into the wall

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.350
and that didn't work either. So, the last
thing I tried

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.860
was just using the mini USB

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.010
to standard USB plug.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.430
I plugged that, the mini USB, into the charging case

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.580
and plugged the other end into my computer,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.019
just let it charge through the computer
with

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.630
 the USB just plugged into a standard USB plug on my laptop

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.730
And lo and behold it worked! As you can
see here

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.980
now we have time. Everything is good

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.709
So, I don't know why that

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.970
works and just plugging it in and charging it doesn't, but all I did is

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.590
plug it into the computer and that

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.180
brought it right back up. So, if you
have one of these, you have a Samsung

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.440
Galaxy Gear watch

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.420
and yours is not charging, or doesn't appear to be charging, it won't come on, the screen is black,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.100
give that a try before you have too much of a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.160
freak out and take it down to the store and demand your money back or

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.360
ask someone to repair it, or to try to take it apart yourself,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.900
sometimes the easiest is the best. Just try to plug it into your computer's USB and

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.390
you'll be back in business. Thanks a lot for watching!

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.780
