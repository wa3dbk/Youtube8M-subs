00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.100
I don't want these feelings that can't be explained to fade away.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.100
So I'm breaking the norm, deleting the provided layout.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.100
Remembering the phrase I hummed the other day,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.100
I sing what I kept in my heart to the sky!

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.100
The things I want to tell you

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.100
and the things I want to share

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.100
May they change into countless lines and dots

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.100
and reach you.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.100
All these words I want to tell you

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.100
and the things I want to share

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100
May everything change into countless lines and circles

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.100
and Join us together.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.100
No matter where you may be

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.100
This clear white light reminds me of your voice

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.100
slipping through my fingers.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.100
With the rythms coming from the tip of my fingers,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:09.100
I'll let the beat in my heart break free, and send them up to the sky!

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.100
The things I want to tell you

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.100
and the things I want to share

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.100
May they change into countless lines and dots

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.100
and reach somewhere far in the distance.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.100
These words I want to convey

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.100
and the melody I want you to hear

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.100
May they change into countless lines and circles

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.800
and connect everyone together.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.100
No matter where we may be

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.100
Those days I had been singing,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.100
I simply never doubted those old days,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.100
thinking the mornings easily come and go.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.100
But this new song I am singing right now

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.100
starts to shake my whole world.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.100
Now, can you tell me about your world?

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.100
about your own world.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.100
and the things you wanted to share
0:03:17.100,1193:02:47.295
The things you wanted to tell me

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.100
are changing into countless lines and dots

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.800
and will reach somewhere far in the distance.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.800
The words you wanted to convey

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.100
and the melody you wanted me to hear

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.100
are changing into countless lines and circles

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.100
and will connect people all together

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.100
No matter where we may be.
