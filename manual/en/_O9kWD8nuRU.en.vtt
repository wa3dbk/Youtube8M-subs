00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.220
Hi, I'm Francis, the host of this show, "Cooking with Dog"!

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.170
Let's prepare the ingredients of this Vegetable Tofu Nimono.

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.799
Cut carrot veggies as you roll it.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.619
Cut off the tip of the boiled bamboo shoot, and then cut it down the middle.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.289
Cut the rest into rolling wedges, like the carrot.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.940
Cut the kombu kelp that was used for making dashi stock.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.360
Peel the lotus root.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.420
Cut it down the middle, and cut into rolling wedges.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.640
Add vinegar to a bowl of water.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.400
Let the lotus root sit in the vinegar.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.940
This will keep it from losing its white color.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.060
Peel the satoimo potatoes,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.520
and cut them into pieces, like so.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.120
Put the satoimo in a bowl, and add salt.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.180
Rub in the salt until it becomes a bit gooey on the outside.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.320
Give the satoimo a good rinse.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.420
Pound the konjac; this will make it more absorbent for later.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.740
Tear the konjac into pieces with a spoon.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.600
Put the konjac in a pot of water, and turn on the burner.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.260
Leave it in for three minutes, after it starts boiling, and then remove.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.780
Like with the other ingredients, cut the gobo into rolling wedges.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.260
Lightly rinse.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.640
Put the gobo in a pot of water, and turn on the burner.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.840
Let them boil for five minutes, and remove.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.760
Put the atsuage, deep-fried tofu, in the same boiling water, and cook for about two minutes.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.300
Remove the atsuage and double-dry with a paper towel.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.620
Cut the atsuage into six equal squares.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.620
String the snap peas.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.560
Add a pinch of salt to boiling water.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.440
Immerse the snap peas.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.980
Remove, and let the snap peas cool in icy water.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.540
Put the pre-washed dried shiitake mushrooms in a container; add water.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.620
Put on a weight to keep them submerged.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.660
Cover,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.120
And give it a good shake.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.120
Let them soak in a fridge until the stems become soft.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.900
Lightly squeeze the mushrooms to remove some of the extra liquid.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.780
Cut off the stems.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.820
Slice the caps diagonally in half.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.820
Let's prepare the stock for Vegetable Tofu Nimono.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.060
Run the shiitake liquid through a wire sieve.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.740
Pour the pre-made dashi stock and check that it measures 1Â¾ US cups.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.060
Let's cook the vegetables.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:06.820
Place the gobo, konjac, satoimo, kombu kelp, carrot, bamboo shoot, shiitake, and lotus root in a pot.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.840
Pour in the dashi stock, and turn on the burner.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.600
When the dashi stock boils, remove the foam.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.180
Add sugar and sake to the mixture.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.640
Place a drop lid directly on the vegetables, and cook over medium-low heat for a couple of minutes.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.200
Again, when you see foam, remove it.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.540
Remove the drop lid, then proceed to add the soy sauce, along with the atsuage,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.860
and stir lightly with a paddle.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:52.360
Reapply the drop lid, and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the ingredients become soft.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.780
When the liquid has evaporated almost completely, add the mirin.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.740
Place the snap peas in the pot, and  toss to cook over high heat.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.420
You are done cooking!

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.880
The vegetables will soak up the remaining liquid while cooling.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.320
You can reheat the Vegetable Tofu Nimono when you are ready to serve.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.920
You may want to add chicken as a variation.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.580
Fry the meat until golden brown, and add it in with the vegetables.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.480
Good luck in the kitchen!
