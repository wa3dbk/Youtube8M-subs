00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.950
INTRO

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.929
Welcome to the Youtube Income Challenge where
you can win some great prizes, and also learn

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.050
how to generate thousands of dollars from
Youtube in 90 days. I'm Tyrone and let’s

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.090
take a look at this week’s tip.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.070
This week's tip is all about content creation
for your Youtube channel and for your product.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.470
Let’s take a look at what type of content
is popular on Youtube:

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.940
- powerpoint or keynote presentations

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.340
- animations

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.920
- screencasts

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.609
- and presenting in front of a camera

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.519
Now that you know the different types of videos
you can make, here's my Content Creation Method

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.690
that you can use to create amazing videos
for your business.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.780
Step 1 is the Opener. This is where you need
get your viewer’s attention. Statistics

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.350
show that most videos are closed within the
first 3 seconds of them starting. So to capture

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.659
your viewer’s attention you need to do what
we call a “Pattern Interrupt”.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.690
Wanna setup a website where your viewers pay
for access? Oh thanks!

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.080
Step 2 is your branding. If you have an animated
logo then this is where you show it. You can

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.390
get one created professionally from Fiverr
if you don’t have one. After your logo comes

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.530
on then, what you want to do is position yourself
as an expert, give the name of your company

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.390
and what it does.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.990
This is what you can say: “Hi I’m Tyrone
Shum, video marketing expert and you are watching

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.980
Social Video Hub where you can learn how to
attract more leads and customers from Youtube”.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.040
Step 3 is where deliver your content. Here
are 3 questions to ask when creating your

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.410
content:

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.580
Why? What? And How?

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.050
Let’s take for example the topic of How
Do You Build A Website and answer these 3

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.660
questions:

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.710
Let's start off with Why should you build
a website? Well, to market your business and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.520
for people to buy your products and services
online.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.300
Next is What. What website should you build?
I recommend using Wordpress for building your

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.490
website and you can get hosting that includes
this at WP Engine.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.569
And then finally, how should you build a website?
Here’s what you do, step 1, step 2, step

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.119
3, etc..

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.810
Now as mentioned, we want to be able to create
a product that you can sell as well. A smart

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.840
way is to reuse the content you're going to
be posting onto Youtube and packaging it into

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.140
a product. The key thing is to provide the
why, and what in your Youtube videos and to

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.090
save the “How” for your product.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.430
Now if anyone wants to find the step by step
instructions on how to do it, that means they'll

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.390
come over and purchase your product. And that
way you can actually offer and make some money

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.420
from it.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.290
And finally Step 4 is your Call To Action.
Every video must have a strong call to action

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.670
at the end of it. There's no point making
videos just for the sake of making videos.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.980
We must have a reason why you're making this
video.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.540
So at the end of each video, make sure you
tell your viewers what it is you want them

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.310
to do. Whether it being to subscribe to your
Youtube channel or to visit your website to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.420
buy a product or service that you have.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.440
Lastly, the most important rule about online
video is to make sure to keep it short. The

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.040
shorter the videos, the better. I find roughly
about the about the 2-3 minutes is about the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.750
optimal length to have.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.300
Alright let's get on with this week's challenge.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.950
This week's challenge is to create two videos
using my Content Creation Method. The first

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.130
video is to create it for Youtube where you
provide the Why and the What. The second video

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.599
is where you're creating the How. And that's
going to be saved for your product.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.530
So go ahead and create these 2 videos for
this challenge.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.280
Once you've created these products, simply
leave a video response down below with your

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.980
links to your videos as well, and put in #YoutubeIncomeChallenge.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.830
We're really, really excited to check them
out and see what you've created as well, too.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.680
