Destroying Militant Firing Positions in Jobar

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Jobar, Damascus. Syrian Arab Army units have been involved in positional fighting in this region.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This is what this city block became after a 17,000-strong group of terrorists had arrived here on their way to Damascus city.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
However, their plans to capture the capital city were thwarted.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The terrorist group has set up their fortified defensive positions in this ancient suburban area of Damascus.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The army troops and the militants are often just a few partitions away from each other.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Those troops who happen to be the first to spot the enemy movement, they immediately open fire.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
SAA intelligence and surveillance forces keep constant visual contact with the militants to report any newly detected targets.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Additional information arrives from the militants themselves.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Whenever militant group members intend to strike a deal with justice they give away their companions’ gatherings and plans.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The newly detected targets are being engaged by the army forces that are composed according to the combat mission at hand.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Amid the harsh realities of their daily routines, the troops have beautiful things on their minds, too.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
According to recent intelligence, the militant group has gathered inside a number of buildings beyond that ground hill.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
A well-fortified concealed firing point is said to be over there.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
A battle tank is rolling in to destroy the militant firing position.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
A couple of rounds fired by the battle tank have reduced the fortified structures to rubble.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
A “Shilka” self-propelled anti-aircraft gun is commencing to deliver fire strikes on the opening in the militant's defense structures.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The anti-aircraft gun’s high rate of fire makes it perfectly suited to strike on the militant light defensive positions and their live force.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The militant firing point has been destroyed. Our job is done for today.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:40.000
