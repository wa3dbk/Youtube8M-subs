00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.189
Before all the controversy and opinions on
what the series should be, Devil May Cry was

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.890
just one thing and that was an awesome action
game.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.730
The game started off as the forming ideas
for Resident Evil 4, but after the research

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.370
and initial build was seen, it was deemed
too “actiony” to be a Resident Evil game.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.850
Funny in retrospect.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.280
But while not a Resident Evil game, it was
still viewed to be worth continuing work on

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.050
and what was created was Devil May Cry.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.979
The game starts with Dante in his shop when
a strange and beautiful women storms in and

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:58.910
starts causing trouble.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.010
She tells Dante, the son of the legendary
dark knight Sparda, that the ruler of the

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.420
underworld is planning an attack and Dante
must stop him.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:28.260
Dante sets off with his trusty weapons to
end evil once and for all.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.189
There are two main things that make Devil
May Cry such a great game, and those are the

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.069
combat and Dante himself.

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:42.499
The combat is a combination of swordplay and
guns, with plenty of style added in.

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:47.640
In fact, you are graded on your style, earning
you points that can be spent at the end of

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.930
the chapter.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.990
Of course you can just run through the game
and hack and slash, but where is the fun in

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.200
that when you can throw an enemy into the
air with your sword and keep him there with

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.700
your guns.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.909
Things like that are too good to pass up.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.069
Dante starts with his sword and dual pistols
but will find new weapons as he continues

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.069
his adventure.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.770
You can also find orbs that can upgrade your
health and buy new moves with, which gives

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.349
the game a great sense of progression.

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:31.380
You actually feel like Dante is growing stronger
and also cooler.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.740
As mentioned, Dante is enough of a reason
to play this game.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.530
His attitude fits perfectly with the style
of game, snarky and sarcastic, as he insults

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.270
a monster over five times his size.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.700
It’s just plain cool.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.760
The bosses are all some great moments.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.160
You will both long and fear each approaching
boss, because you know it is going to be awesome

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.290
but will punish you as well.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.040
Tell me the Nelo Angelo battles weren’t
some of the best parts of the game.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.220
The game does come with a pretty high level
of challenge, making you have to earn each

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.490
kill and finishing each level.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:22.010
But as you are dying, you will always come
back just to play more of a game that is genuinely

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.299
cool.
