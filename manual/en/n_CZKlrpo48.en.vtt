00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.140
Everyone knows the big-name developers.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.730
That goes without saying.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.460
In today’s more enlightened marketplace,
even some of the smaller devs can have their

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.300
devoted fans, houses like Chunsoft or Camelot
or Compile Heart or others that don’t start

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.960
with C. But this game, full of spherical birds
of various colors, comes to us thanks to Felicity

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.370
in Worcestershire and the previously unknown-to-me
team at...

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.370
Bottom Up.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.079
That’s their name.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.980
Bottom Up.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.920
Paints one heck of a picture, huh?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.140
A gander through their history, though, shows
that Bottom Up are responsible for a couple

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.519
dozen releases between 1994 and 2000, though
the only one available in the states is the

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.900
respectable-looking golf sim Tee Off for the
Dreamcast.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.030
That was ‘99, though, years before this...
thing.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.850
And oh, what a thing it is.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.820
Just look at this... stuff.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:21.060
VS Collection is a compilation of four games,
all featuring these kinda pseudo-tofu penguin-ish

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.060
things.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.110
The games each claim a different genre - there’s
a Balloon Fight-ish head-to-head combat game,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.200
a mode-seven-tastic racing game that desperately
wants to be Mario Kart, a frantic snowball

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.840
fight, and a stack-and-sort puzzle game full
of omelettes.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.359
And yes, you can dust off your Multitap for
this nonsense... for some of the games, anyway.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.689
Unfortunately, though, the only game I found
to not have absolutely crap controls was the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.689
puzzle.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.929
It’s fairly simple to maneuver your cursor,
and you’ll soon learn how to give yourself

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.960
extra rows so you can maintain a stream of
trouble on your opponents’ stacks.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.060
The snowball fight would almost be playable,
if there were a bit more input; as it stands,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.149
all you can do is mash the “fire” button,
maneuver up and down, and occasionally send

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.889
your squad out to rush the enemy.

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:13.770
I might’ve been a bit flip when I said the
race desperately wanted to be Mario Kart,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.770
but the graphics play out almost identically...
the controls just suck.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.010
In its defense, though, it tries to innovate
by offering the power to leap off the track

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.849
and potentially cut corners - which comes
in quite handy on this star-shaped track - but

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.930
if you land outside the borders of the course,
you lose instantly.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.700
No convenient Lakitu teleport for you, sir;
they couldn’t afford enough to buy the rights

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.989
from Nintendo.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.299
And I can’t blame them.

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.910
Finally, the battle royale (with cheese),
a four-bird fracas where, if you haven’t

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.799
dispatched all your foes inside twenty seconds,
FIRE AND BRIMSTONE RAIN DOWN FROM THE SKY.

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.849
And make navigation right terrible.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.900
It wouldn’t be that bad, only the controls
are horrible to begin with and the physics

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.900
aren’t much better.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.490
All you can do is jump and miss with attacks,
inevitably leading to your demise in the inky

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.060
void below.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.180
Bomberman this ain’t, but at least it allows
for four players.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.210
And, after enough rounds, this strange winged
projectile-spewing puffer fish shows up just

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.400
to make an arse of himself.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.890
Even meteor strikes don’t deter him.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.469
Strange winged projectile-spewing puffer fish
don’t care.

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:24.720
I wish I didn’t either.
