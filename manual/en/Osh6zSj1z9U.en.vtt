00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.209
My name is Dotan and I travel
around the world with my piano

00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:07.209
I meet really cool people,
go on amazing adventures

00:00:07.334 --> 00:00:10.615
and play in some of the
most extraordinary places

00:00:10.707 --> 00:00:13.199
This is Piano Around the World

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.365
Hey guys, look who it is,
it's my girlfriend Fallon.

00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:20.040
Fallon has been really great
with helping me

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:22.059
organize some of the things for this trip

00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:26.122
she's helped me find
a lot of people to meet up with

00:00:26.214 --> 00:00:28.828
and she's going to continue helping

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.360
with keeping this trip alive
keeping the Piano Around the World

00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:36.000
We are on the hunt to find the perfect

00:00:36.092 --> 00:00:38.055
spot to street perform in Paris

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:41.281
I'm really not sure where to go
to play for the first time in Paris

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.820
I feel as if it's better
to play after five o'clock

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:49.904
when people are starting to go home,
we're just gonna head to a couple of areas

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.549
until we find that one spot

00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:56.890
maybe we should play here, the sound with echo

00:00:56.982 --> 00:00:59.200
so nicely all throughout

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.350
Coming up to Saint Michel you can see
there's a lot of tourists everywhere

00:01:12.442 --> 00:01:15.428
the only problem is finding parking

00:01:15.528 --> 00:01:16.978
There's a protest

00:01:21.363 --> 00:01:22.969
we've found ourselves some parking

00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:26.789
it's around 4:30 in the afternoon
It's perfect time to start playing

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.890
People are finishing work and coming
home, the streets are a little bit difficult

00:01:30.982 --> 00:01:35.599
because they're slanted so pulling out
the piano is gonna be a little bit difficult

00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:39.329
we're ready to go to...

00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:43.863
the centre pompidou, this is my first
time playing piano on the streets of Europe

00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:47.519
We have to walk four blocks away

00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:50.000
to get the centre pompidou right now

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.799
Vamos! (let's go)

00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:58.799
What would I do without this dolly? 
I have no idea, I would not be able to do this

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.979
And I'm traveling

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:54.259
throughout Europe with my piano for the next three months

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
(Indistintic chatter)

00:03:15.076 --> 00:03:16.076
Oh, it sucks..

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.840
We had a good run

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.640
It was a good time here in Paris

00:03:20.732 --> 00:03:23.879
In the centre pompidou, met some really
interesting people

00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:27.006
I can't wait to play again, I'm definitely gonna be
playing again, no matter what the police says

00:03:27.098 --> 00:03:28.501
it's forbidden - that's bullshit.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.031
We're gonna head back to car, pack up, and then grab something to eat.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.289
And so my friends
we had a really good day

00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:54.500
first day playing piano in Paris
