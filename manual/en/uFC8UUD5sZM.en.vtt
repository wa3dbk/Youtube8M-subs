are here on behalf of Expert Village. We are

going to show you how to dance mambo. It's
mambo basic step when you dance with a partner,

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.630
the men's right arm is holding the ladies
left shoulder blade, and the ladies right

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:31.749
hand is on the man's right shoulder. So this
is how it looks and these arms should not

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:39.110
be down here but lift it up a little bit and
there is a space between us all the time when

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.700
