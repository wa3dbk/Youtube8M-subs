00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:08.389
Hi, I'm Karen for Expert Village. The next
thing we want to do is check it for levelness.

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:17.650
And if you get down and look at it eye to
eye here and just check to see that your cake

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:25.779
is level on the top. Now if you find that
one side is very low, you can sometimes fill

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:33.360
in with bits of cake. So you could cut, this
one is pretty level so I don't really have

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.050
to do this, but like right here, you have
a corner that's a little high. You can fill

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:55.039
in with small pieces of cake. Like that. Okay,
you can even lift up a section and slide cake

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:05.850
in or trim off if you have a high spot, you
can trim the cake like that. So, but what's

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.659
important is that you look at the cake that
it should be level on the top. And if you're

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:21.579
not good at eying it, you can check with a
ruler. This is showing four inches and it's

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:28.490
pretty level all around. That's a nice even
cake. Okay, and now the sides, you want to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:38.189
do the same thing. You want to check, and
you can take the serrated knife and just trim

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:47.210
to make a nice, straight sides. Like this.
I'm just going to trim off. You want to use

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.240
a sawing motion so that we're not ripping
pieces of cake off. That we're just gently

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:11.670
sawing off. You'll get a much more even side
if you use that sawing motion like that. Okay

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:21.070
and again on the side. Now the frosting can
fill in a lot of spots, but it's nice to have

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:32.090
good, straight edges to start with. Next we'll
ice the cake, even though we're covering it

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:41.670
completely with our sugar paste or our fondant.
You want to frost the cake all over to give

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.310
it a good base. And have a nice even cake.
