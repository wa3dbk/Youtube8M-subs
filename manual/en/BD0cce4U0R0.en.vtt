00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.800
Well what exactly is genetically modified
food? Who knows?

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.760
I think if all the appropriate testing has
been done, then I'm happy to eat it.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.160
But I think it's the fear of not really
knowing what you're eating.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.680
But it's quite hard to get a non-biased
view on genetically modified food.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.920
I prefer non-genetically modified food.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.480
I don't really have much
of a problem with it.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.400
I don't feel like that there's been a
proper public debate about it.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.480
What does genetic modification mean?

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.200
Alan Richardson - For hundreds of years
we've been using genetic selection

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.160
to improve the quality of
our agricultural crops

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.040
for instance, higher yielding plants,
plants adapted to better environments,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.880
or foods that are more nutritious for us.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.280
Gene technology allows us to do this
in a quicker and more precise way.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.880
Donna Bond - Plants contain
approximately 30,000 genes,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.080
and we're changing only one, or adding in
an extra gene to improve the plant, 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.280
making them healthier,
or making them easier to grow.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.880
I read in the paper the other day that there's 
a concern about people with allergies,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.680
that allergies are on the increase from... and they
think it's linked to genetically modified foods.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.800
Alan Richardson - I understand that allergies
are on the increase, and this is a big concern,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.920
but there's no evidence to link this to GM foods.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.000
In fact, GM foods are less of a risk because
of the extensive testing that they undergo.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.760
Whereas I like it in theory for
the advancements of science

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.560
and what possible benefits it could have,
but it appears that nobody's actually using it

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.880
for real benefits, other than benefits
for large companies back pockets.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.200
Alan Richardson - Yeah, the big companies are
involved, but it's not all about them making money.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.700
In fact in Australia most of the gene tech research
is done by public institutions, like Universities

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.720
and the CSIRO, and there are many other benefits.
For example, at CSIRO, we're producing oil seeds

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.320
that have lower saturated fats,
and inbuilt Omega 3's.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.880
Donna Bond - We're developing
genetically modified cowpeas,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.640
a staple food source for West African countries.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.520
These cowpeas will require less insecticide,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.880
and will result in the production of
more food for the local people.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.240
Probably my largest concern is
that there are

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.440
- at least in some of the media reports
that I've heard so far - is that there are

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.240
food stuffs that are being manufactured
that have genetically modified ingredients

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.200
that we're not alerted to as consumers.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.920
Donna Bond - In Australia all foods that
contain genetically modified products

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.320
must be labelled by law,
like these (demonstrating), 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.480
which contain genetically modified corn
and traces of other GM products.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.600
I just want to know, what is the projected
effect it would have on the environment

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.680
in the future?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.920
Alan Richardson - GM can actually contribute
to a cleaner environment.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.520
Any new crops developed by GM are thoroughly
tested to ensure that they don't pose

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.000
an environmental risk.
GM cotton, with inbuilt insect resistance,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.920
has now been grown in Australia
for over ten years,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.760
and now makes up most of our cotton industry.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.560
This GM cotton has resulted in an 80% reduction
in the use of pesticides,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.960
and this is great news for our farmers,
the environment,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.520
and the health of our river systems.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.920
Genetically engineering of plants is not going
to harm the human race at all.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.560
We've tried to change nature in the past,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.826
sometimes it was good,
sometimes it was bad, so...

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.880
I don't know much about it.
I trust the Scientists.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.280
I don't think I'd buy it unless
I actually knew what it was.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.240
So if I knew what it was,
then, yeah.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.800
If it makes agriculture more productive
and stuff,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.080
and more people on the planet, less farmland,
I think it's a good way to go.
