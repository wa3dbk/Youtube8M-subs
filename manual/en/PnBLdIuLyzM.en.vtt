Hi, I'm Pam on behalf of Expert Village and
today I'm going to show you different art

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.130
projects for kids. One great thing that we
learned how to do is to incorporate things

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.690
that kids love every day into art projects,
it makes it more fun. Many of you've seen

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.880
Happy Feet. So here's one thing you can do
is talk about Happy Feet and polar animals

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.050
such as penguins. The first thing you want
to do is take some white chalk and some black

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.739
paper. You want to trace the child's foot,
their shoe, which that'll be fun because they

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.050
get to take their shoe off which I've already
done because I needed a kid's shoe. You trace

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.440
it onto the black paper and have them cut
it out. It's very important that you have

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.150
kids do it that way it's more theirs and they
can be prouder about it. Then you want to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:55.010
take the little white belly and you glue it
on the black penguin, like that. Then you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.900
have the little googly eyes which, trust me,
every kid loves. They go crazy about. And

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:08.890
use some orange paper for the beak. So you
want to take, just cut a little triangle for

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.189
the beak, it doesn't have to be perfect. This
actually works better if you do it because

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.049
when you get paper that small, kids have a
hard time handling it. And the important thing

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.060
is to let the kid make the project their own.
So you can let them stick the beak anywhere

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.969
they want, if they want to put the beak down
near the foot of the penguin, right there,

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:33.600
let them do it. And then you glue on the eyes
and you have a great little penguin. Another

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.740
polar animal that's really easy to make is
a polar bear. Now I've already precut the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.549
polar bear head. Make sure you have the ears
and everything and you glue it on to a piece

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.979
of, you can do black paper, red paper, green
paper, whatever color paper that the kid wants

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.149
to use. And you take some cotton balls, you
can stretch the cotton ball out, you can leave

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.719
the cotton ball like it is, it doesn't matter.
You want to glue the cotton ball onto the

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:06.020
paper. Once you've done that, these little
fuzz balls, you can use a black one, you can

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.580
use a brown one, you can use a piece of paper,
it really doesn't matter but you glue on like

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.860
this. You have the cotton balls, you can glue
on some eyes, you can glue on a mouth. Some

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.160
kids, like I said, they want to stick their
mouth up here, they want to stick the nose

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.050
down here, it really doesn't matter. And this,
you don't really need that many things to

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.390
make it but they're fun activities that you
can talk about with your kids.
