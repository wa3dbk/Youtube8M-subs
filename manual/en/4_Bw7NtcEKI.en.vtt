00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.530
What's the point of climbing a mountain?

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.530
What lessons are you, or others, really supposed
to gain from the experience?

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.529
For four men 100 years ago on June 7, 1913,
it may have been about earning distinction

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.240
as the first to reach the summit of Mount
McKinley, the highest peak in North America.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.279
Denali is not a highly technical climb, but
it can be among the most challenging big peaks

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.190
on earth because the wind and weather can
be so cold and unpredictable.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.370
To this day, only about half the people who
try make the top.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.760
Now imagine making the attempt a hundred years
ago in 1913, four years before Congress created

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.920
Mount McKinley National Park.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.100
Prior to 1913, eight previous expeditions
failed to reach the summit.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.789
They included accomplished climbers, adventurers, and a scoundrel or two.

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.390
What set the team of 1913 apart was that they
were all hardened travelers of vast distances

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.430
of Alaska wilderness in winter.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.630
For these pioneer climbers, there would be
no modern, 40-minute flight from Talkeetna

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.380
to a base camp on the Kahiltna Glacier at
7,200 feet.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.200
Their journey to the top and back would not
be over within today's average of 17 to 21 days.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.360
Instead, the Stuck-Karstens expedition began
with 90 miles of overland travel by dog team

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.540
from Nenana, then up the Muldrow Glacier relaying ever higher more than a ton of supplies.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.960
From their base camp, they cut and hauled
firewood thousands of feet above tree line.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.240
They hunted Dall sheep and caribou to make
hundreds of balls of pemmican, a slow cook

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.159
dinner that would sustain them for much of
their 77 days on the mountain.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.750
On the whole, their journey amounted to 93
days, from winter, through spring, and into summer.

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.729
The expedition faced challenges beyond the
mountain and fierce conditions.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.920
The team leaders quarreled, sometimes stridently.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.100
A fire in a supply cache torched silk tents,
clothing, critical supplies, precious film

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.720
and camera equipment.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.120
An earthquake the year before destroyed what
had been an easier route for earlier expeditions.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.370
Instead of a relative stroll at one point,
they spent weeks chopping a staircase more

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.390
than three miles long through shattered ice
boulders and debris.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.260
And then on the night before the summit, three
of the climbers were beset by bad cooking by the fourth.

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.890
After only a few hours of attempted rest,
the men set out at three o'clock in the morning

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.000
when the temperature was 21 below zero.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.610
A bitter north wind that day very nearly blew
them off an icy slope.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.379
But after ten hours of slow, exhausting work,
they achieved their goal.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:49.620
Clearly, the Stuck-Karstens expedition staked
a place in achievement lists and history books.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.599
But what else can we try to learn from their
venture?

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.340
When it came to homework and legwork the leaders of this climb managed plenty of both.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.030
They sought out the experience of others,
and studied mistakes to avoid making them their own.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.450
They settled upon a best approach, and paid
close attention to detail.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.400
When much of their supplies went up in smoke,
they responded to the setback with ingenuity.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.000
Rising above panic and despondence, one group
traveled to base camp and back for reserves

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.099
while another cobbled together what they could
from the remains.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.510
They sewed together a new tent from canvas.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.390
They found a way somehow to make due, and
move forward.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.370
When they found their route was blocked by
the work of an earthquake, they persevered.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.549
Despite severe storms and the crushing enormity
of what they faced, they hacked footholds

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.269
for themselves up more than three miles of
broken ice.

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.569
At this point in their journey, there simply
was no other way around but through.

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.269
The composition of this climbing team proved
that diversity works.

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.950
One was an Episcopal Archdeacon, born in England, who had spent time as a teacher and cowboy in Texas.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.549
Another was a gold prospector, mail carrier,
and legendary outdoorsman who eventually would

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.750
be appointed the first superintendent of Mount
McKinley National Park.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.069
Another was a mission volunteer from Tennessee, and was noted for strong character.

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.120
And the fourth was a young Alaska Native whose
strength and relationship to the landscape

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.459
proved invaluable time and again to the survival
and success of the group.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.280
If anything, this group might teach us a little
something about respect.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.300
On the day of the summit, expedition co-leader
Harry Karstens chose to leave Walter Harper

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.800
out front, a challenging position that Harper
had performed admirably for most all of the climb.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.980
So now history records that a 21-year-old
Alaska Native earned distinction as the first

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.160
person to set foot at the top of a great mountain.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.330
Within two days of the summit, they all made
it safely back down to base camp where a loyal

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.750
assistant had been waiting and tending camp
without word for weeks longer than anyone expected.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.790
By June 20, their accomplishment was sealed
when word was cabled to newspapers in Seattle and Fairbanks.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.640
Over the years, the climbers acknowledged
that this trip changed their lives.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.630
What now are you going to draw from the experience?
