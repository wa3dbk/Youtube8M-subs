00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.700
Seeing how well you can hold a plank is a
great way to test how strong your core really

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.700
is.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.660
But the kind of plank that you are doing is
going to tell me the real story.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.750
[Music Intro]

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:28.380
What's up guys?

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.740
Jeff Cavaliere AthleanX.com.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.990
Today I want to talk to you about planks.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.660
Yes, we know that they are a good way to measure
your core strength.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.500
A lot of people use them as a time test, to
see how long you can hold it for.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.320
But to me that doesn't really matter so much.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.390
It is the kind of plank that you are doing
because slight variations in your body and

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.949
the way that you position it, can make the
exercise completely different.

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.420
So let me take you down and show you exactly
how this works out and how you can make them

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.460
more challenging as you get stronger.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.291
Remember guys, this is what Athlean-X is all
about.

00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:04.580
It is not just throwing some program at you
at saying, "go get them guys, good luck."

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.820
It is about matching your ability levels.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.180
Showing you the science behind the strength
so you can always make an exercise more difficult

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.520
and continue to grow with the program, not
just about having a 90 day program and you

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.000
are done in 90 days.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.080
So first and foremost, as basic as it gets
in rehab-someone trying to get a little back

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.660
of core strength.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.940
Start off in that quadrant press position,
hands and knees down.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.250
Now what is the main difference between this,
and when you put your feet out behind you

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.630
is just the length of the lever arm.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.050
Now by bringing my feet back more behind me,
that lever arms on the abs that are doing

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.550
the work, are a little bit longer.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.259
So now I have to work just a little bit harder
on that position.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.890
What you are trying to do is to keep the back
of your head flat and level with your shoulder

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.840
blades and with your tailbone.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.550
Everything sort of sits level at this angle.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.879
Now if you have a little bit longer arms you
are going to hang more a little bit.

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:09.530
As long as you are keeping everything straight,
you are not allowing the abs to break and

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.459
sag down, you should be OK.

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.990
Now people ask "Is this more difficult?"

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.860
Or "Why is this more or less difficult than
any other position?"

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.710
Well, if you bring it straight down to the
ground, now you have another aspect that is

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.770
in play.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.420
Now you are taking out the strength of the
chest.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.200
The mechanical advantage that you had up here
when we had our chest in play, that can help

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.700
out a lot and our shoulder blades are supported
by our arms.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.900
In other words the structure of our back here
and our shoulder blades can pretty much just

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.550
rest in the joint right here.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.820
It is actually getting pressed on the floor.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.980
It is easier to hold that position than it
is here.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.600
Now I keep the chest out of it for the most
part.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.400
Now I am relying a lot more on the abs to
hold the play.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.480
This area here is now more dependent as well-the
inner scapular area-because I don't have the

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.270
ability again to rest in and lock into the
joints.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.580
I now have to rely more on the strength in-between
my shoulder blades.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.770
So this is a more difficult variation.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.780
Now if I want to make that harder I have to
change the elevation angle so that now I am

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.280
up onto a bench.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:35.560
What this does, is increases the likelihood
that I would sag to succumb to gravity, basically.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.940
Now I have a bigger potential to cave in.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.610
So now I have to resist even more to core
to be able to hold that.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.440
Another element that you can continue to progress
to is: your base of support.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.650
The wider your base of support-I will come
this way so you can see it- the easier the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.099
exercise is.

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.030
So if I have my hands out here and my feet
wide, I am going to be able to hold it a lot

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.849
longer than I can if everything is nice and
close together, because now I have a tendancy

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.910
to rock side to side and I have to prevent
that.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.650
So more muscles, more work to do that.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.740
Same thing back up here too, this is an easier
version than everything stacked together.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.690
So we talked about lever arm.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.370
We talked about base of support.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.790
What if we did one killer variation.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.430
No Athlean-X exercise and no video is complete
without one.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.450
So Let's give ourselves a little bit of a
challenge here.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.610
We are going to incorporate all of that.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.401
We are going to narrow our base of support
and we are going to lengthen that lever arm.

00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:50.180
We are going to do that by taking out a weight
plate, holding it out in front of us here

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.650
and doing our plank that way.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.460
So again weight plate out in front of you,
lengthen the lever arm.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.930
Feet behind me, lengthen the lever arm.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.450
Base of support very narrow.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.460
Suspension: remember when I put my feet up
on the bench, we had that suspension involved?

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.169
Hands above the ground: suspension.

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.880
So we had a lot more work being done.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.660
This is kind of a combination of all those
things.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:24.250
Here, come out, feet behind.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.370
[Exercises]

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.780
A lot more difficult.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.080
you have to stabilize this plate.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.840
And down.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:41.669
So next time someone asks you how long you
can hold a plank,say "What kind?" because

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:47.010
the kind of plank that you are doing can have
a much drastic difference between the way

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.580
it feels on your body, and how you can do
on it.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.050
This is the point of Athlean-X training.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.750
Asking somebody how much they bench, right,
they are going to gauge how strong you are.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.050
I say that I don't care because I know as
an athlete there are so many ways I can expose

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.690
a weakness into you regardless of how much
you bench.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.850
If you want to start looking like an athlete,
you have to start training like one.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.919
It is going to expose a lot of different areas
that how much you bench is not going to cover.

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.150
The same thing here.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.480
How long you can hold a plank is not going
to cover.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.570
If you really want to fortify your body, and
be as athletic on the inside as you are on

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.430
the outside, you are going to have to start
following a program that does that.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.990
Hopefully as the many guys on Team Athlean
already know, we have done that.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.990
We have put that together on Athlean-X. I
would love for you to join us here on Team

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.990
Athlean.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.919
Guys I am going to be back here next week.

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:41.960
Another video.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.870
Keep your feedback coming.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.670
Tell me how long you can hold that plank that
I just did.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:07:06.139
I will see you back here in 7 days.
