The pygmy rattlesnake is the smallest of all 
 the venomous snakes found in Florida. 

00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:20.083
These snakes are also the most common, meaning that there are 
 more of them than there are any other venomous snakes.

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:27.792
These snakes will only grow 12 to 14 inches long 
 but they are also very irritable little snakes.

00:00:30.292 --> 00:00:32.292
If encountered these snakes will not hesitate to bite.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.500
 Ninety percent of all the bites sustained by venomous 
 snakes in Florida are bites by the pygmy rattlesnake.

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:50.667
Pygmy rattlesnakes have a base color of bluish grey with 
 dark spots running down their back, sides and belly.

00:00:52.338 --> 00:00:55.338
On the lateral part of their spine appear reddish outlines.

00:00:56.842 --> 00:01:04.842
Since these snakes are the most common of the venomous snakes and if someone 
 is going to have an encounter with a venomous snake here in Florida,

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:10.595
 it will be most likely with a pygmy rattlesnake. These 
 snakes  are dangerous and should be left alone.

00:01:12.307 --> 00:01:17.307
They will not hesitate to bite, if anyone comes into their striking distance.

00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:26.341
Pygmy rattlesnakes being the smallest of all of Florida’s venomous 
 snakes give birth to live young as well.

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:39.004
Their newborn are the smallest snakes I’ve ever seen. A newborn 
 pygmy rattlesnake coiled up will fit on a quarter.

00:02:10.775 --> 00:02:15.780
Pygmy rattlesnakes can be found in rural areas 
 as well as in human habituated areas.

00:02:17.183 --> 00:02:22.180
Meaning that if you deceit to buy a plant 
 in a nursery or garden department store,

00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:29.760
you should be extremely cautious while reaching for any plant before 
 looking out for snakes hiding between the flower pots.

00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:38.090
Reaching for a plant without looking first might be the 
 maine cause for being bitten by these small snakes.
