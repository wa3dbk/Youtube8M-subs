00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.350
Hi.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.360
I hope everyone had a wonderful winter break
and best wishes for a happy New Year.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.671
I want to welcome you back to the 2012 spring
semester, and thank everyone who joined us

00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:24.700
in celebrating the life and accomplishments
of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. yesterday.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.990
It was a great start to the semester.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.590
We ended the calendar year with a winter commencement
ceremony, the first in 40 years.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.030
It was very well attended by graduates, parents,
faculty, and staff.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.329
Over 1,200 students graduated in December,
and we awarded honorary degrees to long-serving

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.640
Arkansas congressman John Paul Hammerschmidt
and to Ernest Gideon Green, a member of the

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.350
Little Rock Nine and the first African American
to graduate from Central High School.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.039
While we were able to give modest raises last
year to faculty and staff, rest assured we

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.519
know salaries are still too low compared to
our benchmark institutions.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.380
To our great disappointment, we have not received
the increases in State revenue that would

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.280
allow us to compensate our faculty and staff
at an appropriate level and know that our

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.240
heavy dependence on tuition and fees places
an added burden on our students.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.070
During these tough economic times, we are
grateful to have a governor who understands

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.670
the value of higher education and its importance
to the State of Arkansas, and is committed

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.700
to helping the U of A fulfill its great potential.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.390
Several new facilities are opening this spring,
including new fitness and technology centers

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.090
in the Arkansas Union, as well as the Epley
Center for Health Professions, which will

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.330
house the Eleanor Mann School of Nursing and
Communications Disorders.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.280
We expect to have the Pi Beta Phi Centennial
Gate completed by this summer, and the Hillside

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.679
Auditorium and the Jean Tyson Child Development
Study Center before the start of the fall

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:01.960
semester.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.689
These are only a few of the many campus improvements
currently underway to enhance the academic

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.070
quality of our university and provide new
classroom space.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.310
I ask your continued patience as we enhance
the campus with the restoration and refurbishment

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.020
of several campus buildings.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.110
It is all intended to make our university
the best it can be.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.000
We just wrapped up another tremendous football
season, concluding with a victory over Kansas

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.240
State University in the Cotton Bowl.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.320
I'd like to thank everyone who traveled to
Dallas to support the Hogs and who participated

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.450
in our service project with Mission Arlington-I
know they appreciated the helping hands.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.790
Whether this is your first day on campus or
your last semester, we're glad you're here,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.210
and we wish you the best this spring.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.820
In a few short months, our senior class will
be leaving with college degrees.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.890
If you're a graduating senior, I sincerely
hope you enjoy the last few months of your

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.520
college experience.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.740
Again, welcome back and enjoy the semester.
