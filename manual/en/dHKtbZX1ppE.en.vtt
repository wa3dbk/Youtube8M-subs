00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.570
Hi, this is Ash on behalf of Expert Village.
In this clip, I tell you how to bowl a bouncer.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.730
A bouncer is a little weapon in the hands
of a fast bowler. A bouncer, as the name sounds

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.480
is a delivery which after the bounce comes
to the shoulder height, or to the head or

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.609
even above. Now this mid air is a very good
one to break the morale of batman that is

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.880
new to the bridge. Let me show you how a bowler
would actually bowl the bouncer and how it

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.850
comes on the bridge. Now to roll the ball,
you would either have the index finger here,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:45.070
or between the two ends or here with the middle
finger right beside it and the thumb here.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.930
So this is a typical stance, or this one to
hold the ball. Now after the ball, there will

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.379
be a good runner, cause this is a fast ball,
and the ball comes, the bowler bowls the ball.

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:06.170
Now this ball would typically land up at about
half the pitch length. So this is where it

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.960
would land up, and you see that this is about
ten to twelve feet from the stands, about

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.200
half the pitch length. So after it comes here,
after it lands up here, this ball rises and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.280
rises to a very good height. Now as you would
see the batsman is here, close to the stands

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.939
and this ball typically would be at least
a shoulder height or it'll go above. So basically

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.820
the batsman will either duck down to avoid
being hit by the ball. So this is how the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.020
ball comes like and you will see this ball
is generally at either the shoulder or above

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.640
the shoulder height. This ball will even go
up much higher, going above the batsman's

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.500
head or some where in this space. Now this
area is the one that I said is fairly to tend

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:04.450
to break batter's morale. Let's see how this
ball would look like in real time. That's

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.279
how it looks like.
