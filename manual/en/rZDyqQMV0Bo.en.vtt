RICHARD BUCCOLA: Hi, this is Rich Buccola
here in New York City. And today on behalf

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:10.450
of Expert Village, I'm going to show you how
to make curry phyllo triangles. All right,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.259
we're going to take our onion and give it
a good chop. All right, we're just going to

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:22.810
cut off the ends of our onion and--a lot of
skin there. Oh, baby. Get that off this side.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.030
Take two. Cut off the ends of your onion.
And you might want to score the onion 'cause

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.720
I heard that's the word of the day, so score
it and that just helps you peel back the onion.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.280
So just peel back your onion and we'll start
making a nice chop. Okay, so after you score

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.140
your onion and you get that skin off, I'm
just going to cut it in half, placing the

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:55.640
side down flat, slicing one way,
turning and slicing the other way. Now, don't

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.980
worry if this isn't the consistency you're
looking for because we're still going to use

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.040
our chopping motion of placing the point of
the blade and just giving it a good chop.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.310
Okay, so I'm just chopping away and I'm just
trying to get it down with a knife. You want

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.310
this to be finely chopped. You're going to
have your potato pieces in there with your

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.610
lamb, your curry lamb, and you just want to
have that little hint so we're going to chopped

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.840
real fine. All right, I got my onion chopped.
Now listen. I'm going to tell you something.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.810
I don't really ever--I rarely ever cry when
it comes to onions, but I'm going to tell

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.610
you, I was getting a little teary-eyed. My
camera girl has taught me a real sad story.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.010
No, all kidding aside, it was from the onion.
I lit a candle and it worked. It stopped the

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.500
tears from going away right away. So light
a candle. I'm giving you a tip. All right,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.630
so this is what we're looking for, about half
a cup of finely chopped onion. This is what

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.920
I'm talking about by finely chopped--very,
very, very, very finely chopped. Just keep

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.100
chopping it back and forth till you get it.
You're going to want about half a cup. Now,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.250
this onion was about a cup. Now, the reason
I'm telling you this is because I'm going

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.540
to cook more because we're actually going
to cook this for a party today that we're

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.479
doing. So--but for the recipe, half a cup,
okay? Half a cup of finely chopped onion.
