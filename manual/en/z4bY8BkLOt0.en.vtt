Episode 5: 	The invitation

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:25.957
— Father Beto. Are you alright? 
If you stay here you’ll get a heatstroke that you won’t soon forget!

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:31.993
— It’s my sister Clara. Yesterday, 
as I was getting the church ready, she appeared…

00:00:32.044 --> 00:00:34.044
— You speak as though she were a ghost.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:39.579
Two years ago she got divorced. I was against it and we argued.
Clara has not spoken to me since. Until yesterday.

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:43.829
Clara has not spoken to me since. 
Until yesterday.

00:00:46.487 --> 00:00:51.522
— Clara?
— Hello Beto.

00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:56.189
— What are you doing here?

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.968
It pains me that my Church has excluded me, 
that you think I’m not a good Catholic, 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.345
and haven’t wanted to give me communion. 
I have not offended God in any way.

00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:10.277
— Marriage is a sacrament, 
and a sacrament is like a tattoo, it cannot be erased.

00:01:10.328 --> 00:01:13.153
— I’m making a new life for myself, Alberto… 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.829
— I’m getting married.
— What?  

00:01:15.835 --> 00:01:21.118
— I met a good man, who, unlike Luis, 
respects me and does not treat me badly. 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.778
He also loves my children. I am finally happy.

00:01:24.839 --> 00:01:27.950
— As a Catholic, you cannot get married again. 

00:01:28.175 --> 00:01:34.053
In the eyes of God a divorce does not undo your marriage. 
You would be committing adultery…

00:01:34.078 --> 00:01:39.880
— But Luis was the one cheating on me, 
Alberto. Will you ever change? 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.474
I have not lost my faith, 
I pray that God may open your heart. 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:46.499
— Take this.
—What is it?

00:01:46.524 --> 00:01:51.751
— An invitation to the civil ceremony. 
Please be there, brother. Give me your blessing.

00:01:52.454 --> 00:01:57.958
— The violation of marriage is an offense to God.  
A person living in sin cannot take communion.

00:01:57.983 --> 00:02:04.312
— Living as a couple, when the relationship is forced , 
can eventually cause serious damage, Father Beto.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:08.345
— She was not forced into that marriage.  
She made a promise before God. 

00:02:08.438 --> 00:02:12.685
This is not a game, Sister Juana, the Bible is crystal clear. 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.816
— There is another way of seeing things, Father Beto. 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:22.342
Marriage is a sacrament, which requires 
the mutual love and free will of the couple.

00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:29.117
Some cardinals are calling for a decree to end 
the exclusion of divorced Catholics from the Church, 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.635
thereby allowing them to receive communion, 
be godparents, and marry again in the Church. 

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:42.881
— God is compassionate, Father Beto.
 And your sister is a good Catholic. Open your heart.

00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:45.381
— I’ll think about it… 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.164
— By the power conferred by the State,
I declare you husband and wife. 

00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:59.487
I bless this new family, in the name of the Father, 
the Son and the Holy Spirit.
