(Music plays in background)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.480
Hello, everyone. Today, we’re going to take a look

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.240
at one of our most popular energy lamps, the HappyLight Liberty 10K.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.860
10K refers to this lamp’s maximum light output of 10,000 LUX,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.820
an amount that 30 years of research has determined

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.620
is the optimal light intensity to get the quickest results.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.160
But first let’s take a look at the benefits

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.840
many people can expect from using an energy lamp.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.260
Light therapy is a drug- and chemical-free,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.740
natural way to improve your mood and energy.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.160
It can be particularly effective for people who

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.600
feel negative effects from the changing seasons,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.900
get the winter blues, experience changes in appetite

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.180
or who have prolonged periods of reduced exposure to the sun.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.960
It can fight fatigue, increase alertness

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.540
and help you regain focus and concentration.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.060
Finally, it can be a stabilizer for those who do shift work or have jet lag.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.480
So, about the Liberty 10K:  What makes this a great lamp is its flexibility:

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.940
By flexibility, I mean three things:

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.060
Flexibility in the length of your therapy sessions.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.300
Flexibility in your ability to move around during your therapy sessions

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.480
and Flexibility in how much light you get during your sessions.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.420
Let’s look at the features that provide all of this flexibility:

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.240
This HappyLight has several features that together

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.440
make up what we call Optiflex light customization:

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.780
We start with two interchangeable and replaceable Optix® lenses

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.380
– High Energy and Comfort –

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.080
that provide different amounts of light intensity

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.440
and diffuse the light to reduce eyestrain and fatigue.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.000
As I’m showing you here, they change quickly and easily with no tools required,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.900
simply by pulling away the magnetized bevel and sliding the lenses in and out.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.660
A High-Low light intensity switch adds to your options for light intensity.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.920
A tilt feature, for more freedom of movement during your sessions.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.180
And the 10K is wall mountable for a particularly understated and discreet presence

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.060
 – in your office, at the breakfast table, or in your exercise room.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.240
You’ll want to start with the Comfort lens and the light intensity setting on low.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.700
That'll give you 3,500 LUX of light intensity.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.520
From there you can mix and match the lenses and the light intensity

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.880
to get to the level that's most comfortable for you or for what you need for your particular session

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:44.140
– and that can be all the way up to 10,000 LUX with the High-Energy lens and the light intensity switch on “high.”

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.120
The final important point is that, despite its small size,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.000
the HappyLight 10K provides the same light intensity

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.720
as other light boxes as much as 10 times its size.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.560
This provides more options for where you can use the lamp – always conveniently and discreetly.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.300
That’s a quick overview of our HappyLight Liberty 10K energy lamp.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.320
