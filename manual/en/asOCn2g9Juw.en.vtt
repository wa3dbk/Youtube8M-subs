Hi! I'm Mark on behalf of Expert Village.
Today I''m going to teach you everything you

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.010
need to know about how to brew your own pilsner.
Today we'll be talking about everything you

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.760
need to home brew this style, which includes
the ingredients, the equipment and the different

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.360
processes you're going to need to take all
of your basic ingredients and convert them

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.010
into tasty beer. I've been a home brewer for
about nine years. I've got about 140 different

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.800
batches under my belt. I'm the president of
the Boeing Employees Line of Beer Maker's

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.610
Club, and I've even had some of my beers scaled
up and produced commercially. There are many

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.780
different ways to brew beers. Today we're
going to be focusing on extract with specialty

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.370
grades. Our focus will be on doing this as
simply as possible with the least amount of

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.610
equipment investment to start off, or recommend
the basic equipment you need and also some

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.830
equipment that if you want to get a little
more into it, you'll appreciate it later.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.860
To start off, I'm going to be giving you an
overview of what you're going to be expecting

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.940
during the whole brewing process. To begin,
you're going to start on the brewing day.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.629
On this day you're going to steep some specialty
grains, if you have them, and you're going

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.170
to add some malt extract and boil all of that,
then you're going to add in your hopps, and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.340
at the end of that, when you're done boiling,
you're going to cool it down and add in your

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.880
yeast, and this usually takes between two
to three hours. After the yeast have been

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.180
added, your wort is now beer, and the yeast
will start fermenting away for about three

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.432
to seven days days, and this is called your
primary fermentation. Once the yeast start

00:01:24.432 --> 00:01:28.950
slowing down, you're going to siphon out of
your primary vessel into a secondary vessel.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.673
This operation is called racking, and it takes
roughly thirty minutes. Once you're in your

00:01:33.673 --> 00:01:38.141
secondary vessel, you're going to let it sit
and finish its remaining fermentation that

00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:43.882
it has left, and this will take usually seven
to fourteen days. At this point, most of your

00:01:43.882 --> 00:01:49.060
yeast will have fallen out of solution and
your beer will be getting very, very clear.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.210
Finally, you're going to go into the bottling
phase, where you're going to siphon one more

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.130
time into your bottling bucket, add some priming
sugar, and then fill up your bottles, and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.829
cap them off. Then you're going to put them
into a nice, dark area and let them sit for

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.311
two or so weeks. At this point, the beer will
start carbonating itself, get up to a nice

00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:12.200
level, and then you'll be able to chill and
drink your beer. While this video will be

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.810
enough to get you started home brewing, I'd
like to recommend a couple other resources

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.129
that you can use to develop your brewing skills.
First, the American Home Brewer's Association

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.150
puts out a beginner's guide to home brewing,
which you can pick up at your local store,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.769
or request at their website at www.beertown.org.
Next we have a classic book called The Joy

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.230
of Home Brewing, which is going to be everything
you really need to get started. For people

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.019
who want to get a little more advanced, you
can pick up, How to Brew by John Palmer, which

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.019
takes you through a little more of the science.
And for some other good recipes out there,

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.739
for some beers that you may have already tried
and want to reproduce, there's Clone Brews

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.619
and Beer Captured.
