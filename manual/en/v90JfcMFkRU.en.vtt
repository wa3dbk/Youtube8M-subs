00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Daddy Troy: Welcome back to Gear Daddy, I’m
your host Daddy Troy. All week long we’ve

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.130
been talking about backyard fun. Earlier in
the week Daddy Brad and Daddy Clay gave you

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.509
some real simple solutions, well today we’re
going to the opposite end of the spectrum

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.810
and we’re going to look at a tricked out
tree house.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:31.150
Well I have here with me Larry, who is the
constructor and engineer behind this tricked

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.000
out tree house and I want to warn you, he
is a home builder so he might have some skills

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.780
that you don’t have, so kids you may not
want to try this one at home. Tell me about

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.201
this rock-climbing wall here, what’s this
made of?

00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:47.300
Larry: This is made of marine plywood – its
not cheap its about $115 a sheet, but its

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.460
guaranteed in the weather for 20 years and
you don’t have to put preservatives on it.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.430
Daddy Troy: So tell me a little bit about
this whole structure – I know that you’ve

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.180
built it to have contour lines to match the
tree aesthetically, but you’ve also been

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.840
kind to the tree in other ways.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.979
Larry: Well as well as being sculptural to
the tree – the tree is not violated in any

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.800
way with fasteners, there’s not a nail or
screw or bolt there that enters the trunk

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.070
of the tree, and you’re going to walk around,
there are places where you see just a little

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.840
bit of daylight but it doesn’t touch the
tree anywhere, except right on that resting

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.250
point - the black thing is a piece of used
tire.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.001
Daddy Troy: And where did you get this climbing
holes right here?

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.760
Larry: Those are all REI off the shelf.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.979
Daddy Troy: Okay is this some sort of beanbag
house? What’s going on right here?

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:38.420
Larry: No it’s a climbing board, which the
kids like but it evolved from needing bracing.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.290
After we had the whole thing built, you could
stand up and it would wobble a little bit.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.140
What we did was just take a bunch of bowls
out of the kitchen, draw some circles on it

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.240
and cut it out with a jigsaw and it became
a climbing board instead of just a bridge.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.190
Daddy Troy: So this is one way the kids can
get up to the deck level, what’s another

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.190
way the kids can get up there?

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.610
Larry: Well here are your options here. They
can jump up on a trapeze and climb up, because

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.890
the railing above is spaced like a ladder.
So they’ll climb on the outside, you can

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.750
go up the holes of this climbing board, you
can go up the rock climbing wall, 2 different

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.819
climbing ropes, you can go up this ladder
– this has a platform halfway, its good

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.120
for younger kids, and I have added some handles.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.750
Daddy Troy: So it gives the kid a break when
he or she is climbing up.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.019
Larry: Right, a long ladder is scary to a
young kid. We’ve had 3 year olds make it

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.750
from the bottom up through the top.
Daddy Troy: I see some monkey bars underneath

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.750
there is that right?

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.750
Larry: Yeah

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.750
Daddy Troy: Lets check those out. These are
the monkey bars you were talking about; it

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.290
looks like its also galvanized pipe.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.220
Larry: Right, it’s the same material as
all the ladders, just cut to size. A good

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.629
plumbing supplier – if you make your list,
they’ll cut exactly what you want – threads

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.069
no threads, whatever you need.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.820
Daddy Troy: And what’s this little round
ramp right here?

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.990
Larry: That’s a launch platform for a monkey
swing.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.730
Daddy Troy: A monkey swing that’s hanging
from the big pecan here.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.599
Larry: Hanging from the tree. And this is
the lower platform.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.849
Daddy Troy: Oh so a kid can get on here – its
like a tire or rope swing, and it swings out

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:11.849
into the driveway and back.

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.191
Larry: You launch from here or there.

00:03:13.191 --> 00:03:16.590
Daddy Troy: On the bottom part right here,
what do you find kids using the most? What’s

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.590
their favorite thing?

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.690
Larry: Their favorite thing, I would say monkey
swing and then it’s the trapeze yeah.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.680
Daddy Troy: So you want to climb up top and
check out the view?

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.490
Larry: Sure I’m brave enough if you’re
brave enough.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.490
Daddy Troy: I’m in let’s go.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.490
Larry: All right

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.959
Daddy Troy: Here we are on the second level
of the tricked out tree house. First of all

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:33.959
what’s this thing right here?

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.170
Larry: This is a shade and it keeps all the
funky things that drop off pecan trees, off

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.580
the deck and its sculptural – I just like
it.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.750
Daddy Troy: And how much time do kids spend
up on this level and what do they do when

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.750
they’re up here?

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.250
Larry: It depends on who their playmates are
and what their imagination is.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.069
Daddy Troy: One thing I am always worried
about is this giant hole right here sitting

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.860
right in the middle of the deck. Do kids ever
fall down that hole? Is that dangerous? What

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.860
do you think?

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:05.350
Larry: No-one has ever fallen down the hole
and I’m a more Darwinian parent than a politically

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.350
correct parent.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.599
Daddy Troy: Well thanks Larry for showing
us your tree house - it’s a really, really

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.150
cool thing. Now remember, Larry’s a professional
– you might want to get professional help

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.150
if you’re going to build one of these in
your own backyard.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.380
