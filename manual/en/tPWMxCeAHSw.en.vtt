00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.679
I grew up on a farm with watching

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.730
my grandfather father and actually a lot of
the

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.329
techniques we use go back to some of 
those techniques that they used

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.230
that probably had gone down through

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.529
centuries of development, some 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.910
of the concepts and I'm not sure  they knew exactly why they were doing some 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.650
things but a I got inducted into the
South Dakota Hall of Fame in 2007

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.260
basically that's what I said is you know,  I'm getting inducted in the Hall

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.089
of Fame for rediscovering things my grandfather and father did....

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:47.589
 and bringing them back in and putting a
twist on that we're going to do this now 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.940
in a modern context with not doing tillage

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.750
and the only thing we ever did was we just took old, old 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.189
 ecological principles of crop
rotation

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:02.290
and predators and prey and...

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.740
we haven't used an insecticide on the
farm here in

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.220
 in about 10 years. You know if we
screw it up

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.290
then yeah we have to come in and take a
big bat

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.940
and hit the "reset" button maybe, but we haven't had to do that now

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.860
in quite a while and way we do
the insect thing is

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.040
is we're very cautious about

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.430
using insecticide because we learned
early on as soon as we pull that trigger

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.440
on an insecticide then we

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.580
we kill the predators.  Our entomology
freinds tell us we have about two billion

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.350
predators

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.890
per acre.........

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.340
with a "B" ... and some of them are ants  and then

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.020
you know, one of the main

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.340
causes of death of things like aphids is fungi.  

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.299
So if you have a very active fungi
population there, 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.440
they just give the heebie jeebies

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.430
to the aphids when they come here.  And there's in there really good evidence

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.319
for that

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.920
I mean there's good numbers, real science that people have proven that.  

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.219
We guessed that  

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:22.219
 at one time based on on principles.
