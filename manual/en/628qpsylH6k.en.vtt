00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.750
Shalom! I am Bisqwit, and guess what is this.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.900
It is a 4x4x6 cuboid,
a form of a twisty puzzle,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.090
like the Rubik's cube.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.670
A few weeks back I saw one
for the first time in my life

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.009
on crazybadcuber's YouTube channel,
and it fascinated me.

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.519
Seeing as how it is a shape-shifting puzzle.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.089
Soon thereafter,
I bought one from HKNOWSTORE.

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.540
Right now I cannot yet solve it;
it is a bit too complicated for me,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.360
but I plan to eventually master it.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.380
On the table you can see a few other cubes
that I also bought.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.990
There is a 3x3, a 4x4, a 5x5 and a 2x2.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.150
I have some prior experience of the 3x3.
However, never in my life

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.920
have I managed to solve
even one of these.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.510
Until now, that is.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.370
I learned the so-called "beginner's method"
to the 3x3 cube.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.059
And in this video I will do a couple of quick
solves.

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.530
Just a warning though: I am not a speedcuber.
My solves are not very fast.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.960
I say "quick" because it's quick for me, not
quick for everyone else.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.990
If you are one of those who can't STAND
someone posting a Rubik's cube solving video

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.560
that is not FAST, please quit watching now.
Thank you.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.670
This is a very nice stickerless 3x3 cube
that I bought from dx

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.189
for a couple of dollars.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.549
It turns and cuts corners very nicely,
certainly worth its price

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.729
if you like these puzzles.

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.090
You can find the links to all of these cubes
in the video description.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.859
My method of solving the cube begins with
placing correctly all the edge pieces on the

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.299
white side,
called a white cross.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.420
Then, the corners for the white side.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.950
After that, the part that I am doing right
now,

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.619
which is solving the edges in the middle layer.
I still struggle with that part somewhat;

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.350
I cannot turn the front layer very quickly.
So it takes a disproportionally long time

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.730
in my solve,
unless I get lucky -- which I did not.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:24.780
It involves either
U R U' R' U' F' U F,

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.680
or: U' F' U F U R U' R'.
Depending on where in the top layer the necessary

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.860
piece is.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.640
First I memorized these algorithms, but when
one night I thought

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.390
about it for a while, I also understood the
logic behind them.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.790
It is really basic method,
which collects the bottom corner piece into

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.600
the top layer
right next to the desired piece, and then

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.810
inserts both at the same time to the right
place.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.110
Once the two bottom layers are done,
comes making the yellow cross,

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.930
followed by the yellow corners;
both without caring about the edge colors.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.760
Now, apparently, I am solving the cube faster
than I can explain how I am doing it

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.290
-- it took one minute and 50 seconds by the
way --

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.710
so I will just scramble the cube and solve
it again.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.530
Anyway, once the two middle layers are completed,
and the top layer corners are all done,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.310
making the top layer all single color
-- yellow in my case --

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:34.460
involves repeating the nifty algorithm
of R U R' U R U2 R',

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.630
several times.
How many times, and how to orient the cube?

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.190
It is mostly a matter of trial and error to
me...

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.230
Now I am doing the middle layer edges again...

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.880
I tried making the U' F' U F rotations faster
by reorienting the cube such that the Front

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.540
rotations
become Right rotations, but it is still somewhat

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.420
cumbersome.
Considerable time is spent also in trying

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.380
to locate the pieces;
I suspect this is something that only gets

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.610
better by practice.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.090
After this, comes making the top layer entirely
yellow,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.280
as explained before.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.310
At that point, the top layer still needs reorienting,
for which there are two algorithms:

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.130
One which swaps three corners, and
one which swaps three edges.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:37.910
The corner swapping algorithm is:
R B R F2 R' B' R F2 R2.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:45.700
The edge swapping algorithm is:
R U' R U R U R U' R' U' R2

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:58.210
And these are quite fast to perform.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.310
One minute and 40 seconds! Better than the
last time.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.000
Thanks for watching! See you next time. Bye!
