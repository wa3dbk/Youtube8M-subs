00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.140
On October 28, 2002 Marianne Thieme 
and Lieke Keller decided it was enough..

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.200
They founded the first political
party in the world...

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.210
that defends the interests of animals,
nature and the environment

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.000
instead of the short-term
peoples interests.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.130
Gandhi said: A nation's civilisation is
measured by how it treats its animals.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.190
A film about a 10-year battle
for compassion and sustainability.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.180
Dutch television reported that
the Party for the Animals...

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.010
most probably would never
enter the House of Parliament.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.000
...while deep down they must know that
they won't make it into parliament...

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.050
But, they are putting up a stiff fight.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.190
Straight after the elections, the author
Mensje van Keulen sent me an e-mail...

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.000
stating that she had voted
for The Party for the Animals.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.000
Mensje Van Keulen got us
in touch with other writers.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.500
The number of electable candidates
just grew and grew.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.000
This resulted in extra publicity
and extra votes.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.000
This new unconventional party was
not always welcomed by other parties...

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.000
The smallest party has the largest
number of questions and motions.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.000
They do what they promise.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I think the party is an improvement.
Since they won't let go...

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
far more is achieved...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I have a strong feeling that this
will be the century of the animals.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
What you see is that people are no
longer accepting..

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.000
that we treat animals as objects...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Does the Party for the Animals compare
human rights with animals rights?

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.000
People always see impossibilities.
We can't abolish slavery...

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
because the economy will collapse.
But, it was possible.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The same applies
to handing out animal rights.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
To let animals display their natural
behaviour, that's not revolutionary.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In and outside of Parliament the party
leads in taking action...

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
making documentaries and raising
awareness.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But politics is whimsical.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.000
Two-thirds of Parliament supported the
parties ban on slaugther without stunning.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500
But the Senate reversed
a democratic vote.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The Party for the Animals stears a
clear political course.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
On animal rights but also on foreign
affairs, geopolitics and economics.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.500
Furthermore, i believe there should
be an end to factory farming.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The Pacer in the Marathon

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.500
a documentary of the Nicolaas G. Pierson
Foundation
