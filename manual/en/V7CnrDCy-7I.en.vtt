00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:01.562
- Hey, this is Donnie.

00:00:01.562 --> 00:00:03.406
- And this is Jess, and in this video

00:00:03.406 --> 00:00:07.573
we've got another question that
was e-mailed to us from Jim.

00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:11.564
Jim had asked,

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:14.400
"I have a friend trying
to paint my 1993 Chevy

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.900
"with the HRB9700,

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:19.920
"has tried two times now
and keeps getting lines

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.430
"and stripes on the top and rear area,

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.180
"only the big spots.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.950
"He is using a gun that
is 1.4 and was told to do

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.772
"a 75% overlay.

00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:33.022
"Temp here is 85 in the morning
and 95 in the afternoon.

00:00:33.022 --> 00:00:34.415
"Any help or questions will be great.

00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:35.248
"Thanks."

00:00:36.283 --> 00:00:38.861
- This is really a good question, Jim.

00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:43.361
What he is talking about is
this Hot Rod paint they have.

00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:47.072
It's that semi-gloss, flat
matte color they have.

00:00:47.072 --> 00:00:49.385
That is one of the
biggest troubles they have

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:52.969
with that type of paint
is, and it's gonna happen

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.788
on the bigger areas.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:57.601
It's gonna happen on the hood, the roof,

00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:01.044
and those large areas
because it dries different.

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:03.810
I've got a couple
suggestions that may help,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.510
and I think one of the main
things is that it causes stripes

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.682
even with metallics and things like that.

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:10.405
This color is one of the
ones that you're gonna

00:01:10.405 --> 00:01:11.735
have the biggest problem with,

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:14.744
but if you're spraying and
you're not completely parallel

00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:16.255
with the work surface,

00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:19.329
you might be trying to
get this gun where it is.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.938
If you see right here,

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:24.502
if you're kinda squaring
away with the cup here,

00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:25.980
that's not parallel with the surface.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.124
You really need to be about right here.

00:01:28.124 --> 00:01:30.960
Or if you're holding
the gun handle parallel,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.207
it's a little bit uneven this way.

00:01:34.207 --> 00:01:36.284
If you think about it,
whenever thhat spray paint

00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:38.755
is coming out, it's
coming out dryer over here

00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:39.727
and wetter over here.

00:01:39.727 --> 00:01:41.273
That's probably where you're seeing

00:01:41.273 --> 00:01:44.032
those stripes is where
you get that wet edge.

00:01:44.032 --> 00:01:46.449
This paint, the way it dries,

00:01:47.572 --> 00:01:50.188
the wetter edge is gonna dry,

00:01:50.188 --> 00:01:53.207
have more of a glossy appearance.

00:01:53.207 --> 00:01:54.854
That's first tip I can give you

00:01:54.854 --> 00:01:57.344
is make sure that your gun is parallel,

00:01:57.344 --> 00:01:59.261
this nozzle right here.

00:02:00.268 --> 00:02:01.661
The second thing is, and we will go over

00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:06.134
this technical data sheet
with you real quick.

00:02:06.134 --> 00:02:07.487
I don't think it mentions this on here,

00:02:07.487 --> 00:02:09.682
but if you're having
problems with stripes,

00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:11.255
what you might do is put your two,

00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:12.842
it says medium wet coats on here.

00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:17.034
Put them on, and then come
back with another coat,

00:02:17.034 --> 00:02:18.701
kind of a mist coat.

00:02:19.623 --> 00:02:21.636
You might get your gun a
little bit further away,

00:02:21.636 --> 00:02:23.642
maybe about 12 inches away,

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:25.258
and maybe go the other direction.

00:02:25.258 --> 00:02:29.382
For example, if I put two
coats going on this way,

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:33.044
you might come back with
that third drop coat.

00:02:33.044 --> 00:02:35.405
Get a little bit further
away and come over this way.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:39.263
That's just to kinda help
hide any wet spots or stripes

00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:40.215
that you may have.

00:02:40.215 --> 00:02:42.965
Those two tips may help you some.

00:02:44.712 --> 00:02:48.950
Now, this is some of PPG's
Vibrance paint that they have.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.606
I have never used this exact brand here.

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:55.809
I have used some of Keysotne's
Hot Rod paint that they have,

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:57.608
but we will go over this real fast,

00:02:57.608 --> 00:02:58.441
and just kinda make sure that

00:02:58.441 --> 00:02:59.582
you're doing everything alright.

00:02:59.582 --> 00:03:00.915
It sounded like,

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:05.401
you said it's 85 or 95 there.

00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:07.480
I don't know if you
mentioned what reducer,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.420
but make sure you're
using the right reducer,

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.009
either 885 for warm weather,

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:15.626
or it sounds like you might
really need to use the DT895.

00:03:15.626 --> 00:03:18.419
So make sure that you
have the right reducer.

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:22.252
As far as coats, it's
recommended two to three

00:03:23.716 --> 00:03:26.790
medium wet coats, so that's
maybe what I would do

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.716
is to put two medium wet coats,

00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:30.844
and then come back with that control coat

00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:33.003
or that mist coat to just
kinda help lock in that

00:03:33.003 --> 00:03:35.705
where you don't see those stripes.

00:03:35.705 --> 00:03:37.646
It says that you need
to wait 10 to 15 minutes

00:03:37.646 --> 00:03:39.782
in between coats, but
you wanna make sure that

00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:42.077
it has has completely flash,
cause if you catch a spot

00:03:42.077 --> 00:03:45.048
that is a little bit wetter
and it looks a little

00:03:45.048 --> 00:03:47.981
glossy or wet in that area,
and you put another coat on,

00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.206
chances are that that are is gonna stay,

00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:51.828
gonna have a stripe right there.

00:03:51.828 --> 00:03:54.656
So make sure that it is
completely flashed off

00:03:54.656 --> 00:03:56.272
and dull before you put the next coat,

00:03:56.272 --> 00:03:57.985
but here on this technical data sheet

00:03:57.985 --> 00:04:00.424
are recommended 10 to 15 minutes,

00:04:00.424 --> 00:04:02.203
but this is at 70 degrees.

00:04:02.203 --> 00:04:06.101
If you're shooting at 95,
that should be plenty of time,

00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:07.784
unless you're putting
it on real thick coats.

00:04:07.784 --> 00:04:11.088
That's something else you
might not have thought of

00:04:11.088 --> 00:04:13.655
is you don't wanna put this
on real thick, real heavy.

00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:15.765
It's asking for medium wet.

00:04:15.765 --> 00:04:16.880
Putting it on too heavy,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.685
that might cause it to dry different

00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:21.410
and cause some type of stripes.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.054
Anyway, maybe those
few tips will help you.

00:04:24.054 --> 00:04:25.954
If not, comment back on this,

00:04:25.954 --> 00:04:28.359
and we will see what we can do from there.

00:04:28.359 --> 00:04:30.372
I will say that ...

00:04:30.372 --> 00:04:33.289
Do you like this paint, the mattes?

00:04:34.304 --> 00:04:35.676
- I love matte paint.

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:37.775
- I mean it looks good.

00:04:37.775 --> 00:04:40.313
It became popular several years back,

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:43.216
it seemed that you started
seeing a lot of it.

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:46.215
I think it looks good,
but it is harder to paint.

00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:47.756
For one, the stripes.

00:04:47.756 --> 00:04:49.463
For two, if you have any imperfections,

00:04:49.463 --> 00:04:50.927
if you have runs, if you have dirt,

00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:53.360
if you have anything like
that, you're stuck with it,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.232
because you can't sand and polish it.

00:04:55.232 --> 00:04:57.507
If you buff it, it's gonna
be glossy right there,

00:04:57.507 --> 00:05:01.883
so you just got to kinda
whatever the end result is

00:05:01.883 --> 00:05:03.509
is what it is.

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:04.871
- All right, thanks for
watching this video.

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.929
As always, we appreciate the questions,

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:09.448

if you went and subscribed

00:05:09.448 --> 00:05:10.489

00:05:10.489 --> 00:05:11.558
See you next time.

00:05:11.558 --> 00:05:12.522
- See you.

00:05:12.522 --> 00:05:15.105
(upbeat music)
