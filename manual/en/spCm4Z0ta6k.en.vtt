Hello &amp; Welcome to a brand new episode of F3 recipes.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.880
Today will make Kesar Badam kulfi

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.020
So, let's have a look at its ingredients, so for this you require

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.820
Sugar, Almond Pieces ( I have coarsely grind them)

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.920
Kesar (Saffron) Milk Made &amp; Milk

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.520
Firtsly

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.120
Will pour milk in the pan

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.920
We'll add sugar along with this

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.340
and now we will cook this

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.480
Till the time its nicely boiled

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.780
We, have added sugar initially only. So that it melts &amp; becomes caramelize with nice brown color

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:05.849
And we have to boil the milk till its reduces to its half.

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:09.900
Milk is boiling , now will slow down the induction.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.920
Will minus its heat &amp; will add

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.060
Almond.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.860
since its Kesar Badam Kulfi so it should contains lots of almonds (Badam)

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.700
And kesar (Saffron) whom i have already soaked in the water

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.280
This will also add in  this

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.920
and once again will mix it nicely

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.750
i have added less sugar as we have to add condensed milk in this

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.920
Else our kulfi will be too much sweete

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.740
and will cook it , till the time milk is reduced to its half

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.860
Milk is quite thicker &amp; its smells really nice.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.180
Now we will add some condensed milk in this

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.460
We will mix it well

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.620
Just one more boil &amp; you are done.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.360
Let's off the induction

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.120
We will let it cool down &amp; then

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.140
I have some moulds which are easily available in the market.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.896
We will fill the kulfi in these moulds &amp; will put them into freezer.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.220
Milk is completely cool down &amp; now will fill it in these moilds.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.160
We have added the milk in the molds &amp; now i am bringing the ice here.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.940
We will put these ice cubes in this bowl.

00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:09.885
and will place this bowl in the freezer for around 5-6 hours

00:03:09.885 --> 00:03:12.045
or you can keep it for overnight as well

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.360
Let us place it in the fridge

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.620
So, just wait for few hours &amp; then our Kesar Badam Kulfi will be ready

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.523
