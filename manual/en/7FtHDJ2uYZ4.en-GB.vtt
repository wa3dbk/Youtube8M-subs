00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.480
Welcome to SITREP#20. The focus of today is the Airstrike unit.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.000
They're one of the most powerful units
in the game, but are very hard to master

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.840
You have to get the timing just right for maximum efficiency

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and our lead game designer will tell you how to do just that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Stay tuned and enjoy the show

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The air-strike is a support unit that rains destruction from above

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and deals huge damage to enemy ground units

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Air-strike can be one of the most deadly units
in the game and destroy multiple enemies at once

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but they can also be completely insignificant
in battle if used incorrectly

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So what are the main differences between the
different air-strike units? Let's take a closer look

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Okay we now have three types of air-strike and they are all offense-based

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
However they are unique in the way they deal damage
and there are different tactics for each

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The first type uses a skill called Bomb Run
which deals a large amount of damage to an area

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
This type has the safest and most guaranteed
way of dealing damage

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The second type uses a skill called Napalm
It deals damage over time in an area and slows enemies

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
If there's a large group of enemies concentrated
in one area or if the unit has a high armor rating

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the commander can be very lethal

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And finally the third type uses a skilled called Walking Bomb

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It deals damage to a very long area and can also stun enemies

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
This commander has a much larger blast radius than the other two

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
but it deals less damage and can not hit turrets

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So how do we use air-strike in the most effective way
what are the best tactics

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Let's have a look

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
There are a few things to keep in mind when using air-strike

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
First one is air-strike takes time to reach their destination so timing is the most important factor

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The easiest way to make sure you hit enemies
is by making sure they're standing still

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and engaging your units already

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Secondly make sure your air-strike isn't damaged
on the way to the target

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
because they'll deal reduced damage in that case

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Air-intercept units are your biggest threat

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
but AAV and infantry can also greatly reduce
your unit's potential

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So ideally you'll want to deploy an air-strike
right after the enemy uses an air-intercept

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
so you know you can't be countered.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And finally this may be obvious but make sure
your air-strike unit is at the appropriate level

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Units have a reduced hit rate against
higher level enemies and with air-strike

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
this is very important

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
If you miss the enemy then you just wasted a unit

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Hey Jacques thanks for being here
Hi Jing

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So a player this month is asking

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Would there be a side for a Terrorist Campaign
such as the Army of the Forgotten in the future

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It's possible but there's a lot to consider

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We have two factions right now and are working
on a third one which is already quite a lot

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Aside from the production costs we also need
to consider the gameplay impact

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
of another faction and splitting players up into 4 groups

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
To be honest I don't see it coming in the near future

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and we need at least to see how the game feels with 3 factions

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
That makes sense thank you very much Jacques
Thank you

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
