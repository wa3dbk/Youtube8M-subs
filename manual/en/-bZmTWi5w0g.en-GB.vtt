00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.200
The sound of the piano   

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.620
originates from the percussion of the hammer heads  

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.200
on the strings. 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.080
Each note is made up  

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.440
of a fundamental note

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.340
and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.680
of a lot of secondary notes

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.200
that contribute to forming its tone.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.120
It is the percussion of the hammer head on the string 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.900
 that releases the secondary notes 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.740
that we call harmonic sounds.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.320
Two strings vibrating at slighty different frequencies 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.340
produce “beats”.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.040
It is important that each note 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.640
can blend nicely

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.439
with all the others notes.

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.933
The skill of the tuner 

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.734
is his/her ability 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.340
to hear and then identify the harmonic sounds 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.000
that two notes have in common.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.480
To do this 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.340
we have to pull or loosen the strings 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.880
by turning the tuning keys

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.420
they are connected to.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.700
In order for the entire length of the keyboard to be tuned equally,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.220
there should not be a mathematical relationship between two notes, 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.640
the intervals should all be slightly out of tune

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.140
Bach said: 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.320
 “at last the piano is out of tune in all keys”.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.280
Tuning is only one 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.000
of the many tasks of the piano technician. 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.980
There is also the adjusting of the tone, 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.180
the balancing of the mechanics, 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.940
and the partial or complete restoration of an instrument

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.140
including work on the heart itself of the piano,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.560
that is the soundboard. 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.400
When a piano is tuned perfectly, 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.800
it is then necessary to work on the timbre, 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.820
The timbre, 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.600
determines the  the tone colour, 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.680
the harmonic content of the notes. 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.240
This is done by pricking the felt on the hammer head

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.180
with a tool called "voicing needle". 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.280
It is equally important

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.340
that the hammers are perfectly level with the strings.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.780
After the piano has been tuned 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.160
and the hammer heads have been pricked 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.000
for the desired tone (voicing) ,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.620
it will also be necessary to regulate 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.460
the let-off and drop of each hammer 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.600
in order for the levers to move in such a way 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.420
that the mechanics act as an extension 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.240
of the player's hands.
