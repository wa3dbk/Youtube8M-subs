00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.620
some folks Dustin Dustin's fish tank I
got to be a little quiet cuz everybody's

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.429
upstairs sleeping so hope you can hear
me okay fun stuff I got a new fish

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.830
always a good time and I don't want to
copy Steve too much the guy with the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.990
rainbows is shit as sick but he's got a
millennium rainbow and I couldn't resist

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.730
I bought one but I'm dealing with the
same problem he is he isn't eaten so I'm

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.329
going to I don't naive you're not even
good so I'm gonna give a sauce so here

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:42.300
we go we got the 220 sorry the water
level is low and I want to just talk

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.210
through this real quick so like when
you're getting rainbows it's very very

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.170
very important to always buy them in
pairs

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.399
I think that's overlooked I don't keep
cichlids because I don't like the way

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.370
they beat the shit out of each other
enough some of you guys might like to

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.060
hear that but they do well rainbows get
kind of pissed off at each other too so

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:11.460
I'd like to pretend that we're at a bar
and we're all drunk and there's a bunch

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.049
of dudes we've been watching football
all day or whatever and they're hammered

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.710
and there's only one broad in the whole
bar well guess what those guys were

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.400
probably gonna fight over that girl well
that's the same deal with rainbow fish

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.950
so personally I believe that you can you
should only keep rainbow fish with like

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.439
one male one female and if you've got a
boesemani like that he's looking out

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.890
because I got him two bitches
her

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.810
as a female both mine and I'll have
those money falling out of my ears

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.290
because that whole tank over there it's
full of those money but anyway so I

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.430
bought two millennium rainbows and I
want to point out the difference of

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.850
these that right there is an Iranian red
and I don't have the scientific names

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.229
but I'll get them and then that is a
millennium rainbow notice there's a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.200
difference there that millennium is a
bigger rounder more disk shaped and this

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.110
little guy is like narrow and just a
little skinnier so I wanted to get a

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.590
contrast I want to just get a couple of
but I made sure I bought him a girl too

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.560
I gotta find his girl I'm not sure where
she is but I want to get a good look at

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.830
him so that's my dude right there so
what I'm gonna do though is I'm gonna

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.250
put some of this garlic I've had in the
stuff for like years I mean I might even

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.870
had this like before I was in college
and I went to college when I was in 99

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.760
so this stuff is like pride 10 years old
it's garlic it works whatever so I'm

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.900
gonna drop it in here before I put any
of it on the food I'm just gonna drop

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:03.090
some in to get them all riled up if you
can see that yeah all right so put a

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.980
little too much in it but whatever so
they're just like oh damn what's that

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.049
I'm gonna take some mices shrimp over
here and I'm Isis for saltwater but

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:21.360
whatever I'm gonna oh I just put too
much on that too damn and obviously you

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.590
know you try not to get this stuff on
because it stinks but I'll seal that up

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.430
dip my finger over here get some water
good put on there I'm just gonna kind of

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.670
whirl around

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.110
I hope that I'm gonna get these guys for
all up to so what I'm doing is I'm just

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.220
getting a little garlic in these tanks
it's that the fish are like oh man cuz

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:53.129
they love to smell them so uh yeah so
that's what I'm doing and I'm actually

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:59.720
gonna let it melt a little bit more than
that because it's not to my liking but

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.390
I'm gonna put that in the tank with the
rainbow and I'm gonna try to get that

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.269
millennium to eat I really don't want to
feed him cherry red shrimp I will if I

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.310
have to I mean heck I could just put
them over here because in this tank I

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.289
mean it's not a problem you know so
that's what I'm doing I also want to

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.250
plug fish tank tv.com real quick because
I've got some great content up there

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.930

get their immune systems good anyway why
