00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.440
- Welcome to Charli's Crafty Kitchen,
where you can eat what you make.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.760
- G'day.
Welcome to Charli's Crafty Kitchen.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.240
Today we're making Lego Cookies!

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.080
Today our ingredients
are some flour to dust,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.440
some red M&amp;Ms,
and some red cookie icing.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.160
We've got some red food colouring,
a square cookie cutter,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.840
and a rectangle cookie cutter.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.520
We've got a baking tray
and some baking paper.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.320
We've got a skewer,
a knife, and a rolling pin.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.920
We've also got some of
our three-ingredient cookie dough.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.160
For the recipe, click the link
in the description box below.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.240
Preheat the oven to
180 degrees Celsius,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.320
or 350 Fahrenheit.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.120
Today I'm just gonna make
the red ones,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
but you can make yours
any colour that you like.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.720
We're gonna colour the cookie dough.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.280
If you don't want to get
red hands, use gloves.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.600
You want it to be quite red
and bright like Lego.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.600
We're gonna get our flour

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.480
and sprinkle it all over the bench.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.080
We're gonna put our dough down,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.760
and we're gonna put
our baking paper on top.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.760
Now we're gonna roll it out.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.600
You want it to be
about a quarter of an inch thick.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.280
Just like that.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.880
We're gonna take
our baking paper off.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.520
Now we're gonna cut out
our shapes.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.400
We're just doing one of each
to show you how.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.760
Now we're gonna put it on the tray

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.120
and bake it for 12 minutes.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.160
Get a grown-up to put it in the oven.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.600
We're just gonna use the cookie
icing to go around the edge.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.360
It's best to leave it to dry
for five to 10 minutes

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.480
then we'll come back
and colour it in.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.640
We're gonna colour in the big one.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.960
Now we're gonna use a skewer

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.880
to colour in the bits
that are still not coloured.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.360
Just like that!

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.320
Now I'm gonna do the little one!

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.280
Now I'm gonna put
six M&amp;Ms on the big one

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.960
and four for the small one.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.000
Just like that.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.640
It's best if you leave them to dry
overnight,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.360
and then they won't be all sticky.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.120
I'm gonna call my sister
to come and join the taste test!

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800
- Here I am, darlings!

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.480
Now for the taste test.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.800
- Mmm!

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.240
What do you think, Ash?

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.600
Thumbs up?

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.680
(Ashlee hums)

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.400
- I think it's awesome!

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.040

Lego, Lego, Lego.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.480
(laughs)

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.680
- Everything is awesome!

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.680

of the Lego movie, Ashlee?

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.600
- Um...Girl-girl?

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.760
Do you want one of mine, Charli?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.160
