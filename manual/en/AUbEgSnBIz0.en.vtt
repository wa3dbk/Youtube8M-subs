00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.580
We're just going to start now. You
shouldn't feel any pain at all,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.520
but if you do just let us know, and
we  can stop at any time.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.740
My name's Margaret Cox, and this is the
HapTEL lab which is in the Dental

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.860
Institute in Guy's Hospital, which
is part of King's College London.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.380
The equipment that you see behind
us here, what it does is it acts as a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.570
virtual dental work station. You could
say it's a virtual patient for dentists,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.800
although it's probably a very
well-behaved patient.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.300
You put on these virtual reality glasses. That
tracks your head movement when you're

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.520
preparing the tooth, to mimic essentially what it
would be like to drill a tooth on a real patient.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.860
You've then got a virtual reality handpiece
which tracks where the handpiece is

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.620
in relation to you drilling the tooth on a
patient with a cavity.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.280
Upstairs there are 77 real dental workstations
which cost Â£45,000 each,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.180
and these ones were designed so that the students
could try out things over and over again.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.780
These students have got to be safe to
practice in about 18 months' time.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.470
Dentists do make mistakes - they can drill
too far into your tooth, they can remove too

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.270
much healthy teeth, even after years of
training. Here it tells them in the very

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.860
first year how much healthy tooth they've
removed, how much decay material they

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.520
removed, so they can get a much higher
level of perfection in their first year.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.140
When you do your first filling on your first
patient, it does make you very very aware of

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.100
what you're looking for and what you want
in a good cavity preparation and filling.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.580
Through doing this in dentistry we've
developed ways that can be translated

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.040
into other disciplines like medicine, like
physics. People who've been stroke victims,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.740
for example. You could change this
device so that people could learn to

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.540
write again using the same sort of approach.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.220
One of the things that it doesn't do
is it doesn't feel pain, although some

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.600
of the dentists would like us to incorporate in the
graphics blood pouring out of the mouth

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.540
if they drill too deeply, for example. You could
do that, but we haven't actually done that yet.
