Hey folks Todd Faircloth here and we're here
at the Strike King writer's conference. I'll

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.390
talk a little bit about the Swimmin' Caffeine
Shad, I'm real found of this bait. As many

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.339
of you know I won my first Bassmaster Elite
Series event of the year this year on the

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:31.339
Sabine River fishing with this exact color
and bait. I had it rigged a little bit different,

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.780
I was fishing real real shallow water so I
had a 1/16 ounce weight on the front of it.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.010
Basically what I was doing in that tournament
was I was fishing a big expansive flat that

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:50.010
had a mixture of pads, grass, different types
of grass, and it had some reeds. The fish

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.019
weren't really keyed in on one specific deal
but what I could do with this bait was I could

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:03.010
cover a lot of water and I could keep the
bait in the strike zone. I was basically making

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.640
long casts with and I was just crawling the
bait through potential areas where I thought

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.740
the fish might be. Sometimes they were random,
but I tried to fish something different where

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.740
the pads met the grass line, or reeds met
the pads, and I was looking and trying to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.130
find something different. It's just a great
great bait; it's a real nature looking bait.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.710
You can fish it shallow, you can fish it deep,
and you can vary the depths you fish it with

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.110
the amount of weight that you put on it. Like
I said, there I was fishing 2 foot or less

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.640
of water so I was using a 1/16 ounce weight
and this is a 1/4 ounce weight. You can fish

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.640
this from anywhere from7-8 foot of water.
This is the Pro Blue and it's a real natural

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.390
looking shad color in the water, which is
my personal favorite. But we've got a lot

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.390
of different colors in it. Next time you're
out there and you're is a situation where

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.849
maybe a spinnerbait isn't working, or maybe
a bladed bait isn't working and you know there

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.849
is fish present. This bait can definitely
add to your catch for the day. Give it a try!

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.849
You know there is a couple of different ways
you can rig the Swimmin' Caffeine Shad. Whenever

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:47.829
I'm fishing around cover and I'm throwing
it in thick stuff such as grass, around wood,

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:54.829
or what be. I'll rig it Texas Rig like this
with the hook coming out of the back. It's

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.650
a real Weedless bait like this. If you're
fishing flat points where there's not a whole

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.650
lot of cover then you my want to go with just
a regular jig head. They make a lot of swim

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.310
bait heads now and you can just rig it and
bring the hook out of the back of the bait

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.310
where it's exposed. If I'm fishing spare cover
that's how I rig it and you'll get more hook

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:29.299
ups that way. It's got a real natural swimming
action to it. The tail has a kick to it, and

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.340
they whole bait kind of wobbles as it's coming
through the water. Its just a real natural

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.719
appeal for the fish and it's a bait that a
lot of people won't throw in real thick cover

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:46.310
and that's kind of why I like it. It just
gives the fish a little b it different look,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.310
and a lot of times that's what it takes.

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:02.999
But it does work!
