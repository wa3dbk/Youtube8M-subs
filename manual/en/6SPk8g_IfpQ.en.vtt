You want to do the same on the other side,
so, if this point meets, we've got a point

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.820
here, so the point's going to start here.
And we could draw it in, you could, what I

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:18.500
would suggest is actually drawing another
plane. Well, I should do that. I'm going to

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.910
draw another plane. So we've got this back
plane, we've got a side plane, we're going

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:34.470
to draw another plane here. So, this basically,
what we're doing is actually creating, this

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.670
is how they would make miles in the computer,
three dimensionally. They would take a three

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.649
part drawing like you would do in drafting
and you would have a top view, a front view,

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.019
a side view. And then with those three views
you could actually just, on a three dimensional

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.859
scale, like you could just draw and put them
all together, nice and slowly. And this is

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:05.840
exactly how they would do it in the computer.
This is old school. So like I said last time,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:16.290
if you're getting confused, wait until I execute
it and then pause it and then do it yourself.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:25.210
So you're not getting lost. Alright. We have
the middle of this guy, this is what we're

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.060
looking for. I'm just kind of drawing in all
the extra lines just so we know exactly what

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.960
we're looking at here. Okay. Now so this is
the top of this guy, so he's going to repair

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:53.021
the middle, the top of this guy as well.
We'll slow down here for a minute just so

00:01:53.021 --> 00:02:02.260
people can kind of see what I'm doing. Probably
doesn't help that I've got the drawing skewed.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.340
So you're saying like, whoa, look at all these
lines, what the heck am I doing with all these

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.870
lines? But essentially what we've got here
is if you can see it, you can start to train

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.420
your eye but we've got a box here, in the
middle plane, we've got the back box here,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.870
and then we've got the new box which is between,
so it's basically this middle plane but now

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.180
it's this way.
