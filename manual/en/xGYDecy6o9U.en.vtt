00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.890
Pittsburgh is a proud thriving city of sports champions, universities, medical centers,

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.039
and the arts

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:13.099
with the delicious local culinary scene,
that's being further enriched by food

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.259
trucks.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.890
Meet three of these mobile
entrepreneurs.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.810
I'm Lynne Szarnicki, I own the Pittsburgh Pierogi Truck,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.749
and we sell pierogis, stuffed cabbage and  haluski.

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.090
I'm Tim Tobitsch from

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.099
Franktuary,

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.429
and this is the Franktuary food truck.

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.990
My name's Brian Pekarcik, I'm the owner of BRGR Spoon.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.790
We've just recently opened a food truck within
the last few weeks.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.199
Customers love the food and experience
Pittsburgh's food trucks have to offer.

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.600
I really love that it's fast, affordable, and really convenient.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.670
I have costumers literally jumping up andd down for joy

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.280
because they love pierogis so much as they
are so excited to eat our food.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.889
Food trucks are a great way for a small company to start

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.000
out in the big world.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.920
They let people get their foot in the door.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.560
I really appreciate the mobile food truck scene

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.670
because it takes

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.420
an inactive space and it 
activates it. It's a popup community

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.020
gathering spot.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.479
Franktuary has local beef. They get their

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.229
food from local farms and it's a local business that

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.970
supports local people.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.750
But, Pittsburgh's laws make it nearly
impossible for food trucks to survive,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.780
let alone thrive.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.759
Pittsburgh laws, they're really
restricted in allowing food trucks to be

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:29.780
successful.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.539
We have a rule in place in the
city of Pittsburgh right now that

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.570
prohibits us from being within five
hundred feet

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.200
a brick and mortar business that sells a
similar product. The restrictions are

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.620
kind of harsh. Especially the
thirty minute time limit

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.740
by the time we set up,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.940
like half of that time's gone,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.160
so we only have fifteen minutes to sell
to people.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.580
That's not really

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.950
practical at all. It's such a bummer sometimes when you hear a food truck's somewhere

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.890
and then you make your way out there on
your lunch break and then it had to

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.130
leave because there's regulations

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.769
against how long they can stay in one spot.
The metered spaces,

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.200
that's hard because

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.800
a lot of the spaces in Pittsburgh are metered. It pretty much takes out all of downtown.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.669
They seem to be designed to keep us
from costumers and

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:22.629
obviously if you have a food truck, you need customers to earn a living.

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.189
We decided to open up a food truck because it's such a popular concept across the

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.119
country.

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:31.509
So we wanted to try to help bring
Pittsburgh current with food trends and

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:35.239
so there certainly still are challenges with the thirty minute rule, and

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.199
being within five hundred feet of brick
and mortar restaurants.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.680
That proximity restriction is actually
unconstitutional

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.859
because of its protectionist nature

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.579
and it makes it

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.609
next impossible to operate legally at
any given moment. Fortunately city

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.680
councilman Bill Peduto has introduced legislation

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.200
that would make it easier for these food
trucks to get on the road and serve eager

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.559
customers.

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.829
We are here today with a bunch of
entrepreneurs.

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.309
Young people who have created a new
industry within Pittsburgh, and we're

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:08.129
introducing legislation

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.529
to make their industry

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:12.959
something that could happen all
throughout our city, and at the same time

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.819
create a model piece of legislation that
other cities could follow.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.290
Councilman Peduto's bill

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.760
would let food trucks operate from metered parking spaces, allow trucks to operate from one

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.870
location for up to four hours, and
eliminate the five hundred foot

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.529
proximity restriction.

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:32.589
These reforms would make Pittsburgh one
of the most food truck friendly cities

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:33.610
in the Nation.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.219
What food trucks add is an added

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:40.309
amenity. Something that adds just a
little bit more to that city experience.

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:44.539
At the same time, it provides people with
an opportunity for a career, a business.

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.799
This is a city that values its food scene, and

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.499
values it's community, and

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:50.969
it's pretty apparent that

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.979
the community wants food trucks and we're thrilled to be a part of it.

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:57.269
I would like to see the laws really losen up, and allow food trucks to

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.259
be sucessful. I don't understand how
the city can have laws in place

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:05.819
that prevent us from competing. We need
people to really be hungry for change,

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.899
and they can do that by going to the website,

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:09.719
calling their city council person, telling their friends

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:11.429
about the petition

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:18.429
and generally helping us spread the word that Pittsburgh is right on the cusp of change for mobile food, and we want to see those things go through for a more

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:20.399
vibrant, exciting food community in Pittsburgh.
