NURSE: Excuse me, Dr. No, but
your next patient is here.

00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:41.890
It's a Mr. Bond, James Bond.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.394

00:00:43.894 --> 00:00:44.394
Hm.

00:00:44.394 --> 00:00:45.842
Right this way.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.720
DR. NO: Good morning, Mr. Bond.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.700
What can I do for you?

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.470
Oh.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.330
Ah, Dr. No.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.050
I need your help.

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.490
Do you see this word?

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.640
I can't read it.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.550
My regular doctor
couldn't help me.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.090
He said I should
consult a specialist.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.530
DR. NO: Well, you've come
to the right man, Mr. Bond.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.860
With your permission, I'd
like to conduct some tests.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.900
JAMES BOND: Of course,
Doctor, anything you say.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.810
DR. NO: Right.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.040
Now then, read this.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.090
JAMES BOND: Um.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.318
Toenail.

00:01:39.318 --> 00:01:39.818
DR. NO: Hm.

00:01:39.818 --> 00:01:40.770
JAMES BOND: Yes.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.490
DR. NO: Cover your
left eye and read this.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.830
JAMES BOND: Um.

Pepperoni.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.980
JAMES BOND: Grr.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.460
Cover your right
eye and read this.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.650
JAMES BOND: Um.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.230
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.920
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.870
Fuzzy Wuzzy--

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.470
DR. NO: I'm afraid
your condition is

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.534
more serious than I thought.

00:02:03.534 --> 00:02:04.200
JAMES BOND: Ahh.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.730
I feared as much, Dr. No.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.039
Can you possibly help me?

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.699
DR. NO: Yes.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.150
Take off those
ridiculous dark glasses.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.780
I'm surprised you
can see anything

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.990
with those ruddy things on.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.860
Now then, read this.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.650
JAMES BOND: No.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.560
DR. NO: And this.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.390
JAMES BOND: No.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.140
DR. NO: This.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.060
JAMES BOND: No.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.820
No.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.636
No.

00:02:27.636 --> 00:02:28.610
I'm cured.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.550
Oh, you cured me.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.490
How can I ever
thank you, Dr. No?

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.437
DR. NO: Give me a $1,000.

00:02:35.437 --> 00:02:38.180
JAMES BOND: Hm.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.461
No.

00:02:39.461 --> 00:02:39.961
No.

00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:40.458
No.

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:40.955
No.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:41.452
No.

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:41.952
No.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.250
