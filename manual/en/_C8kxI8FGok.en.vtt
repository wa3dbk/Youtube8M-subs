00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.430
Her Queen assassinated on a mission of peace,
Mecha Wonder Woman seeks justice with glaives

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.170
and precision-guided munitions.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.800
The Warden of Truth is a ranged hybrid Marksman
whose destructive salvos wreak havoc on the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.330
battlefield.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.720
Her passive is Implacable Judgment.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.380
Each Basic Attack places one stack of Judgment
on an enemy.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.290
At three stacks of Judgment they're consumed
and the enemy is dealt bonus Power Damage.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.900
Glaive Storm &lt;Q&gt; launches a wide spread of
projectiles that deal Attack Damage to the

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.440
first enemy hit and apply one stack of Judgment.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.040
Use Afterburn &lt;W&gt; to Dash to a target location
and leave a trail of scorched earth.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.019
Enemies who stand on the path are dealt Power
Damage.

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.290
Celerity &lt;E&gt; grants a powerful Attack Speed
boost and its duration is increased by stacking

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.570
an enemy with three Judgments.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.300
Her Ultimate, Tempest, channels a cone of
Attack Damage over a short time.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.900
Because Mecha Wonder Woman has very low defense,
good positioning and team cooperation are

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.500
vital to success.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.990
Use Afterburn to catch fleeing targets or
save it to escape pursuing enemies.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.650
Use Glaive Storm to pressure opponents early
in a match.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.850
Late game, Celerity allows you to quickly
dispatch soft targets like Zatanna.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.770
Reserve Tempest for advantageous moments like
when enemies are crowd controlled or grouped.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.110
Invulnerability and Super Speed can help keep
you alive during team fights, opening a chance

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.160
to escape to safety.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.150
Mecha Wonder Woman is a hybrid character that
can build Attack Damage, Power Damage, or

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.150
both.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.950
Artifacts that provide attack speed and damage
are essential to maximize the full potential

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.909
of Implacable Judgment.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.890
Power up and obliterate the battlefield as
Mecha Wonder Woman.
