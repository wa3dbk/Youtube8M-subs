that gives you the world’s most influential guitar and bass tones

right on your desktop.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.880
Quite possibly the most famous guitar amp of all time,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.980
the tweed Bassman® is considered a must-have for any serious tone connoisseur.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.330
Originally conceived in the 1950s

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.680
to amplify the newly invented Fender® Precision Bass guitar,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.930
it was quickly adopted by guitarists

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.980
who found that it was able to
provide shimmering clean tones

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.780
and a cranked up “crunch” tone  that lent itself perfectly to Rock and Roll.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.480
That tone became the basis  for the famous British “stacks” of the 60s and beyond.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.190
Played clean or distorted, from Rock to Blues to Country,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.090
with or without external effects,

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.390
the ’59 Bassman® is the foundation for a wide variety of great tones.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.190
One of the most distinctive amps of all time.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.090

that is perfect for any style of music,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.190
yet it will bark when turned up to arena volume.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.790
The Twin Reverb is known as the first popular “built-in effects” amp,

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.690
with world-standard Fender Reverb and Tremolo.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.890
This is also a great amplifier

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.690
for accentuating the character of external stomp boxes,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.890
making it an incredibly versatile platform to build on.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.000
One of the first amplifiers designed by Leo Fender, and one of the most influential.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.400
The Tweed Deluxe provides classic compressed overdriven tones when cranked,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.700
and rich harmonic clean tones when played at low volumes.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.700
The Deluxe is a great amplifier for Chicago-style Blues tones,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.500
as well as Country and early Rock and Roll tones.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.050
Today, modern players of all stripes

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.400

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.400
that is perfect for finger-picking, Garage-Rock...

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.800
...just about anything.

great Reverb and Tremolo, and amazing versatility.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.310
as modifed by “Amp Doctor” Cesar Diaz.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.610

With the available “Mod” mode,

the Vibroverb Custom can create the famous Texas Blues tone

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.910

to modern Metal and Punk.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.320
Its independent cascading gain stages and custom EQ

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.920
allow guitarists to create a huge variety of both

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.120
vintage and modern harder-edged distorted tones,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.520
all while retaining that unmistakable Fender® character.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.220
This modern Fender® classic provides incredible clean tones,

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.520
unequalled touch sensitivity, and a thick overdrive character

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.720
that will inspire artistic inspiration for any player.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.520
Engaging the FAT switch

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.120
helps boost it into classic Rock distortion.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.620
