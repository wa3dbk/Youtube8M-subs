00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.910
I know you and I can´t blame myself
when it all starts to fade away

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.531
its enough with all the things you pray
and desire isn´t what remains

00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:25.170
I´m in hell and I can´t blame myself
when it all starts to fade away

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.800
It´s enough with all the shit you pray
and I won´t give you what it takes

00:00:32.800 --> 00:01:03.770
I´m whatever you want (whom I have to blame?)
x4

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:11.389
Do you want to get older
´cause I just dont care what you say

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:18.040
your mind is now getting older
and I´m just thinking about being a child

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.770
again
when it all started falling apart, where were

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.439
you?
you want to play me with your cards

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.959
so fuck you
so fuck you

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:27.959
whom I have to blame?

00:01:27.959 --> 00:02:04.420
I´m whatever you want (whom I have to blame?)
x4

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.440
I know you and I can´t blame myself
when it all starts to fade away

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.510
its enough with all the things you pray
and desire isn´t what remains

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:25.170
I´m in hell and I can´t blame myself
when it all starts to fade away

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:56.700
It´s enough with all the shit you pray
and I won´t give you what it takes

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.630
I can´t bare it like you (I cant handle the
lack of you)

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.020
I can´t bare it like you (I cant handle the
lack of you)

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.400
I can´t bare it like you (I cant handle the
lack of you)

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.900
I can´t bare it like you (you complete me
when I´m with you)

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:33.090
Cause I´m whatever you want
I´m whatever you want

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:46.810
I´m whatever you want (whom I have to blame?)
