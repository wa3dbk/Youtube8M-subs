00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.450
Hello. My name is Jeff Fiffie. Today I'll
be showing you how to remove and replace a

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.930
water pump on a Mazda 626. Of course before
you start with anything you want to think

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:17.199
about safety. The safest thing to do is to
remove the battery cables from the battery.

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.339
It's going to vary on different cars. On this
particular car it's going to take you a 10

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:32.660
millimeter just to loosen up the cables. First
for the negative side then for the positive

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:41.920
side. And then set them safely behind the
battery so they don't touch the posts. You

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.660
don't want to cause any sparks or flames.
Of course there's going to be a few things

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.880
that you have to remove before you can get
to the water pump itself. This portion right

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.890
here is called the power steering pump. This
is going to have to be removed out of the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.019
way and then the motor mount and this assembly
is going to have to be moved out of the way.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:12.100
As you disconnect the hose from the power
steering pump put it back out of the way.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:21.259
Put the power steering pump back over in there
nice and safe. And make sure you don't puncture

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:32.420
any wires or hoses. This assembly here is
the mount, motor mount. This is two portions.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:45.399
Set this portion back over on the fire wire
itself. Safely so it doesn't fall. Now the

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.170
housing has to be removed next.
