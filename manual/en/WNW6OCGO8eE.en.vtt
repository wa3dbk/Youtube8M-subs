Hi, I’m Eugenie. 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.730
Today I’m so happy to share this double chocolate muffin recipe with you guys 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.730
because these muffins are as beautiful as the ones you buy at cafes and bakeries. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.820
For today’s recipe you will need: 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.970
chocolate chips, cocoa powder, flour, 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.490
sugar, baking powder, baking soda, 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.830
salt, Greek yogurt, an egg, 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.070
milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.120
For muffins, I will prepare dry and wet ingredients separately. 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.770
First dry ingredients.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.010
I will sift 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.870
1 teaspoon of baking powder, 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.810
1/4 teaspoon of baking soda, 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.410
2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder, 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.250
Today I'm using Dutch processed cocoa powder.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.250
½ cup plus 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.200
And 1/2 teaspoon of salt. 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.200
And sift.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.000
Baking is definitely better with a little bit of salt.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.070
Then whisk to combine. 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.360
And finally I will stir in ½ cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.100
In another mixing ball, I will add 1/4 cup of vegetable oil, 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:07.100
Normally extra virgin olive oil is not used for baking but today I'm using it because extra virgin oil worked pretty much fine with double chocolate muffins.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.100
1/3 cup of milk,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.000
3 tablespoons of Greek yogurt, 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.660
I found Greek yogurt at Costco the other day. Thank God, this makes muffins moist.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.250
1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.250
And 1 large egg.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.490
And lightly whisk to combine. 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.610
Then pour the wet mixture into the dry. 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.610
And stir until combined. 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.950
The batter should be liquidy enough. 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.950
If yours is not like this, you can add extra milk to adjust the thickness.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.660
Now fill the muffin molds with batter. 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.100
2/3 full.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.590
And decorate with chocolate chips on top. 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.590
Never forget this because the crust should be delicious with extra chocolate chips, too.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.790
And bake in the oven preheated to 350 degrees F. (180 C.) for 20 to 23 minutes. 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.890
Rotate the pan front-to-back at about halfway through the baking time.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.110
Out of oven, let cool for a few minutes in the pan and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.400
Voila, easy double chocolate muffins.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.590
Bon appetit. 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.490
This is moist, delicious, but sweetness is not overwhelming at all. 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.690
I highly recommend you try these chocolate muffins.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.450

You can find the link down in the description box.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And now I cook and talk at the same because I have extra cameras and lighting in the kitchen. 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.830
I wish you like this change because I like it so much this way! 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.830
Thank you for watching. See you soon. Bye!
