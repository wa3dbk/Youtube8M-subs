00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.399
this is Nick, and this is me, Liz.

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.770
Today we are going to take up a
lot of space on the subway

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.940
in the United States use of public
transportation is growing significantly

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.440
faster than use of highways

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.800
and with more crowded subway cars come
new social issues

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.820
the latest is a phenomenon dubbed manspreading

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.890
here in New York the transit authority
has actually responded

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.000
and plans to launch an awareness
campaign in the coming months but how do

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.320
people in real life

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.439
actually respond to man spreading, and would they
act differently if they were women instead

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.020
of a man

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.660
on the subway nick has little issue
pushing his way to an open seat and

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.980
assuming position

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.350
stop after stop no one pays any
attention to him

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.530
I managed to get away with my own
version of manspreading too

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.730
but not without feeling like people were
glaring at me

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.700
my posture alone seems to be a spectacle
one that some some subway riders

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.830
immediately notice

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.280
and feel compelled to record with their
phones to post online or share with

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.980
their friends

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.760
Nick's legs spread wider and wider as this
train fills up

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.300
a group of four is forced to stand right
up against Nick as he takes up three

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.350
seats

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.210
no one appears to even notice the
behavior may have come very naturally

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.050
to Nick

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.910
but for me well not so much I'm always
crosslegged when I'm on the subway I always have like my

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.210
bag on me

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.390
even if there's no one standing I feel
like of awful 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.360
While I'm kind of rude on the subway to begin with, so it wasn't that big of a change

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.729
Do did it feel good? It did it felt really empowering

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.320
like you felt better after doing it?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.729
I don't know I don't know if I want to go that far

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.940
how could taking up all of that unnecessary space make nick feel empowered

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.360
research shows that people who take
expansive body postures feel more

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.820
confident and successful

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.680
but scientists at MIT also found
expansive postures make subjects feel

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.470
more entitled

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.950
prompting increased cheating and
stealing behavior so it's possible that

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.149
man spreading

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.399
breeds bigger problems than just
uncomfortable subway rides

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.399
thankfully not everyone let nick get away
with this wide like a dominance

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.370
although man spreading may feel
liberating collectively standing up to it

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.510
empowers us all

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.299
its actually not that hard it turns out
that being just a little bit aware what

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.340
is going on around you can take an
immediate

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.670
issue and turn it into an opportunity
for progress even if that issue is just

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.760
an arrogant bro spreading his manhood
across three seats
