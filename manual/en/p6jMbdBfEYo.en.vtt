00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.250
Ok, now I’m going to show you how

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.020
I get these old rubber bushings out

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.300
Of the spring eyes here

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.380
And there’s really only 2 things that you
need

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.140
We’ve got a drill, with a drill bit

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.080
Roughly 1/4”

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.019
And then we’ve got the torch

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:15.930
I’ve got MAPP gas

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.909
Propane works just as well for this

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:19.909
You’re just trying to melt it really

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:21.810
What I’m going to do, is I’m going to
drill

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.069
A series of holes, probably 5 or 6

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:26.970
In the rubber, all the way through

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.039
And then we’re going to heat it up

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.519
Primarily what we want to do is heat up

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.649
This inner steel sleeve

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.370
And that will help sort of melt the rubber

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.219
And then we can hammer it out

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:40.230
And it will just fall out the bottom

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.320
So let’s go ahead and get started here

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.040
Can be tricky to get it started sometimes

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.520
There we go

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.640
Got it all out of there

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.040
The next thing we need to do to get

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.170
Our new polyurethane bushing installed

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.540
Is this large diameter sleeve, right here

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.360
Needs to come out as well

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.440
Now I’ve just found that my Sawzall is broken

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.130
It doesn’t work

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.690
So, the best way to get this steel sleeve
out of here

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.960
Is to actually cut it

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.610
Just straight down the center

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.000
Try not to cut into the spring

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.270
You might nick it a little bit

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.910
But that’s OK

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.810
Try not to cut too deep into the spring eye
itself

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.690
Now I’m using my air body saw

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.960
The result will be the same

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.660
It will just take me longer to do it with
this

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.610
So we’re going to make 1 cut through the
center

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.200
Just to split the sleeve in half

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.250
And then we’ll get some screwdrivers and
some chisels

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.690
And we’ll punch out that sleeve

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.140
Alright, so I’ve got a cut all the way through

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.920
The bushing here

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.980
So, I’m just using a screwdriver

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.530
Yes, I know a screwdriver is not a chisel

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.950
However it can be

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.840
And that’s how I’m going to use it today

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.950
So we’ll just start tapping

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.960
Just go straight down the cut

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.460
So there you can see that sleeve is split

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.460
All the way down the center

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.520
So now we can just drive it out of there

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.440
That’s it

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.660
There’s our sleeve

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.020
Now we just need to clean this out in there

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.360
And then shove our new polyurethane bushing
in place

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.420
Ok, now that we have the sleeve punched out
of the spring eye

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.490
There’s some rust in there that we need

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.209
To scrub out of there

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.090
There’s a couple ways you can do it

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.490
You could just take a regular old brush

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.200
Stick it down in there

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.840
Get some of that out of there

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.040
A little bit better option would be

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.130
Take a little wire brush that you can chuck
up in your drill

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.349
Spin that around in there

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.140
What I’m actually going to use

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.599
Is a small little hone

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.140
Now this is really like a wheel cylinder hone

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.340
And I’ve got some WD-40

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.069
And I’m going to stick this in the hole

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.290
To kind of get that rust scale out of there

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.950
Now, because of the way the spring eye is
wrapped here

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.630
You need to make sure that you spin this

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.290
In the correct direction

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.280
In this case the drill would be going in reverse,
like that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.989
If you spin it in that direction

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.930
It’s going to catch on that little notch
right there

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.010
And you’ll brake your little hone

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:28.479
So this is clean enough

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.069
And smooth enough for our purposes

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.210
If you are going to use one of these

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.900
Small little wheel cylinder hones

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.569
Just remember

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.529
You just want to do it enough to take

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:37.960
The rust and the scale out from inside there

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.620
If you do this too long, you will increase

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.569
The size of this hole right here

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:42.599
And you don’t want to do that

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.409
The bushings, they’re not a press fit

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.870
But they are a snug fit

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.430
So don’t spin this for too long

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.389
Or you will increase the size of that hole

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:52.900
Now with some of the grease that came in the
kit

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.200
Smear just a little bit onto our bushing

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.240
Smear it around with our finger

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:02.650
Kind of get all the surfaces

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.029
Including the little flange area up there

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:08.949
Towards the outside of it

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.100
Then it just presses into place

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:19.849
And just a little lube on our finger

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.020
Kind of smear it around on the inside of the
bushing

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.660
Be sure to get both sides

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.740
Take just a little bit more

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.159
Smear it onto our sleeve here

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.020
Now the sleeve is a little bit more of a snug
fit

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.719
Than the bushings

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:49.110
That one went it really pretty easily

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.759
But if you’re having trouble with it

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.710
Just take a C-clamp, put it on there

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.979
And you can kind of press that sleeve

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.360
Into those bushings without too much trouble
