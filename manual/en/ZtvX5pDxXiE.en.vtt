00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.829
Nikon, at the heart of the image.

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:14.359
Delighting you always, Canon.

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:16.879
WTF, what the hell

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:19.050
is TV and AV?

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.379
Adult Video and Television?

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:25.400
Nikon is for pros.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.769
I only have seen pros using Canon.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.230
Seems like amateurs.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.880
Oh..Oh look, made in Japan!

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.080
Made in Japan!

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.030
Nah...

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.000
Check out the bottom, check out your ass.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.890
Megapixels

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.030
Why would you need so many of them?

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.690
Low light performance! That's

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.240
what it's all about!

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.510
Noise performance?

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.580
Poo! Resolution is king!

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.070
With this, you can print

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.960
HUGE!

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.700
ISO 6400 is the new ISO 1600

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.570
It's for pervs, paps and pedos.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.190
Megepixels are

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.049
everything!

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:12.640
Suck the shit out my ass!

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.010
Well it's not actually about megapixels now.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.640
It's not about the megapixel race.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.430
Noise performance, that's what it's all about.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.990
If you want to shoot video, you CAN with a Canon.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.300
Douchebag!

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.900
If you wanna f(beep)king shoot video

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.640
buy a f(beep)king camcorder.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.729
Philip Bloom uses a 5D

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.220
Nikon made lenses for Canon

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.570
back in the 1930s.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.049
Red...red ring, Aww!

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.390
C: look! Dial on the back. 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.680
N: I don't need a spinning wheel with a spinning SET button. 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.950
What a piece of shit. 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.670
N: I got a dial up here. C: I actually like the spinning button. I like how it kind tell 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.680
you where your dial was in last position so you can think ah...woo...that's

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.370
ten o clock.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.240
I'm gonna move it over to two o clock.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.920
to change the aperture. I know!

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.930
muscle memory

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.349
Oi! See that lens is white

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.809
That means professional

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.039
Chase Jarvis is cool

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.739
He uses a Nikon

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.749
so do I!

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:24.999
Oh you know 5D Mark II, you know what they use that for?

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:26.619
Yeah, final episode of House.

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:27.569
Take that!

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.729
and Avengers! SIRI: I don't know what you mean by 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.510
"Find a house that takes that"

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.859
That green cast

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.189
it's supposed to be like that.

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.279
That's what your f(beep) eyes see.

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:48.969
Nikon colours are so awesome. AWESOME! AWESOME!

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.069
The colours of Canon photos are much more neutral.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.790
It's just as you see it.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.000
not those stupidly vomit of colours that Nikon...

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.869
MADE IN

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:08.799
GERMANY

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.289
Yup. I have seen the M... Leica M6 Titanium. It's not actually titanium,

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:16.159
that's the funny bit isn't it?

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.199
Precision

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.979
German engineering

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.430
made by the hands of little German men. Craftsmen.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.669
Maybe big craftsmen... In Germany.

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:30.010
Oh it's an M3, it's a high serial number.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.139
Urgh ...Voigtlander!

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.619
Not basic, it's Bauhaus! Oh my god,

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.499
poor people these days...

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:39.139
It is...

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.829
like an extension of my eye

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.049
Form, function, form

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.549
Form and function. Form follows function.

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.869
Basically, a summicron, f2.

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:51.949
Summilux, f1.4

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.859
It's silent...

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.389
discreet! 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.169
Notilux, 0.95 or f1

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:04.759
or the first version is actually f1.2. It's all about that glass

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:10.269
that's the most important thing in Leica. You know

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.329
forget about what I'm saying

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.919
Henri Cartier-Bresson

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.769
If it's good enough for him,

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.819
it's good enough for me.

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:20.549
Well of course! 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.960
have you taken it to a "CLA"?

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.819
I mean it's not soft or anything. It's that special Leica glow...

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:31.919
I mean when you see it, and it.. it...so...what

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:32.549
what was your name?
