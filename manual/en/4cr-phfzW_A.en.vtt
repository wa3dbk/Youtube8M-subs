00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.060
Hi and  a huge welcome to Steve's
kitchen. I fancied

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.470
bacon and eggs this morning. Now the
fourth Earl of Sandwich like to have a

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.059
bit of bread either side of his meat

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.389
so when he was playing cards he could eat
that meat without getting grease on his

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:11.910
hands

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.820
the quesadilla comes from Mexico and is a similar idea, you have a flour tortilla

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.369
either side the contents

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.670
fantastic idea so why not we have

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.779
the fried breakfast quesadilla

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.630
I'm going to show you how. I'm also going to be making the tortillas which you don't

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.560
have to do of course but I really urge
you to try it

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.210
because it's so simple and they taste so
good and also

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.710
going to let me at the end, edit this video
without getting grease on my keyboard

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.309
come on let me

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.559
show you how

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.560
 Now I'm not going to show you here how to make a tortilla because I've have done it many times

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.140
on my channel, I'll leave a link at the end if
you need to know how

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.360
we're just going to take a round piece of dough, roll it out to a circle

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.410
I'm then going to fry them in a dry pan

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.629
just lightly and get this wonderful soft

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.640
tortilla, stack of those there and now
we're ready to start using those to make

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.979
this

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.100
wonderful quesadilla breakfast. Now this is
going to be

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.500
a one pan meal so I've still got the flour in there from the tortillas I'm just

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.950
going to give that a little wipe round

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.689
bring that back over to the stove let it
warm up again and let the water evaporate

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.049
I'm going to pop a tiny little splash of vegetable oil in the bottom of the pan

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.460
then I've got four bacon rounds which is
just going to pop in there

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.490
and we're going to fry these off until they're how you like them basically,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.720
I like mine fairly brown so my bacon is
ready I'm just going to pop those

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.110
out onto a plate set those aside for a
moment

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.740
now I don't want to lose all the flavor
from this pan but I am going to take a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.399
little of the oil out of here

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.729
just using a bit of kitchen towel to soak up some of the oil

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.340
and then I'm going to pop a knob of butter in the middle

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.329
let that start to melt down,We're going to break 4 eggs into the pan

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:06.030
and break the eggs up

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.660
and at this point I want the season them

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.370
with a little black pepper and a little salt

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.930
if you want you can put herbs and spices in here as well, we're going to scramble these eggs

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.080
about a tablespoon, tablespoon and a half of

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.709
cream in there, just continue

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.890
to get these eggs nice and scrambled

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.410
I've got all the wonderful flavors of the
bacon in there as well

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.040
don't overcook the eggs, I'm going to take those out now and put them on the plate with

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.680
the bacon

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.200
Now I've just wiped that pan down a tiny bit, drop a tiny

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.170
little bit of vegetable oil in the pan and
also just a little knob of butter

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.760
just get that evenly coated over the
surface of our pan

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.900
Now let's get one of those flour
tortillas and just lay it down

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.659
in the middle there it wouldn't be a
quesadilla if I wasn't putting

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.069
some nice tasty cheese on top of the
tortilla

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.730
Now the beauty of cooking food from
around the world you're always going to get

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.319
picked up on for pronouncing things
incorrectly now

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.349
quesadilla, it's a tricky one for us when we
see 2 L's we have to go to hell back

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.830
not to pronounce them, you're lucky to even get a k out of me

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.799
because I see quesadilla anyway please
forgive my bad pronounciation I hope I

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.099
get it close to right

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.750
I'm then going to put the scrambled egg on
top of the cheese

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.940
let's get that lovely crispy bacon in
there as well

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.799
and over the top of that bacon

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.659
some more tasty cheese I'm just using a
cheddar here

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:49.310
you could use a mozzarella, provolone
anything could be fine

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.590
let's lay another tortilla over the top

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.280
push that now nice and firm I'm going to
let that

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.739
cook for a minute or so to let the cheese
on the bottom start to melt together

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.129
the way I like to turn these over is to pop
a plate

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.920
on top of that and then I'm going to
flip

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.349
the whole pan over so I've got my quesadilla there now

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.440
and I can just slide that back in to the
pan

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.150
that way up and continue to cook the
other side now

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.370
the tortillas are lovely and brown I can lift
that out now

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.820
onto my plate and there you have it

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.930
so there's my quesadilla breakfast

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.020
I am really looking forward to tucking
into this

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.340
what I will do in good sandwich style is
to cut it into something a little more

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.699
manageable

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.600
