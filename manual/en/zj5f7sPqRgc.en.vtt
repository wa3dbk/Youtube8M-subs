Hey guys its Mike from The Geek Pub, and on
this episode I'm going to show you how to

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.089
repair these saggy cabinet hinges. Now you
could go down to your local big box store

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.670
and buy new pair for about 5 bucks, but on
this particular project I think we can repair

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.120
the ones we already have. But, if you need
to replace yours follow along and we'll show

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.120
you how to do that too.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.829
To repair our saggy european style cabinet
hinges, the first thing we need to do is remove

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:35.750
he door from the cabinet. Just remove all
four screws. Be sure to support the door while

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.330
doing this.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.130
Now with the door removed, lay it on a table
and remove the rest of the screws, two on

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.300
each hinge, and then remove the hinge from
the pocket.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.000
Take each hinge and disassemble it by removing
any screws or other hardware and then it should

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.190
slide right apart. If yours has a quick release
mechanism, remove that as well.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.720
Using an air compressor, or canned air, gently
blow the dust and cobwebs out of all of the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.670
pieces.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.510
Using a wire wheel remove any debris from
the hinge parts, if you don't have one a toothbrush

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.310
will work.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.220
When you're done everything should look brand
new and be squeaky clean.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.470
Now using a lubricant, spray all of the joints,
and then start the reassembly process by attaching

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.820
the hinges back to the door.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.360
You might be wondering what all of these screws
do? Well they allow you to adjust the door

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.880
to make it fit square and level. For example,
this set screw pulls the cabinet door closer

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.570
to the frame, or pushes it away. You'll want
to adjust these to get the perfect fit.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.340
My hinges also have a quick release that makes
them a snap to install. So we'll leave them

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.150
in two pieces while we install them.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.100
Go ahead and re-attach the other half to the
cabinet face. I recommend using new screws,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.229
and tossing the old ones.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.790
Then, take the cabinet door and align it with
the cabinet face, and gently press on the

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.100
quick connects. They should pop right into
place.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.920
And that's it. No more sagging hinges. It
works like new, and didn't cost anything more

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.210
than a little time. It's really quite a simple
repair job, that many people just don't know

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.430
how to do. Well, now you do.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.380
