00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.250
Jeff is going to demonstrate the backhand
topspin with the starting position a little

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.070
bit lower than you would for the backhand
counthit and the finish position a little

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.070
bit higher.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.529
So up at eye level or even higher.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.670
The start position when you are playing a
controlled backhand topspin can be quite in

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.050
front of you.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.090
As you start to get a little bit faster with
your stroke you can start to swing from a

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.410
little bit more outside your body.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.890
So for a right hander outside your left hip.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.500
That allows you to swing a little bit faster.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.159
So the basics for the backhand topspin starting
with your bat quite low down about table height

00:00:47.159 --> 00:01:43.380
or even lower and finishing up above eye level.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.410
After hitting some backhand topspins you can
see here where to ball has marked Jeff's bat,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:55.601
that region there is probably the prefect
area for you to hit your topspin.Here you

00:01:55.601 --> 00:02:02.159
can see Jeff swing through from below the
table height and finishing above eye level

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.480
or above head height.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.039
You can see Jeff's feet position is quite
square to where you want the ball to go.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.670
This is the especially good for a control
backhand topspin.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.310
Later on if you are trying to hit the ball
a lot faster you can start to turn you feet

00:02:19.310 --> 00:03:19.270
a little bit more side on or just turn your
wait to generate that power.
