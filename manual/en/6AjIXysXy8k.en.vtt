This episode of Tekzilla
Bites is brought to you

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.240
by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.020
Welcome to Tekzilla Bites,
feeding your tech hunger fast.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.190
I'm Shannon Morse.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.680
Have you ever wanted to make
really quick voice memos,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.420
or you needed to record a
phone call for future use?

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.420
Maybe you had a customer
service rep promise you

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.460
a really good deal, only to
have your next bill be a higher

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.167
price.

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:24.750
Sometimes the best
proof that you need

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.920
is the words directly
from a person's mouth,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.210
and I have a free app that will
do that, and will do it well.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.910
Call Recorder by Bold Beast is
a simple yet powerful free app

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.807
made to record voice.

00:00:34.807 --> 00:00:37.140
First off, make sure that you
have your settings the way

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.140
that you want them.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.720
Recordings are automatically
saved in a folder called

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.230
.bbrec.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.990
Now, since there is a
dot before the name,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.330
that means that it's going
to be a hidden folder.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.530
You can unhide that folder
by removing the period

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.980
and clicking OK, and this
will make it much easier

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.870
for you to access
your recordings.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.330
Now, you can also turn
on and off an indicator,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.970
and you can change the icon.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.990
If the tiger distracts you,
you can also remove that, too.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.880
Under call settings you can
change the record mode, format,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.470
and set calls to the
auto recorded or not.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.180
Here you can choose to
include or exclude contacts

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.800
from your recording
list, or just record all.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.130
You can also set a pop
up to ask before saving

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.050
each and every recording, and
you can set similar settings

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.657
for just memos as well.

00:01:17.657 --> 00:01:19.240
Now when you go back
to the main menu,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.190
you'll notice two other icons.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.050
One is for voice memos
that you've recorded,

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.470
so you can replay or
delete them from the app,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.580
and the other is
for phone calls.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.740
To record you can hold
down on the record button

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.500
for about two seconds, and
then hold down once more

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.760
to activate recording.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.760
The recording will start,
and to stop it, simply

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.090
hold down twice again
on the record button.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.647
If you've turn on
ask before save,

00:01:39.647 --> 00:01:41.480
it should pull up a
little window giving you

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.130
details about the file.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.080
Voice recordings can
be tricky legally

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.610
depending on what state or
country that you reside in,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.210
so check with your
local authorities

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.030
before choosing to
record all your friends'

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.310
conversations with you.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.300
For example, in
California both parties

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.374
need to know a call
is being recorded.

00:01:56.374 --> 00:01:58.790
This is probably going to be
one of those handy tools I'll

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.960
be happy to have when
I'm on a never ending

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.050
call with the customer service
rep who's promising me green

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.510
lit pricing, but no assurance
that it's actually a real deal.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.539
Again, it is a free app,
so why not give it a try?

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.700
And speaking of free,
I like to live freely,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.490
and you don't get that choice
if you've been driving drunk.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.110
When you drive drunk you
face jail time, court costs,

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.535
and even losing your license.

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:21.660
Letting somebody else drive
if you've been drinking

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.470
is a really smart thing to do.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.640
Seriously, drive sober
or get pulled over.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.220
Nobody ever gets in their
car thinking, I'm drunk,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.170
I'm driving.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.190
I'm going to go to jail tonight.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.020
Our sponsors at the NHTSA
want you to know on average,

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.790
more than 10,000 people die
on the road due to drunk

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.200
driving each year.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.280
In order to stop
this deadly epidemic,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.240
law enforcement in every state
and most US towns and cities

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.950
will be cracking down on
drunk driving from August 15th

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.090
through Labor Day.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.590
They'll see you
before you see them.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.880
If you've been drinking, do me
a favor-- let a sober person

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.560
drive.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.240

Thanks for watching.
