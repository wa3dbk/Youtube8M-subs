00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:09.843
Here in zone 5, it’s time to start sowing vegetable seeds indoors for the spring. 

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:13.113
If you live in an area that has freezing temperatures in the winter, 

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:16.216
you can easily determine when to start seeds indoors for the spring 

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.852
based on your average last frost date. 

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.688
In today’s 2 minute tip, I’ll show you how.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.157
If you don’t already know your last frost date, 

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.426
you can easily find it online. 

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:29.362
For example, if I Google last frost date UK, 

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:34.534
the first search result shows a nice color coded map of last frost dates in the United Kingdom.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:38.338
If you live in the US, you can search for your last frost date using your zip code. 

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:44.811
Here I’m using a tool on davesgarden.com to search for the last frost date for zip code 60626. 

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:49.149
As you can see, the last frost date for this zip code is April 27. 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.820
Now that you know your last frost date, you can figure out when to start sowing seeds. 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.426
Most seed packets will tell you how many weeks before the last frost date seeds can be started indoors. 

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:03.630
They’ll also tell you if it’s best to direct sow the seeds in the garden.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.899
For example, carrots and beets can be started indoors 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.635
but may do better when sown directly in the garden.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:13.340
But what if you haven’t bought your seeds yet and don’t have seed packets to reference? 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.676
There are tools online that can help.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:19.379
Here I’m using a tool on johnnyseeds.com. 

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:22.415
All I have to do is type in my last frost date and click enter. 

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:26.186
It not only tells me indoor planting dates for a wide variety of crops, 

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:29.689
but also the number of weeks before the plants can be set outside. 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.930
Some plants, like collards, can go out before the last frost, 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.198
while others like tomatoes, shouldn’t be set out until the last threat of frost is past.  

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:44.204
The tool also tells me which crops are typically not started indoors and directly sown in the garden instead.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:47.640
As you can see, it’s almost time for me to starting sowing seeds indoors. 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.843
I’ll start kale and collards this weekend, 

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:55.448
but will wait at least another few weeks before starting tomatoes.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.716
Well, that's all for now.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:58.852
Thank you for watching this two minute tip.
