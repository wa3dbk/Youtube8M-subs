00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.900
- I LOVE THIS STORY SO MUCH.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.333
DURING HER FINAL CROSS-COUNTRY
MEET OF THE SEASON,

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.766
OUR NEXT GUEST ENDED
HER RACE EARLY

00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.566
TO HELP AN INJURED RUNNER
FROM A RIVAL HIGH SCHOOL.

00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.366
SHE WALKED 1/4 OF A MILE

00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.133
WITH HER COMPETITOR
ON HER BACK

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.566
UNTIL SHE WAS ABLE
TO FIND HELP.

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.333
TO ME,
THAT IS WINNING THE RACE.

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.133
FROM NORTH DAKOTA,

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:20.766
PLEASE WELCOME MELANIE BAILEY
AND THE RUNNER SHE HELPED,

00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:21.966
DANIELLE LENOUE.

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.566
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.600
AREN'T YOU JUST
AN AMAZING YOUNG WOMAN.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.500
I MEAN, I JUST THINK THAT
YOU'RE SO COOL--WHAT YOU DID.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.033
EXPLAIN--

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:31.866
IT WAS A 2.4-MILE RACE, RIGHT?

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.000
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.600
AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW EACH OTHER
AT ALL.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.933
both: NO.
- NEVER MET.

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.600
- NEVER MET.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600
- AND YOU'RE RUNNING A RACE,
AND...

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.133
- UM...
[both chuckle]

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.333
WE WERE A LITTLE PAST
THE 2-MILE MARK,

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.433
AND I NOTICED DANIELLE,
AND SHE WAS CRYING REALLY HARD.

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:50.000
AND I'VE SEEN PEOPLE CRY
FROM STRAINED MUSCLES--

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.366
- WAIT, LET'S EXPLAIN.

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.000
IT WAS, LIKE,
NOT ON A ROAD OR ANYTHING.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.133
IT WAS, LIKE, KIND OF A TRAIL
IN THE WOODS OR SOMETHING?

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.833
- IT'S A GOLF COURSE.
WE RUN ON A GOLF COURSE.

00:00:56.833 --> 00:01:00.166
AND WHERE WE WERE AT WAS BEHIND,
LIKE, A BIG ROW OF TREES.

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:03.233
IT'S KIND OF WHERE I FELL,
WAS BEHIND WHERE NO ONE--

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:04.833
NO ONE COULD SEE ME.
- NO ONE COULD SEE YOU.

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:06.066
- NO.
- MM-MM.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.066
- WELL, I GUESS WE SHOULD--

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.766
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU EXACTLY?

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:12.366
- JUST RUNNING, AND THE RACE
WAS DOING PRETTY GOOD.

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:15.700
AND I FELT A POP IN MY KNEE,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.000
AND I FELL TO THE GROUND,
AND I COULDN'T GET BACK UP.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.100
MY KNEE HURT REALLY BAD.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.866
AND ABOUT 50 PEOPLE
HAD PASSED ME,

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.566
KEPT RUNNING,
AND I'M JUST SITTING THERE--

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.366
- WAIT, YOU WERE CRYING OUT,
AND EVERYONE JUST KEPT GOING?

00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.766
DID THEY GLANCE AT YOU?

00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.166
- YEAH.
[laughing]

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.100
YEAH.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.100
THEY KIND OF LOOKED AT ME,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.333
AND I WAS JUST LIKE,
"GOOD JOB."

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.433
AND I'M JUST LAYING
ON THE GROUND.

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:35.400
AND--YEAH.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.133
AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
MELANIE CAME

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.633
AND PICKED ME UP, AND--
CRAZY.

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:41.266
- SO YOU JUST--DID YOU THINK
ABOUT RUNNING PAST?

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.133
DID YOU RUN PAST
AND THEN GO BACK,

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:44.133
OR DID YOU STOP RIGHT AWAY?

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.200
- I JUST STOPPED RIGHT AWAY.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.600
I MEAN, SHE WAS CRYING
REALLY HARD.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.700
SHE NEEDED HELP, AND I COULDN'T
JUST LEAVE HER THERE.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.200
SHE NEEDED HELP.
- GOOD FOR YOU.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.200
- YES.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.366
[cheers and applause]

00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.733
- YEAH.

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:59.333
ALL RIGHT,
SO THEN DID YOU THINK,

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:00.466
"OH, I'LL JUST HELP HER UP?"

00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:01.900
I MEAN,
YOU OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T THINK,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.133
"I'M GONNA PUT HER ON MY BACK
AND CARRY HER."

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:05.700
- NO, I PUT HER ARM
AROUND MY SHOULDERS

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.800
AND TRIED TO GET SOME WEIGHT
OFF OF HER LEG AT FIRST,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.200
BUT WE DIDN'T GET VERY FAR.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.566
- YEAH, BECAUSE WHAT HAD--

00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:12.766
THE PATELLA, IS THAT--

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:15.333
- YEAH, I TORE
THE PATELLA TENDON RIGHT HERE.

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:17.266
IT'S THE ONE THAT RUNS
ACROSS YOUR KNEECAP, SO...

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:20.066
- OKAY, SO YOU COULDN'T
HOLD HER UP, AND THEN...

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:22.933
- I JUST STOOD IN FRONT OF HER
AND TOLD HER TO GET ON MY BACK.

00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:24.766
AND SHE STARTED SLIDING OFF,

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:26.233
'CAUSE SHE COULDN'T REALLY
LATCH ON.

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:27.400
- NO.
- SHE WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400
[both laugh]

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.466
- I WAS TRYING TO HOLD MY KNEE

00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:30.900
AT THE SAME TIME
AS HOLDING ON TO HER,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.300
AND I'M TRYING TO CHOKE HER,
AND...

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.166
[both laugh]
- OH, MY GOD.

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:36.000
- AND I CARRIED HER FOR ABOUT
A QUARTER OF A MILE,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.933
AND THEN MEDICAL HELP
CAME ONTO THE FIELD,

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:39.700
AND I PUT HER ON A GOLF CART.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.300
- YOU CARRIED HER
FOR A QUARTER--

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.600
I MEAN,
LOOK AT THE PAIN YOU'RE IN

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.700
HOLDING YOUR KNEE LIKE THAT.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.800
- YEAH.
- THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.166
ALL RIGHT,
SO YOU FINISHED THE RACE.

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:51.500
ONCE SHE GOT HELP,
YOU THEN GOT BACK INTO THE--

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.933
THAT SLOWED YOU DOWN A BIT.

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:54.133
- JUST--
- A LITTLE BIT.

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:55.233
[both laugh]

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:57.166
- SO HOW MANY PEOPLE
WERE IN THE RACE?

00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:58.966
- I THINK IT WAS ABOUT
180 PEOPLE.

00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:00.500
- AND WHAT DID YOU COME IN?

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.266
- 178TH.

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:04.300
I WASN'T LAST.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.300
- WHOEVER CAME IN LAST--

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.300
I MEAN, THAT'S REALLY--

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.300
- YES, I KNOW.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.266
[laughter]

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:11.300
- THAT'S REALLY--THEY DIDN'T
STOP AND HELP ANYBODY.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.900
- NO, THEY JUST...

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.733
- SO YOU CAME IN 178TH.

00:03:14.733 --> 00:03:16.500
SO I JUST THINK YOU'RE AMAZING.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.333
YOU'RE AN INCREDIBLE
AND AN INSPIRING--

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:20.033
AND I WISH MORE PEOPLE--

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.033
I CAN'T BELIEVE 50 PEOPLE
PASSED YOU UP, DANIELLE.

00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:23.200
- [laughs]
- ALL RIGHT.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.366
I GOT YOU SOMETHING, MELANIE,

00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:27.200
BECAUSE YOU WON--YOU WON--

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.600
YOU CAME IN 178TH.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.600
- WHOO!
[laughs]

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.600
[applause]

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.100
- AND IT SAYS--

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.100
YEAH, IT SAYS
SHE CAME IN 178TH, SO...

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.300
- I LOVE IT.
[laughs]

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.733
- SO THAT'S FOR YOU.
- WOW. THANK YOU.

00:03:38.733 --> 00:03:39.733
- AND THEN EACH OF YOU...

00:03:39.733 --> 00:03:41.033
- OH, MY GOSH.

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:43.900

SUPER-INCLUSIVE STAY

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.733

00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:48.766
[both scream]
- OH, MY GOSH.

00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:50.300
[cheers and applause]

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.933
- WHITE BEACHES,
WATER ACTIVITIES,

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:53.266

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.500
- [laughs]
[mic echoes loudly]

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.600
[laughter]
- AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE FUN.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.766
AND IF YOU NOTICE THE TOP,

00:03:57.766 --> 00:03:59.300
YOU'RE CARRYING HER ALSO THERE,
SO...

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.566
[laughter]
