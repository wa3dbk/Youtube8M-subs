Welcome back! This is Brian on behalf of expertvillage.com.
In the previous clip, I showed you how to

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.250
choose a stick and whittle it so that you
can cook a marshmallow. Now, let’s go ahead

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.339
and actually cook a marshmallow. Go ahead
and carefully puncture the center of the marshmallow

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:40.629
and slide over the sharpened tip of the stick
that you have created. Take it into your fire.

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.469
The closer you hold it to the flames, obviously,
the faster it is going to cook. What you want

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.719
to do is rotate it. You do not want to have
one side overcooked and one side undercooked.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:48.770
Just gently rotate it by the flames. It’s
starting to cook. Let’s get to the other

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:58.200
side now. You can roast it to suit how you
like them. I like mine a little bit crispy.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:20.690
Let’s go ahead, let that light, and rotate
to catch all sides,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.160
perfect.
