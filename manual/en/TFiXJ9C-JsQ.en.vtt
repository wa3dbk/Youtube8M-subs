00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.250
Heidelberg is a city in south-west Germany.
The fifth-largest city in the State of Baden-Württemberg,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.150
Heidelberg lies on the River Neckar in a steep
valley in the Odenwald.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.380
A former residence of the Electorate of the
Palatinate, Heidelberg is the location of

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.910
Heidelberg University, well known far beyond
Germany's borders. Heidelberg is a popular

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.930
tourist destination due to its romantic and
picturesque cityscape, including Heidelberg

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.579
Castle and the baroque style Old Town.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.550
The old town, on the south bank of the Neckar,
is long and narrow. It is dominated by the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.290
ruins of Heidelberg Castle, 80 metres above
the Neckar on the steep wooded slopes of the

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.149
Königstuhl hill. The castle ruins are among
the most important Renaissance structures

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.880
north of the Alps.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.910
It is no secret that Heidelberg is a jewel
among German travel destinations. It is located

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.730
in the Neckar river valley right where the
legend-rich Odenwald opens up towards the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.680
plains of the Rhine Valley. Heidelberg is
home to the oldest university in Germany (established

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.609
1386). Generally speaking, Heidelberg is an
academic city with a long and rich history

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:19.939
and is similar in many ways to cities such
as Cambridge or Oxford in England.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.939
During World War II, the city was almost completely
spared allied bombings which destroyed many

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.270
of Germany's larger inner cities. As a result,
Heidelberg has retained its baroque charm

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.119
of narrow streets, picturesque houses and
of course the world-famous Castle.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.950
Over the years, Heidelberg has attracted numerous
artists, intellectuals and academics from

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.749
all over Europe and has sometimes been referred
to as Germany's unofficial intellectual capital.

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:51.079
With hundreds of thousands of tourists flocking
to the city annually, Heidelberg is truly

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.000
a culturally diverse and international destination,
despite its small size.
