00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.140
I'm gonna
fly you all down here

00:00:02.141 --> 00:00:03.475
To help us dedicate it.

00:00:03.476 --> 00:00:04.676
Yay!
Yay!

00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:06.010
Ooh!

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:08.980
I can't swim, clark.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.583
I know that, eddie.

00:00:13.986 --> 00:00:15.053
[sighs]

00:00:15.054 --> 00:00:16.087
[sighs]

00:00:16.088 --> 00:00:17.589
[clark sighs]

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.925
Hey. Ho.

00:00:22.194 --> 00:00:23.362
[sighs]

00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:24.929
Oh.

00:00:26.165 --> 00:00:28.533
Clark,
what's wrong?

00:00:28.534 --> 00:00:31.002
Honey.

00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:33.305
It's bigger
than you expected?

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:38.042
Smaller?

00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:42.046
Well, what is it?

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.117
It's a one-year
membership

00:00:46.118 --> 00:00:47.719
In the jelly
of the month club.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.087
Oh, god.

00:00:49.088 --> 00:00:50.455
Eddie: Clark,
that's the gift

00:00:50.456 --> 00:00:52.891
That keeps on giving
the whole year.

00:00:54.627 --> 00:00:56.595
That it is, edward.

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:58.930
That it is, indeed.

00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:00.666
I'm sorry.

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:02.567
Clark...

00:01:02.568 --> 00:01:04.836
If this isn't the biggest
bag over the head,

00:01:04.837 --> 00:01:06.371
Punch in the face
I ever got.

00:01:06.372 --> 00:01:08.139
God damn it!

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.174
Son.

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:24.222
[whispering]
that's good. That's good.

00:01:25.425 --> 00:01:26.525
That's good.

00:01:29.995 --> 00:01:32.764
Ahh, hey.

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:34.165
If any of you
are looking

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.835
For any last minute
gift ideas for me,

00:01:36.836 --> 00:01:38.804
I have one--

00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:41.740
I'd like frank shirley,
my boss, right here tonight.

00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:45.143
I want him brought from
his happy holiday slumber

00:01:45.144 --> 00:01:47.245
Over there on melody lane
with all the other rich people,

00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:49.648
And I want him
brought right here...

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.250
With a big ribbon
on his head,

00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:53.785
And I want to look him
straight in the eye

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:55.487
And tell him what a cheap,

00:01:55.488 --> 00:01:57.889
Lying, no-good, rotten,
four-flushing,

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.325
Lowlife, snake-licking,
dirt-eating, inbred,

00:02:00.326 --> 00:02:03.528
Overstuffed,
ignorant, bloodsucking,

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:06.231
Dog-kissing, brainless,
dickless, hopeless,

00:02:06.232 --> 00:02:09.200
Heartless, fat-assed,
bug-eyed, stiff-legged,
