Hey everyone! This is Mei Yu, the creator of Fun2draw. I've been getting SO many requests on how to draw a

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:10.135
cute

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:12.155
MUSTACHE!

00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:14.284
It's gonna be Fun2draw one :)

00:00:14.284 --> 00:00:21.284
First, I'm going to start with a nice big curve, like this...

00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:28.295
so it kinda looks like a really stylized, stretched out letter "S".

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.135
I'm going to draw another curve

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:33.344
that's coming out, like that,

00:00:33.344 --> 00:00:39.045
and now, let's draw a cute, small mustache inside,

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:42.935
I think it kinda looks like two leaves
joined together.

00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:44.835
So there's a little mustache in there

00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:46.375
in the middle!

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:47.435
Draw

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:51.515
the rest of the big mustache

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:52.925
so again, the

00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:57.775
curved letter "S", but it's facing the other way,

00:00:57.775 --> 00:01:04.775
and let's just finish up this point,

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:07.985
Ok! Now, let's get those BIG Fun2draw eyes in there.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:11.024
I'm drawing these two curves on either side of the

00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:16.665
little mustache

00:01:16.665 --> 00:01:17.785
and now let's draw those

00:01:17.785 --> 00:01:21.885
rounded triangles for those BIG Fun2draw eyes!

00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:28.885
Just like that...

00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:36.165
I'll make this part a little bit thicker...

00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:41.945
there's a big pupil in the eye - there's a highlight for a shiny look,

00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:45.645
let's shade in the eye, starting dark,

00:01:45.645 --> 00:01:46.884
then let's go

00:01:46.884 --> 00:01:48.995
all the way down towards

00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:54.634
a lighter effect,

00:01:54.634 --> 00:01:58.655
and let's do the same thing on this side.

00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:02.394
After you're done drawing this, you can go to my Fun2draw channel on Youtube,

00:02:02.394 --> 00:02:07.265
where you'll see LOTS of my other cute drawings, including more kawaii food,

00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:09.835
and other cute cartoon videos

00:02:09.835 --> 00:02:15.064
like my little hamburger, watermelon or
cute animals!

00:02:15.064 --> 00:02:19.244
Okay, let's draw that big pupil in there...

00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:22.444
and the highlight.

00:02:22.444 --> 00:02:25.625
Please let me know in the comments what other cute things

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:30.574
you'd like to see me draw in the future.

00:02:30.574 --> 00:02:37.094
Let's get some little eyebrows in this little mustache as well.

00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:38.904
This little mustache looks so

00:02:38.904 --> 00:02:41.375
sophisticated!

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:42.834
Alright, there you go!

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:46.654
And now I'm gonna draw a cute little mustache

00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:48.644
right here,

00:02:48.644 --> 00:02:51.484
it kinda looks like two leaves

00:02:51.484 --> 00:02:54.394
joined together

00:02:54.394 --> 00:02:58.564
and to finish the big mustache, I'm going to draw another curve...

00:02:58.564 --> 00:02:59.375
AAHHHH!

00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:01.404
It's unbalanced!

00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:03.554
like that

00:03:03.554 --> 00:03:04.364
and... just finish the point *GROAN*
