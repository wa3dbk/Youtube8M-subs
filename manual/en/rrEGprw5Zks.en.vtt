00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.149
Okay, the life cycle of goldenseal starts from a shiny little round black seed

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.140
and I've seen wild goldenseal
numerous times over the years and it's

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.360
very difficult to find a seedling the
woods.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.460
Normally when you find it in a wild state
it's going through...

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.560
um, it's a clonal plant - it'll send out
runners and you see it in patches

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.199
however, it really truly originates from the
black seed

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.960
which in the wild, would fall off the plant and
if it's lucky

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.019
it will germinate by the next spring, and 
the seedling

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.130
looks absolutely nothing like the adult
plant - it has two tiny, little round leaves

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.670
and if you were to see it in the woods, you wouldn't think it was goldenseal. That's pretty

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.710
much a good outline of the plant right
there.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.840
Those are seed leaves; they're not true
leaves.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.190
The next year that will develop the goldenseal true leaf on it. As you can see, that's

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.770
got a taproot that's

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.980
fiber-root probably two or three inches long
and its got a good start on life.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.920
The second year it gets the true leaf
which is similar looking to a maple

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.050
leaf on a maple tree,

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.390
and then depending on the environment it's
growing in, it can mature...

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.440
some people say it can mature as early as
three years but it's more

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.680
up five to six years where it's actually
ready to harvest -

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.479
four, five or six years and as a mature
adult it can get up to 14 inches tall.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.840
The berries are collected - usually around
here in this locality its July 4th

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.550
typically

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.720
and what's with them is they're
picked and I don't have much

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.840
wildlife predation on mine, so you can
leave them for a little bit but the point

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.979
being that you want to

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.820
pick them and soak them in water, mash them up and remove the pulp and plant them immediately

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.540
and by them having the warmness of the
summer soil

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.850
and then the coldness of the winter they'll
actually germinate the next year

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.640
and this is a somewhat new finding...
People used to stratify them and wait a

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.520
whole another year

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.310
but now the scientific evidence is that
you need to just plant them immediately

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.119
as soon as you pick 'em.
