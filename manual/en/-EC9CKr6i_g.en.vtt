00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.920
AHH, THE GOLDEN YEARS, THE
AUTUMN OF OUR LIVES.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.400
BUT FOR MANY SENIORS ESPECIALLY
THOSE WITH AGE RELATED DEMENTIA,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.760
THOSE YEARS ARE ANYTHING
BUT GOLDEN.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.849
AND FOR THE ADULT CHILDREN WHO
HAVE TO WATCH THEIR PARENTS

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.009
DECLINE, THIS IS A TIME OF
REFLECTION, RENEWED HOPE AND

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.619
INSPIRED FAITH.

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.849
MY NEXT GUEST PERSONIFIES ALL OF
THIS AND OHH SO MUCH MORE, I'M

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.080
SO PLEASED TO BE JOINED HERE
THIS MORNING WITH SINGER

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.420
SONGWRITER AMY GRANT, AND WE'RE
HERE AT HER BEAUTIFUL FARM JUST

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.329
OUTSIDE NASHVILLE TENNESSEE.

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:38.910
AMY, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.910
THANK YOU.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.840
I AM GLAD, THIS IS SUCH A
BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL PLACE, HOW

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.350
MANY ACRES DO YOU HAVE HERE?

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.720
UMM, WELL THREE OF US BOUGHT A
700 ACRE FARM THAT WAS GOING TO

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.720
BE DEVELOPED.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.720
OKAY.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.450
SO, UMM, IT'S ENOUGH TO GET
LOST ON.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.310
I WOULD LOVE TO GET LOST HERE,
(LAUGHS).

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.330
MAYBE WITH A BLANKET TODAY.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.430
YEAH, IT'S A CHILLY DAY TODAY.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.470
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS, I
WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I WAS TOLD I

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.280
WAS GOING TO BE DOING THIS
INTERVIEW BECAUSE I'VE BEEN SO

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.280
INSPIRED BY YOU.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.890
I'VE LISTENED TO YOUR MUSIC,
SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR JOURNEY AND

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.030
THE INSPIRATIONAL MESSAGE BEHIND
IT HAS REALLY BEEN INSPIRATIONAL

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.530
FOR ME AND NOW YOU'RE ON THIS
NEW JOURNEY, DEALING WITH

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.880
PARENTS WITH DEMENTIA AND I KNOW
YOU'RE MOM HAD DEMEMTIA AND SHE

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.439
DIED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.630
YES,
NOW, YOUR FATHER IS DEALING

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.640
WITH DEMEMTIA, HOW MANY YEARS
HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON FOR YOU?

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.009
SINCE ABOUT 2009, WE REALLY
NOTICED IT.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.110
YOUR LIFE CHANGED WHEN YOU
STARTED DEALING WITH YOUR

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.680
PARENTS WITH DEMEMTIA, BUT WAS
THERE A MOMENT THAT YOU KNEW

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.770
YOUR DAD HAD TURNED THE CORNER
OR WAS IT MORE OF

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.979
A GRADUAL DECLINE?

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.409
INTERESTING YOU ASK THAT BECAUSE
IN THE END OF 2008 I CAME HOME,

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.350
I HAD DONE A LOT OF TOURING THAT
FALL AND I SAW SUCH A PRONOUNCED

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.859
CHANGE IN MY MOM AND DAD AND I
CALLED MY MANAGER AND SAID

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:58.399
CANCEL EVERYTHING FOR 2009.

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.630
DID YOU KNOW AT THAT POINT OR
HAVE AN INKLING OR YOU JUST KNEW

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.860
SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT HERE.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.450
I JUST KNEW SOMETHING WAS
DIFFERENT AND I DIDN'T KNOW HOW

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.920
MUCH TIME WE HAD AND SO WE, UM,
MY MOTHER WAS GETTING SO FRAIL,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.140
BUT IT WAS DURING 2009, LIKE
EVERY WEEK I WOULD GO "DAD,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.380
YOU'RE TALKING DIFFERENTLY THAN
YOU DID LAST WEEL" AND SO HE HIT

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.420
THAT SLIPPERY SLOPE OF REALLY
FAST PROGRESSING DEMENTIA.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.080
BUT, YOU KNOW, DANIELLE, IN A
WAY IT WAS...IT'S A CRAZY KIND

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.850
OF GIFT, BECAUSE MY FATHER
ADORED MY MOTHER.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.710
WE TALKED WITH MY DAD ABOUT
THINGS THAT MATTERED TO HIM.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.720
HE SAID "I WANT TO STAY WITH
YOUR MOM".

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.470
AND WE JUST SLOWLY HAD THE
DISCUSSION ABOUT NOT DRIVING, WE

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.830
TRANSFERRED POWER OF ATTORNEY, I
MEAN IT'S TOUGH, (SIGHS), YOU

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.680
KNOW, BUT THINGS HAPPEN ALL THE
TIME TO FAMILIES.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.710
WHAT WERE THE LOWEST OF THE
LOWS, THOSE MOMENTS WHERE YOU'RE

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.220
LIKE "I'M LOSING MY MOM, I'M
LOSING MY DAD".

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.750
YEAH...WELL MY DAD SPENT HIS
ENTIRE...

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:23.010
(PAUSE) THIS IS HARD
TO TALK ABOUT.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.890
(PAUSES).

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:36.460
I KNOW THAT THIS IS JUST...THIS
IS THE WAY THEIR LIVES WILL END.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.320
BUT, NOTHING IN ME, NOT ONE PART
OF ME BELIEVES THAT THIS IS

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.430
REALLY THE END OF THEM, BUT
THERE ARE MOMENTS I FEEL MY

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.970
MOTHER MORE PRESENT THEN I DID
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS OF HER

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:51.970
LIFE.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.970
(MUSIC).

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.110
IS THERE A SPECIAL MEMORY THAT
YOU HAVE OF YOUR DAD HERE?

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.280
OH, MY GOODNESS.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.570
WELL, MANY ACTUALLY, SOME OF THE
BEST HAVE HAPPENED INSIDE.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.700
(DOOR CREAKING).

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.390
COME ON IN.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.060
SOME OF THE BEST STUFF HAPPENED
IN HERE.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.060
AHH.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.420
SO, HE LOVED COMING IN AND
BUILDING A FIRE AND SOMETIMES

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.859
WE'D BRING A PICNIC AND IT JUST,
IT DIDN'T REQUIRE A LOT OF

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:18.859
WORDS.

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.630
AND HE WOULD JUST SAY
"BEAUTIFUL".

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.220
YOU KNOW, DO YOU KNOW THE SONG
"I COME TO THE GARDEN ALONE

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.470
WHILE THE DEW IS STILL ON THE
ROSES.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:39.600
AND THE JOY WE SHARE AS
WE TARRY THERE".

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.550
MY DAD WILL DIRECT ME.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.620
(LAUGHS).

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.940
"NONE OTHER HAS EVER KNOWN".

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.810
THE ONLY WORD I CAN THINK OF IS
BEAUTIFUL.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.270
THE SAME WORD YOUR DAD USED...

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.270
YEAH...

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.870
RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF THIS
FIRE.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.870
YEAH.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.440
(DOOR SQUEAKS) SO, I WANTED US
TO COME OUTSIDE TO END THIS

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.650
BECAUSE WHAT BETTER WAY THEN
THIS BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL VISION

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.970
OF THIS FARM, THE MEMORIES OF
YOUR MOM AND YOUR DAD HERE, AND

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.900
FOR ME PERSONALLY, I CAN'T TELL
YOU HOW WONDERFUL THIS HAS BEEN

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.900
FOR ME.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.919
AWWW, THANK YOU.

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.770
IT REALLY HAS BEEN, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.569
(MUSIC) "HEY, HEY, THIS IS HOW I
GREET THE DAY"
