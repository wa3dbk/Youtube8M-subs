Hey Justin with AmericanMuscle.com and I'm
here with one of the most exciting new products

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.520
to come along in sometime.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.130
I'm talking about BBK's Vari-tune fully tunable
axle back exhaust system fitting all 2011

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.509
and newer Mustangs.

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.930
Alright, before we start breaking down the
Varitune this would be a great time to tell

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.980
you to subscribe to our YouTube channel, just
by clicking on the link below or on the AM

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.620
logo up in the corner there.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.880
That's so you can stay up to date with the
latest products, like these Varitunes, for

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.900
your Mustang.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.960
Alright, getting into the Varitunes themselves,
as the name suggests, this is a fully tunable

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.949
muffler, so basically by adjusting this screw
on the end of the muffler you can essentially

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.940
change from a 3 chamber muffler to a single
chamber muffler in a matter of minutes.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.570
Of course this gives you the best of both
worlds by offering an exhaust that can be

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.179
both loud or quiet depending on your mood.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.499
With the power valve fully closed like it
is now, the exhaust tone will take on the

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:07.990
characteristics of a 3 chambered muffler - it's
going to be relatively soft and relatively

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.990
quiet.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.420
But by opening the power valve all the way
you are bypassing those first two chambers

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.590
and it's at that point the muffler takes on
the characteristics of a single chambered

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.590
muffler.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.619
It's going to get a lot louder, and you're
also going to get those rough around the edges

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.430
sounds coming off the revs, all those pops
and subtle backfires.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.740
Of course you can experiment with the valve
being half open to see what kind of tone that

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.190
will give you as well.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.000
So with the Varitones bolted up to our 14
GT, we were interested to see if they would

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.259
make any power with the valves fully open
as opposed to fully closed, well after a few

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.340
Dyno pulls we actually put down about 8 more
horsepower at the rear wheels with that power

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.770
valve fully open.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.789
So now that you know what the Varitune does
why would you want something like this?

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.729
Well we as car people have the tendency to
change our minds over time.

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.249
So even though having the loudest exhaust
possible when you first pick up your Mustang

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:02.530
is the only way to roll for most Mustang owners
out there, over the years you might change

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.840
your mind a little bit, and you'll probably
want to tone it down a little bit.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.210
That's where the Varitune comes into play.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.319
The Varitune gives you the luxury of having
a loud and a tame muffler in one package and

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.680
allows you to change your tone easily as your
preferences change.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.840
Getting into the actual construction of the
Varitune, BBK offers this exhaust in aluminized

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.800
steel and full-stainless, with a slight difference
in price between the two.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.570
In addition we're looking at 3" mandrel bent
tubing, and these brightly polished 4" tips,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.620
with an optional black tip available from
the drop down menu just in case you wanted

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.780
to switch up the look a little bit.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.890

BBK products available for your Mustang.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.820
Installing the Varitune is just like installing
any other axle back for your Mustang and can

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.860
easily be done in about an hour using basic
hand tools.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.040
Adjusting your sound is even easier and only
requires a 7/16th wrench and socket and a

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.070
minute or two of your time.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.650
Now if you should run into any problems you
can always call our customer service reps

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.170
Now let's hear how the Varitune sounds on
our 2014 with the valve fully closed first,

00:03:20.170 --> 00:04:03.180
and then fully open.
