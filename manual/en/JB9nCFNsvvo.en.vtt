00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.090
Here at Station Safewater we are here

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.170
to help. So you can have a good time on the beach

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.250
or a boat. But sometimes

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.390
you may get into trouble and you will need some help.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.460
We will be there to save because that's our job. We're in the Coast

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.510
Guard. And saving lives is what we do.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.560
So bring your friends for a visit and we'll show you

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.650
around. So come on down to Station Safewater.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.750
Hey there, my name is Lt. Sanchez,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.820
the commanding officer here at Coast Guard Station Safewater. That means

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.860
I'm in charge of all the boats and other Coast Guard people, kind of like your teacher

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.920
in charge of the class room. I'm so glad you stopped by today

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.950
becuase my crew and I wanted to show you around and teach you guys how to be safe when you

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.980
are around the water. Like always wear a life jacket when you're on a boat.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.100
That's right Glen, every time you get on a boat or a jet ski or a canoe, you should

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.150
be wearing a life jacket. Do you know why? So you'll float if you fall

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.200
in the water. Right again. And sometimes you might even have to remind your mom

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.300
and dad to put their life jackets on too. It doesn't matter if you're young or old,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.360
little or big, or how good you can swim, everyone,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.480
even people in the Coast Guard, needs to wear a life jacket. Sometimes boats

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.570
and canoes tip over accidentally or sink. And if that happens

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.670
you want to be ready. Having life jackets in the boat isn't enough. Would you

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.740
reach your seatbelt when your car is about to crash? No.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.010
You need to wear it for it to save you.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.380
The Coast Guard's motto is "Always Ready." Semper

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.530
Paratus. A motto is like a little sentence that

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.720
tells people what you care about the most. For us we always have to

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.870
be ready to help people in trouble.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.080
Why do those people have a flag on their boat?

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.140
You see Nikki, you hold up those bright orange or red flags

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.190
so other people in boats know that someone is in the water near your boat.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.280
Maybe they're swimming or just had a major wipe out, that way

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.340
other boaters can slow down and be more careful if they come close to you.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.400
Oh, that makes sense. It's like warning flag telling 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.490
other people, "be careful I'm playing in the water." That's right

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.590
Nikki. And when you're playing the water never pretend you're in trouble and yell

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.670
for help or say you're drowning. But what if I'm just playing with friends and

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.770
I don't yell it very loud? Helping people who are in trouble in the water

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.890
is one of a bunch of things the Coast Guard does and we take it very seriously.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.950
One of the worst things someone can do is pretend to be in trouble.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.990
A lot of times kids and teenagers like to pretend

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.100
they are in trouble using the radio on the boat. That is a really bad

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.280
thing to do, because if the Coast Guard thinks you're in trouble we'll send people to come

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.420
and look for you. And if we are gone looking for you and you aren't in trouble,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.470
who is going to help the people that are in trouble? No one I guess.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.510
So remember, never pretend you need help

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.560
in the water or on the radio. Maybe just leave talking on the radio to the adults.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.590
Well, that is unless an adult is in real trouble and needs your help.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.710
So did you guys enjoy the boat

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.770
ride? Yeah! And did you learn anything?

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.820
Always wear a life jacket when you're on a boat. Wave a bright orange

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.840
or red flag to tell other people you just wiped out. [laughter]

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.930
Or people are in the water near your boat. And don't

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.990
yell that you need help if you're really just pretending. And...

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.040
Never, ever ever, play on the radio.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.170
It's like calling 911. And you never call 911 unless somebody

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.240
is in trouble. That's very good kids. Also,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.280
remember that the motors on a boat can be very dangerous and hurt you a lot.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.320
So leave working on the motor to the adults too. So, who

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.420
wants to go the kitchen and get some ice-cream before we go to the beach. Yeah!
