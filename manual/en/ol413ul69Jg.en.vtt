00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.302
The President:
Good evening.

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:05.638
Today, the United States
continues to build a broad

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:08.908
international coalition
to degrade and ultimately

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:11.378
destroy the terrorist
group known as ISIL.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:15.348
As part of the air campaign,
France will join in strikes

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:18.318
against ISIL targets in Iraq.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.787
And as one of our oldest
and closest allies,

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:24.190
France is a strong partner in
our efforts against terrorism,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.893
and we're pleased that French
and American service members

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:30.830
will once again work together on
behalf of our shared security

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.433
and our shared values.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.802
More broadly, more
than 40 countries,

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:38.238
including Arab nations,
have now offered assistance

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.140
as part of this coalition.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.976
This includes support
for Iraqi forces,

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.345
strengthening the
Iraqi government,

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.681
providing humanitarian
aid to Iraqi civilians,

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:52.152
and doing their part in
the fight against ISIL.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.921
Here at home, I'm
pleased that Congress,

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:58.224
a majority of Democrats and a
majority of Republicans in both

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:01.694
the House and the Senate, have
now voted to support a key

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:05.899
element of our strategy: our
plan to train and equip the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.569
opposition in Syria so they can
help push back these terrorists.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.906
As I said last week, I
believe that we're strongest

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.442
as a nation when the president
and Congress work together,

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:19.512
and I want to thank leaders
in Congress for the speed

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.482
and seriousness with which they
approach this urgent issue,

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.018
in keeping with
the bipartisanship

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:30.290
that is the hallmark of American
foreign policy at its best.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.460
These Syrian opposition forces
are fighting both the brutality

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.831
of ISIL terrorists and the
tyranny of the Assad regime.

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.999
We had already ramped
up our assistance,

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.502
including military assistance,
to the Syrian opposition.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:46.039
With this new effort, we'll
provide training and equipment

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.041
to help them grow
stronger, and take

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.577
on ISIL terrorists
inside Syria.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:53.346
This program will be hosted
outside of Syria in partnership

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:56.349
with Arab countries and it will
be matched by our increasing

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:59.686
support for Iraqi government
and Kurdish forces in Iraq.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:04.991
This is in keeping with a key
principle of our strategy.

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:08.728
The American forces that have
been deployed to Iraq do not and

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:12.866
will not have a combat mission;
their mission is to advise

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.834
and assist our partners
on the ground.

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:18.738
As I told our troops yesterday:
we can join with allies and

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:22.075
partners to destroy ISIL without
American troops fighting another

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:24.777
ground war in the Middle East.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:27.413
The strong bipartisan support in
Congress for this new training

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:30.283
effort shows the world that
Americans are united

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:32.285
in confronting the
threat from ISIL,

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:35.054
which has slaughtered so
many innocent civilians.

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:37.490
With their barbaric
murder of two Americans,

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.492
these terrorists thought
they could frighten us

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.561
or intimidate us or cause us
to shrink from the world.

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:44.664
But today they're learning
the same hard lesson of petty

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:48.234
tyrants and terrorists who have
gone before: as Americans,

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:51.638
we do not give into fear, and
when you harm our citizens,

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:53.640
when you threaten
the United States,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.642
when you threaten our allies,
it doesn't divide us;

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.076
it unites us.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.279
We pull together,
we stand together,

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.115
to defend this country that we
love and to make sure justice

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.984
is done, as well as to join
with those who seek a better

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:09.289
future of dignity and
opportunity for all people.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.791
Today, our strikes against
these terrorists continue.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:14.894
We're taking out
their terrorists.

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:19.132
We're destroying their vehicles
and equipment and stockpiles,

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.468
and we salute our dedicated
pilots and crews who are

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:24.571
carrying out these missions
with great courage and skill.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:27.407
As Commander-in-Chief, I
could not be more proud

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:28.608
of their service.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:30.810
As I told some of
our troops yesterday,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.413
the American people are united
in our support for them

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:35.682
and for their families.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.684
And as we go forward
as one nation,

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:39.686
I'd ask all Americans to
keep our forces and their

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:42.355
families in their
thoughts and prayers.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:43.256
Thanks very much.
