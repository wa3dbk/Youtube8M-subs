00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.520
Gossamer is an animated cartoon character
in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.370
Melodies series of cartoons. The character
is a hairy, orange monster. His rectangular

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.800
body is perched on two giant tennis shoes,
and his heart-shaped face is composed of only

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.359
two oval eyes and a wide mouth, with two hulking
arms ending in dirty, clawed fingers. The

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.220
monster's main trait, however, is bright uncombed
orange hair. In fact, a gag in the 1980 short

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.260
Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24½th
Century lampoons this by revealing that Gossamer

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.230
is, in fact, composed entirely of hair. He
was originally voiced by Mel Blanc and has

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.150
been voiced by Frank Welker, Joe Alaskey,
Jim Cummings, and Kwesi Boakye.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.440
The word "gossamer" means any sort of thin,
fragile, transparent material — in particular,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.790
it can refer to a kind of delicate, sheer
gauze or a light cobweb. The name is meant

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.220
to be ironic, since the character is large,
menacing, and destructive.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.510
History
Animator Chuck Jones introduced the monster

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.910
character in the 1946 cartoon Hair-Raising
Hare. In it, Bugs Bunny is lured to the lair

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.210
of a mad scientist as food for Gossamer. The
monster serves as the scientist's henchman.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.050
Part of this plot was repeated in the 1952
Jones cartoon Water, Water Every Hare, in

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.270
which the monster's character is referred
to as "Rudolph". The mad scientist, in need

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.350
of a live brain for his giant robot, releases
Rudolph from his chamber on a mission to capture

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.040
Bugs Bunny; Rudolph shows a sudden burst of
joyousness and quickly sets out when the mad

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.520
scientist promises the reward of "spider goulash"
for capturing the rabbit. The monster next

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.370
appears in Duck Dodgers and the Return of
the 24½th Century in 1980. This is the first

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.420
cartoon where the character is called "Gossamer",
and is so named by Marvin the Martian. Jones

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.930
gave the monster this name "because he's the
opposite looking of gossamer. He's a big,

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.610
hairy thing."
Later appearances

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.660
Gossamer has also appeared in a cameo role
in a number of recent Warner Bros productions.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.940
He appeared in 1990s episodes of Tiny Toon
Adventures, including a prominent role in

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.260
a Frankenstein parody segment in the Tiny
Toons Night Ghoulery special.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.930
He appears briefly in the 1996 movie Space
Jam, and he has also been featured in a number

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.980
of episodes of The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries.
He was used as an enemy in Bugs Bunny Crazy

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.920
Castle 4 and his silhouette appears on the
cover of the game.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.900
He is a boss character in the Looney Tunes
video games Taz: Escape from Mars; Sheep,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.900
Dog, 'n' Wolf; and Taz: Wanted.
Gossamer also makes a cameo in the Pinky and

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.500
the Brain episode Star Warners.
Gossamer appeared in the Aaahh!!! Real Monsters

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.069
episode "Monsters are Real" where he was shown
on the Gromble's monitor as one of the best

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.120
monsters to scare people and animals. He appears
in the Videogame Looney Tunes Collector Alert

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.470
as a boss in the Count's Castle, and a non-playable
character.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.080
Gossamer appeared in the Warner Bros.'s Beetlejuice
as redesign named The Monster Across the Street

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.730
In recent years, Warner Bros marketers seem
to have seized upon the character. Gossamer's

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.830
image is available on all sorts of Warner's
merchandise, from T-shirts to ball caps to

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.739
plush toys. This sort of marketing helped
propel The Tasmanian Devil to new-found stardom,

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.630
and it is seemingly helping Gossamer's popularity
to some extent.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.340
In 2001, Gossamer returned in the Sheep Raider
video game.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.240
He also appears in the Loonatics Unleashed
series as a wrestling rival for Slam Tasmanian

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.819
named Gorlop, who hails from "the planet Gossamer."
A younger Gossamer appeared in an episode

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.110
of Baby Looney Tunes as a helper in Pepe Le
Pew's garden.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.650
He also appears in 2006's Bah, Humduck! A
Looney Tunes Christmas as a Security Guard

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.540
who has to work overtime without pay for greedy
Daffy Duck.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.019
A clip in the deleted-scenes featurette on
the Looney Tunes: Back in Action DVD features

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.469
Gossamer being harassed by Kate Houghton,
suggesting that Gossamer was planned to make

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:29.020
an appearance in the film, but it was deleted.
However, a full look at this scene is not

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.529
shown in the full deleted scenes clips on
the DVD-ROM.

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.370
Gossamer appeared in The Looney Tunes Show
episodes "Monster Talent", "Newspaper Thief",

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.020
"Sunday Night Slice" and "The Muh-Muh-Muh-Murder"
voiced by Kwesi Boakye. Strangely, Witch Hazel

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.979
is somehow his mother. Gossamer is a child
in this incarnation, a lonely boy who just

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:57.749
wants to make friends. To that end, he seeks
the dubious advice of Daffy Duck. In "Monster

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:02.800
Talent" he makes his debut. In Newspaper Thief
he appears as a guest at the Dinner with Witch

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.990
Hazel, Granny and Yosemite Sam. In" Sunday
Night Slice" he is a client of the Pizzariba.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.039
In "The Muh-Muh-Muh-Murder" he appears at
Pizzariba for Daffy's birthday party.

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.510
Gossamer also made a cameo in the MetLife
commercial "Everyone" that was first seen

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:26.759
during Super Bowl XLVI in 2012.
In September 2002, Dale Earnhardt Jr. ran

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.270
a special Gossamer paint scheme at Richmond
International Raceway during the Chevy Rock

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.699
and Roll 400 weekend in which he and his brother
Kerry ran Looney Tunes cars in the Busch Series

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:43.439
race, and nine drivers (Skinner, Terry Labonte,
Jeff Gordon [who crashed his Bugs Bunny car

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:50.069
in final practice for the race and, therefore,
the Bugs car never saw race action], Joe Nemechek,

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:56.740
Kevin Harvick, Jeff Green, Robby Gordon, Jimmie
Johnson, and Greg Biffle [in place of Bobby

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.580
Hamilton, who was injured in a Truck Series
race two days before] ran Looney Tunes paint

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.319
schemes.
