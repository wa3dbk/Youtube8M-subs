Hello, my YouTube friends, how are you?

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.040
Today, I have a new box opening video to share with you.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.520
Unfortunately, I had some camera issues where I lost some of the footage.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.980
And, I had to record on my phone, but I hope that you will still enjoy this.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.140
This parcel travelled all the way from Spain, and it contains my newest ball-jointed doll, Toffee Melo—

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.020
which was made by the amazing Lola of Atelier Momoni.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.560
As usual, I absolutely love the packaging.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.960
The bright pink printed on the textured paper is just beautiful.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.800
And here is little Melo.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.320
Just look at those little cute lips and chubby hands.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.520
And the pear-shaped body is adorable too.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.960
Her size is actually very similar to my Lati Yellow girls: Ichigo and Mocha.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.580
Let me show you both next to each other.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.360
I think little Melo will fit in my doll family perfectly.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.860
Especially since she can wear the same clothes as Ichigo and Mocha.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.680
I hope to find time to customize her soon.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.460
And I will definitely share my progress photos on my Instagram and Facebook page.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.540
Also, before I go:

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.700
I just launched my Patreon page—

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.740
where my supporters get early access to my videos and other exclusive content.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.040
So for example:

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.900
If you want to see my next week's Untangled episode,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.980
you can see it straight away right now by becoming my Patreon—

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.360
instead of waiting another week or two before it becomes public on YouTube.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.720
Thank you so much for watching!

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.220
If this is your first time on my channel,

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.120
then I would love to have you subscribed so you don't miss out on any future videos, giveaways, and other events.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.800
If you enjoyed this video, give it a thumbs up, comment, and share.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.200
That way, I know which videos you enjoy and I will make sure that I make more of them.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.940
Have a great day, and I will see you in the next one.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.020
Bye! :)
