00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.874
Each fall, as areas in the north freeze, thousands of bald eagles migrate south 

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:10.820
from Canada and the Great Lakes states in search of open water.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.884
Some eagles will travel as far south as the Gulf Coast. 

00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:20.573
During a recent winter, more than two-thousand bald eagles were reported in Missouri.

00:00:20.573 --> 00:00:26.126
A few are usually seen in the state by mid-fall but most arrive in December.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:30.964
In some cases, a bird will return to the same location each winter.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:36.503
At waterfowl areas, eagles feed primarily on dead and injured waterfowl.

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:40.040
At rivers and lakes, fish make up most of their diet.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.546
A few remain in Missouri to nest, but most begin moving back north again in late February.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:50.450
Eagles are one of the largest birds of prey in the world.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:58.158
Their life expectancy in the wild is about 30 years, while some bald eagles have lived up to 50 years in captivity.

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:06.767
They fly 20 to 40 miles per hour in normal flight, but can reach speeds of more than 100 miles per hour while diving.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:10.804
Their vision is five to six times sharper than human's.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:18.019
When it was adopted as our national emblem in 1782, the bald eagle flourished in numbers, 

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:21.386
and nesting bald eagles were common in Missouri.

00:01:21.386 --> 00:01:25.101
Since that time, their numbers have declined drastically.

00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:30.023
Pesticides and habitat destruction nearly wiped-out the eagle population. 

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:37.733
They began making a comeback after DDT was banned in 1972 and a restoration program was started.

00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:45.720
During the 1980s, more than 70 young bald eagles were released from artificial nests in Missouri.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.644
This program, plus the eagles natural tendency to return to its former nesting range, 

00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:54.289
has enabled eagles to once again nest in the state.

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.117
Eagle nests are found throughout Missouri,

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.353
mostly in southeast and west-central parts. 

00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:04.858
They are usually built in the top of a giant sycamore tree.
