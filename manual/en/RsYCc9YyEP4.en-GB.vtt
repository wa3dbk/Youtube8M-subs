[Jingle Bells playing]

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.360
I’d say the most annoying thing at Christmas is when we’re having Christmas dinner 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.720
and there’s a lot of white noise when you’re talking around the table. 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.380
People have their own mini discussions within the group

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.200
and because of that there’s a lot of noise.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.000
Neil: But the thing is when you flit between them, you’re going in mid-discussion 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.940
and so you don’t really know what’s going on and so you have to try and ask someone, 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.740
and you ask someone “what you talking about?”

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.560
and they just say “listen”, I’m like “I can’t listen, I’m deaf. 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.220
You need to explain to me what is going on because I can’t follow you 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.800
because you haven’t told me what’s going on”.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.700
Aaron: Number one would have to be people sitting down 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:17.120
sitting down around a table having Christmas dinner and talking. 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.420
And not allowing you a chance to look around at what’s being said, 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.800
so you have to rely on one person to sort of translate everything at the table

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.360
– that is the most annoying thing.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.680
Maya: I think one of them would be when your family or your friends 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.780
are talking to you while having food in their mouth and it’s kind of horrible 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.100
because you to have to lipread them. 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.860
Zanna: One of the things that I find most annoying is when everybody talks 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.740
at once because I’ve got a big family anyway but with extended family it’s just chaotic.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.760
Kirsty: I think probably one of the most annoying things is sometimes my parents 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.500
or my family play music and then they talk and I can’t hear anything, which is kind of annoying.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.520
Maya: I think it would be for everyone to take turns when they’re speaking, 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.980
I think that would be nice.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.060
Zanna: I agree! We sometimes have music on in the background like 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.640
Christmas carols and stuff – not having that on so loud. 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.580
Kirsty: I think it would be better just to sit down, speak as a family and just enjoy Christmas.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.640
Aaron: For both my grandmothers to learn to look at me 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.420
when they’re talking so that I know what they’re grumbling about as usual. 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.560
Liam: I think the best way at Christmas to make things better for me and everyone really 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.220
is to just find a time where everyone can say what they want to say 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.940
and there’s a sense of family, and everyone can talk in a way where they can all

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.640
hear each other and it’s not kind of a flurry of excitement and noise.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.800
Cause although that buzz is nice I just think it would be better if there was a way 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.280
to make sure that everyone can hear each other. 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.480
And it’s just, not as low as having one person talking at a time

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.500
but in a sense where everyone can hear each other. 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.780
Neil: One, actually tell me what’s going on in the conversation so I can get involved 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.100
and two – stop trying to talk with your mouth full. 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.980
I can’t lipread you when you do that, I know the food is amazing

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.420
but swallow before you talk, please for the love of god.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:51.400
