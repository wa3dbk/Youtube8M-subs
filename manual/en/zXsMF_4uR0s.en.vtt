00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.140
Hi guys, The Frenchy here !

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.929
Welcome to "FRENCH GUY COOKING" ! Smile my friends because today we are making

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.300
something sweet ! just imagine a pastry with some

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.740
gorgeous fruit wrapped in a buttery caramel.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.560
You've got it , we are making kind of a tarte tatin

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.560
as known as an upside down apple pie

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.830
But... I knew it... we are going to use quinces
in addition to the classic apples

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.250
and must of all we are not gonna cook it
in an oven

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.320
instead we are gonna use a kitchen
appliance

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.850
used by millions, no by billions of houses

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.930
in Asia... the inevitable rice cooker

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.989
please welcome the billions rice cookers tarte tatin

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.910
yum yum

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.470
 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.870
first

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.940
Let's make the dough. According to the french
tradition

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.330
the dough has to be made with puff pastry

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.530
yeah but everybody knows that in a tatin
pie the dough

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.920
is nothing but an excuse to eat huge
caramelized chunks of

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.070
fruits... Plus, with the ricecooker thing, the steam

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.870
would make the dough go spongy... instead
we will do very simple cake batter

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.229
in a bowl go 5 tablespoons of flour 5
tablespoons

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.930
of brown sugar one heaped teaspoon

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.520
baking powder a pinch of cinnamon

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.590
one egg, 1 tablespoon

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.800
oil , 2 or 3 tablespoons milk

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.280
mix it well the batter

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.740
is ready. let's prepare the fruits

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.180
I'm using my favorite variety of Apples
"REINE DES REINETTES"

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.260
in French or in English "KING OF THE PIPPINS"

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.420
Now for the quince, this is an amazing
fruit

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.929
disgusting when raw but delicious when
cooked

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.340
it will take a beautiful sunset color
and the taste

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.929
is spectacular ! Fragrant, sweet, tangy ! I use one quince and two small apples

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.979
Cut the fruits into big chunks remove the
seeds and the cores

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.320
warning the core of the quince is very
hard and does not change

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.660
after cooking so be sure to remove it all.
a good tarte tatin is all about

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.850
Caramelized fruits and I 've got a good cheat's on caramel.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.660
Fill one third of a microwave safe cup with salted butter.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.569
cover it with brown sugar till you reach
two-thirds of the cup

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.540
boom in the microwave for 30 seconds ! Mix it up.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.750
it should look syrupy. In Japan,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.040
rice cookers can be found in every house
this appliance

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.180
is especially popular among the students
and you know what

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.630
I did not invent anything they have been
baking it for years...

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.819
yes but the question remains: why are
you doing so

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.600
in the Western world of ours ? because it
makes me think

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.900
and thinking makes me feel alive ! grease
the bottom

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.990
and the sides of the rice cooker with butter. you can even

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.100
add a light coating of oil . don't be shy
on this step,

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.860
because you really want it to unmold
afterwards. spread the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.920
caramel stuff on the bottom. place the
chunks of fruits.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.490
make it tight. cover it up with the cake batter

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.350
Now let's cook it. Before we start I must
warn you

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.940
that there exists a tiny tiny risk of
screwing up your rice cooker...

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.190
I bought mine for 20 bucks five years ago

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.560
an it's still working like a charm. that said, let's
burn it up.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.060
figuratively speaking of course. Start
the rice cooker

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.410
the global cooking time with mine was
under an hour

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.430
if it stops before it , then start it again

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.250
after about 40 minutes you can start to
test

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.000
the doneness of your cake. Use a knife or a
skewer

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.030
and stick it in the center. if it comes
up clean

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.150
with no better on it then the cake is
properly baked

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.160
if not , let it cook a bit more. now comes
the tricky part

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.940
Unmolding the tarte tatin could be a
bit annoying. for example

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.330
you can (A) burn yourself pretty bad with
the caramel

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.150
and (B) end up with a scrumptious yet
told shapeless

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.680
hell of a mess. but don't be scared I got
good tips for you

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.509
after baking let the bowl of the rice
cooker cool down

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.590
till you can safely touch it with bare
hands. then place it on high heat for 1

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.100
minute

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.110
this will loose the caramel on the bottom
now

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.310
using gloves, places a stand or a plate

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.410
in the bowl and flip it over. gently
lower the hand holding the plate

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.990
you should feel the weight of the cake.  if not

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.060
back on high heat and do it again.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.580
A gorgeous and smart TATIN cake

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.860
I eat it warm with a dollop of "CREME FRAICHE"

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.660
or heavy cream you won't be able to
resist this sweet and caramelized

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.780
cake. well that's it. tell your friends
your mom or whoever

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.289
thats you did that in the rice cooker
then might not believe you

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.229
but you did it. have fun, comment and don't
forget to subscribe for the next video...

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.870
 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.860
 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.770
