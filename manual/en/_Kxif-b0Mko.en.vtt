00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.770
MARK BLOCKER: In this segment, we're going
to cover seating the front brake pads. The

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.590
next step, we're going to seat those pads.
And as I explained earlier, we're just going

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.040
to pump up the brake system until the brake
pedal feels good and solid. That means I know

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.820
I've got those pads contacting the rotor and
now I'm just going to give it a couple of

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.510
good stiff pushes and then just kinda flexing
them in and seats the pads and make sure that

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.881
everything is set in the proper position.
What you'll need to do is just seat in the

00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:32.619
vehicle. You don't need to start it up. We
don't need to take it out of park or release

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.300
parking brake or anything of that nature and
just slowly compress the brake pedal. The

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.370
first time down, you'll probably won't feel
any resistance at all. I'm starting to feel

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:51.700
a little resistance on the second. Now, I'm
just going really slow and gradual. You don't

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.079
wanna--when you pump brakes, you don't want
to pump them rapidly. It just agitates the

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:05.239
fluid and gives a possibility of air getting
into the system. Okay. About--near the bottom

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.450
of the third, push down. I've got a good,
solid resistance and now in the next pump

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.580
up, the force is right up on the top of the
pedal. If the brake system's working correctly

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.610
you just replace your pads. You'll get a minimum
of an inch and a half, 2 inches to travel

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.970
at the most with your brake pedal and you
should come to a firm position. Now, if you

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.990
push down and hold and the brake pedal holds
firmly, that's what you're looking for. That

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.670
indicates that the system's holding the pressure
and everything's working correctly. If your

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.920
foot is slowly drifting down to the floor
and is not holding pressure, this can be a

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.172
very gradual thing. That indicates that you
have a leak or a loss of pressure in your

00:01:44.172 --> 00:01:50.490
system and a loss of pressure is fluid could
be going pass the master cylinder or the--excuse

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.930
me, the master cylinder valve or in the caliper
itself without externally leaking. It's just

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.509
a loss of pressure inside the system but it
does indicate a problem. You should be able

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.060
to sit and hold your foot on the brake pedal
and then maintain pressure. If all these things

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.940
check out okay, then that's indicating that
the job was done correctly and the system's

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.599
function normally and you're ready to go for
a test drive. Thank you for watching our video

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.370
on how to replace front brake pads.
