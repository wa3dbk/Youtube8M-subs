00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.820
Welcome back to INsight. We are joined now by Dave Farnbauch from the Sweeney Law Firm.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.440
So Dave, there are some medical malpractice laws that are unique to Indiana.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:21.100
And there have been a number of news stories lately regarding medical errors and medical malpractice.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.120
So, tell us about those.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.460
Well, I mean, we've seen a lot of news stories lately that we're sort of the issue of medical

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.700
malpractice come to the forefront. There
was a big news story a few weeks back

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.680
about a local pain physician who the
Attorney General's pursuing.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.220
And there's been the epidemic that we had in Massachusetts with the fungal meningitis.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.440
So,  it's been it's been a lot of news
lately about the topic of medical malpractice.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.219
What I thought we'd do today is spend a little bit of time

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.430
explaining to people maybe some of the laws that govern malpractice here in the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.020
state of Indiana that are surprising
when I talked to people are unique to Indiana.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.980
Most people don't realize that
in the state of Indiana, we have a cap on

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.940
medical malpractice damages. We have a
cap.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.260
So you can only sue for so much.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.560
Right. It's $1,250,000 and that's shocking when I
tell a lot of people for instance we

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.729
handle cases that involve - we call birth
injury cases - where a little baby during

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.900
the delivery can be harmed and can
require a lifetime of medical treatment

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.120
that could realistically tens of
millions of dollars.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.940
In Indiana, we have hard cap of $1,250,000. So it doesn't matter how much harm is caused,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.000
you're capped out at $1,250,000. When I tell people that they're completely shocked.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.820
How could that be? That there could be this ceiling on the amount of damages

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.740
irrespective of the amount of harm.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.200
Is there anything somebody can do about that if they're in that situation?

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.440
No in fact there was a recent case where attorneys tried to challenge the cap in the Indiana Supreme Court

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.240
Primarily, on procedural
grounds, just ruled that the cap is

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.160
going to stay in place. So it's been the
law since 1976, we have a cap on damages.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.300
They've adjusted it at different time
frames but the current cap is $1,250,000.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.960
Which, with today's medical costs, is
woefully inadequate.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.680
The other interesting thing that's unique about Indiana Medical Malpractice law is the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.830
the notion that we have a Medical Review
Panel that decides on the merits of

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.670
cases before you can file lawsuit. It's
it's the only area of law that I'm aware

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.830
of in Indiana where you're sort of
judged by your peers when you file a

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.720
medical malpractice lawsuit in the state
of Indiana. If you sue physicians,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.680
a panel of three physicians is convened to decide whether the case has merits.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.260
That's unique, you know, if
you sue a lawyer there's not a panel of

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.280
three lawyers or an architect but if you
sue a physician state of Indiana there's

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.880
a Medical Review Panel that's formed to
decide the merits of the case.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.470
Well and I would think just in theory that that's a little harder to get past because

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.280
obviously they're cognizant of the fact
that these are their peers in their

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.880
industry so I would think it's almost -
you got to go two steps and that first

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.380
step I would think is challenging

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.380
Well, it is challenging because it's a

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.640
situation where a lot of times
physicians know one another and they

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.470
attend the same you know seminars and
whatnot so it is difficult I think cases

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.410
that tend to fall into what we call the
gray area of medical malpractice I think

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.680
a lot of times physicians do get the
benefit of the doubt with their peers on

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.640
the medical review panel which makes it
a lot more challenging for patients and

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.720
consumers to try to get justice if
there's a medical malpractice case so we

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.109
have some very unique and challenging
laws that present some hurdles to

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.440
patients when they are the victim of
medical malpractice in the state of Indiana.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.739
Well, obviously you're the expert
on that and it is very hard to digest

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.160
all of the rules and what you need to do
so if somebody thinks they have a

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.760
medical malpractice suit definitely the
best thing to do is

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.860
to contact you guys because you can at
least tell them whether or not they should proceed.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.120
Oftentimes, we get a lot of calls and we explain to

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.270
people look we're sorry for what
happened to you but it appears that

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.380
there's no malpractice but occasionally,
we do get calls where the cases are

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.039
meritorious and so the only way we're going to find out as to whether you have

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:42.140
a meritorious, winnable medical malpractice is to call an attorney who specializes in that area.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.400
