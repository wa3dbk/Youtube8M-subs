00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.170
Hi there. This is Stephen Harrison, forecaster
with the National Weather Service in San Diego,

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.880
and here is a short video weather briefing
on the return of the monsoon flow that begins

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.280
on Wednesday.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.600
July has been abnormally wet for the coastal and valley areas so far, mostly due to last
Weekend's widespread showers and thunderstorms

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.990
associated with the remnants of tropical cyclone
Dolores. San Diego has received 1.71 inches

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.630
of rainfall, compared to the July normal of
only 0.03 inches. Ramona also saw heavy rainfall,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:46.940
with 2.38 inches so far, compared to a July
normal of only 0.11 inches. We also can see

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.899
on this graphic that parts of Orange County
and the Inland Empire have seen record rainfall

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.019
as well.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.580
Will the coast and valleys see additional rainfall this week? Well, it's possible,
especially for the valleys. We start to transition

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.409
to the monsoon pattern on Wednesday as the
ridge of high pressure over the great plains

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.180
expands westward and creates east to southeasterly
flow aloft which will bring up plentiful amounts

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.250
of monsoonal moisture. The Green, blue, yellow
and purple colors on this map show high amounts

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.750
of moisture, with the yellow and purple colors
indicating the most amount of moisture. The

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.090
red colors show dry conditions.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:39.520
It will also start to feel increasingly uncomfortable, with conditions becoming quite warm and muggy
throughout Southern California. This graphic

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.300
shows the current forecast high temperatures
for Thursday.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.420
Looking at the potential impacts from this
Monsoon pattern. Showers and Thunderstorms

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.860
will be possible beginning Wednesday morning
and continuing through Thursday night, with

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.920
best chances over the Mountains, Deserts and
Valleys, but also possible for the coast as

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.700
well. Then, storms will transition to mainly
the Mountains, Deserts and Valleys on Friday

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.180
during the afternoon hours, and then mainly
afternoon thunderstorms and showers over the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.610
Mountains and Deserts Saturday and Sunday.
The storms with the initial monsoon surge

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.140
on Wednesday may be moving too quickly, so
the flash flood threat is low for that day

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.450
as of this moment. The Flash Flood Threat
for Thursday through Sunday is more uncertain,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.069
but with weaker winds aloft, we could see
a higher flash flood threat, especially Friday

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:42.629
through Sunday. If we do get some coastal
storms, it would be most likely to occur Wednesday

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.950
and Thursday. Finally, the Warm and Muggy
conditions will persist during this pattern,

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.470
with hottest conditions likely Thursday and
Friday. Temperatures at the coast should be

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.720
moderated somewhat by the presence of the
marine layer, but it will likely feel muggy

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.020
at times for those areas as well.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.780
