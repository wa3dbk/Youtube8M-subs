00:00:06.593 --> 00:00:10.942
Can you tell me how to fix Xbox One System
Error E305?

00:00:10.942 --> 00:00:14.463
I’m assuming a PS4 is out of the question.

00:00:14.463 --> 00:00:19.583
The Xbox One has too many sunk costs for me
to get a different console.

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:22.343
The E305 error is an update error.

00:00:22.343 --> 00:00:27.883
That’s rather painful, given how often the
thing updates and how often updating it is

00:00:27.883 --> 00:00:30.282
supposed to fix everything else.

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:35.302
If you do not mind erasing everything, you
can do the reset to factory defaults.

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:38.563
Reboot, and run the updates again.

00:00:38.563 --> 00:00:41.162
What can I do short of a mind wipe?

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:47.972
The E305 error can occur when the update fails
a validation; in that case, you can try updating

00:00:47.972 --> 00:00:49.532
again.

00:00:49.532 --> 00:00:51.822
Assuming it does not compound the error.

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:56.712
Then you restore the unit to factory defaults
with less guilt because you tried something

00:00:56.712 --> 00:00:58.293
else before you wiped it.

00:00:58.293 --> 00:01:02.332
I’ve heard it could be caused by my wi-fi
connection.

00:01:02.332 --> 00:01:07.503
If your wi-fi connection is weak, your internet
connection could lead to lost packets in the

00:01:07.503 --> 00:01:08.963
update download.

00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:14.073
That leads to the E305 error, because the
incomplete package is considered corrupted

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.553
by the machine.

00:01:15.553 --> 00:01:17.594
Would changing to NAT 1 settings fix it?

00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:21.763
That’s a wide open security hole.

00:01:21.763 --> 00:01:27.413
Simply set your router to NAT2 and give the
Xbox One priority on the wi-fi connection

00:01:27.413 --> 00:01:31.783
and make sure no one else is using it while
you’re downloading updates.

00:01:31.783 --> 00:01:36.503
I can just imagine the reaction of others
when I say stop surfing the net so I can update

00:01:36.503 --> 00:01:38.423
my Xbox One.

00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:43.753
Casual websurfing on the same wi-fi router
won’t slow it down enough to cause corruption,

00:01:43.753 --> 00:01:48.133
but someone else uploading projects or downloading
movies will.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.703
Or watching Youtube videos.

00:01:50.703 --> 00:01:55.213
Or you could have the problem because someone
is using their cell phone as a wi-fi hot spot

00:01:55.213 --> 00:02:00.783
next to your router, and the competing signals
messed up the Xbox One download.

00:02:00.783 --> 00:02:04.163
What do I do if the wi-fi update keeps failing?

00:02:04.163 --> 00:02:06.233
Try the offline update tool.

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:11.372
They offer it because stuff like this happens
periodically with the wireless updates.

00:02:11.372 --> 00:02:15.813
I’ve heard that the offline update process
does not always work.

00:02:15.813 --> 00:02:20.743
Make sure you are using an already formatted
USB thumb drive, with at least two gigs of

00:02:20.743 --> 00:02:24.013
space and an NTFS file system.

00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:28.802
If the thumb drive does not have properly
set up partitions or the right file system,

00:02:28.802 --> 00:02:31.542
the Xbox cannot pull the update from it.

00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:36.292
So I download the update from the internet,
copy to the thumb drive and put it on the

00:02:36.292 --> 00:02:37.723
Xbox One.

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:38.733
Then what?

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:42.393
Reboot it to make sure the update takes effect.

00:02:42.393 --> 00:02:43.942
Then get back to gaming.
