Hi, I'm Greg B from Expert Village. Today
we're going to talk about model cars. Now

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.000
we're going to talk a little bit about some
of the supplies and tools you need for assembling

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.070
a model car. This is your typical glue that
you can find in Wal-mart, K-Mart, your hobby

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:30.090
shops. This is testers glue it's been out
on the market for years. This is a tool of

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.440
the trade so to say. I like to use from time
to time, for my small parts, a toothpick so

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.690
I don't get too much glue on a part. This
is your testers plastic glue and this comes

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.870
with a brush. This works great when you're
gluing your clear plastics like your headlights,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.609
your windshields in, it's easy to control
this. This is Crazy Glue, this works with

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:06.110
your resin kits. You've got to be really careful
with this because you will stick your fingers

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.600
together. Those are some of the types of glues
that are out on the market that are available.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.740
These are some miniature side cutters or cutting
pliers. They work good for trimming parts

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.240
off of the tree without destroying them. Needle
nose or a pair of tweezers so I don't get

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:38.270
the glue on my parts and so I can hold the
part in place. You need these. This is a cheap

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.140
knife set, I paid a dollar for it at a dollar
store. This you can use to trim your parts

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:52.180
off of the trees, which I'll explain to you
later, so you get that clean cut shaving there.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:00.920
This is a file kit. You have round files it
in, flat files. Not expensive, five dollars.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.710
It works great on your plastic parts and your
resin parts, clean the flashings that might

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.180
be on there. These are some of the tools that
you should have to make assembling your car

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.309
a lot easier.
