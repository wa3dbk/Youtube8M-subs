If you love the look of a traditional shed, however,

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.320
you don't want to spend your time
treating and painting the wood

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.660
then the BillyOh range of Evan Metal Sheds

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.099
is perfect for you and that is because
the steel is 100 percent

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.380
maintenance-free so you don't have to treat it.
You don't have to paint it.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.150
You can just spend your valuable time
off for the weekend

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.460
enjoying your garden. Now these doors are fantastic.
They’re sliding doors.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.900
And it's a really easy action to just open and

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.350
close them. And what’s nicer is because it's not
a typical hinged door you don't have to worry

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.850
about it

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.400
swinging open or slamming shots on a
typical British breezy day.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.820
And also you have this huge entrance as
well. So you can easily get inside and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.030
take out your lawnmower

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.650
or of course all of the bikes if you're
going out for a nice family bike ride.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.659
Now there are two vents just above the doors.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.059
This will make sure there's always nice
fresh air inside so if you are planning on

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:56.769
using

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.210
this metal shed as a workshop for example,
it's nice to know there’s

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.150
fresh air inside there even if you’ve got
the door closed if it were a little bit

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.320
cooler outside

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.490
or if your just using it for storage
it’s not gonna have that buildup of condensation.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.320
So you don't have to worry

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.630
about everything that you’re storing inside
having that buildup of condensation so

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.200
it's all

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.740
taken care of. Now the steel is actually galvanized
and that’s a very special technique.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.100
So basically it's coated with zinc

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.719
and that is going to protect the shed.
It’s also gonna help with its stability and just

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.500
protect the properties of the shed as well.
Now it does of course come with a

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.189
foundation kit as standard so that is included

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.810
with the shed and that is the perfect foundations for it.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.789
If you fill the grid with cement
that will basically give you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.109
the best foundation possible making sure that this shed

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.390
will stand test time which is just what you want.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.670
So if you want all the benefits of a metal shed

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.310
and you want to spend your valuable time
enjoying the weekend and not treating or

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.579
painting a wooden shed

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.700
then this is absolutely perfect for you
especially with this huge opening as well

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.520
so you can easily get in inside and just enjoy the space

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.179
that it gives you. So why not get your hands on a BillyOh

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.459
