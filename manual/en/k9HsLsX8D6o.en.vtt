00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:32.260
And what could I use as an example for our love?
There's nothing that can compare even from so high above

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.110
Looking down upon this endless ocean
Can you see the horizon?

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.710
Another end to a day we can't really call perfect
But that's okay even if we don't quite fit

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:55.390
Because love comes in all different flavors
And this is how we taste together

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.730
A little sweetness from you, baby three words will do

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.810
And every now and then some salt from the tears we shed

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:23.260
Don't you know that bitterness can disappear with one little kiss
From me to you and you to me

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:44.260
僕らの味といえばなんだろう？
やっぱり甘酸っぱいんだろう

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.250
絶妙の組み合わせじゃなくたって
十分美味しいんだね

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.720
飲み込んだらそんな顔しないで
みんな見てるから「美味しい！」と言って

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:07.400
誰だって舌バカになるさ
とりあえず味見はやめた

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:34.790
君に覚えてただきたい
このレシピは永遠の愛

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.950
A little sweetness from you, baby three words will do

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:13.390
And every now and then some salt from the tears we shed

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:27.980
Don't you know that bitterness can disappear with one little kiss
From me to you and you to me

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.710
知ってた？　僕はこの味をずっと探してたんだ

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:44.700
Of you
And me with you
