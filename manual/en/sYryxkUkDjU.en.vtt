00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.850
Let's talk a little bit about plush. We call
these plush. These are the kind you see everywhere,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.470
like the kind you see at the fair when you
throw a ball at milk bottles. But those are

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.220
the cheesy ones. And if you see those, and
they're like copies of things, don't buy those,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.910
because they're everywhere, because the fair
gives them out. All you have to do is pretend

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.710
that you hit a bottle and you get a plush.
So, remember those huge ones you can't even

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.650
fit in the car? These are some cuter plushes
that are characters that we know. This is

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.750
my pal, Gumby. Isn't he precious? He has Pokey,
too, but I only have a Gumby to show you today.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.539
And he's probably from the late '70's. But
he's awfully cute. And he's in good condition.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:44.069
He's not dirty. He's got all of his body parts.
And he's even waving to you. So, he's very

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:51.809
cute, and he's probably worth about $30, this
Gumby. "Call home." There he is, E.T. When

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.269
E.T. came out, there were zillions of E.T.
things, but there aren't that many around

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.589
any more. So, they're starting to become highly
collectible, and they're starting to be something

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.019
that you can find. So, if you find some E.T.'s,
start buying them and putting them away, because

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.730
right now this one's only worth maybe $10,
$15. But, you know, if you store your E.T.'s,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.320
they improve and increase in value over time,
kind of like a fine wine. A fine E.T. Isn't

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.410
he cute? They have lots of E.T.'s, by the
way. They also have E.T. mask, E.T. keychain,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.759
everything E.T. You know how it is. Let me
mention this as a more modern idea, too. Look

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.859
at this cute little Linus. Now the Snoopy
line is very valuable, very collectible. This

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:39.250
particular Linus is--United Features Syndicate--I
would say this is from '60's, '70's. I don't

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.710
have the exact date. You can date them, though,
if you get a price guide, and start looking

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.060
at what's written on the bottom, where they're
made--Hong Kong, China, etc. But this is a

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.869
Linus, and, you know, he's worth quite a bit
of money. He's in great shape. He's worth

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.640
about $70. Now, if you had the original box,
everything goes up in value. So, when you

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.210
buy toys for your kids, keep the boxes. Except
remember, they make a lot more toys now than

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.670
they did then. Much more mass production now.
So, when people start collecting things now,

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.780
like dolls like this, remember that there's
zillions of them, and the whole collectible

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.300
craze is becoming more common in people's
psyche. So, collecting things now, it may

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.590
not get you what you did in the '70's. You
may have to wait a hundred years instead of

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.920
twenty, and I don't think we'll live that
long. So just keep that in mind when you collect.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.420
Right, Linus? He agrees.
