00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.736 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - My day-to-day tasks
 involve designing

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:05.071 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
   new ways of making
   things blow up

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:08.508 line:0%
   or new ways of,
   basically, mayhem.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.715
I'm a principal engineer
at Dreamworks Animation.

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:20.120
 I design new kinds of visual
 effects for our feature films.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.824
 So, creating virtual water and
 lava and tar and explosions.

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.798
  In 2008, I received
  an Academy Award

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.433
   for Technical Achievement.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.169 align:start position:0%
   I'd been working on
   liquid simulation effects,

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:39.539 align:start position:0%
  and it was quite innovative
  for the film industry.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.941
 It was very nice to be
 recognized by people

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.843
 that I respected a great deal.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:46.446
 And, even more so, it
 was nice to contribute

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:50.817
   to a field that gives me a
   lot of joy to work inside.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.488 align:start size:88% position:13%
 When I was at the
 College of Charleston

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:58.958
I was very influenced by
Professor Tony Leclerc.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.227 align:start size:88% position:13%
  He had a lot of
  research into using

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:04.197
 algorithms to create pictures.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:08.201
So, he really taught me
how to approach things

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:11.404 align:start position:0%
   algorithmically and
   blend art with computing.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.041 align:start size:88% position:13%
 The group of students
 that ended up

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:18.278 align:start position:0%
in computer science at the
college had a real love for it.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.980
  And there was a lot
  of mixing between

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.749
  the seniors as well
  as the freshmen.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.685
 So it was a very nice,
 tight-knit community.

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:29.055 align:start size:88% position:13%
 One of the things that
 was stressed a lot

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:30.757
   in the computer
   science department

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.059
 was continued experimentation.

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:37.297 align:start size:88% position:13%
 We were always
 encouraged to try out

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:40.667 align:start position:0%
 the things we learned in very
 real and practical terms.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.702
   So I learned a lot
   outside of class,

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:46.439 align:start size:88% position:13%
  and that, to me, was
  a lasting lesson.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.611
 Right after college,
 I sort of just worked

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.746
 as a programmer trying to find

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.715
the niche that would draw me in,

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:58.017
 and it took me about
 two and a half years,

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:00.053
 but I eventually found my way

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:01.788 size:88% position:44%
   into the visual
   effects industry.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:06.860
  My favorite part of
  my job is getting

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.595 align:start size:88% position:13%
  to work with
  world-class artists.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:12.866
   It's so inspiring to work
   with them and to help them

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:16.169 align:start position:0%
   because they bring the
   best ideas that they have,

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.037
  and I bring the best
  ideas that I have.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.006 size:88% position:44%
   And together we
   can create things

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:21.875 size:88% position:44%
   that have never
   been seen before.
