00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.260
This is the ultimate in hands on
training for students who want to build

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.229
a career at the racetrack

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:17.149
the group of nine becomes the first
participants in the old college certified

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:19.580
Exercise Rider and Jockey school.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.730
It's a program designed to meet an
industry demand

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.729
"time is money so everyone's tryin to make money at the racetrack"

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:28.679
"and they don't seem to have
the time to help people.. you know to take

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.210
somebody aside it's ok this too is going
to be done and that's kind of a day to

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.129
day thing so with this would have a good
twelve weeks into the student so that he

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.690
wont need that such hands on rate
when they get there"

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.400
"Most of these student have spent some time at the track already, but in ordered to move

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.610
up the ladder they have to gain some
valuable experience

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.350
and have the right stuff

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.630
be able to the love of horses for sure

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.050
and uh... some of them are coming with
no other previous much riding

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.160
experience and some are coming with a lot
of riding experience

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.060
so it just depends you know you have to
have the character also would not be

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.699
scared because these horses are high strung
horses and they want to go fast so you

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.229
gotta like speed also

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.140
"I've always had an interest in horses... actually relative trains horses in the saskatoon track,"

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.240
and I got to spend the day with her, and I was just
excited about what goes on there

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.420
uh... saw this opportunityand thought, it's
a short course if nothing else you come

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.820
out with a lot of basic knowledge

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.810
in the industry of horses

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.400
The college assembled a team of
instructors know what life at the race

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.600
track is all about

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.830
and what it takes to be successful

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.300
Sumard is riden in some fifteen
thousand races winning eighteen hundred

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.450
of them easing plenty of potential for
careers in the horse racing world

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.490
"the Industry  is growing right now"

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.479
"It kinda went for a down swing for a
few years, i've been in it for twenty

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.490
years, I've seen an up and a low

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.210
now running up some again

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.619
and we get a new track gonig in Balzac
sack supposed to be by 2007

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.770
so right there still is reason to
believe that this fall on the upswing

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.670
alot happens before and after the actual
rates at the track

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.729
accounts and then the other students get
a broad-based and training in the

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.309
equine world

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:14.090
just basic down conditioning for horses
and care and proper techniques and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.059
definitely a lot of safety

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:20.209
this school is unique in canada and is
generated a lot of interest Sumar hopes

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.619
they can make an impact on the world
that has been his life had the

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:26.429
yeah the race industry would just do
it the old way

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.700
but it's going to be going to be the new
ways of hopefully it goes over well

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.380
i think we have a good group of kids
that are going to be able to open some

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.160
eyes and see that not everything has to
be done the old way definite looking for

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.019
getting a cheque
