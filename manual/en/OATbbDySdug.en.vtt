00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.069
Overhead power lines and elevating equipment
can be a dangerous mix.

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.300
You don't even have to touch the power lines.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.070
Get close enough to one, and like lightning,
the electricity can jump across an air gap.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.000
This is known as flashover, and it's what
happened to one young worker.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.710
The young worker had been cleaning 
and performing service checks

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.300
on two scissor lifts at the rear 
of a rental yard.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.300
The service checks included raising the lift to full height.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.800
The worker had finished working on one of the lifts.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.900
He moved the other lift from the wash area
to the far back of the yard.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.000
Overhead were 138-kilovolt and 25-kilovolt high-voltage power lines.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
One kilovolt equals 1,000 volts, 
so 25 kilovolts equals 25,000 volts.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.500
Labels on the lifts warned to keep clear of
power lines.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.300
A worker had just arrived at the 
business next door.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.400
She saw the young worker standing in the middle
of the elevated platform.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.900
The worker began to raise his right arm 
towards the power lines

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.700
in what appeared to be a defensive manner.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.700
Electricity flashed over from the 25,000-volt
line to the worker,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.400
then travelled through the scissor lift to
the ground.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:28.600
The surge was so severe that scorch marks were left where the ground straps of the lift contacted the concrete.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.600
The worker, seriously injured, did not survive.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.200
We can learn three main lessons from this incident:

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.900
Keep at least 3 metres or 10 feet away 
from power lines.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.400
This applies to power lines that are over
750 volts and up to 75 kilovolts.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.710
Higher voltages require keeping even farther away.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.700
Implement controls such as visual aids or
barriers to protect workers from overhead power lines.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.200
Don't just rely on workers' ability to
judge the distance to the lines.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.600
After this incident, warning flags and signs were installed in the rental yard.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.719
Train young and new workers so they can 
do their jobs safely.

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.560
While job-shadowing of more senior workers
is essential,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.189
don't rely on that alone for training.

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:24.400
It can lead to inconsistent training and perpetuate
errors.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:32.200
Include structured training, which means developing and having workers follow a safety-focused training program.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.400
Document the training.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.519
Overhead power lines mean danger.

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.800
Look up, keep back, and stay safe.
