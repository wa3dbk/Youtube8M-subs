00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.000
-No! No, no.
-It's okay, he's in here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.500
-What?

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.000
-Oh, hey, Virginia.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.500
DONALD: Hey!

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.100
-Do you have any idea how long I waited for you?
-How long?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.700
-I don't know. Time was stopped.
-It's not my fault.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.600
-You never came back. I thought you were
gone forever.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.100
-I didn't wanna not come back. Something
weird happened. I got distracted.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.620
-Oh, that's great. I've been stopping time,
you've been altering destinies,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.409
and still this doesn't keep your attention?

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:50.000
You've been TIME TRAVELING for a couple of
weeks and you can't keep from dozing off?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.100
-No!
-Was it food? It's usually food with you.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.700
-Seriously?
VIRGINIA: What then?

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.900
-I want to tell you!
-I can't wait to hear it.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.000
-Can I have something to drink first?
Maybe something to eat?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.500
I haven't eaten all day.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.900
I was afraid to interact with anything after Paradox Man
sprinkled me with paradoxes before I left.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.500
-What?
You have no problem stopping crimes,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.500
but you think the real universe-altering paradoxes
revolve around snacking?

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.200
-You were real non specific.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.800
-I'll make you a grilled cheese.
-Sweet.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.100
DONALD: So, we're not paradox'ing?

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.300
JONAS: Well, the other you went through the portal like
you were supposed to, so I guess the loop's complete?

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.100
DONALD: What?
JONAS: I'm gonna diagram it.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.000
DONALD: Oh, thanks!

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.200
-Let's hear it, Mister Doctor Distracticon.
JONAS: Nice!

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.700
-What could be more important than your
dear friend Virginia's peace of mind?

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.700
[Unintelligible mush]

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.200
-Swallow.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.500
-I saved the same girl again.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.900
-What?

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.170
-I went through the portal the bar,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.600
DONALD: Hey!

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.000
-Oh, come on!
-I said, 'Hey.'

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.500
-Why does this keep happening to me?

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.000
-Are you okay? Hey...

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.500
-Hey!
-Help!

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.000
-You're that girl that I saved...

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.500
Lady!

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.600
I saved you already!

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.800
VIRGINIA: So what?
-What do you mean?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.500
-Why'd you run after her?
-She ran away.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.500
-What does it even matter? You saved the same person twice.
What's the big deal?

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.900
-What's the big deal? The odds of getting attacked by
a stranger are one in three hundred twenty seven.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.400
The odds of being attacked again by a completely different stranger
in the same city are one in two point three million.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.300
-Where are you getting your statistics?
-He's making them up,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.400
but it is an interesting coincidence.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.700
-I stand by my made up statistics.
-Dude, you are buying me more orange juice.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.500
-I'm thirsty!
-What then?

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.000
Then I chased her.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.300
DONALD: I must have chased her for a few
blocks and I couldn't catch her.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.600
By the time she lost me, I had no idea
where I was.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.300
It must've been over an hour before I
made it back to the bar.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.500
[Deep sigh of exhaustion and regret]

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.100
Then I couldn't find the portal.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.500
I walked all over that place hoping to walk through it.
Couldn't find it.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.610
They finally realized I didn't have any money
and kicked me out.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I figured the portal must have closed, so

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I decided not to interact with anything and walk home.
It took me all day.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.800
I've been out in the shed since five
because I knew that past me

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.810
was in Sebastian's room going through...
he was inside.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.000
And all the paradox warnings from Back to the Future
have to do with running into yourself.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
-And Time Cop.
-And Time Cop.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
-I can't believe how much you risked
just because you happpened to have

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.700
saved this girl once before.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.000
-It's fate.
-It was a coincidence.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.500
-Did you hear my statistics?
-You made those up.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.000
-There's precedent.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Olive Oyl.
-You gonna make some spaghetti now?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
-How many time has Popeye saved Olive Oyl?
They're destined to be together.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
She's always gonna get tied up,
he's always gonna run and untie her.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.500
Fate.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.500
That's why I have to open another portal,
go back to last night, and find her.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.300
-Whoa.
-No. No. You've taken your last portal ride.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.800
-Come on!
-I can't trust you anymore, Donald.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.500
You couldn't even make your way back here.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.300
A drunbken hipster could find it with his eyes closed,
but you couldn't make it happen.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.000
-A drunken hipster?
-Why do you think I started time back up?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
-Oh! Sorry. Is the line for the bath...

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.600
Did I black out again?
[Time starting noise]

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.800
-Tonight I found out what it was like to
lose you, Donald.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.500
Now, I don't know why you feel the need
to go out every night

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.300
looking for reasons to get yourself killed,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.000
but I do know that from now on I'm not gonna be the one
holding the door, hoping you'll come back.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.800
-Virginia--
-No.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
-Dude.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.400
JONAS: Look at it this way, if she is your fate, you're not going to
need to bend time and space to find her.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.590
-Now I've lost my Olive Oyl
and my time machine.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
-And you don't have a job.
