00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.859
Vienna is a very pretty city, actually it's
the center of the European culture with beautiful

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.840
places to see, it's a lovely Baroque city,
it's something you should really see one day.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.990
The RailEuro website offers you many, many
opportunities if you'd like to buy a ticket

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.509
from Prague to Vienna, and of course you can
call them personally as well, no problem.

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:31.210
The other thing is that on your way you can
take something with you to read, because there

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.560
are so many things to see in Vienna, which
you should see while you're there, and maybe

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.860
you won't even be able to decide where to
go and what to do on your own, so it's better

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.220
off learning a little bit about Vienna before
getting there, seeing the wonderful Hofburg

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:55.000
or maybe getting into a nice authentic Austrian
cafeteria, or just walking around there is

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.980
something really amazing. The best idea is
buying, for example a ticket from Prague to

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.500
an Austrian Border town, such as Huanou, and
you can travel between these two places, and

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.570
then after all, you can use your EuroRail
pass. If you're under 26, you got to make

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.620
inquiries in the train station in Prague,
because maybe you get certain reductions from

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.090
the price you have to pay for a ticket. If
you're a bit older, you should just deal with

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.720
the international travel agency, and then
they will help you as well. The other thing

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.670
is that, in case you have a EuroRail pass
you shouldn't rely on it a hundred percent,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.720
because it's not much honored in the Czech
Republic, and I have to say that, in most

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.630
of the Eastern European countries, they don't
accept it, so you should make inquiries about

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.190
this as well. The trip between Prague and
Vienna will take around 4, 5 hours. In case

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.450
you'd like to see the Czech Republic or Austria
in a short time, that's quite a nice idea,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.729
because then you will see the beautiful countryside
on your way. But in case you'd like to travel

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.459
overnight, it's another option as well, because
you can sleep on the train as well, but it

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:22.120
will take a little longer. Don't forget about
another important thing, that the trains for

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.740
Vienna will leave from the main station in
Prague or the second largest station.
