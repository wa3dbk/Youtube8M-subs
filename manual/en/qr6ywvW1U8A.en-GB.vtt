00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.130
 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.340
It's a little known fact that Predator learned
how to shoot during an afternoon spent in

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.270
a hide with Crowman. Andy obviously didn't
know he was there - as Mr Predator had spent

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.660
the previous week studying how Mr Crow builds
a hide...And let's just say he's pimped his

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.720
space craft in Jack Pyke English Oak.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.120
Anyway, our real life pigeon predator is out
again and he's setting up shop on another

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.580
abandoned crop that's worth keeping an eye
on at this time of year.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:54.000
You see have been picking up some barley.
We've got whole ears and with barley it takes

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.260
lot longer to germinate. This barley's been
cut now since the first week of July this

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.059
has been cut. We have had rain, we've had
hot weather and it has not germinated. So

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.170
that is why the pigeons are here. And WInter
barley stubble or Spring barley stubble - keep

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.619
an eye on them because they tend to leave
them, that's what they have done here - they

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.880
have left this stubble and gone off on to
the drilling and other stuff but then they

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.899
have other stuff they prefer than the barley
as their are whiskers on the barley and they

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.909
don't prefer that so much. Now they have got
wet they have all gone brittle and they are

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.229
not spikey. They can get stuck in their throats,
they don't like all that so they come back

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.929
onto this as a last resort. You have got one
which has germinated their and the others

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:42.600
haven't germinated so the pigeons, of course,
just clear them up.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.249
So a few weeks ago it was beans, now barley
can be added to the list of possible food

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:54.249
sources. From food sources to heat sources.
We're using the Guide IR500 from Thomas Jacks.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.729
The ability to film through it offers all
sorts of interesting results. The quality

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.700
is good enough to show a flock of ferals on
the other side of the field, and feathers

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.120
flying off birds as Andy makes contact.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.700
What is particularly fun is seeing the wad
not the shot offering a heat signature.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.800
Ruby Ruby looks particularly vivid. If she
wasn't here the Guide could of course help

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.800
locate birds tucked away in a crop.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.940
Back to normal vision and Andy has kept the
hide away from the field margin. It's less

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.540
cover but it means he can shoot behind him
, tucked underneath, a lot of birds would

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.830
be lost in the foliage.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.879
Now it's fair to say that Andy thought it
was going to be a bonanza day , he's packed

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.840
plenty of Clear Pigeon cartridges , but uncharacteristically
for Crow it's not as busy as he'd expect.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.840
There was a lot of birds here yesterday - I
don't know where they have gone today. They

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.689
are not around here.Let's hope we end up with
about 50.I am happy with that. There are a

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:15.689
few tame ones around at the moment. They will
get back on it in the end. I would just like

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.909
to know they have gone today! Certainly not
coming now. I'm getting the odd ones. Just

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.319
nice to be out with you David. Really enjoy
that.

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:38.319
As Andy says, it's worth trying to move birds
on a few days before you plan to shoot it

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.030
just to gauge how much "they want it", as
Crow would say. If they come back to the field

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.099
within half an hour, chances are they're locked
on.

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.819
Andy plays with the pattern , he's got the
larger than life A1 decoys out today as well

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.049
as their whirlys , the thermal shows they're
working hard...the thermal also shows up the

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.519
fresh birds as opposed to the week-old ones
Andy's used for the pattern.

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.409
As well as some good pigeons, there's a token
crow plus a fox heading away from the local

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.719
pheasant shoot a mile away. And it's the pheasant
shooting that might have kept the pigeons

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:14.430
from homing in here.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.900
We started at 1130am and every bird's crop
is empty apart from one of the last birds

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.850
Andy shoots at 3pm.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.500
This one is the last one I just shot - he
has got beech nuts in his crop. I saw a few

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.890
pigeons back over there earlier on. In the
wood there are a few beech trees and that's

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.560
what he has been on. They go on that , preference
over anything else as it has so much protein

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.800
in it. It is the first one we have shot today
with anything in it.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.430
Maybe we should get Andy to produce a league
table of the wood pigeons' most favourite

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.050
grub.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.520
It's unbelievable isn't it?

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.710
As we prepare to pack up Andy uses the thermal
to locate a missing woody but Ruby gets there

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.920
first. It adds to a bag of 50 birds pretty
good as barley was off the menu...but they'll

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.320
be back.
