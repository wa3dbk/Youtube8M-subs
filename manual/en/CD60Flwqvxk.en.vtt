00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.740
Oh my! People at Sony, they got a monster on their
hands. This is not...

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.500
I don't even know if you can call this a laptop,
or even a Notebook really. 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.530
This is like a desktop computer, in a giant
hulking package. 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.900
It's a 17 inch Sony Notebook. It's got a Core
2 Duo, 2.2 gigahertz processor onboard.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.200
It's the T7500, fast fast processor. 2 'gigs'
of DDR2 RAM.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.440
It's got Vista Ultimate, pre installed. 320 
gigabyte hard drive,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.990
it's got all of your wireless spectrum covered.
It's got 'a', 'b', 'g' and 'n',

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.390
it's got Gigabit Ethernet, it's got a 17 inch 
screen, sort of the show piece of this laptop.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.440
It's an extraordinarily vivid beautiful screen on
this thing.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.870
GeForce Go, 8400M chipset. So you are actually 
going to be able to play games on this.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.430
You're going to be able to decode high def movies,
you'll be able to do all that stuff,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.570
without any problem whatsoever. This screen runs
at a 1440 by 900 resolution, 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.150
which is a really really solid resolution for the 
17 inch screen size really.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.990
And, overall, this thing will have absolutely no
problem replacing your desktop computer at home.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.980
Without a doubt. Especially if your desktop
computer might be more than a year old or so.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.820
This thing... It will probably, already, 
kick it's tail.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.600
Like my grandma used to say, 'cause she didn't
like to curse. She would say "Kick it's tail",

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.360
you know. So, let me go ahead and show you all
around this thing, how about it?

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.170
Up here at the top, is where Sony has located 
their Motion Eye webcam,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.470
kind of difficult to see in the lighting there,  
but there we go.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.250
Motion Eye webcam right there, 1.3 megapixel
webcam. Also up here in the bezel,  

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.090
you're going to find the microphone integrated 
as well.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.820
Down here, there is plenty of screen... Or space,
on this giant...

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.230
What do you call this? What is this area? Keyboard
area? 'Cause it goes beyond the keyboard.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.580
You know what I'm saying? So I don't even know
what this... I don't even know what this whole

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.300
area is called, but I'm going to go with keyboard 
area. Over here you got a couple of user

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.640
programmable quick launch buttons. You've got
your media keys for volume,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.630
for mute, for ejecting your DVD drive, all located
right there.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.380
Up here you've got more of your media controls, 
as well as a quick access to the Sony AV Mode,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.980
which allows you to very quickly get to all of 
your media.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.920
Down here, is your trackpad, along with your 2
track buttons, located right there on,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.410
the bottom. Now, over here, we got some ports
 and some expansion going on.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.840
We have Express 54, and PC card onboard. You got
both of those slots,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.910
located right here. As well, as a couple of USB
drives.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.640
Or USB ports. Over here on the front, is where
you're going to find,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.380
your Memory Stick, and Memory Stick Pro. 
And Magic Gate slots right up here,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.720
as well as your wireless on/off located right 
here. 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.080
Over on this side, you're going to find your DVD
drive.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.630
That's your DVD drive. It's very well concealed 
into the body of the Notebook, 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.310
but that's where it's located. Right here is your
headphone, microphone and Sony's S/PDIF interface,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.470
right there. Look at that, it's optical. It glows 
all the time. On the back,

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.320
one more USB port, and your power charging 
port located right back here.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.860
Speakers are actually integrated into the bottom 
of the screen.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.120
If you look right here, abo... Right, flaking this
beautifully glowing Sony logo on each side,

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.660
is where you're going to find some pretty good
sounding stereo speakers as well.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.210
Now hidden underneath this trap door here, 
is where you're going to find your modem,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.970
and Ethernet ports right there. So they're not 
always exposed, those are the types of ports

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.510
you don't want to have getting dusty all the time.
So it's got a very handy little latch there,

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.080
to cover them up for you. So I think you're going 
to find, that this computer is a fantastic value.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.870
Especially when you factor in the fact that it's
got a nice sized monitor,

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.450
it's got a really fast processor, it's got Vista
Ultimate, and,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.990
it's got a decent graphic chipset onboard as well
so you'll be able to do just about 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.700
anything you want to with this thing. So, it's
a great laptop. Great desktop replacement, 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.370
laptop/notebook/ you know, beat every other
laptops tail, kind of computer. 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.110
You know what I'm saying? It's the Sony VAIO 
AR650U. Go check it out.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.150
To get more info on the Sony VAIO AR650U, with
that giant 17 inch screen, 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:47.260
go to any of these retailers and type in 
S168-AR650U. For Computer TV, I'm Bauer.
