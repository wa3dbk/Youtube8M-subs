00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.010
Hi I'm Matt from eSpares.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.280
In this video, I’m going to show you how
a microwave oven works.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.360
So what are microwaves?

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.730
They’re just a form of energy that move
in a wave-like way, much like visible light.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.700
Lets have a look at the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.500
Here’s visible light, right in the middle.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.640
And as we move this way along the spectrum,
the wavelength gets longer.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.920
And our microwaves are here, between IR and
radio-waves.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.070
Now the microwaves that are produced by our
ordinary microwave oven are of just the right

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:50.289
wavelength to be absorbed by water and foods
like potatoes are full of water.

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.300
Now imagine for a second that this isn’t
a potato but is in fact a water molecule.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.550
It’s polar.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.999
Which means it’s positively charged on one
side and negatively charged on the other.

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:06.930
As the microwave passes by, the water molecules
vibrates to stay aligned with the oscillation

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.930
from the wave.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.240
And it’s this vibration that causes heat.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.780
Now contrary to popular belief, microwaves
don’t heat foods from the inside out.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.640
The microwaves still penetrate the outer part
of the food first, which is why you’ll see

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.300
on cooking instructions it often tells you
to leave the food to stand for a little while,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.050
and that allows the heat to penetrate evenly
throughout the food.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.580
Microwaves don’t heat up plastics, glass,
or ceramics.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.420
That’s because their molecules are not polar.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.670
If the bowl does get hot, it’s through conduction
of heat from the food itself.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.310
And im sure you know never to put metal objects
inside the microwave.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.060
That’s because many metals reflect microwaves,
and you get that ‘arcing’ or sparking.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.760
And that’s actually dangerous and can cause
damage to the microwave oven.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.220
So, let’s open ours up.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.000
Now I’m doing something we recommend you
don’t do.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.840
You shouldn’t ever take off the outer casing
of your microwave, like I’m doing.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.730
It should only ever be done by a qualified
appliance engineer.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.930
We’ve got high voltages inside and it can
be potentially quite dangerous.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.750
But I’m doing that so I can show you the
flow of the electrical current through the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.120
microwave, obviously I’m unplugged from
the mains.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.650
So it comes in here into this little board
here where we’ve got a fuse and a little

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.609
filter and that just cleans any noise from
the electrical signal.

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.400
It comes across here to this which is a thermal
cut out switch.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.780
Just means if everything is getting too hot
inside it will cut the power before things

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.400
start to catch fire.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.459
It then comes down to a little micro-switch,
which if I then open and close the door, hopefully

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:04.620
you can see that, its cutting the current
to stop the microwaves when the door is open.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.109
That also comes up to a bulb here, so we can
see what we are doing inside, and down to

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.859
our main control board here.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:19.170
Now the control board is obviously where we
set the power level and duration that we want

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.129
to cook for.

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.560
From there it comes down to this big lump
at the bottom here which is a transformer,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.109
and that’s just jumping the voltage up from
ordinary 240 volt mains electricity, up to

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.159
several thousand volts; it depends on what
make and model of microwave that you’ve

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.159
got.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.840
But we need that really high voltage to power
this part which is called the magnetron.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.349
And the magnetron is what actually produces
the microwaves.

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.079
They are filtered through this part here,
channelled through this, which is called the

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:58.700
wave guide and out into the cavity of the
microwave.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.359
Now there’s a cover on this called the wave
guide cover, it can be either a plastic one

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.540
like this, or you might find that you have
this slightly metallic card.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.830
And it’s just to stop any food getting inside
the wave guide and into the magnetron; because

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.939
you don’t want that to happen.

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.019
But it’s one of the few parts that’s easily
replaceable on a microwave.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.080
Now there’s just a couple of motors I want
to show you.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.710
There’s a motor here that’s driving this
fan.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.390
That’s just to draw ambient air across the
magnetron, stopping it getting too hot.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:43.460
That comes past the bulb and across the cavity
and then vents out this side of the microwave.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.580
Now the other motor is right in the middle
underneath here.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.270
And that’s just what turns the plate round
whist the microwave is on and the food is

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.370
cooking.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.449
And the plate is very often broken.

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.300
It’s the most commonly replaced spare part
on a microwave.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.610
So hopefully you now know how a microwave
works.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.800
Wave guide covers and microwave plates, and
other spare parts for microwaves are available

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.810
for all makes and models.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.169
And you can find them on the eSpares website.

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:18.880
Thanks for watching.
