Welcome to the Daily XP for Tuesday July 16th.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.230
Today on the show we have Elder Scrolls Online's
latest Q&amp;A, Neverwinter's Fury of the Feywild

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.100
Module, Perfect World Entertainment expanding
into browser territory and the death of a

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.750
Pirate, mmo.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.411
Elder Scrolls Online.com yesterday released
their latest Ask Us Anything on anything and

00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:28.580
everything ESO.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.450
If you've not taken a look at these ask us
anything's before, they are done about every

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.910
two weeks and range from simple questions
to much more complex ones.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.030
This particular ask us anything didn't have
any groundbreaking stuff, and most of it has

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.250
been said elsewhere through various interviews.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.790
And as much as I'd like to read through the
whole Q&amp;A here, it's much easier to check

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.920
out their website that has very detailed answers,
I will of course link to it below.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.399
Perfect World Entertainment and Cryptic Studios
have just announced the latest expansion for

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.750
their free to play action MMORPG, Neverwinter.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.899
The expansion, or as they like to call it,
a module, is called Fury of the Feywild, and

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.530
will release next month.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.040
The free module will allow players to explore
the enchanted woods of Sharandar, as well

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.620
as play as two new races, the sun and moon
elves, earn new rewards, encounter new creatures,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.150
collect new weapons and items and more.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.860
Fury of the Feywild is set for an August 22nd
release.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.200
More news from PWE, they have revealed their
first efforts into the browser based market

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.189
with the upcoming release of the real time
strategy game Fortuna.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.030
There is minimal information at this time
on Fortuna, but it appears to be a mix of

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.880
RTS, eco-sim features and a deep economical
management system.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.340
We won't have to wait long though to find
out what Fortuna is all about, the open beta

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.400
will begin in just two days on July 18th.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.760
And lastly we must say goodbye to Kartuga.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.650
Innogames and Ticking Bomb games announced
today the discontinuation of their pirate

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.090
MMO, stating that the companies partnership
has also been disbanded.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.740
Kartuga was unable to fulfill high expectations
during its recent closed beta, and unfortunately

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.450
Ticking Bomb Games will be closed.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.090
Thanks so much for watching, hopefully you
learned something you didn't know about one

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.470
or more of your favorite MMO games.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.950
Please tune in everyday for another episode
of MMO Attack's Daily XP, and we will see

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:34.879
