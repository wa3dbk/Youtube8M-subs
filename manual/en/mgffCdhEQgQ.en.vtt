00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.300
And we're gettin' a picture on the T.V. This
is Houston, we're copying. It's one, small

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.180
step for man... one, giant leap, for mankind.
You understand what the federation is, don't

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.960
you? When you feel like you were meant for
something better... something special. There

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.050
is greatness in you. Enlist in Starfleet.
They say time is the fire in which we burn.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.859
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation
is going to have the hardest time living in

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:59.379
it. Fascinating. I may throw up on you. Son
of a bitch. Emergency session - suit up Kirk.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.379
Weapon systems and shields on standby. Confirmed,
sir. Scotty? Don't you worry, captain. Maneuvering

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.540
thrusters Mr. Sulu. Maneuvering thrusters.
Hold station. Lights. Space... the final frontier.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.540
Warp speed - engage. Punch it. These are the
voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Engines

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.580
at maximum warp. Their ongoing mission: to
explore strange new worlds. Come on Bones,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.580
it's gonna be fun. To seek out new life-forms.
Oh my God. And new civilizations... and boldly

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:49.730
go where no one has gone before. Now... shall
we begin. Darkness is coming. Who is this?

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.430
Do you know the klingon proverb that tells
us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.430
It is very cold in space. I'm sorry. If there
is one constant in this whole universe, it's

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.440
death. You think you are safe... You are not.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.970
I believe in you, Jim... but there's not an ounce of humility in you.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.580
You're afraid. I'm afraid of nothing.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.790
And you're going to get yourself, and everyone under your command, killed.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.599
These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Your ongoing mission: to explore strange, new worlds... seek out new lifeforms, and new civilizations... and boldly go where
no one has gone before.
