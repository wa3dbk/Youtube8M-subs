00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.389
hi I'm Peg from Sony and I'm going to
show you some of the common symptoms

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.039
that may indicate a malwhere infection
on your Vaio pc

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.210
first what is malware

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.609
malware is a blanket term used
to identify any kind of unwanted or

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.279
destructive file or program that
might find its way onto your computer

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.399
the term malware applies to viruses
internet worms

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.160
trojan horse programs

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.750
key loggers and password or credit card
stealing programs

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.990
most of us have heard some of the classic
symptoms of malware activity on a pc

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.910
slow performance slow to boot up

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.440
multiple pop-up windows or error
messages that won't go away

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.180
but these symptoms can be caused by a
number of things besides malware

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.760
so how can you tell if your computer has
become infected

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.710
one example of unwanted activity on a
pc is a pop-up window or message that appears

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.710
which informs the user that a
computer virus or malware application

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.690
has infected the pc

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.580
and indicates the user should enter a
credit card number into a box provided

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.880
or click a link to a website to enter
a credit card numbers in order to

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.520
purchase the antivirus application to
get rid of the virus

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.979
this is a common method used by hackers
to obtain credit card numbers

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.229
every pc should be protected by an anti-malware
applications and there are many trusted

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.400
anti-malware providers

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.610
such as Kaspersky and Norton

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.420
if you have an anti-malware program
protecting your pc

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.350
it should alert you to the presence of
malware

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.050
usually with a pop-up message

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.460
but this message will be labeled with
the name of your application

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:04.190
as an example look at this alert message
generated by Kaspersky antivirus 2011

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.619
this message is clearly labeled with
the name of the application

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.029
if you have Kaspersky installed to
protect the pc from malware

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:17.899
this would be what you would expect to see
when the program is doing its job

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:23.840
this message recommends selecting the
action to move the infected file to quarantine

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.579
where it can't interfere with anything else

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.079
now look at this pop-up message

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.420
if you have Kaspersky antivirus
installed

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.289
this pop up would be very suspicious it
is not labeled with the Kaspersky name or logo

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:45.489
so it does not appear to be a message
coming from the Kaspersky program

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.379
some of these fake virus alerts
applications are designed to look like

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.799
Microsoft security pop-up windows

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.429
but they usually are not labeled with
the Microsoft Windows name or logo

00:02:57.429 --> 00:03:02.109
even more suspicious this pop-up
advises that you must register online in

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.489
order to get help with removing the
infections which the pop-up claims have

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.599
been found on your pc

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.439
but is not clear that this is a message
coming from a legitimate program

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.039
the pop-up appears to be generic

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:18.569
this is typical of malware

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.609
so what should you do with a pop up like this

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.599
first be familar with the anti-malware 
security application you

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.629
currently have on your pc

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.909
Sony ships Vaio pcs with a working
trial version of either Kaspersky or

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.459
Norton security software

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.809
if you see a pop-up informing you of
security risks and the pop up is not

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:46.449
identified by name and doesn't match the
name of the security software you use

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:50.029
then don't click on the suspicious pop-up message

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:54.809
instead just run a security scan using
the security software already installed

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.009
on your Vaio pc

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.959
of course you should always be
suspicious of any message or window that

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.970
pops up on your pc asking for personal
information

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.579
or asking you to install a program

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.430
expecially if you didn't initiate a request
for a product or service

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.120
most of us feel safe in giving
personal information name phone number

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.880
or even credit card numbers to someone
over the phone when we are calling a

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.919
company to request a product or service

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.330
but only when we call the company and
you know who we are talking to you

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.870
if we get a call from an unknown person

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.849
who immediately asks for personal information

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.240
for instance a caller who says who is this

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.360
it instantly is suspicious

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.759
since you have no idea who the caller is
or where the call is coming from

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.899
the same is true of pop-up messages on your pc

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:53.900
another common behavior of malware is to
suddenly change the home page of your browser

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.040
the home page is the site that comes up automatically
when you first open the browser window

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.940
if you are used to seeing a particular website
appear when you first open your browser

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.009
and your browser suddenly starts opening
up to a different website

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.229
this is evidence of a malware infection

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.569
the first thing you should do if you
suspect malware is to disconnect your pc

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:18.810
from the internet

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.389
open the security software you are using on the pc

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.890
and then run a full scan of your pc to
detect and remove malware

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.039
before reconnecting to the internet

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.589
