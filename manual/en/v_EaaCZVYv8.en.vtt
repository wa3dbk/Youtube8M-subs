00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.980
I'm going to use my paint, showing you some very simple techniques.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.820
I'm using here the smallest of my brushes. I could be using the bigger one.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.260
I just picked up one, it doesn't really matter,
what ever feel comfortable with.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.810
first of all I'm going to show you how to do it using a smooth-ish brush stroke

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.140
so I'm painting, if you noticed, every which
way. I'll just slow that up

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.330
I do these sort of techniques like that.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.800
but because i'm going for a sort of

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.550
distressed look.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.740
I prefer to paint over these things

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.060
also

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.550
it's a lot quicker.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.330
and the other thing I can do is to
take it and sort of stipple with it

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.410
dabbing it fairly hard and quite dry, so
can you see that bit there where

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.180
the paint is thicker and it's more three-dimensional

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.649
you'll now need to wait aproximately 20 minutes for the paint to dry

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.290
depending on the temerature and the thickness.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.930
So now the next step is to show you
how to do the wax, and of course the wax

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.240
has been the thing that people have been the most intrigued by.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.799
So here's my brush covered in wax, and I've got a cloth here as well.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.300
I'm painting over with the wax and you
can see the lack of paint

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.820
has brought that up because I only did a thin coat. This is not laying a layer of wax on the paint

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.040
but it's a bit like, someone came up with the idea, when you put hand cream on

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.090
you put hand cream on so it absorbs right in. You don't put hand cream on and leave a layer

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.470
so you walk around with really greasy hands.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.440
When I've waxed enough

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.210
I will then go in

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.020
wiping it. Because it's metal underneath, just a
little bit without really much work

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.910
is coming through, and you can see a little
bit of the metal and I think it looks quite nice

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.640
So this is my Dark Wax. I know it looks really dark.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.589
What i'm doing now is something you will
probably be very scared of... but

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:16.759
as long as you've got clear wax underneath that is not a problem.

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:21.069
Now I'm just going to wipe that off. Quite lightly take it off.

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.109
That's where I did the stipples. What I tend to do is I work

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:33.059
sort of painting it really. Take a little bit of clear wax, just very lightly go over the top

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:39.059
leaving the top lighter, and the darkness really in the

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:40.999
cracky bits.

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:45.569
this is a sand paper which is quite fine. You can get finer. Just showing 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:52.569
a little bit of the wood maybe.
Bring out that nice bit of gold on there.

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.219
and I might just do a little bit more

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:02.219
clear wax on to there.
