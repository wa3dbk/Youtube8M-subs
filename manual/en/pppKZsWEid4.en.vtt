00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.930
Hi, I'm Tricia, a California organic gardener.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.999
I love my fruit trees. They're beautiful and they give me box after box of delicious fruit!

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.939
If you're considering planting fruit
trees in your yard this year,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.860
I'm ready to share my tips on which varieties to choose!

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.439
The first step in choosing your
fruit tree is to determine your USDA zone

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.119
and the number of chill hours in your area.

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.099
Chill hours are the number of hours below 45 degrees that your area will have during the dormant season.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.720
You can find out your chill hours by
contacting your Master Gardeners

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.460
or local Ag. extension.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.780
Once you know your chill hours,
then you can choose your fruit varieties.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.760
If you choose a variety that requires
more chill hours than what your area has,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.940
you may not even get any fruit.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.500
On the other hand, if you choose a variety that requires 300 chill hours,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.160
you have 800 chill hours, more than likely the tree's gonna break dormancy too early,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.220
and then you're gonna
have either frost damage or the tree could die.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.260
The exception are fig trees - they only need 100 chill hours, but they're hardy down to 15 degrees below zero,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.350
and if they get killed by the frost on
the top, they'll grow back from the roots next year.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.030
The challenge with figs is choosing a
variety suited to the summer heat you get.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.600
For example, White Genoa figs do
well in cool coastal areas,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.640
on the other hand Flanders figs need a
nice hot climate in order to produce the best flavor.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.929
Pay attention to where you'll plant your tree. Micro climates are important!

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.529
You'll get a lot more cold air if you
plant with a northern exposure, or in a little valley,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.920
and you'll get more warm air if you plant your tree with a southern exposure or close to the house.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.990
Citrus doesn't normally do well here,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.870
but these blood oranges are doing pretty
well since I planted them so close to the house.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.960
Another thing to consider is a pollenizer.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.380
Most apple trees, for example, require another apple tree planted

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.300
within 50 feet that blooms at the same time in order to bear fruit.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.140
This big apple tree was on the property when we purchased it,

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.100
but we never got any fruit until we planted our orchard and planted another apple tree.

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.489
Now look at it!

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.170
If you don't want to plant multiple fruit
trees for pollination,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.070
consider a multi-grafted fruit tree, like this cherry.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.679
These trees have multiple varieties that
pollinate each other grafted onto the same rootstock.

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:35.239
Multi-grafts are also a fantastic solution for limited space.

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.379
Another option is to plant 3 fruit
trees in the same hole,

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.769
you'll get the same effect as the multi-graft!

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.760
Consider the space you have in your
garden.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.440
Can u accommodate an 18 foot 
semi dwarf or a 40 foot standard tree?

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:52.199
Or is a 10 foot dwarf tree more suitable for your space?

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.239
Keep in mind that by pruning you can keep a tree to any height,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.540
and espalier pruning takes up even less space.

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.940
There are different harvest times for
different varieties of fruit trees,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.560
so the question to ask is do you want
all your fruit to ripen at the same time for preserving?

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.489
Or do you want to stagger the harvest times for a constant supply of fresh fruit?

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.700
Don't guess about harvest times. This awesome online harvest chart available at GrowOrganic.com

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.299
lists virtually all varieties and their harvest dates.
Check it out before making your selection.

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.419
If you have diseases that are prevalent in your area, you can choose varieties that resist those diseases.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.500
For example, the peach leaf curl resistant Indian Free peach,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.220
or the blight resistant Warren pear.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:44.540
So you figured out what varieties do well in your area, the pollination, the size of the tree, the time it ripens,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.960
now it's time to consider 
some special characteristics that you want.

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.229
Are you going to want to harvest a good
baking apple, or a winter storage apple?

00:03:54.749 --> 00:04:00.369
And what about peaches? Do you want a peach that's good for canning or perhaps one you can eat right off the tree?

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.520
Think about what you want and make the decision on what tree to plant.

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:09.079
It makes sense to plant fruit tree
varieties whose fruit are either

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.779
commercially unavailable or expensive
to buy, like these Hachiya persimmons.

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:16.849
Please consider planting a heritage
variety of fruit,

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:20.519
some of these varieties are in danger of
disappearing and by planting them in your

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.599
garden or orchard you can help preserve some vanishing varieties!

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.150
Have a lot of fun choosing your fruit tree varieties!

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.800
I hope this information will help you make the best decision, so plant your fruit trees,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.180
and Grow Organic for Life!
