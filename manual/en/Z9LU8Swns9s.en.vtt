00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:05.990
Hello and welcome to sharmilazkitchen. Today
I'm going to show you how to make Chicken

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.159
Roll. Chicken roll is one of the popular street-food
originated from Kolkata. This is the roll where

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:16.240
Juicy morsels of spicy chicken are wrapped
in Paratha that has been coated with egg.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.830
Basically it has two basic parts. One is making paratha
and another is inner chicken stuffing. Once

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.710
they are ready, all you need to do is assemble
the rolls and serve! So let's start.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.430
First I'm gonna marinade the chicken cubes.
Here I have 500 gm boneless chicken cubes.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.430
Add salt, lime juice, whipped yogurt, turmeric
powder, red chili powder, tandoori chicken

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:49.390
masala, mustard oil, chopped green chilies
and ginger garlic paste over the chicken pieces

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.879
and rub altogether. I have added tandoori
chicken masala because I want to keep the

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.980
recipe very simple. This tandoori masala has
a unique combination of all aromatic spices

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.550
which we need for this recipe. So you don't
need to put extra effort of adding cumin, coriander

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.550
and other masala powders separately and this
masala will really give a nice taste like

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.690
kebab.
Also add the chopped coriander leaves and

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.970
mix well again. Check the measurement of the
ingredients in my website www. sharmilazkitchen.com.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.970
Marinate for at least 30 minutes.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.140
While chicken is resting, let's make the dough for paratha.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.140
The dough needs very basic ingredients. plain
flour, salt, sugar and enough water.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.200
Knead the dough until you get a smooth dough.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.200
Now you can go ahead with plain
paratha but my first choice for this roll is lachcha paratha

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.300
because it is more crispier
and flaky paratha and tastes just awesome.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.300
Divide into equal roundels or balls.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.569
The roundels will be slightly bigger than normal roti roundels.
Roll into big circle.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:34.099
Stretch it to make a big roti.

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:41.099
Then apply a tsp of oil evenly on the top. Either use your hands
or a brush to spread. Sprinkle a tsp of flour

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.620
and again spread evenly.
Now start making fleets. After fully done,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.010
twist and coil (roll) to make a flat round.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.800
Rest for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.800
In the meantime, lets cook the chicken.
Take a pan and heat 2 tbsp oil.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:19.569
Once the oil is hot, add onion.

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.659
When they are golden brown
in color, add marinated chicken.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.600
Give a good sautÃ© to incorporate altogether.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.819
Cover and
cook. After 4-5 minutes of cooking on slow

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.139
flame, the chicken will leave its own juices.
So you don't need to add water as They will

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.709
cook with these juices.

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:55.700
At the end of cooking add onion rings and capsicum.
Give a final saute and take out.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:04.569
I have added them at the end of cooking because I want them little bit cooked but still get a crunch/ bite.

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.819
Chicken filling is done. Now just roll the
paratha but be careful this time as too much

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.180
pressure can remove the layers.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:20.180
Place the paratha on the heated pan.
Beat the egg well with a little salt and keep

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.610
aside.
Apply oil. When one side is fully cooked and

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.610
other side is halfway remove from the pan.
Add oil again on the tawa and

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:51.450
Pour beaten egg and spread by tilting the pan from side to side.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:06.950
Now quickly put a Paratha onto the still 'wet' egg and allow to cook. Press to cook inside.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.800
The egg will soon cook and 'set'.  Vegetarian can skip this step and put the stuffing directly in paratha.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.400
Flip the parantha over to the other side and cook till both sides are evenly fried.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.400
Remove the fried parantha from tawa . Keep aside.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.620
Place a tissue paper or foil and

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.030
over this place a parantha  and lay a portion of the cooked

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.840
chicken pieces in a straight line in the middle
of the parantha.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.840
Put sliced onions, cucumber on the chicken cubes. Add tomato

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:53.030
sauce and sprinkle chat masala. chopped green chillies. Finally squeeze the lime juice on the chicken cubes.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:02.340
Roll the parantha with the chicken stuffing
firmly so that the chicken cubes do not fall.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:15.210
Now your chicken roll is ready to give a bite.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.200
You can use paneer or potato cubes instead
of chicken to make Vegetarian Roll

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.200
