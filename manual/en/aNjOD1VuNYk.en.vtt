00:00:49.797 --> 00:00:51.682

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:54.592
Stop, oh hold on, go a little
bit deeper, little bit.

00:00:54.592 --> 00:00:56.400
- No, you have to Triple-X it!

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.371

I don't have the boobs!

00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:36.119
You do it in the boob department,

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.094

00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:38.638

00:01:56.988 --> 00:01:58.801
- We already ain't got much,

00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:00.072

00:02:00.973 --> 00:02:02.001
Where?
- [Cecilia] It's in there.

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:03.036
- That little tiny shit?

00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:04.362
- These women don't know
nothin' 'bout the kitchen, okay?

00:02:04.362 --> 00:02:05.357
- Whatever, I do!

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:07.206
I break it down in the kitchen!

00:02:07.206 --> 00:02:08.791

Caipirinha using Cachaca 51!

00:02:15.922 --> 00:02:19.595
Alright, go ahead, give it a
taste, tell me what you think.

00:02:21.895 --> 00:02:23.683
- Oh my God, I love it.

00:02:23.683 --> 00:02:25.126
- It's good, it's just one of those like,

00:02:25.126 --> 00:02:26.791
for me, because I'm such a lightweight,

00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:28.518
I'll drink one and I'm like (snores).

00:02:28.518 --> 00:02:30.205
- Well you can drink one
of these and pass out?

00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:31.383
- Um, I wouldn't pass out,

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:32.846
but I'm definitely
gonna be a little loopy.

00:02:32.846 --> 00:02:34.695
- Could you do a little
Brazilian Carnival Dance?

00:02:34.695 --> 00:02:36.076

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:37.805

00:02:58.883 --> 00:03:02.784
To our future, to our kids,
little Black-Russian babies.

00:03:02.784 --> 00:03:04.328
- I'm not sure about that.

00:03:04.328 --> 00:03:07.258
- (laughs) May they run
the Kremlin! (laughs)

00:03:08.076 --> 00:03:09.661
- Can more we toast? (laughs)

00:03:09.661 --> 00:03:10.361
'Cause like scary--

00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:11.397
