00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
So what you're saying is:

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.020
wasAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:15.420
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.876
AAAAAAAAAaaaaaaabi.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.180
[WTF Theme Music]

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.254
Ok so: Amber, if you guys don't know Amber

00:00:23.254 --> 00:00:25.535
Umm Amber runs a laundromat around the corner from here

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.260
YES

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.800
Best dry-cleaning in town

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.300
YES!

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.260
$5 in one day! BOOYAH!

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.200
2 minutes!

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.914
She'll even provide you with the bubble tea

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.620
No. Amber's from F(x)

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.994
which you already knew

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:36.414
Hi guys! I'm Amber from F(x)

00:00:36.414 --> 00:00:39.554
I'm gonna make Simon &amp; Martina's life a misery today

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:40.696
So here's what I'd like to know

00:00:40.696 --> 00:00:42.174
When you were travelling in Japan

00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:43.555
And you were on your way back

00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:47.114
What were you thinking when you picked up these particular treats for us?

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:49.234
Well, I was buying like, my friends, like

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:50.260
Pastries, and like

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.954
OH PASTRIES

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:51.454
Yeah, and

00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:52.494
The nice things

00:00:52.494 --> 00:00:53.313
The nice things, and I just

00:00:53.313 --> 00:00:54.735
sort of came across this, and I was like

00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:55.843
Simon and Martina.

00:00:55.843 --> 00:00:57.096
There's Green Tea Kit Kats

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.980
You could've got...TWO Kit Kats

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.420
That would've been nicer

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.220
than WASABI flavoured Kit Kats

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.736
Have you tried these before?

00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:05.463
No, I actually haven't

00:01:05.463 --> 00:01:07.340
I wanted to save that for

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.736
the experience that we can share together

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.540
Alright.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.155
This is a first for all of us?

00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:11.655
Yes....

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.260
*romantic music*

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.275
Am I allowed to be here?

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:17.195
I love you girl

00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:18.649
I love you too snuggle ducky

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:19.683
You're the best

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:21.795
I feel like something's come between us

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.180
Something...braaaaahhhhh

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.774
So here's my suggestion for how we try these

00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:28.594
Umm I think we do a traditional Kai Bai Bo showdown

00:01:28.594 --> 00:01:30.415
And the loser has to try it first

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:32.494
Simon is a Cheater McCheaterson

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.920
So we have to keep a careful eye on -

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.623
SEE? Look at him

00:01:35.623 --> 00:01:37.074
He's trying to think of a way to cheat

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.140
They make a valid point.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.674
Thank you!

00:01:39.674 --> 00:01:40.454
Ok ready?

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.940
KAI BAI BO!

00:01:42.348 --> 00:01:42.848
I win.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.120
I call upon the power of F(x)

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.220
to guide me~~~ Haiyooooo~~~

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.195
I'll actually CALL them

00:01:49.195 --> 00:01:50.695
I took the power of F(x)

00:01:50.695 --> 00:01:52.014
You have to pick a new group, I'm sorry

00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:53.995
Ok ready? Here we go

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.440
KAI BAI BO!

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:57.695
YESSS!!!

00:01:58.954 --> 00:02:00.234
F(x) you failed me!

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.560
Alright.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.780
Give me a break, give me a break

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.540
Break me a piece of that Kit Kat bar!

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.740
-

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.715
I can't open these

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:13.815
It's gonna damage my nails

00:02:13.816 --> 00:02:15.896
See? It's harder than expected

00:02:15.896 --> 00:02:16.629
Should've just ripped them -

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:17.549
There's an easy -

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:18.542
Look: Right here

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.280
Oh my god.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.294
Whoooaaa See how easy that was?

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.860
SCIENCE!!

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.194
Oh these are so tiny!

00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:28.703
Are you saying you want TWO of them at once?

00:02:28.703 --> 00:02:29.203
No!

00:02:29.203 --> 00:02:30.043
That's what I just heard

00:02:30.043 --> 00:02:31.360
Noooooo I did not say that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.390
That looks like fermented mayo

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.870
This doesn't smell great, I'll be honest

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.090
Ok here I go. Ready?

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.180
It's fine!

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.929
I'm actually really curious now. I'm gonna try one

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:55.330
We should both try one. See what it's like

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.560
Who would do this?

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.755
That's what I'm saying!

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:06.475
Where the hell is yours?!

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480
I dunno?

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.460
We invite other people over to play

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.720
And they don't play with us!!

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.215
I'm gonna call your mom.

00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:14.635
Ok I'm gonna eat it now.

00:03:14.635 --> 00:03:15.735
Eat it. Go for it. One shot

00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:17.195
The whole thing

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.020
I'm gonna describe it after Amber gets a chance to

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.640
Yeah?

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.400
See?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.469
Lay in the bed that you've made!

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.140
It's sweet

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.460
and creamy

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.220
but you can taste

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.720
encompassing peppery

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.754
When you first try it

00:03:33.754 --> 00:03:35.575
You're actually like, Oh this isn't that bad

00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:37.313
And then it - when the wasabi kicks in,

00:03:37.313 --> 00:03:38.150
you're kinda just like

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.376
Why would you put these together?

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.200
I was really hoping this would be delicious.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.342
They did a good job doing the wasabi part

00:03:43.342 --> 00:03:44.620
It just tastes like an eraser

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.840
They didn't do a good job on the Kit Kat part

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.555
Amber's had a lot of erasers before.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.620
So she knows

00:03:49.753 --> 00:03:51.273
She eats them non-stop

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.420
F of x

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.534
bracket....maths...

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.660
...erasing...

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.090
but when no one's looking she goes

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.980
I'm really honoured that you came here

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.734
and you want to bring us some candy

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.660
We thought of you as well

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.794
And we have some special candy we want you to try today too

00:04:07.794 --> 00:04:10.495
So when we were overseas for our European tour

00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:13.155
We fell in love with this one candy that we had in Norway

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.960
Oh "Fell in love"?

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.904
Yes. We actually brought back some extra candy with us

00:04:16.904 --> 00:04:19.040
This is called 'salmiakkis'

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.180
So this is very popular in Sweden, Norway, and Finland

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.035
It's like, a lot of places in Europe

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.520
Yes. So people LOVE these candies

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.260
Grab one

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.135
I'd never had anything like this before

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:30.487
and then it just became addictive

00:04:30.487 --> 00:04:32.249
So you just stick the whole thing in your mouth

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:34.054
and then you can kinda nibble on it or chew it

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.220
3, 2, 1

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.720
In you go!!

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.460
Can I wash that down with a Wasabi Kit Kat?

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.940
Yes you can do that

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.796
Isn't that the most awful thing you've had in a long time?

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:56.834
Describe the taste, Amber!

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.260
IT'S HORRIBLE!!

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.120
Describe the taste!

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.620
It's horribleeee

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.460
Isn't it like punishment candy?

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.100
I WANNA GO HOME

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.060
I wanna go homeee

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.820
What is this made out of?

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.814
It's actually licorice

00:05:08.814 --> 00:05:10.775
It's the tears of children, is what it's made out of

00:05:10.775 --> 00:05:13.193
But here's the thing, it's SALTED licorice

00:05:13.193 --> 00:05:15.555
I think your manager right there wants some

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.860
I see it in his eyes

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:17.374
He really

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.380
Oppa!

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.645
He really wants to try this

00:05:19.645 --> 00:05:20.495
'Try eating this'

00:05:20.495 --> 00:05:21.615
It's from Norway

00:05:21.615 --> 00:05:22.954
'It's very delicious'

00:05:23.744 --> 00:05:25.184
'It's NOT delicious'

00:05:32.254 --> 00:05:34.494
Aaaah that is the worst thing ever

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.240
I can see doors slamming

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.057
I just saw your car drive off

00:05:39.057 --> 00:05:42.491
And your manager rolled down the window and he put up the middle finger

00:05:43.873 --> 00:05:46.033
We got so many variations of this

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.374
Eating a super salmiakki bar

00:05:47.374 --> 00:05:47.915
and then being like

00:05:49.236 --> 00:05:50.836
and super salmiakki gum

00:05:50.836 --> 00:05:51.416
and being like

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.320
you mean there's more of this stuff??!

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.540
There's all flavours - it's -

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.460
it's LOVED

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.758
I'm not joking. This is ultra popular

00:05:58.794 --> 00:05:59.754
I respect that

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.560
I respect your decision but politely

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.720
I will reject it.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.400
Yes

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.633
We decline your super salmiakki offer.

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:09.420
So thank you for coming in and doing a Wonderful Treasure Find -

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.994
I'm never coming back here again!

00:06:10.994 --> 00:06:12.234
I'd had a feeling that

00:06:12.234 --> 00:06:13.575
The next time you go through Japan,

00:06:13.575 --> 00:06:14.803
and if you find any other -

00:06:14.803 --> 00:06:16.603
Edible Underpants, I believe you saw?

00:06:16.603 --> 00:06:17.563
Oh yeah.

00:06:17.563 --> 00:06:18.360
Think of us.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.336
Oh, oh, Of course.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.520
Think of us~~

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.040
Well that's it for this week's Wonderful Treasure Find

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.969
Thanks for being tortured with us!
