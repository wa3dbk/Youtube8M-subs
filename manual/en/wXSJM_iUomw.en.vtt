00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:03.893
People, let's go to the
famous "Quick Change" Game!

00:00:03.893 --> 00:00:07.030
Who knows the "Quick Change" Game?
Change!

00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:10.525
Change!

00:00:12.184 --> 00:00:13.987
It's the "Quick Change" Game,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:13.987 --> 00:00:20.245
three will play. Cris plays,
Daniel plays, Elidio plays.

00:00:21.332 --> 00:00:24.075
Every time I say "change" they change

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:26.328
the last thing they said, okay?

00:00:26.328 --> 00:00:31.396
They change that last thing, they change
the meaning of what they said.

00:00:31.396 --> 00:00:34.533
People from the middle,
I need a place!

00:00:37.843 --> 00:00:41.418
Fireman! Did someone say fireman?

00:00:41.418 --> 00:00:44.180
Who said fireman?
You said fireman.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.487
It wasn't Andy who told you
"say fireman."

00:00:47.487 --> 00:00:49.044
All right. Fireman is good.

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:56.579
Fireman, "Quick Change" Game,
Daniel, Cris and Elidio, go.

00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:01.244
Are you ready for the
firefighting training?

00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:12.042
What the fuck?

00:01:13.303 --> 00:01:15.926
I was expecting
so much more from you!

00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:18.354
- Let's begin sliding down the pole!
- Change!

00:01:18.354 --> 00:01:20.557
- Let's begin holding the hose!
- Change!

00:01:20.557 --> 00:01:23.741

00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:35.664
Sir!
I think now it's for real!

00:01:35.664 --> 00:01:37.665

00:01:37.665 --> 00:01:40.302
- No, that's a false alarm!
- Change!

00:01:40.302 --> 00:01:43.469
Let's hurry!

00:01:43.652 --> 00:01:44.700
Get in the car!

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.900

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.500

I'll stay here!

00:01:50.713 --> 00:01:52.084
- Very well!
- Change!

00:01:52.084 --> 00:01:53.900
Oh, no, you're coming!

- Turn on the siren!
- Change!

00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:00.962

00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:10.445
- Oh, I'm here!
- Change!

00:02:10.445 --> 00:02:14.485
I want to jump on
that big round thing!

00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:16.696
- Sir!
- Change!

00:02:16.696 --> 00:02:19.835
- Ma'am!
- Change!

00:02:20.897 --> 00:02:23.986
Gentlemen, calm down...

00:02:23.986 --> 00:02:26.673
How do you want me to be calm,
there's a fire here!

00:02:26.673 --> 00:02:27.600
Change!

00:02:27.842 --> 00:02:33.035
How do you want me to be calm,
there's a fire here!

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:06.653
