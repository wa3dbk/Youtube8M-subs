00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.200
Hi I'm Mat from eSpares.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.230
In this video I'll be looking at noisy
spinning

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.780
or shaking on spin in a washing machine.
The first place you need to check if

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.119
this is happening with your machine

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.990
is to make sure the machine is level.
If you machine rocks

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.609
such as this you need to adjust the feet
from underneath.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.910
Most manufacturers have adjustable feet
at the bottom

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.070
Now have a nice

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.920
level machine.
The next thing to check is to put the machine

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.860
on an empty spin cycle.
If you machine makes a grinding noise

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.570
or shaking excessively that's likely to
be an issue with the bearings

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.780
eSpares has an additional video for
best how to deal with that.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.420
However if I put

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.420
one wet towel into the machine and put
it on a spin cycle.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.590
You can't hear

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.740
the machine struggling to balance out
the load

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.850
within the drum. 
What I'm going to this take the top off

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.100
never do this at home, this is in a
controlled environment and is for

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.190
demonstration purposes only but I want
you to see what's happening inside the

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.700
machine.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.979
Here we have

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.510
the concrete weight which helps to give
the drum inertia

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.729
so there isn't too much movement you can
see the two suspension springs

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.490
which suspend the drum from the chassis
the machine and underneath are two dampers

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.500
which helped to control the movement of
the drum. that you frequently putting an

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.590
unbalanced load into a washing machine
and there's lots of movement happening

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.330
inside

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.369
this can hammer the bearings causing
you to have to repair those.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.149
Or can shake  the concrete weights free.

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.600
Now the machine has found a balance load so
it's going into a faster spin cycle

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.600
if it doesn't it will stop and re start and  work
at a slower speed.

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.860
What I'm now  going do is undo the bolts on
the weight on the top of the drum

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.150
just you can hear what a loose weight 
sounds like.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.840
Now if you're hearing that noise in your
machine and obviously you can still see

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.800
the drum shaking violently

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.959
this is easy to fix. 
Simply tighten up these nuts here,

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.750
put the machine into a spin cycle
and give it a test.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.420
What I'm going to do now is to put
three towles

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.450
into the machine.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.140
This should be a much more balanced load

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.390
and easier for the machine to deal with.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.060
Now that machine has a balance load you
can hear that it's fitting much more

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.750
effectively

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.460
incomes up to a spin speed far quicker
as you can see there is some movement in

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.120
the machine

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.070
but this is perfectly normaly the
suspension springs and dampers

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:10.070
underneath help to maintain that balance
drum

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:11.959
A balance load

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.939
isn't something that manufactures touch
on into great detail but as well worth

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:16.909
keeping in mind.

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.400
If you washing heavy items put them
together jeans

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.549
jumpers how's that sort of thing help to
balance out the loading your machine

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.150
stop excessive shaky and excessive noise
and save you

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.939
time and money in the long run.
