Hi, I'm Rachel for Expert Village. The 2nd
one we are going to make marble. All we do

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:26.390
is put the dough inside here and I'm going
to take 1/3 of it

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:42.030
and sprinkle about a teaspoon of cocoa and
just mix it inside. It is better to do is

00:00:42.030 --> 00:01:08.520
by hand it is easier. If you used white flour
it is going to show better of course.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.649
What we do now is take this in here and this
one on top. We are just going to roll them

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:53.711
together. When you are going to cook this
it is a little bit more sticky but here we

00:01:53.711 --> 00:02:21.030
go it is sticking on the mandel bread and
I'm going to put it in the tray.
