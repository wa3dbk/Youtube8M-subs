00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.080
Hi. This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.139
I'm going to show you how to quickly
place a tattoo onto someone,

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.910
wrap it around the contours of the
skin and even change its color.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.020
You can apply these to text, as well.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.119
If you'd like to use this font, 
I provided its link in the video

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.320
description or project files.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.370
Before we begin, 
you should have two documents ready.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.649
One is the photo you'd like to use for
your subject

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.440
and the other is a black and white
design for the tattoo.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.020
If you'd like to use this design, I provided

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.030
its link, as well. If the tattoo wraps around

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.660
any part of your subject 
such as the arm in this example,

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.910
you need to make a selection of the arm
to ensure that the tattoo will be

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.399
confined to that area.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.160
There are many ways to make selections
and I covered them in many of my

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.300
tutorials.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.939
Once you make your selection, 
to see it as a quick mask,

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.179
press Q on your keyboard. Since I'll be
placing the tattoo on the

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:16.219
upper arm, I make sure the selection
surrounds that entire area.

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.249
Go to Select and Save Selection.

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:23.590
When this window pops up, just click OK.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.099
To delete the selection, press Ctrl + D

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:32.500
on a PC or Cmd + D on a Mac.
Make a copy of the layer

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.999
by pressing Ctrl or Cmd + J. We'll use this
copy to make a displacement map.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.400
The displacement map will wrap the tattoo

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.630
around the contours of your subject
based on your subject's

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.630
shadows, midtones and highlights. Since
displacement maps work best when they're

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.880
slightly blurred,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.069
go to Filter, Blur and Gaussian Blur.

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.429
I'll blur this image 3 pixels.

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.689
Go to File and Save As.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:12.689
Save it to your desktop. 
Name it "Displacement" as a PSD file.

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:17.959
Then, click "Save".  If you see this window,

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.790
click OK. Now we can trash the blurred layer

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.370
since we don't need anymore. 
Open your tattoo design.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.599
We need to make a selection of the shape, so we can cut it out from its background.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.969
One of the quickest ways to separate
black and white

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:38.700
is to use your Magic Wand Tool. 
Make the Tolerance 5 pixels,

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.799
make sure Anti-Alias is checked

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.329
and Contiguous is unchecked.  Click

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.129
anywhere on the tattoo. 
This created a selection

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.750
of everything that's black. To cut the
design out from its background

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.909
and copy it to its own layer, press

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.030
Ctrl or Cmd + J.  To get it

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.049
onto your subject, open your Move Tool
by pressing "v"

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.810
on your keyboard. Then, drag it up onto
the tab of your subject.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.290
Without releasing your mouse or pen, 
drag it down

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.100
onto the image and then release.
To resize and position it,

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.189
open your Transform Tool by pressing
Ctrl

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.359
or Cmd + T.  Go to a corner

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:30.230
and when you see a curved, double-arrow,
rotate it to an angle you like.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.609
To reposition it, click inside and move it.

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.109
Continue until you're happy with its angle,

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.230
size and position.
Then, press Enter or Return.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.829
The tattoo will blend in better with the skin

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.310
if it's slightly blurred. So go to Filter,

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.319
Blur and Gaussian Blur. We'll blur it 1 pixel.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.480
Then, click OK. Next,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.260
we'll use the displacement map to conform
the shape of the tattoo to the contours

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.159
of the arm.  Go to Filter, Distort

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:11.200
and Displace. We'll displace the
Horizontal and Vertical scales by 10,

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.370
choose Stretch To Fit 
and Repeat Edge Pixels.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.509
Click OK 
and click the Displacement PSD file.

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.930
Then, click "Open".

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.970
As I toggle back and forth, 
you can see that the shape

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.800
adjusted itself based on the tonal values
of the arm.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.380
Next, we'll hide the parts the tattoo
that extend beyond the

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.550
outside of the arm. Ctrl-click

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.599
or Cmd-click on the thumbnail of the
tattoo to make a selection of shape.

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:47.509
Open the Channels panel, go to "Alpha 1"

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.800
and press Ctrl + Shift + Alt on a PC

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.080
or Cmd + Shift + Opt on a Mac
as you click on it.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.840
This deletes the selection outside the arm.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.030
Open back up the Layers panel and click
on the layer mask icon to make a layer

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.599
mask of the selection.

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.639
next to the tattoo

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.949
Next, we'll blend the tattoo onto the skin.

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.560
First, change the blend mode to Soft Light

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.400
and make a composite snapshot of your
image by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Alt + E

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.120
on a PC or Cmd + Shift + Opt + E

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.270
on a Mac.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.690
Make a copy of it.  Go to the layer mask

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.160
and press and hold Alt a PC 
or Opt on a Mac

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.060
as you drag a copy of it
next to the top layer.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.349
Click on a thumbnail to make it active
and click on the adjustment layer icon.

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.870
Choose Hue/Saturation

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.889
and click the Clip-to-Layer icon.

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.099
This clips or restricts the adjustment layer

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.419
to effect just the one layer beneath it.

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:05.370
I'll reduce the Saturation to minus 30.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.360
Keep in mind, since every photo is different, you may want to adjust the

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.610
numbers we'll be using 
in the adjustment layers.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.819
For this photo, 
I'll change the Lightness to minus 40.

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.060
Many at the tattoo tutorials that I've
seen up to this point

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.990
use "Multiply" for the blend mode, but I
find that this blend mode dulls the tones

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.889
and nuances of the skin

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.700
under the tattoo. As I toggle back and forth,

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:36.680
you can see the difference.  If you want
to change the color of the tattoo,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.110
experiment with the sliders to get just
the color you want.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.870
Using these simple techniques, 
have fun creating realistic tattoos.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.300
This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV.
Thanks for watching!
