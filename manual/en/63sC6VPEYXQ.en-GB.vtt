00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:12.734
Hello and welcome once more to RuneLabs.

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:16.415
This month we've got some very important information about the future of RuneLabs

00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:19.358
and Mod Osborne is here to help you write the perfect pitch.

00:00:19.428 --> 00:00:23.559
But first up Mod Avatar is here to take us to the depths of the afterlife.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.611
This year's Halloween event was suggested by Cinder Quill.

00:00:26.713 --> 00:00:29.201
It was the Icthlarin vs Amascut event.

00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:32.192
There's a lot of cool characters and cool lore surrounding it.

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:36.736
We're well underway with the prototyping of the event now. We've got some good ideas and decent designs.

00:00:36.844 --> 00:00:41.818
We've been talking to Cinder Quill quite a lot over the last few weeks and the events really come together.

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:45.120
This year's Halloween event is in the underworld.

00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:49.696
We've not been there before but there have been some books in game that describe the area itself.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:55.451
So we use those when we sent it over to our concept guys and they've done a really awesome job.

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.709
It's got some really cool-looking statues and gargoyles

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.868
which are modelled after Icthlarin and Amascut, the jackal and the lion.

00:01:04.076 --> 00:01:08.662
The place itself has got one island at the bottom

00:01:08.673 --> 00:01:11.188
and it's going to have the holding area for the event.

00:01:11.256 --> 00:01:13.588
Then we've got the bridge over the river Noumenon.

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:20.743
The river Noumenon is where the souls of the undead need to cross to be taken into the afterlife.

00:01:21.108 --> 00:01:24.171
During the event you're going to be fighting Amascut's Devourers.

00:01:24.255 --> 00:01:28.156
They're their devouring souls in the underworld and you're there to stop them.

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:32.562
As well as the Devourers, you're going to be facing off against Amascuts avatar.

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:37.320
That's going to be at the gates of the underworld and Icthlarin is holding the gates shut

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:40.973
until the time when he's ready to take all the souls through

00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:43.784
and then everyone's going to have to face off against the avatar.

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:51.419
The next main stages of development are going into the lore and a lot of the characters we want to get involved in it.

00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:55.027
We've been doing a lot of mechanical and structural stuff to the event so far.

00:01:55.038 --> 00:01:59.334
We wanted to get that down and make sure that the core of the event was good fun.

00:01:59.763 --> 00:02:01.477
But now we're really happy with that.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:05.846
We're now going to start going around it and tying it altogether with some really cool lore and story.

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:12.142
Since February RuneLabs has seen large updates, medium updates, events, new mobs, new quests and a whole lot more.

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.630
But this month we're making some changes to the system.

00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:18.664
We managed to track down Mod Kelpie to find out how the changes will affect you guys.

00:02:19.167 --> 00:02:24.821
Not too long ago Mod Osborne sent out some feedback surveys around to the players to gauge their interest in RuneLabs.

00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:28.049
The responses we got across the board were very indifferent.

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:30.511
Therefore we're going to change things up for next year.

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:33.117
So for the time being RuneLabs is in an open period.

00:02:33.128 --> 00:02:38.199
You can suggest and support whatever you like and you can be assured we're keeping an eye on all your cool and crazy ideas.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.628
Smaller suggestions that we like may be included in relevant projects or be done as ninja fixes.

00:02:44.754 --> 00:02:48.289
Larger projects may influence our planned releases in the future.

00:02:48.583 --> 00:02:52.485
A good example is the current highest supported suggestion on RuneLabs

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.155
and that is adding blood dyes to treasure trails.

00:02:55.324 --> 00:02:58.602
We've a small graphical requirement and just a bit of plugging in to do.

00:02:58.613 --> 00:03:01.010
I'm sure you can expect to see it in the near future.

00:03:01.436 --> 00:03:06.246
So it's now going to be more important than ever that you write the most kick-ass pitch possible.

00:03:06.326 --> 00:03:12.084
And luckily for you, the one and only Mod Osborne is here with tips on writing a pitch that will help you stand out from the crowd.

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:17.994
Although if you all follow these tips, then you'll be from a different crowd, in the same crowd, together.

00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:19.459
Anyway, here he is!

00:03:19.676 --> 00:03:24.158
I'm here to give you the top 5 tips about how to get your RuneLabs idea noticed and in game.

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:25.353
Five.

00:03:25.367 --> 00:03:27.888
Find a way to summarise your idea with a hook.

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:30.081
Focus on what everybody can get behind.

00:03:30.092 --> 00:03:35.036
If you feel this removes some detail or complexity from your idea, add them as stretch goals at the end of your post.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.146
Four.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.696
Get the community behind it.

00:03:37.707 --> 00:03:40.835
Take to Reddit, your clan, forums, or even tweet a JMod.

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:42.732
Get them all to champion your idea.

00:03:42.743 --> 00:03:44.741
If your idea is good, people will flock to it.

00:03:44.752 --> 00:03:47.065
Images in particular will get your idea seen.

00:03:47.398 --> 00:03:48.324
Three.

00:03:48.377 --> 00:03:51.985
If you have a cool reward, make it a separate RuneLabs suggestion.

00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:55.861
We're always on the lookout for cool rewards, and they get lost in another suggestion.

00:03:56.165 --> 00:03:57.039
Two.

00:03:57.314 --> 00:03:58.692
Don't use tricks.

00:03:58.703 --> 00:04:04.082
If you manage to get your idea to the top of RuneLabs with a title like "Support my idea and get a P-hat", we'll remove it.

00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:05.900
And you'll run out of bank pretty quickly.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.103
One.

00:04:07.144 --> 00:04:10.206
Think about the original, the imaginative and the left field.

00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:14.256
We're loving your ninja fixes and quest sequels, but we'd like to see more outlandish ideas.

00:04:14.267 --> 00:04:19.290
If you have a wild idea that changes the way people play, put it on RuneLabs and see what happens.

00:04:19.976 --> 00:04:22.848
Well, that's about it for another episode of RuneLabs.

00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:29.298
Remember, we're not looking for any set criteria, so now is the time to submit all your weird and wonderful ideas.

00:04:29.367 --> 00:04:34.940
And if you follow those suggestions from Mod Osborne, hopefully it won't be long till we see them in the game.

00:04:35.497 --> 00:04:37.068
See you next time!
