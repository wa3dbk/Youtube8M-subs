00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.040
Today we have a 2011 Hyundai Accent and we
are going to show you how to install a trailer

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.200
hitch step-by-step.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.320
We have a draw-tite 1-1/4 hitch, part number
24760.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.470
Before we get started with our installation,
we are going to give you a couple of measurements

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.199
to be useful when selecting accessories to
go with your hitch.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.939
From our hitch pin hole to the outermost part
of our bumper measures 5-1/4.

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.479
Our height measurement from the ground to
the top of the inside of the receiver tube

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:30.769
measures 10-3/4.

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.950
Now we can get started with our installation,
first what we need to do is identify the locations

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.940
where we are going to attach our hardware.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.000
On the outboard side of the frame over here
on the driver side, theres a hole here and

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.290
inside theres a weld nut sitting with this
hole here, that means these are going to be

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.030
our attachment points for the flange on the
driver side.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.100
On this particular vehicle things are the
exact same on the passenger side, so on the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.960
other side of the frame, well use these same
outdoor weld nuts for our attachment points.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.760
At our attachment points we are going to use
this as our hardware.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.439
Weve got a bolt a split-lock washer and a
flat washer.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.020
Well take our bolt, slip on our split-lock
washer, slip on our flat washer, and thats

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:30.399
the hardware assembly that we are going to
use 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:57.990
to mount 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:24.639
our hitch.
