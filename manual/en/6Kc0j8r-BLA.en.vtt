Hi! I'm Louis Ortiz on behalf of Expert Village
and I've showed you the basic preparation

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.080
steps for Hollandaise and we are going to
go ahead and get started. I've got 2 egg yolks

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:19.260
that I am going to throw in the bowl. I'm
going to do half a tablespoon of just regular

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:28.460
water, a tiny bit more there. Okay. I'm going
to do just a pinch of salt which is really

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.500
kind of just a quarter turn of my salt grinder
there and I am going to squeeze just a little

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.260
bit of lemon juice; a few drops in there to
give it some character. So I am going to go

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:51.339
ahead and whip these egg yolks on with the
water, a little bit of salt I have inside.

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.730
I've got this fire on a very low frame. Just
have steam coming up from underneath side.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.880
I just want a gentle heat. Okay, you don't
want to simmer, you don't want to boil; just

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.880
steam coming up from underneath this bowl.
So I've got some warm clarified butter here

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:14.140
and all I'm going to do is just drizzle that
into the egg yolks, slowly. You don't want

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:23.380
to just dump it in there. I'm mixing the whole
time and again, just drizzle. What we are

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:34.100
doing is we are creating an emulsion. An emulsion
occurs when you got two unmixable things and

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.131
you have to mix them together. So something
like that as you can imagine has to be slowly

00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:45.500
and gently in a sense and it has to be done
with care so that the items will separate

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.600
and break. So again I am just drizzling this
warm clarified butter in there slowly and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.670
to focus on getting all just one color usually
is try to instruct people to do because that

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.130
way you know all the ingredients has been
mixed correctly and perhaps Â¾ tablespoon

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.450
of water that I put in there is really kind
of a buffer in that sense. While I try to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:27.900
mix these two main ingredients together which
of course is the clarified butter. The sauce

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.049
and the butter in that sense is just to have
some acid ingredients in there so that it

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:44.909
will cut through these very rich flavors of
butter and the egg yolk.

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:52.099
Again, I've got my flame on the lowest setting.
I'm just going to do this nice and gentle.

00:02:52.099 --> 00:03:04.909
The clarified butter itself is warm to the
touch, not hot.

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:12.700
As you can see from the color, we've got this
nice rich yellow. The sauce itself is starting

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:22.140
to kind of thicken. So we are going to put
a little bit more butter in there. We are

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.720
starting to get this thickness going as you
can see in the pan with a mixing bowl rather.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.640
As it starts to get thick and gain some body
we can actually add clarified butter a little

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:39.439
bit more quickly now and mix that in together.
Again, I just used 2 egg yolks but you can

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:44.830
2, 3, 4, or 5. It is just going to require
a whole lot more clarified butter if you decide

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:52.629
to use that many egg yolks. So we've got a
good emulsion going. We'll come right back

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.319
and show you how to flavor this at the very
end and what kind of consistency we are looking

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.480
for. We are just about done.
