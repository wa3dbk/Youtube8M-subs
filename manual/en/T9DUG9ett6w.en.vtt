00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.670
Well I've just picked up the new 200 series,
and you'll never guess where I'm taking it.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.779
Well, I tell you what, I liked that other
vehicle, that other 200 of mine, so much I

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:19.999
thought maybe Simon could drive that one,
and maybe I'll get this silver one chopped.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.940
So I'm just pulling into Creative Conversions.
And Len from Creative Conversions is going

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.900
to chop my car in half again. And we're gonna
show you what goes into chopping a car in

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.900
half. Especially a brand new 200 series.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.420
Where do you want me to start cutting?

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.160
With that?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.040
Yeah.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.740
I suppose that's why they call it a conversion.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.400
That's right.

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.309
Oh well, remember, look it's brand spanking
new. There's not a mark on it. So what exactly

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.760
are you going to do to convert this thing
into a ute?

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.969
Well, we're going to take all the interior
out of it.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.049
So strip all the guts out of it.

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:03.949
And then we're going to cut the back of it
off. Weld some bits in. Extend the chassis

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:04.989
out. And away you go.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.140
All right. Get to work, mate.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.780
Now they've actually cut the entire chassis
in half and taken the rear end of the truck

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.360
backwards, that way. And this is where it
gets really scary for me, but these guys do

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.400
it day in day out. And this is where they
put that space in. So if you have a look here,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.580
I'll show you. I've got this little camera
here.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.200
And there it is.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.680
My car's in two pieces. So they're actually
going to stick 650 millimetres into the chassis.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:54.110
650. Weld at that end. Weld it on that end.
And the car, well, it becomes longer.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.800
She's starting to take shape. Now it's all
back together. So they've put all their strengthening

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.580
gutter plates in. And now they're going to
start work on what goes in here. They've got

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.330
this big toolbox that goes in here, and then
they can start looking at lengthening all

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.420
the wires at the back. Because remember, 650mm
has gone into the chassis of this car. So

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.740
it's coming together nicely.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.960
So what Creative Conversions do is they pre-fabricate
all the parts. You can see here, I've got

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.500
all the parts here. This will be the parts
for the toolbox by the look of it. They go

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.000
down in here. They get it all pre-fabricated
and then they just basically put the pieces

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.060
together like a meccano set. And then weld
it up. And then it's a matter of doing a bit

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.460
of body work, and then of course, they start
looking at doing the final which is the top

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.780
coat. And blending that silver in.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.450
So as you can see, behind me now, we're in
the paint shop. So it means we're in the final

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.380
stages of the conversion. And this is where
the real magic happens. So Paul behind me,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.700
now this guy is good at what he does. He's
real good. Because this car, when it's finished

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.010
is going to look like it came out of a Toyota
factory. So his job, it's got an undercoat

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.480
there on the back, his job now is to blend
that silver paint job through to the front.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.640
And I can guarantee you won't be able to pick
the difference.
