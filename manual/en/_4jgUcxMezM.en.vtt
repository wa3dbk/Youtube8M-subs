00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.400
Dear sixteen-year-old me

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.920
Dear sixteen-year-old me

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.320
Dear sixteen-year-old me

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.760
Please don't get that perm,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.880
it's not as awesome as you think it's gonna be

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.600
You have to actually practice in order to learn to play guitar

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.240
Whisky tastes even worse on the way up

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.680
Dear sixteen-year-old me,
there's going to be a new set of Star Wars movies

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.800
Don't watch them, they ruin everything

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.360
Dear sixteen-year-old me

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.760
This is where they took the cancer out

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.120
It was something called melanoma

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.040
It's called malignant melanoma

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.640
Malignant melanoma

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.000
'Malignant,' that's not a very friendly word

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You'll be diagnosed when you're twenty-eight

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.760
Eighteen

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.800
Thirty-six

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.480
Twenty-nine

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.240
Twenty-two

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.800
It's a tumour that starts in your skin cells,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.920
the cells that give your hair and skin colour.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.480
It's not just skin cancer

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.920
Well, it is

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.680
Well, it is 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.280
But not just

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.280
The cut it out and it'll be fine kind, unfortunately

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.880
It's the kind you have to catch before it spreads

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.720
Because it spreads so fast

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.800
So fast

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.120
To places like your liver

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.320
Your lungs

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.280
Your brain

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.360
Yours will be a really rare kind in your left eye

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.680
and that's when you'll find out

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.320
That melanoma can show up on your tongue,
the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.160
Your doctors will tell you you're lucky that you caught it early

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.840
Yours will tell you that you need aggressive treatment

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.160
I'll have to tell you it might take a year of chemotherapy

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.760
And you'll need to do some of the injections yourself

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.360
Dear sixteen-year-old me

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.560
You're doing okay

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.600
You're strong

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.520
But there are some things I want you to know

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.000
I wish I'd known

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.080
That one bad sunburn before you turn eighteen

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.400
Doubles your chances of developing melanoma

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.720
That fair skin and red hair
means that you're at a higher risk of getting it

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.000
As if ginger people didn't have enough problems

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
That you're at higher risk if you've got more than fifty moles

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.160
And if you have a weakened immune system
or family history of skin cancer

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.120
I want you to know the outlook is very good if we can catch it early

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.600
But you have less than a ten percent chance
of surviving more than five years if we don't

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.520
Dear sixteen-year-old me

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.920
Spend more time with family, they mean everything

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.000
If I had one piece of advice for you:
don't start the tanning bed

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.480
I know you want a healthy glow

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.840
but it's going to double my chances of getting melanoma

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.760
Sunscreen

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.160
Yes, I agree it's a huge pain in the ass, but so worth it.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.000
Please

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.880
Your skin's like an elephant. It never forgets

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.240
Dear sixteen-year-old me,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.000
helping spread this message is how you'll honour Glenna's memory

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.840
At sixteen she's already an incredible lifeguard,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.600
she loves the sun, and the beach, and tanning

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.400
but she just doesn't know

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.000
She'll be diagnosed when she's twenty-two

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.360
and will lose her battle when she's just twenty-six

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.680
I want you to know

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.040
because it's melanoma that's going
to take the strongest man you know,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.120
your best friend and the love of your life

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.880
Dear sixteen-year-old me

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.560
Don't be afraid, this isn't about being afraid

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.360
I want you to be aware

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.080
That melanoma is a young person's disease

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.160
It is the second most common cancer in children and teenagers

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.320
and one of the most common in young adults

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.800
And it can be deadly

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.280
I want you to know you're not helpless

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.360
This is a cancer that shows itself

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.800
Right there on the outside of you

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.160
Start checking your skin

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.280
Please check

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.800
Get to know your skin

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.000
Get to know your skin

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.400
Start checking your skin

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.920
If a new mole shows up

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.280
Or if one you have starts to change colour

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.160
Or size, or shape

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.480
Or feels different

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.560
If something seems out of place get your doctor
to have a look as soon as possible

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.040
Know what to look for and get help,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.040
these are all signs your skin could be developing cancer

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.760
You brush your teeth everyday, maybe even floss

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.840
Okay, we both know you don't floss

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.440
But just once a month I want you to check

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.280
It takes ten minutes

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.280
Ten minutes

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.080
Dear sixteen-year-old me,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.600
I do realize that you're not actually going to see this

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.640
but someone else will and it'll make a difference to them

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.920
Dear someone else

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.200
Dear somebody else

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200
If you're watching this

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.280
Send it to a sixteen-year-old you care about

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.640
Send it to anyone who was once sixteen

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.080
Or soon will be sixteen, send this

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.840
And check yourself, educate yourself

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.760
