MYA: "Full Time Kid," with Mya.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.816
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:05.220
Hi.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.160
Mya here.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.770
Today, we're going to
make our own thermometer.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.750
Here's what you'll need-- an
empty glass bottle, some food

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.070
coloring, some modeling
clay, a clear straw, one half

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.640
cup of rubbing alcohol,
and one half cup of water.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.600
Pour your water into
the glass bottle.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.350
Now, pour your rubbing
alcohol into the bottle.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.400
Add a few drops
of food coloring.

00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:48.037
Now, mix it, like this.

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:57.600
Insert your straw
into the bottle.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.630
Make sure it doesn't
fall through or touch

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.920
the bottom, just like this.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.530
Now, squish your modeling
clay around the straw.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.505
Make sure not to cover
the top of the straw.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.710
The liquid expands when it's
warm, and moves up the straw.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.420
The liquid contracts when it's
cold, and moves down the straw.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.870
Put your thermometer
in the sun if you

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.120
want to see it in action.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.090
Let's go check it out.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.700
Whoa.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.330
That's cool.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.870
Science is awesome.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.587
Thanks for watching.

00:01:49.587 --> 00:01:53.340
Pour your water into
the glass-- bottle.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.810
Glass-- bottle.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.999
MAN: Say that one more time.

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.499
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.270
Ready?
