00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.260
another Amano their great great great
great great Algiers okay really do a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.530
nice job on the hair algae like this
type stuff that I have into a lot of

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.159
your complaining about algae please know
just because i'm suggesting of the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.189
shrimp is a good alligator doesn't mean
that that's gonna solve your algae

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.320
problems yeah al do you have bigger
issues but nonetheless Amano shrimp do a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.840
great job of eating algae they get big -
oh there's one right that foam they get

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.270
really really rather large come from
Asia I want to say Japan I haven't

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.070
actually looked that up they eat all the
stuff off anubias you see that one going

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.490
off the Nubians anubius by the way gets
a lot of algae because it's a slower

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.009
growing plant so how they can grow on a
faster order to go and they suck at

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.090
peeing on film but great great great
algae eaters can be kept with cardinal

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.750
shrimp which we're going to talk about
here in a minute but the biggest beef I

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.219
have with the mono trim really this is
it they don't breed you can get eggs all

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.459
day like there's a ton of eggs on that
one I was just showing you what you

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.789
can't do they need to go back into
brackish and

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.480
don't come unlike the cherry shrimp the
Amano shrimp don't release shrimp just

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.500
as they are like cherry shrimp you can
just they just hatch eggs and boom you

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.739
got more cherry shrimp Amano shrimp have
to go through a larva stage you have to

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.599
give them to brackish if anyone is
breeding Amano shrimp they are a liar or

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.280
they need to contact me because I want a
ton of them just cuz they're sweet and

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.609
they do a great job I actually had a
bunch of Amano shrimp there's another

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:45.319
one back there in a 55 at work for a
real long time I had like 13 of them and

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.939
I didn't have a speck of algae that I
only had like 3 fish in there but no

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.159
algae there's another one coming at us
here and just really really great great

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:00.200
cleanup crew obviously you don't want to
keep them with rainbows or angel fish if

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.849
they were larger you could try to keep
them with age of it I wouldn't but yeah

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.720
great shrimpy cat try him out especially
you guys that are doing all these small

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.389
tanks give a mono shrimp a try and let
me know and if someone is breeding them

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.470
or is breeding them A or B knows where
to get them cheap give me a holler

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.329
