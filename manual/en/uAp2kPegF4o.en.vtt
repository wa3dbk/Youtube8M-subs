00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.730
Hi my name is Bob Linde and I'm here today
to show you the next move in the 24 Yang Style

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.860
Tai Chi. I have been practicing Tai Chi for
about 13 years now. So we just finished the

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.160
repulsed monkey's move and we are going to
move into the grasp bird's tail series. So

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.650
we just finished the repulsed monkeys and
we are going to go into a move called hold

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:30.000
the ball which is really a transitional move.
We empty step out and our weight shifts, arms

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.340
reach to the corner, our weight comes back,
the right hand pivots around on top of the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:48.059
wrist, folds down and we press the arms come
apart as the weight shifts back and then we

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.980
press out one more time. So let me show you
the grasp bird's tail series from the side

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.739
so you can see the moves from that angle.
And so we just finished the repulsed monkeys,

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:14.640
we hold the ball, step out, reach for the
corner, weight comes back, hand on the wrist,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.189
press, apart, and push. We will real quick
show the marital applications of that move

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.229
as well and so although there are a lot of
variations of what we can do. Basically this

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.310
is a series of opportunities to really just
kind of punch and slap somebody around a little

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.030
bit. So we went from hold the ball to a sternum
strike and we can actually grab the arm and

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.350
do a sweep and we come back and we are now
supporting the wrist and we can do a wrist

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.860
strike. We hit him right in the zyphoid process
and stop the ability to breathe, hand comes

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.259
back and we give him a good shove all the
way back from our foot, extend it to our hands

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.509
and we can shove them away from us so we can
run away. So find a good instructor in your

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.259
area and play Tai Chi.
