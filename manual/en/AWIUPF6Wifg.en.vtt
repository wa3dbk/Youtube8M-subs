00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
hello namaste

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.370
salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.030
Vahrehvah.com. Today we're going to
make Bhendi kadhi

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.170
they also call it daya chi bhenda this is very popular in Maharashtra but

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.119
this is also made in many parts of India
like even in Andhra, Gujarat they make

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.289
this preparation

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.800
so to make this here I've got buttermilk just take some buttermilk in and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.019
add into the besan that is chickpea flour

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.040
you have to do it this way because
otherwise it'll form lumps first you

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.290
need to make a paste

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.670
you can also add water you don't have to
use buttermilk only to make this

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.480
add this into your buttermilk

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.520
so this is a thickening that we are
going to use for this kadhi

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.809
you know now have got okra see what you can do is take little oil and saute them or

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.160
you can even fry them

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.240
you know i'm going to fry these okra the
another method to do is much easier

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.560
all you need to do is after you add the
tempering ingredients and okra

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.600
into it and slowly saute it because the
okra will have the kind of a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.740
sticky nature

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.290
so you have to cook it till it is well fried, when we do this in the hotel's

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.490
what we do is we fry the okra separately
like the way i am going and then make

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.420
the kadhi ready

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.579
and then we'll top it off okra on it;  take some oil in a pan when the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.460
oil is hot add mustard seeds

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.170
you know take very little oil you don't need much oil for this because

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.450
already we sauteed bhendi in oil, when the mustard seeds crackle add cumin seeds

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.030
and fenugreek seeds

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.790
you know you want the fenugreek seeds to be little bit colored not too much you

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.880
don't want to burn them but they get colored very fast though see now that they're coloured

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.530
now add cloves and

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:14.990
cinnamon and ginger, chopped green chilli, curry leaves and add turmeric very

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.550
little of hing in this add this besan and
buttermilk

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.040
reduce the flame now and the let it
simmer for few minutes

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.870
add salt

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.530
and sugar and sugar just to add little bit sweetness

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.750
then this is slightly sweet and the
souress from the curd, you can also see

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.650
that because of the besan that is there in this while it is slowly cooking

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.930
it also get slightly thickened

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.400
you know when this is done you don't
want it to be cuddled you want it to be

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.230
really silky and nice you know now you
can see that this kadhi is almost

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.920
ready

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.660
that's when you add the fried okra now
you want to bring this to a boil

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.380
you know you can see this is slightly
thicker than i expected it to become so

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.030
you can add little bit of water and
dilute it bring this whole mixture to a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.130
boil and then switch off the flame

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.420
you know you have to see that this
should be like it nice thick soup

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.420
the amount of besan you add is the trick to this good kadhi

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.799
you know do not add too much you can add little less but if you think that you

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.760
may need little more you can dilute some more besan in the water and add to

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.459
it, it should become like a nice soup, a thicker soup but it should not become

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.110
like a lump and become a paste

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.609
so be very careful when you add besan, now another important thing is the methi

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.380
seed that is the fenugreek seed

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.730
you know add just very little you know
if you add too much and you get in the

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:55.400
mouth it can be really bitter so add
very little, time to taste

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:06.069
emmm you know I was in Gujarat for 2 years and I've eaten lot of Gujarati food and I love

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.580
it

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.410
and this Kadhi reminds me of that Gujarati food, dear friends

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.359
this Kadhi is awesome it's very nice and light especially sometimes if you have

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.169
fever and you don't feel like eating
anything make this Kadhi and you will

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.549
love it

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:31.180

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.760
thank you. This Kadhi can also be made
plain

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.210
you don't need to add okra without
adding okra also this will taste great.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.310
Another great kadhi is I love to fry you know round eggplants into thin slices and

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.160
crisp and add into this that also tastes
really good.
