00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.699
I support President Obama because he's a man
of integrity.

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.040
The guy's for the working man, he's for the
middle class American.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.840
He does what he has to do to get things done
for the American people.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.180
That's why I support President Obama.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.800
The first thing that he did when he got into
office was the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.460
Which grants us a great deal of access when
it comes to fighting for equal pay.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.090
He has made it really clear that access to
things like birth control is not going to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.989
be on the negotiating table.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.519
President Obama made it possible for me to
get medical insurance when nobody else would.

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.799
Because President Obama signed the Affordable
Care Act, I won't go bankrupt, my kids are

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:56.239
going to go to college and I'm going to live.

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.059
President Obama's stance on making sure that
colleges are affordable is extremely important

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.989
to make sure that kids know, you can also
attain this.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.360
President Obama has the students' best interests
at heart.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.890
Announcing his support of gay marriage was
pretty courageous.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.210
Now that Don't Ask, Don't Tell is over, I'm
definitely going back in to the military.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.110
President Obama kept his promise 100 percent
to get us out of Iraq.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.110
And he's doing the same thing in Afghanistan.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.030
He's given additional benefits to the military
and veterans alike.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.710
President Obama has been supporting green
businesses like mine.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.310
As a small business owner, he's helped with
the tax breaks.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.000
He's put us back to work.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.649
When he helped secure loans for the auto industry,
I think he was helping secure the future of

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:42.920
the entire middle class.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.789
He bet on us and we came through.

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.450
I really applaud him for making that decision.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.389
What President Obama has done for student
loan reform.

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:53.389
The middle class.

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:54.389
Civil rights.

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:55.649
The Hispanic community.

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.119
Access to preventive services.

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.119
Energy.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.119
Wall Street Reform.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.479
He's been moving this country forward.

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.460
What could he accomplish in four more years?

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.189
He needs to finish what he has started.

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.740
We can't stop here.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.680
We have to keep moving, we have to keep pushing
forward, we have to do more.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.940
And that is talking to people at the grocery
store, that is going door to door, that is

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.180
working phone banks.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:37.432
And I am going to do everything in my power
to help him win re-election.
