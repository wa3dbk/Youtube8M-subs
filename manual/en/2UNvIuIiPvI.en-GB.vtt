00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Hi guys, how are you all doing? I hope you're doing well, I'm not doing well, I am doing awfully!

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.600
I joined a gym last week, and everything hurts!

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.234
Anyway, so I've been tagged in the Krave Challenge, and I totally got an email from them last week that said;

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:17.914
"Hi Luke.... Are you Kraving some ... Krave?"

00:00:17.914 --> 00:00:22.094
AHAHAHAHA!!!

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.340
(Doorbell rings)

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.660
Hello

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.780
Thank you... Thanks

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.980
HAHA don't get to Kravey

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.500
HAHAHAHAHA!!!

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.520
(Door slams)

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.580
Okay yeah, maybe that was just a really violent cereal related dream that I had...

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.600
...Don't judge me...

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.720
So now all I need to complete my beautiful challenge is a friend.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.300
I shall summon my friend.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.040
THE POWER OF KRAVE COMPELS YOU!

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.320
Hello! Who are you?

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.480
I'm Patty! Hi!

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.140
This is my friend Patty. He is my only friend.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.500
Probably true.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.340
Anyway! Thank you for joining me for the Kruululululu...

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.840
What?!?

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.420
Thank you for joining me for the Krave challenge!

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.040
I have our Krave box here.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.300
So there is a bowl which is bubble wrapped so that the postman doesn't like sit on it and things.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.440
AND THEN!

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.000
There is a Krave box but it is covered in a thing like velcro!

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.160
Patty your hands aren't made of velcro, it's not going to work.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.960
It's so sticky!

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.680
Please read out the card:

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.180
Lukeisnotsexy,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.160
We all remember your awesome bouncy castle challenge last year.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.960
This time we're testing you to the limits!

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.900
Okay (laughs)

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.500
Pick a side of the box and there are some things in there to distract your buddy.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.080
Hey buddy buddy...

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.300
The person who makes their bowl of Krave first gets a free pass to one of the fantastic Merlin attractions and the loser has to pay!

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.420
Velcro time!

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.420
(laughs)

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.220
It's meant to say "velcro time" but they spelt it wrong and it says "velco time".

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.940
It has A and B on it.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.600
I choose B because that is the first letter of the word "bluh"

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.600
And that's what you are!

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.100
I get A for AMAZING!

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.820
AMAZING!

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.940
Ow I should have chosen A now!

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.580
Well it's too late now! I want it!

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.880
AMAZING!

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.760
BAMAZING!

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.180
YOU GET BALLS?!

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.500
I get plentiful balls!

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.960
AH I wish I had balls!

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.120
Look at my sticky balls!

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.120
I'm starting to slightly understand now!

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.980
They want us to rob a bank!

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.580
Using velcro balls and Krave cereal so that they can't trace it back to us!

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.860
I got a pun!

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:40.076
This is a stickup!

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.020
Ahhh it's sticky cos it's sticky...

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.380
We're now gonna pause and we're gonna get into our suits because otherwise you'll see our weenies...

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.580
Hello Luke would you like to do the Krave challenge in return you get blindness and misery...

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.460
I can't see what I'm touching but I hope it's a nose...

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.100
It's not.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.980
What is it?

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.160
Your nose.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.300
Oh that's a twist

00:03:06.814 --> 00:03:07.534
NO!

00:03:07.917 --> 00:03:10.057
I couldn't see, that's my excuse.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.560
Oh okay.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.560
I cant see, oh no!

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.400
I win!

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.400
Hello, we're outside and we're gonna do our Krave challenge, are you ready?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.220
Yeah!

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.880
Good I am ready also!

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.880
Let's go for a lad's do!

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.140
Me and Patty are gonna commentate on the wonderful challenge we're doing!

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.860
COMMENTATE!

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.680
Trip!

00:03:38.954 --> 00:03:40.954
No! I'm doing okay!

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.120
This is the part when I beat up the air because I thought it was you!

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.040
Balls to the head

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.880
Eat my sticky balls! Eat them!

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.100
Why have you just thrown your bowl on the ground and spoon?!

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.480
And what are you doing?!

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.920
You're the worst...

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.760
You are the best!

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.640
That wasn't an insult!

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.240
Ow!

00:04:50.034 --> 00:04:52.034
What will you do now?! You poop!

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.380
I genuinely, like the whole time I thought you were somewhere...

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.880
AHH!

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.280
(laughs)

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.480
I have my Krave!

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.640
Now where's my spoon!

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.140
This is my favourite bit of the whole thing!

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.700
Take that!

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.360
Why are you over there?

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.700
Oh no! My table!

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.700
I think you'd have won by now if you hadn't been doing this...

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.300
Don't come near me!

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.080
Oh god I've forgotten where I am!

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.520
Oh this is the house!

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.100
I walked into a house!

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.960
Oh yeah the table's not there!

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.374
I gotta have a maximum of 30 grams..

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.560
AHH!!

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.560
A maximum of 30 grams of Krave.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.160
Go away!

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.780
30 grams of Krave in the bowl!

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.860
I have a bowl!

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.360
Stop it!

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.974
WHY ARE THERE TWO!

00:05:56.454 --> 00:05:57.274
Bowlception!

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.180
Can the camera man say something please!

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.700
I can hear you!

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.200
Hello! Am I looking at the camera?

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.700
No.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.340
Am I looking at the camera?

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.840
No.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.100
Where are you?

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.580
Can you not please!!

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.680
I have completed my challenge!

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.900
You sound like an old woman when you scream.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.760
"Can you not please!"

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.800
Mmm yummy!

00:06:21.954 --> 00:06:23.114
I am the victory!

00:06:23.206 --> 00:06:25.206
Excuse me! I can see again!

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.020
NO! NOO!

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
Swag! I completed my Krave challenge!

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.540
(mimicking) "I completed my Krave challenge"

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.560
"Amazing, it was a good Krave challenge"

00:06:36.494 --> 00:06:38.494
Back to the studio!

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.540
Are you done now?

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.480
Good! That was our Krave challenge, I hope you enjoyed it and it was very nice and yum!

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.640
This whole thing happened because Krave have got a "mates go free" voucher on the side of their Krave packet

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:01.380
so you take your friend free to Madame Tussauds and Thorpe Park and Legoland and all sorts of wonderful places!

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.820
Thank you cereal industry!

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.400
I was tagged by my friend Cherry to do the thing and I would like to tag umm who? 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.340
Tag Dodie I like Dodie!

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.340
Okay Dodie's not done this before so let's ring her.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.420
Hey Dodie do you want to do the Krave thing?

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.000
Yeah!

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Good! Yeah, good!

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.440
