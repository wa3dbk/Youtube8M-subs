00:00:00.794 --> 00:00:06.629
I am standing here for my son. 
My son was conscripted on March 26th.

00:00:06.942 --> 00:00:12.891
I don't know his whereabouts. 
I am asking him "Sonny, are you ok?"

00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:16.455
He says: "I am ok". I ask: "Where are you?" 
His only reply is -- "in Ukraine, Mom, on the border".

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:18.112
That's all, nobody tells me anything.

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:22.092
Why, I ask, why did they take our children there? 
Who needs them there, who?

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:26.847
They are different people -- some will not say 
anything to them, others ask our boys:

00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:29.888
"Why did you come here? You are a Banderovets!" 
Why do we send our kids there,

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.752
if they are mocked as "Banderovtsy"? Why? 
Why the grown up able-bodied men run to hide here,

00:00:36.052 --> 00:00:37.798
and send our kids instead?

00:00:37.798 --> 00:00:46.082
Why? Why did they make "Maidan"?  
From this very Maidan everything started.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.635
This Maidan they made - and they were paid on Maidan. 
They were paid to be there.

00:00:51.088 --> 00:00:52.508
Everything was paid for.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.406
But here, our kids don't have even the most basic 
conditions. Not even drinking water.

00:00:59.128 --> 00:01:05.595
Can you imagine? Buying water there? 
How can this be happening? 
What kind of a country is it?

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:07.296
Nobody is thinking of anything.

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:13.693
In Supreme Rada [Ukrainian parliament], they just 
sit around and every day they "debate certain questions".

00:01:13.913 --> 00:01:18.404
Every day!  What kind of questions?  Empty air. 
While we are standing here -- mothers, wives, children.

00:01:18.813 --> 00:01:20.154
Not knowing anything.

00:01:20.508 --> 00:01:30.524
I don't know anything. My son says that "everything is Ok," 
but I don't know. He left behind his child.

00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:36.437
The little boy is just 9 years old. 
He keeps asking "Mama, where is my daddy?"

00:01:36.748 --> 00:01:42.182
Where is his daddy?  How is it possible? 
How is it possible to heap so much abuse on these people?

00:01:42.442 --> 00:01:46.296
I am sick and tired. 
I am sick and tired of watching the lies [on TV].

00:01:46.577 --> 00:01:50.343
They say "we are winning" but men come and 
take my son to the East.

00:01:50.605 --> 00:02:00.522
How long will they continue to lie to us? 
This is not a country anymore. 
They holler: "We are building a new Ukraine!"

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:04.303
What kind of Ukraine are we building now? 
For so many years we have lived in peace!

00:02:04.303 --> 00:02:10.887
Nobody cared to ask if you were Romanian, 
Moldovan, Russian, or Ukrainian.

00:02:11.146 --> 00:02:16.450
Not anymore: "The language, it can't be Russian," 
can't be this, can't be that. And who are we now?

00:02:16.881 --> 00:02:23.431
I will tell you -- we are now nationalists, aren't we? 
How can they be allowed to divide people like this?

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.811
They did it on purpose! 
We know who did this, whose team it was!

00:02:26.123 --> 00:02:33.707
Did anyone from local authorities visit you [the protesters], 
and what did they say to you?

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:41.950
Yesterday, I was here only in the evening. 
Today nobody came. Only us. Did a mayor come out to see us?

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.284
No. At least if someone were to come and ask us 
what we want.  But no, not at all.

00:02:48.503 --> 00:02:55.947
What should we do, go to the Supreme Rada? 
These women are at the end of their wits.

00:02:55.947 --> 00:03:02.251
They stay here, they sleep on the bare pavement. 
They must -- because of our children who are there.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.217
We can't go on like this.

00:03:06.443 --> 00:03:11.687
We can't stand this TV, we can't listen to it. 
It is full of lies!  Why did they do it?

00:03:11.887 --> 00:03:20.062
Why did they divide people like this? 
Why did they do the Maidan?

00:03:20.062 --> 00:03:25.616
Why did they pay big money there? 
And here -- they don't pay anything.

00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:31.317
Did anyone from Maidan come here? 
They said they are fighting for Ukraine there!

00:03:31.317 --> 00:03:35.118
Why wouldn't they stand with us here 
to defend our children?  Nobody. Nobody.
