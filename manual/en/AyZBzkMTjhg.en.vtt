00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.479
All right, it's the kids' last night, and
we are on our tour. 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.600
Shanghai UnTour, and this is crazy amazing. 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.580
There are tons of vendors with tons of food. I think we're gonna have some crayfish.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.880
 It's gonna be delicious and amazing. 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:40.080
(music and street noises)

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.900
Were these just alive? Were these just alive? 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.560
Yep. These were just alive,
and now you're eating them. 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.660
Hi! Hi! Hi! 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.361
Oh yeah. This is good, good stuff. It's a lot
of work, though. 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.100
It's not too spicy. Okay.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.080
All right, Jesse eating oysters. Is this your
first oyster?

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.960
Uh, I think I've had ones covered

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.649
in cheese and stuff, whatever those are called, but... 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:24.969
It's hot, but it tastes good! 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.500
I'm eating a stick of meat. 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.440
Oh my gosh! This lamb, it's amazing. This is life-changing. 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.040
(Jesse: oh my gosh.) 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.209
This is a life-changing moment right
here. Oh my gosh. 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.920
Eggplant and potato!

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.560
The garlic, the garlic! Mmmm! Try a razor clam--they're amazing. 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.560
Before. 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.240
After. 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.200
You have to understand

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.240
that I'm having the best night of my life,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.600
and I'm eating the best--the best--the best these things in all of China. 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.520
Ahhh, it's so good!
It's really good. This is amazing. This is

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.240
the best thing, this is like the best thing
we've done. You need to do Shanghai UnTour

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:30.880
because this is absolutely incredible. You
gotta eat this. 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.880
Oh my gosh, Jesse. 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:03:25.680
(music and sounds of talking)

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.880
We are going through the second night market.
Holy moly. 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.920
And our fabulous guides, Mitch and Dan, are picking out food for us. 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.040
These guys are from the Guangdong area of China.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:00.010
Do you guys know where Guangdong is? In the
south, like right by where Hong Kong is.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.750
That province around Hong Kong is called Guangdong.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.670
You guys are studying Chinese, so you may know that "nian" means "year" and "gao" means "high," 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.000
and so when you say, at Chinese New

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.680
Year, they eat this and they call it "nian
nian gao," which means like "Each year, higher

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.200
than the last." Every year better. 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.840
I think that this may be the happiest that I have

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.800
been this entire trip. This is--I can't even
describe how wonderful this is. 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:42.320
There are no tourists here. There are no tourists. We are not in a bus. We are eating the most amazing

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.690
food. It's so fresh. And now we're going to
eat outside, and I'm just going to cry from

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.050
happiness.
