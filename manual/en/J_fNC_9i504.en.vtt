How to Do Makeup for Summer.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.580
Don't spend all your time fussing with your
face in the summer.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.209
Learn how to do your makeup right so you can
spend your time in the sun.

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:20.360
You will need Oil-free cleanser Towel Sponge
Tinted moisturizer Powder foundation Blotting

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:30.029
paper Bronzing powder Fluffy brush Light makeup
Tinted lip bal Eyeliner Eye shadow Waterproof

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.050
mascara (optional) and oil-based remover (optional).

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.050
Step 1.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.120
Wash your face with oil free cleanser in a
cool room to limit sweat.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.359
Then blot your face dry with a towel.

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:41.899
Step 2.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.430
Sponge on a tinted moisturizer SPF 15 or higher
to protect your skin from the sun.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.590
Let the moisturizer absorb for 10 minutes
before applying your foundation.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.340
Step 3.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.199
Smooth foundation over spots where you need
extra coverage, around your nose, under your

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.719
eyes, and over blemishes.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.450
Step 4.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.930
Apply bronzing powder to your forehead, cheekbones,
chin, and nose with a loose, fluffy brush

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.610
to keep it from densely packing on the color.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.450
Glowing skin enhances the whiteness of eyes
and teeth.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.170
Apply lighter makeup in the summer that won't
cake.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.840
Shade slightly, but allow your skin's natural
color to come through, too.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.110
Step 5.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.540
Control shine with blotting paper, followed
with a luminescent powder to keep it all looking

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.830
natural in the bright sun.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.180
Step 6.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.930
Color your lips with a subtle, tinted lip
balm.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.040
Use a natural-looking nude shade or invisible
lip liner for definition.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.180
The waxy film will prevent colors from bleeding
in the heat.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.500
Use waterproof mascara during the humid months,
but use oil-based remover to prevent a build

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.500
up.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.630
Step 7.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.390
Use neutral shades of shadow to make your
eyes pop, and shape your eyes with colorful

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.390
liner.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.140
Put on a bikini and hit the beach.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.280
Did you know Ancient Egyptian workers considered
oils that guarded skin from the effects of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.750
sun and wind to be a vital part of their regular
wages.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.129
Grievances were filed during the reign of
Ramesses III when they were withheld.
