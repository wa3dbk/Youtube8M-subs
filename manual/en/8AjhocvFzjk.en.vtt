00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.830
Alright, here we are in Plant City. We’re
nearing towards the end of the stone work.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.099
We got our grotto finished behind us. We started
putting some of the plantings in. We’ve

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.360
got some pigmy date palms here. We’ve got
the spa, all the stone work is done there.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.670
Now we’re just working on wrapping the columns
with stone. We’ve been getting a lot of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.480
surprise showers and a lot of heat and sun
in between. So in order to stay cool and stay

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:40.079
dry, we’ve put up some tarps here. Here
is the steps coming down into the lower pool

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.920
where this is kind of a nice place to put
up some lounge chairs, hangout, and watch

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.300
the waterfalls coming down. And then over
here, you can walk right down into another

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.920
deeper part and this is the outdoor pergola
area where there’s the outdoor kitchen and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.260
a bar. And this is kind of like another little
area to hang out and you can use this ledge

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.000
as a bar. So instead of just having a negative
edge basin to capture the water, this is a

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.259
functional basin where we have the shallow
area that I just showed you. And you can walk

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.031
down here, be in a little bit more water and
you got a nice bar height here to hang out

00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:22.290
and have a drink. And then you can go underneath
the bridge to the other side, where you’ll

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.400
be right in the dining room area. So in here
I create a little destination seat rock where

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.659
the waterfalls coming down, you can sit underneath
the waterfalls here. And then you can just

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:46.009
hop out, and now we’re in the dining area.
Right here is where the dining table is going

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.079
to sit, so you can sit here, look at the waterfall.
So as you’re seating here, you’ve got

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.369
the views of the waterfall behind you, and
in here you’ve got a nice fireplace. And

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:01.870
then we dropped the grade down, so then you
got a beautiful view of ten acres behind you

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:09.360
with two ponds to look at, very nice setting.
Over here is going to be the outdoor kitchen

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.799
area where we’ve got the grill, the sink,
the fridge, all those amenities. And then

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.110
over here, this is where when you’re in
the pool, you come through the waterfall and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.549
you’ve got this swim up bar right here.
So I’ll have a nice granite countertop here.

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:29.560
And then a second level bar up at this height
here, for everybody in the spa, so they can

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:39.169
have their bar area as well, and then all
this is under roof.

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:44.359
These pigmy date palms not only soften the
look of all the hard rocks, they give a beautiful,

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.160
tropical feel. And then at night, that’s
when they really come to life. We up light

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.570
all these palms and then the lighting effects
really make this place a wonderland at night,

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.830
just a beautiful spot to hang out. And that’s
why I love using so much landscaping so you

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.350
have other features to up light, so at night
the design becomes even more incredible. This

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.780
one big boulder we set here will be outside
of the pool cage. The pool cage is going to

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.700
run up this footer here, up the wall, and
go that way. And then from the upper level,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.480
you have stairs coming down and this rock
is used for two purposes. One, ascetically,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.680
it starts bringing the design from in the
cage out of the cage. And also, it’s going

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.480
to help make that transition in grade where
we go from three feet higher down here to

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.000
three feet lower. So now I can taper the grade
around this boulder and that’s going to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.820
retain the dirt instead of having it want
to wash right in through the cage right there.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.940
When doing our stone work, I love to break
up the stone work with some big pieces of

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.650
stone embedded in the smaller rock. This makes
it a lot more interesting looking and much

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.530
more natural. Also notice, even though all
these rocks are mortared together, it has

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.759
a very dry laid, natural look. We achieve
that by getting tight joints, also keeping

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:09.740
the mortar raked back, and using a brown dye
in the mortar, so the mortar matches the rocks.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.030
So it doesn’t stand out with the shiny grey
mortar that you see time and time again.
