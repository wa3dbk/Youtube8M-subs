Welcome to Space News from
the Electric Universe,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.160
brought to you by The
Thunderbolts Project™

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.480
at Thunderbolts.info

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.950
Solar researchers discover more and more
links between solar and Planetary events.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.110
The message learned
is, to study the Sun.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.580
The Sun and Earth are no longer
thought to be isolated bodies

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.740
floating in an inert medium.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.440
Recent evidence suggests a direct physical
plasma link between these two bodies.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.830
NASA launched five spacecraft called
the Themis group of spacecraft

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.590
into Earth orbit, and Themis detected gigantic,
what they call tornadoes of plasma,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.550
emanating from the Sun with
over a million amperes

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.030
in each one of these giant
funnels of electric energy.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.450
They directly impinge on the
atmosphere of Earth, on the ionosphere,

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.220
and they are huge 40,000
mile wide funnels

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.640
that come from the Sun and touch
Earth's electrical environment.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.380
So that's a direct connection
from Earth to the Sun.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.370
The implications of the direct
connection that the Sun has with Earth

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.520
are that we are going to
directly experience on Earth

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.480
any changes in the nature
of the Sun's activity.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.280
If there are increased Sun spots,

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.750
then the Sun is going to emit a
greater number of solar flares

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.110
and a greater number of
coronal mass ejections.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.860
And those are going to have impact
on communications around Earth,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.560
as well as on
satellite activity.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.290
Increased solar activity can actually
degrade the orbits of some satellites,

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.800
because the charged
particle flow

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.240
acts like a brake on them and they
start descending into lower orbits.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.710
Effects of solar activities on
satellites are well known today.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.340
However, the effects of the Sun on our
planet go beyond merely interfering

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.210
with our communication channels.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.990
The Sun may have a direct connection with
weather and other natural events here on Earth.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:15.270
Well, it's been shown, there's a
gentleman named Henrik Svensmark

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.820
who's been doing experiments in
Scandinavia with solar activity

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.500
and he has discovered that when there
is an increased level of solar activity,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.240
the Sun's magnetic field increases,
and that causes the cosmic rays from space

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.120
to be deflected around
the solar system.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.510
Now according to Svensmark’s theory,
when cosmic rays enter our atmosphere,

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.580
they produce bubble tracks in the atmosphere,
very similar to the old bubble chambers

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.800
that used to detect particles
from cyclotron experiments,

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.210
where they would
smash atoms together.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.280
The particles that were produced would
fly through a high humidity chamber.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.030
They would cause a
pressure reduction

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.720
and leave a little track of bubbles in
the chamber that could be visualized.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.590
So, what Svensmark determined is that
when there are a lot of cosmic rays

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.430
penetrating Earth's atmosphere, they leave
bubble tracks which creates clouds.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.090
So, high solar activity
deflects these particles

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.540
around Earth, around the
solar system in general.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.210
So, with increased solar activity
you have a lower number of clouds,

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.250
because fewer of these charged cosmic rays
are entering our atmosphere from space.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.880
By the same token, when
solar activity is low,

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.530
the particles are not deflected
around the solar system

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.430
and they do enter our atmosphere
and they do cause an increase in clouds.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.960
So, the Sun could actually be thought
of as a cloud generator indirectly,

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.320
insofar as that it's reducing cosmic
ray activity in our atmosphere

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.410
and allowing more clouds to form,
or increasing its magnetic field,

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.170
and allowing fewer cosmic rays
to penetrate the atmosphere.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.830
Also, the electrical
energy from the Sun,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.810
because it's passed down these giant solar
tornadoes directly into Earth's environment,

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.230
that electrical activity can influence the
underground flow of electric currents

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.200
called telluric currents and those telluric
currents might actually be responsible

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.330
for Earthquakes,
underground Earthquakes,

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.300
because magma can be considered
a plasma in solid form

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.490
since it contains a portion of
charged particles within it.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.020
It can form double layers inside
of the magma flow underground

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.640
and those layers can actually
shoot out at times and detonate

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.850
and if those detonations
are occurring

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.670
in these giant telluric currents
underground in huge magma streams,

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.200
then the double layer detonation
could be considered an Earthquake

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.700
and the seismic waves could
be considered the sonic boom.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.020
Earth is connected to the Sun as we've
demonstrated through these giant plasma tornadoes

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.720
that the Themis
spacecraft has detected.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.130
So the Sun is right here;
the Sun is here with us now,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.670
and it's affecting
everything that we do.
