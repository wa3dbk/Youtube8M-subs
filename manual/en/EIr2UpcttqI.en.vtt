00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.409
I'm going to make

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.279
so what i want to do is slice this up to like centimeter discs 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.460
like that 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.699
then I get my spuds over here just slice these little tigers up same thickness

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:29.439
as a celeriac 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.109
get them in with the celeriac 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.629
and then some herbage in here i'm using sage I want a couple of cloves of garlic like that 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.180
in it goes and then I have got a nice big handful of parmesan 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.750
and then about half a pint of double cream half a pint of milk 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.730
good pinch of salt 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.560
and pepper and what I want to do is get in there 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.700
and give it a little mix up

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.250
just layer up

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.720
spuds

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.120
celeriac 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.660
nice bit of cheese on top 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.330
be quite generous what I'm going to do now 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.260
is put this over wrap the little tiger up 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.300
about half an hour 180 350

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.680
fahrenheit

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.030
so that's that bit 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.770
and then with venison i want ten

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.260
at junin berries get my knife and I'm just going to crush it 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.730
some salt goes in there some pepper and I've got rosemary just chop this all 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.680
together so just chop this up as soon as I've done that, I'm going to scatter this like that 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.930
I'm going to rub 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.540
this beautiful little thing with oil 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.370
then we can begin to 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.370
role it so just roll it over like that 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.510
I've got a pan in the oven, then I want to get a bit of olive oil happening

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.350
in the pan

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.510
in with the venison 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.880
nice and hot get it going sear it off 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.790
while I'm in here 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.580
we might as well chuck in a few bits of herbs and then garlic cloves 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.240
so what I want to do now is just put a little bit more

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.940
Parmesan on top 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.659
you can be reasonably generous 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.060
smack bang in the oven 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.110
and then

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.209
this here

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.729
just turn the meat over in the juices

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.189
take it out put it on there to rest 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.059
that is proper cooking that is 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:21.469
exciting stuff get the venison

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.839
centimeter slices look at the colour 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:31.839

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:38.979
