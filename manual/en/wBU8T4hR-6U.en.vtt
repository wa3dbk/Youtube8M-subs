00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.680
You don't know how much I wanna go and lift.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.010
What will help you, buddy?

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.700
I need to wear one of my thongs

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.370
Will you get it for me?

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.070
'Cause I'm in a diaper

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.080
You want the plaid one?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.910
That'd be good

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.670
Or wait, there's the one with the diamonds

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.550
Those are not diamonds

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.050

I don't like your face

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.890
Hmm, you got horrible zoo hands

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.030
And you have the record for frowning

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.800
'Cause I want some lettuce.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.190
 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.220
You ever just wanna have a centipede

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.320
You know, in your pocket, just in case you wanted to eat it?

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.190
Why would I do that? Like, that's just -

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.070
Cuz you'd LIKE IT?

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.210
Uhh, that's really weird.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.210
Suntan

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.740
JIMMA JAH MAH FA MAH JEEGA BURGA

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.870
I don't speak French

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.790
I believe he said we should all make out

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.090
I thought that we just did!

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.010
 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.680
Hey, you know what?

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.590
I have jeggings for my pelican.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.810
Wait, dude, what?

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.810
HUH?

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.540
 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.840
You just said that you -

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.690
HUHH??

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.610
 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.310
If I ever become a cannibal

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.610
I'm gonna eat a fat fellow.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.390
I think you're sick

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.500
HER SAID A BAD THING TO ME

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.980

HUHHH??

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.000
 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.040
I want to address my wart

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.080
The one on my knee

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.880
You see, I wanna just shear it off and then keep it

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.940
Maybe tuck in a tray

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.540
Or a decorative box

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.140
And no one could find it

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.250
It'd be a secret

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.650
Hidden away, like my frisbee

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.380
And my Grover mask

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.900
[whispering voices] "And my Grover mask"

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.070
 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.270
What?

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.030
Umm there was, like

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.400
The Wart Man

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.850
Was he wearing a hat?

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.120
 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.350
Keep calm

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.710
Go to sleep

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.340
 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.820
What do you need?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.790
Can you find me a drummer?

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.540
No, but I can find a loser

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.150
Come on, I'm a star!

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.400
Well, then, where is your gold suit?

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.120
Uhh, it got like hair on it

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.430
from this rasta guy on the bus

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.670
I mean, I'd probably look totally incredible in it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.420
But it was really just, uh

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.190
Makin' me sick mon

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.440
But I brought you something.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.940
It's the tissue I just used to blow my nose

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.610
And it's still wet.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.010
Mm hmmm.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.440
 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.110
Can you train a pig?

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.310
To do what?

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.780
Like harm my grandpa...

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.690
 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.190
And grandmama

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.060
 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.740
Uh, you're looking for an assassin pig?

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.880
Maybe

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.040
Dude, they're not something you can like

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.130
purchase at the mall

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.220
You do realize that a pig doesn't really have human hands

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.010
What?

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.340
Bingo

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.140
Heh heh, PIG

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.350
[singing] Remember dragons are great in several ways

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.270
They guard the magic cloak

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.570
And I will find this cloak, then I will hide

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.730
Out in the street

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.150
In plain sight

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.480

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.850
 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.070
It's not my fault

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.280
 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.000

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.170
"Bean Fork"

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.470
"Human Litter Box"

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.140
 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.030
[burp]

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.240
 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.270
Dang it!

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.160
I just hit the cat

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.160
And all because I can't look where I throw things

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.270
I bonked my kitteh!

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.540

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.660

It's a stupid gift from a friend

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.040
My friend who's a loser

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.300
 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.320
Smells like a freakin' egg roll

Geez, I need some glue

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.990
Do you not use it when you break stuff?

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.140
Not really

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.640
Nice!
