00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
Frostbite Theater presents...

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Cold Cuts! No baloney!

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.200
Just science!

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.400
Hi! I'm Joanna!

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.400
And I'm Steve!

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.800
From time to time, we spill a little liquid nitrogen!

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.900
[Liquid Nitrogen] Sploosh!
0:00:16.300,0:00:14.400
The reaction we sometimes get is....

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.800
Did they just pour LIQUID NITROGEN on the FLOOR?!?!

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.900
Yes. Yes we did.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.300
One thing people seem to have a problem with

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.400
is the mess that liquid nitrogen makes.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.700
Happily, there is no mess!

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.100
Liquid nitrogen boils at 77 Kelvin.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.800
That's 196 degrees below zero Celcius,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.900
or 321 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.000
The room is way hotter.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.900
When the nitrogen touches the rug,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.000
it boils and changes to a gas!

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.800
So, no mess!

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.500
[Steve] The rug is also useful in that

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.100
it keeps the liquid nitrogen in one spot.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.700
If we pour the liquid nitrogen on a smooth surface,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.800
it skitters all over the place and could cause trouble elsewhere.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.300
It does this because the liquid ends up floating

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.800
on a little layer of gas due to the Leidenfrost effect.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.200
[Joanna] Another concern some people raise is what we call ODH,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.400
or Oxygen Deficiency Hazard.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.600
When the liquid nitrogen boils,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600
the gas that's made takes up a lot more space.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.800
The gas then mixes with the air,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.800
lowering the concentration of oxygen that's available.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.300
Reduce it too much and we're going to have problems.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.000
Air normally has 21% oxygen.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.400
The Lab's ODH alarm will sound if it falls to 19.5%.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.000
If you take a look around,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.900
you'll see that we're in a fairly big space.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.900
We know how much nitrogen expands

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.400
when it changes from a liquid to a gas

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.400
and we know the volume of the room,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.900
so we can calculate how much nitrogen we can bring in here.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.400
For this room, it works out to 30 liters.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.800
Typically, we don't have more than 10.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.800
If we were to spill all the nitrogen

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.400
we brought in here all at one time,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.700
we'd still be well above the ODH alarm threshold.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.700
Thanks for watching!

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.100
I hope you'll join us again!

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.300
So, what's next?

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.300
Well, I was thinking we could do something with lasers!

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.100
Oooh! That'll be fun!

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.700
Uh-huh!

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.700
So, aah, we don't need liquid nitrogen any more?

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.200
Nope!

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.700
Ah-ha!

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.400
[Liquid Nitrogen] Sploosh!
