00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.070
Hi! This is Matt on behalf of Expert Village
and today I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:10.890
Chinese sesame chicken. If you notice, we
have a whole bunch of things going on at the

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.039
oven. First thing we have is our oven preheating
at 300 degrees. I'll tell you why in a minute.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.050
The next thing we have is a plate with a paper
towel sitting over top. We have our chicken

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.619
here in our batter or coating and we have
our pan. The first thing we're going to do

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:41.200
is we're going to turn our stove on medium
high. Let's take our oil and let's pour that

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:51.872
into our pan. As you can see, our oil is starting
to heat up. It's bubbling. We're going to

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:59.750
take a few pieces at a time of chicken and
we're going to throw them in the pan. We're

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.070
going to cook them for about 4-5 minutes or
until they're kind of golden. Let's throw

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:18.299
one more in there. You can kind of hear it
sizzling up. That's good enough. That's starting

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.659
to cook nicely. I'm going to leave this in
here for a couple more minutes and then I'm

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:32.420
going to turn it over. Depending on how big
your pot is just so they have enough room.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:46.049
Only a few pieces at a time. Let's just turn
that over real quick. They're not quite golden

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:56.920
yet.
This definitely is starting to cook here.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.729
We're going to turn these over. You see how
it's starting to get golden brown. Give them

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:16.180
a turn. They're definitely getting golden
right there. I'm going to give them they're

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.250
own space. Now, these are pretty much done,
so what we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.650
a spoon. We're going to take them and we're
going to transfer them over to our plate with

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:40.870
the paper towel so the oil can drain. Just
like so.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:49.700
These definitely turned out really good. Let's
get that last one out of there. Wonderful.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.799
Now I'm going to add the rest of these and
cook these up. Then I will see you on the

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.049
next step.
