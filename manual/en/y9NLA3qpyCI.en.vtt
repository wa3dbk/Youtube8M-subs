Hi I'm Rachel Dayan for Expert Village now
we're going to make the legs for our little

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:22.359
sheep, 4 legs we make chunky little snakes
and we just put them on the bottom 4 legs

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:31.089
just make sure they stay good to the body
of the sheep because other wise it's not going

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:46.100
to hold. Another one we're going to make little
nails for the end of the legs you take brown

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:54.260
you make little thin snake and you fold it
in half, and you just put it on the bottom

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:04.350
of the leg. Open it a little bit it's going
to be the nails

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:40.700
4 nails that we're going to need for the 4
legs, now we're going to make a little bell.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:54.829
Very nice, finish, you take the blue and we're
going to make a snake to put around the neck

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:08.520
of the sheep, put it all the way around and
now we're going to make a bell, a little bell,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:16.480
you take yellow or whatever color you would
choose. You make a cone kind of shape at the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.940
top you just squeeze it a little bit and then
the bottom your going to flatten, flatten

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:34.830
it up like this. You can make a little push
inside to make it a little deep and a little

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:43.780
take some white and make a small ball and
put it in the middle and that's going to be

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:55.020
our bell that we're going to put on the bottom
of the neck our sheep and here we go.
