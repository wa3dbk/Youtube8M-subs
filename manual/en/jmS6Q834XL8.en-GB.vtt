I'm Nomura Shuhei. Welcome to IN DEPTH CHANNEL.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.040
When I was a baby, my family took me to visit Hong Kong

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.540
But as I was too small, I have no memory of it

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.800
So it can be called as the first time.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.260
(Oh really. Please comment on Hong Kong.)

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.308
I feel...

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.740
I think Hong Kong is a metropolis.

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:52.929
Comparing with Tokyo, there are more high rise buildings here.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.140
It suprises me.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.440
The food is very delicious.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.820
The roads are neat and well-formed.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.080
The people are warm.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.800
I think it is a very nice place.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.400
This photobook creates an atmosphere of a film.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.240
We hope the readers feel that they are in a film.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.100
And it shows that I am (the hero) in the film.

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:40.009
The thing I remember the most?

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.000
The person I took photo with is now here.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.240
(Why?)

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.020
Why is she here?

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.500
(Actually, she is our Chief Designer.)

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.300
I was really happy when they prepared me a birthday cake.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.700
And I had a chance to take photo with fans. It makes me so delighted.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.333
What're you doing? You bustard.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.960
I don't really have such a goal.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.820
but I hope to be an all-rounded actor in the future.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.740
Till now, you have acted as a student for quite a number of times,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.800
do you have any kind of roles that you really want to act?) 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.520
I don't really have a particular role to act.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.840
But I want to work in Hong Kong

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.971
(What kind of work?)

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.780
Film, drama

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.340
(In Cantonese?)

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.000
I prefer Mandarin
