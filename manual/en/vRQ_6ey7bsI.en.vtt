00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
Hi everybody, in this video I'll show you a new nail art.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.910
It's a little special and you'll see more of it in my upcoming videos.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.870
It's 3D nail art which I've done with acrylic resin.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.200
I hope that you'll like this new tutorial.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:23.430
This one's not really to explain how I do but just to show you because it's my first 3D nail art.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.420
I hope you'll like the video; let’s watch it.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.140
First, I make a dramatic French manicure. You can find a link to the tutorial of how to make a dramatic french manicure in the annotation.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.810
I have used a beige nail polish which is quite common

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.960
and a purple one for the French.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.960
I did the markout with a liner.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.840
Then, we’ll need white acrylic resin

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.080
and the bonding acrylic nail liquid to make the acrylic paint.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.890
And finally a pointed acrylic brush.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.560
Now I dip my brush in the acrylic liquid and I wipe it.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.690
I take a small amount of resin and I wipe it on a piece of paper

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.690
and then apply it on my nail.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.170
I'll wait until the ball becomes slightly matt.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.880
Then, I'll flatten it. To flatten 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.690
bring the tip of the brush towards the center of the flower.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.960
Now I flatten it well to make the petal.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.580
It'll be up to you to see whether you like the 3D rendering to be emphasized or if you prefer flat petals.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.940
If you like flat ones, you flatten it more with the brush.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.070
So I do it again with another drop.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.290
Consider placing the petals one over the other.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.290
It looks great !

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.460
If the resin is too wet, you'll see that you won't be able to flatten it.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.850
And also if it is too dry, it'll be hard and you won't be able to flatten it.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.270
That's why I wait some three or four seconds before flattening it.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.770
Here it is, I have forwarded the video a bit  because it takes some time to do 3D nail arts.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.950
To make the leaves, first I make a drop

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.110
and flatten it on the sides

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.110
and then, I make the tip.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.850
When the leaf has dried a little, I will use the back of the brush or another tool

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.460
to make the lines for it to look like a leaf

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.460
and finally make it hollow in the middle.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.570
Then, I use white acrylic paint

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.410
since its whiter than the resin.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.300
I take a small brush and make the outlines of the petals to bring them out.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.110
To have even better looking flowers 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.100
I have made lots of lines on the petals

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.290
from the outside to the inside.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.130
They must be very small ones so I used diluted paint.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.600
To be able to make very small lines.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.730
Then, I make some lines around, quick ones.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.880
And I apply three small rhinestones with rhinestone glue.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.150
To make it hold better.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.460
For the finish, I apply the topcoat.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.270
You have to apply the topcoat on the side of the flowers.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.450
Not on on the flower itself otherwise the 3D effect will vanish; it won't be nice at all.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.860
As you can see, I apply the top coat on the side.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.160
You can apply some matte top coat on the flower it won't spoil it.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
Or some glue.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.820
