00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
My crafting ideas (May contain traces of old ideas and nuts)  Episode one

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:21.580
When we have iron, gold and diamond why not have leather? The color of the wool used will be the color of the armor.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:36.640
Fits in the body armor slot. Provides no armor but 9 additional storage slots.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:51.660
Attracts all mobs except bosses! Every time a mob reaches the cake it takes a piece. This will go on until the cake is gone and the bait becomes useless.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:01.300
Just another food option for a balanced diet.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:16.400
Will make pig you're riding run super fast!

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:31.580
Will make you see clearly underwater and gives you a little extra oxygen.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:46.480
Will keep non-hostile mobs away from the area. This can help you prevent farmland from being trampled.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:02:01.040
The haybale itself is not my idea but I think this is how it should be crafted.
