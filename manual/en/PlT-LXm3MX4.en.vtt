00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.020
Fight!

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.180
Raging oil spill!

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.900
Green Ninja! Green Ninja!

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.580
Needs to build a ninja team!

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.800
Gren Ninja! Green Ninja!

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.640
Never going to stop until we do this thing!

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.760
Green Ninja!

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.500
On this episode of the Green Ninja Show

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.060
Talia and Joanne from Walnut Creek ask

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.020
The last video game episode was great, do you have any more?

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.880
We love games!

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.780
What do you take me for?

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.920
Some kind of "noob"?

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.080
Hold onto your rumble packs, ladies

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.880
I'm about to go full Steam ahead!

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.820
The air became polluted

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.320
temperatures soared

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.060
weather extremes everywhere

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.520
the world became engulfed in smog

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.540
disaster, hopelessness, all due to an evil power that emerged

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.720
Fossil Fuels!

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.340
No one stood in his way

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.600
his power was too great

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.820
no one could defeat him, no one could-

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.120
What are you talking about?

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.820
There are many ways to defeat you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.980
I can do it right now!

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.040
Game on!

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.980
Fight!

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.840
Raging oil spill!

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.940
Wind turbine uppercut!

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.620
Frack attack!

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.900
Hydropower cleanse!

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.720
Coal barrage!

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920
Concentrated solar beam!

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.560
Finish him!

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.380
Ah!

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.720
That's easy for you, Green Ninja

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.560
but not everyone can defeat me so easily.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.100
Ha!

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.360
That's what you think, look!

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.540
No!

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.940
Kids taking action!

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.720
There you have it, folks.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.120
If you make some wise first-person environmental decisions

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.060
a winner is you.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.040
