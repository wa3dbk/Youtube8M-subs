00:00:03.373 --> 00:00:07.843
Namaskar!
Welcome to Nishamadhulika.com.

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:10.640
Today we are going to make brown bread.

00:00:10.773 --> 00:00:13.468
That is bread made from wheat flour.

00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:16.640
This bread is very nutritious.

00:00:17.141 --> 00:00:24.023
If you cannot eat bread made from
maida then enjoy eating brown bread.

00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:28.218
So come, let’s prepare brown bread.

00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:37.039
Wheat flour (Gehun atta) - 2 cup or 300 gram

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:40.195
Oil - 2 tbsp

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.109
Active dry yeast - 1 tsp

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.601
Salt (Namak) - ½ tsp or as per taste

00:00:48.852 --> 00:00:50.812
Sugar - 1 tsp

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.914
Let’s knead a dough for the bread.

00:00:54.203 --> 00:00:57.226
Make a space in the middle of the bowl this way.

00:01:01.063 --> 00:01:08.148
Add salt, sugar and active dry yeast.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.671
Add a little lukewarm water and knead the dough.

00:01:16.352 --> 00:01:24.140
You can add instant active yeast
directly in the dough and knead.

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:43.366
If it would have been dry active yeast then we would have kept it in
water for 10 minutes, it will produce bubbles and will become active.

00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:50.397
But we can add instant active yeast to the dough.

00:01:50.905 --> 00:01:57.241
Now add 1 tbsp oil to it.

00:01:59.014 --> 00:02:06.160
Keep adding a little water and knead a soft dough.

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:13.934
We will take lukewarm water to knead the dough.

00:02:14.172 --> 00:02:18.223
Make sure the water is neither too hot and nor too cold.

00:02:22.864 --> 00:02:26.582
We have kneaded a soft dough.

00:02:26.777 --> 00:02:33.019
We have used more than 1 cup
water to knead this much dough.

00:02:33.893 --> 00:02:39.431
Knead it a little more to make it soft.

00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:44.111
Apply some oil on your hands
and knead the dough a little.

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:51.978
Knead the dough for another 5-6 minutes.

00:02:52.768 --> 00:02:57.001
Apply oil on your hands if the dough sticks.

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:04.509
A dough of soft consistency is now ready.

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:09.806
Take a container that is to be used to bake the bread.

00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:12.533
Grease the container with oil.

00:03:13.462 --> 00:03:18.149
Grease the container with oil.

00:03:20.768 --> 00:03:31.197
Apply oil on your hands and give the
dough the shape of the container.

00:03:31.548 --> 00:03:33.907
Press it using your fingers.

00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:38.650
Spread it evenly.

00:03:39.837 --> 00:03:45.875
Cover the container and keep it in a
warm place as it will ferment easily.

00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:55.186
The dough will take a long time to ferment in
winter's if it is not kept at a warm place.

00:03:55.598 --> 00:04:11.729
So for this we will cover and keep the dough in an
almirah, in the oven and next to it will keep a bowl of hot water.

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:18.832
Our dough will ferment in 2 hours and will be ready for baking.

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:21.261
So let's keep it in a warm place.

00:04:26.301 --> 00:04:39.015
2 Hours are over and now our dough is fluffy.

00:04:39.234 --> 00:04:41.593
It has doubled after getting fluffy.

00:04:41.734 --> 00:04:44.046
It is ready in 3 hours.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.679
Now we will bake the bread.

00:04:46.187 --> 00:04:53.717
Preheat the oven on 220 c .

00:04:53.936 --> 00:04:57.412
Now we will bake the brown bread.

00:04:58.116 --> 00:05:04.311
Put the container on a wired stand.

00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:14.848
Set the oven on 220 c for 15 minutes.
After this check.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.114
Let's check the bread.

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.450
Our bread is golden brown in colour.

00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:33.575
It takes 18 minutes for the bread to bake

00:05:33.872 --> 00:05:59.915
First we baked the bread for 15 minutes it was a
little brown, then we baked it for another 3 minutes.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.306
In fact this will take different time in
different ovens depending on the temperature.

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:12.430
You should keep checking the bread when you bake it for the first
15 minutes and then set the time according to the speed of baking.

00:06:12.617 --> 00:06:15.429
Bake the bread till it does not get
golden brown in colour from both sides.

00:06:15.811 --> 00:06:19.944
Once the bread cools down, take it out from the container.

00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:33.017
Cut it from the sides this way using a knife.

00:06:43.822 --> 00:06:52.945
Grease the top of the bread with ghee which will
increase its taste and will give a good fragrance.

00:06:53.891 --> 00:06:58.179
Cut the bread into thin slices.

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:07.898
Our brown bread is now ready.

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:18.607
You can eat hot bread or once the bread gets cool, you can
store it in the refrigerator and eat it for 2-3 days.

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:26.373
