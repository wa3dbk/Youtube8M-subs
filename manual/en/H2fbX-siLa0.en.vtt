00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.210
less than an accident submission i cant
restarting its central michigan

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.670
university is now sending european
history in germany and action center

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.959
graduate degree germany and she explains
why in this next video let's watch

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:15.919
i had

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.730
when i say it's not finished university
in outsiders break glass

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.380
but i have three three tabs to make ends
meet tonight not having to support my

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.610
family whatsoever

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.340
associates and scholarships hopefully
through and users as you've got people

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.490
to do that without

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.430
loans

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.180
and uh... process request that the bad
guy wasn't able to afford to do a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.850
master's customs and you can sense which
is about the cause them to you

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.240
and uh... i was just not able to afford
in the last thing i would have been in

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.949
that

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.179
so i thought that uh... about sites that
but that's the way i can go and i

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.020
figured maybe europe would be the best
option

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.610
and uh... i universe the faster and
faster is on the border between a

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.130
journey that might

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.130
bad five girls persons at his work on my
feet there's no such thing and having a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.560
bad situation absolutely no need to take

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.160
for one semester

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.780
and that's a specificity classes as you
can take that you don't pay per credit

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.940
society that sent and half of the fee

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.860
pays for the puck expectations and finds
that at sxsw i technically only paid

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.720
forty euro that's like fifty seventy
dollars late absolutely nothing

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.840
absolutely nothing and uh... actually
the item is such a good life here i

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.560
don't pay so much for rent needs to give
you a two hundred a month and then by

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.560
also have the best health insurance i
was not able to afford health insurance

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.510
when i was in the united states but an
engine you have something uh... as a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.180
student discounts to get health
insurance in his full coverage

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.010
for seventy seven euro

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.230
prayer

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.060
that is an incredible story and to be on
studio i'm very surprised that germany

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.030
is willing to extends it such a great
service to you americans were traveling

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.120
abroad right eileen under the assumption
that if you are sitting in the united

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.500
states and you decide you want to travel
abroad in those countries they will

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.630
charge you tuition up through the roof
because if they didn't all this and you

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.160
have all these american students
flocking to your country and you know

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.560
taking advantage of the awesome system
that you have their another three

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.420
minutes away from that video is that the
united states is embarrassing her is so

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.170
embarrassing that we have students now
who have to travel abroad to get into

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.590
unaffordable education and don't get me
wrong i'm glad that she's getting her

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.170
education in niger many because as she
mentioned she standards studying

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.310
european history

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.800
and she's in her masters in that which i
commend you for i think that's great at

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.310
the same time so i can make you made it
very much money balls on the work i mean

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.219
i guess fear the morning and gave me a
professor

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.709
unnaturally a horrible person and just
tell you what the facts are european

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:57.510
history

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.920
it's very unlikely that you are gonna
make a ton of money from that major

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.219
cities in europe

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.930
was to stay there

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.639
maybe to come in handy

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.059
maybe if you will work in the email
adults you think i had since the majors

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:13.760
are as part of the what exactly someone
can do

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.929
diplomat with

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:18.539
uh... but you know what they may be slow
things that's worth inviting alamo you

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.799
know the makeup or or of the country
living but

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.359
you know we say whenever there is
evidence that comes our country

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.339
civil action by the end and make it a
place where they want to be which is we

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:30.859
can always used to be in this country

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.239
they contribute to our society and makes
the country stronger

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.709
maybe that's idea enough i don't know if
it's the decided to invite or how long

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.860
this type of set up a thing going on

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.929
busting butt in open people from
different countries

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:47.530
and then they contribute to this aside i
mean if you feel better medication there

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.230
and you eventually get a base for being
there may be a comfortable enough in

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.619
this double a move

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:55.989
right would be surprise if she stated
that i you know when you consider the

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.100
health care costs below grants

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.690
i don't know i don't think it's
considered i wonder many sounds awesome

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.180
rabbit i wonder what part of the minute
i wonder what kind of a permissive day

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.260
that i mean

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.470
is that i wouldn't think that at the
bookstore expand wouldn't i wouldn't

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.829
soon as we know is this

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.879
nominees and i should have known i don't
think that is different from country to

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.150
country and other if you want to travel
to denmark to pay the low tuition cost

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.209
that they have there

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.770
you good luck right there they're gonna
charge a lot more if you received was

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.099
you know traveling abroad uh... but

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.990
if you go our programs in europe that
make education is affordable take

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.569
advantage of them i think that's great
and not only that it makes you more

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.539
called by adding culturally aware andy a
traveling to another country i think is

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:45.090
the best educational experience that you
could possibly get honestly i learned a

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.210
lot in college night i'd never learned
as much as they did in the one month

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.460
that i was in europe and i've traveled
all throughout europe and you just get

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.559
the sense of

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:58.949
how small you are how little you know if
you kind of develop this thirst for

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.210
uh... enlightenment and not like formal
higher education i'm talking about you

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.360
wanna learn more about the world today
and she studied with roots in bombay yes

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.150
i mean if they don't do you say that's
the thing that's why i think maybe it

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.019
means to me being ok with thirty eight

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:14.419
your district and the messages

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.580
their you've been learning about where
you where you are long mojave you know

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.810
how it came to be

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.709
and by the maybe there's future as
recently as about connected

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:26.829
but i mean if you there may be that
there's some kind of easter so if you

00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:30.529
happen the way you know there's a new
study engineering

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.969
or you can there are no plans available
right isn't that yeah it makes sense to

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.829
going out to a study european history
right an annual i'm not knocking on a

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:41.589
major airline hope you guys understand
that the only thing i'm saying is that

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:45.409
regardless of how hard it is too early
to greater major how important are major

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:49.519
might be it's not one of those
profitable majors rights so it's very

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:54.079
smart for her to go to affordable
college to get her at masters degree as

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:57.209
opposed to stay in the united states
racking up the tremendous amount of

00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:01.289
student loans and then working as a
professor anti-big keep in mind

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.820
professors are really getting hired very
much right now

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.010
and not be able to pearson loans that
would be a disaster
