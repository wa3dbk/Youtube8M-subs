00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.800
How to recover your device

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.020
Before you start

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.980
Your device has to be charged for at least 2 hours to make sure it has enough battery power to go into the recovery mode.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.960
Connect the USB cable that came with your device to your computer, but do not connect the USB cable to your device yet.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:43.080
You should plug the USB cable directly into a USB port on your computer, and not into a USB hub or USB port on a keyboard or monitor.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.020
You cannot use the windscreen mount to connect your device to the computer.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.460
Switch on your navigation device.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.120
While your device is switched on,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.120
press and hold the power button until the device shows white text

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.900
This can take 10 seconds or more.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.540
When the white text is displayed, quickly press and release the power button 3 times in quick succession.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.740
Getting the timing right is one of the critical steps of this process.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.700
The screen goes black, and after a few seconds the device reboots into recovery mode.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.440
Quickly connect the USB cable to your navigation device while the wheel is spinning.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.460
As soon as your device is connected to the computer,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.160
MyDrive Connect starts restoring the software on your device.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.060
You can check the progress in MyDrive Connect.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.100
The recovery process can take between 5 and 30 minutes, depending on your internet connection.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.400
Leave the device connected to the computer whilst your device restarts.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.500
Once you see the map screen, you can disconnect your device from the computer and use it as normal again.
