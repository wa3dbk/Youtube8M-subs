00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.600
Old godzilla was hoppin' around

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.660
Tokyo city like a big playground

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.020
When suddenly Batman burst from the shade

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.720
And hit Godzilla with a bat grenade

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.820
Godzilla got pissed and began to attack

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.840
But didn't expect to be blocked by Shaq

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.380
Who proceeded to open up a can of Shaq-fu

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.380
When Aaron Carter came out of the blue

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.380
And he started beating up Shaquille 'o' Neal

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.380
Then they both got flattened by the batmobile

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.380
But before it could make it back to the batcave

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.380
Abraham Lincoln popped out of his grave

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.380
And took an AK-47 out from under his hat

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.380
And blew Batman away with a ratatattat

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.740
But he ran out of bullets and he ran away

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.100
because Optimus Prime came to save the day

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.080
This is the ultimate showdown

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.900
Of ultimate destiny

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.440
Good guys, bad guys, and explosions

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.080
as far as the eye can see

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.200
And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be?

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.800
This is the ultimate showdown

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.540
Of ultimate destiny

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.320
Godzilla took a bite out of Optimus Prime

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.300
Like Scruff McGruff took a bite out of crime

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.500
And then Shaq came back covered in a tire track

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.520
But Jackie Chan jumped out and landed on his back

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.700
And Batman was injured and trying to get steady

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.700
when Abraham Lincoln came back with a machete

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.780
But suddenly something caught his leg and he tripped

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.840
Indiana Jones took him out with his whip

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.260
Then saw Godzilla sneaking up from behind

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.280
And he reached for his gun which he just couldn't find

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.520
'Cause Batman stole it and he shot and he missed

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.440
And Jackie chan deflected it with his fist

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.720
Then he jumped in the air and did a somersault

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.700
But Abraham Lincoln tried to pole vault onto Optimus Prime

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.860
But they collided in the air

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.200
then they both got hit by a Care Bear stare

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.900
This is the ultimate showdown

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.580
Of ultimate destiny

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.020
Good guys, bad guys, and explosions

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.000
as far as the eye can see

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.960
And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.880
This is the ultimate showdown

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.560
Angel sang out in immaculate Chorus

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.240
Down from the heavens descended Chuck Norris

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.920
Who delivered a kick which could shatter bones

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.380
into the crotch

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.120
of Indiana Jones

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.860
Who fell over on the ground

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.560
Writhing in pain

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.380
as Batman changed back into Bruce Wayne

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.960
But Chuck saw through his clever disguise

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.020
And he crushed Batman's head in between his thighs

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.540
Then Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.500
and Monty Python and the Holy Grails Black knight

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.760
And Benito Mussolini and the Blue Meanie

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.180
And Cowboy Curtis and Jambi the Genie

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.160
Robocop, The Terminator

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.300
Captain Kirk, and Darth Vader

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.240
Low-Pan, Superman

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.400
every single Power Ranger

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.280
Bill S. Preston, and Theodore Logan

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.320
Spock, The Rock, Doc Oct, and Hulk Hogan

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.420
All came out of nowhere lighting-fast

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.600
And they kicked Chuck Norris in his Cowboy ass

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.660
It was the bloodiest battle that the world ever saw

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.900
With civilians looking on in total awe

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.960
The fight raged on for a century

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.980
Many lives were claimed, but eventually

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.300
The champion stood, the rest saw their better

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.780
Mr.Rogers in a blood-stained sweater

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.520
This is the ultimate showdown

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.060
Of ultimate destiny

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.220
Good guys, bad guys, and explosions

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.120
As far as the eye can see

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.880
And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be?

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.060
This is the ultimate showdown

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.440
This is the ultimate showdown

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.360
This is the ultimate showdown

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.260
Of ultimate destiny
