00:00:06.917 --> 00:00:09.500
SPEAKER: We're going to show you
how to remove your door panel

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.870
on your '87 to '93 Mustang, ,
because you have to remove this

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.430
panel to get to
just about anything.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.570
There are door lock actuators,
window motors, you name it.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.350
Really simple.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.891
You need a Phillips
head screwdriver,

00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:23.500
a nut driver with a 3/8 socket,
and a door panel removal

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.430
tool, available
off of our website.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.740
Start by removing the
Phillips head screw

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.750
holding on the
mirror hole cover.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.740
 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.030
Then, remove the single
Phillips head screw

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.960
holding on the inner
door handle bezel.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:52.690
 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.800
And the Phillips
head screw holding

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.885
on the base of the
speaker grille.

00:00:56.885 --> 00:01:02.690
 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.080
Now you've got two Phillips
head screws, one at the front,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.967
and one at the back
of your door armrest.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:09.175
Going ahead and remove those.

00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:30.480
 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.510
Then grab you a small,
flat-blade screwdriver,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.415
and you can remove your
door armrest hole plugs.

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:48.315
 

00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:48.815
OK.

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:51.740
Then you can grab
your 3/8 socket

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.040
and remove the
two bolts that are

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.980
remaining, holding
on the arm rest.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:15.380
 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.160
Then you can lift up
on the armrest, out,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.990
and pull it away from
the door, and you've

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.645
got two electrical connectors
that you need to undo.

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:38.577
 

00:02:38.577 --> 00:02:42.990
And then you can move the
arm rest out of the way.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.710
Grab your door
panel removal tool

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.210
and work your way around the
perimeter of the door panel.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.360
You've got 12 plastic clips
that retain this poor panel

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.217
to the door.

00:02:52.217 --> 00:03:03.151
 

00:03:03.151 --> 00:03:06.470
Some of them may not
be holding on anymore.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.120
Just remove the ones that are.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.940
 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.440
And once all your
clips are loose,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.810
you can lift up
on the door panel,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.350
and pull it off of the car.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.370
And now you have full access
to everything inside the door

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.390
that you're going to
need to repair, or just

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.730
to replace your panel.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.430
