Hey guys! Alright, this video is my first
segment in drugstore growth aids; so if

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.789
you just started a hair journey or your
starting hair journey, not really sure

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.180
where to start with growth aids, or if
you just want something really quick

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.710
just to take a vitamin just to you know
get yourself acclimated to the world of

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.170
growth aids. My first product that I
really wanted to talk about its my -- my

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.040
favorite one actually, it's prenatal
vitamins. I have two that I'm going to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.149
show today, just because I was pregnant;
and I was taking them when I was not

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.750
pregnant years ago when I was in college.
This is the one I actually love the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.570
most, just because it comes in a gummy
form; and it's Vitafusion prenatal and

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.550
there are 90 gummies in here, but you
take two a day so it lasts for 45 days,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.960
basically a month and a half; and they
are normal size. You can see them at the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.430
bottom there little squares; so they're
not bad, they do taste really good. They

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.040
have flavors in here but I can't ever
tell the difference in the flavors, they

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.460
just all taste the same to me; and here's
the supplemental facts for you guys, so you can

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.250
see that right there -- it does have
great stuff in it with all the different

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.549
vitamins and whatnot, but if you'll
notice, it does NOT contain biotin. In

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:32.700
this the one that I was prescribed, when
I was pregnant is by Prefera OB so you guys

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.520
can see that biotin is in this one. You do
need a prescription for these, but even

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.360
though it sounds like you know it's
medicine it's not, it's just a vitamin;

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.079
but here they are right here and these are 
actually softgels. I personally don't --

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.520
didn't like taking these. I only took
them for my second trimester and they're

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.820
actually purple you can't really tell
but they're purple and they smell like an

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.810
orange chocolate, so they smell really
good. I just don't like taking vitamins

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.439
this size. Whenever you're taking a
prenatal vitamin, what happens is

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.780
basically it's a vitamin for you, I'm
going to take --

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.509
your body is taking everything that it is
supposed to take in. The growth aid part

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.980
of it kicks in when it takes in more
than what it needs to -- basically your

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.920
body takes in as much as it can, and
that's where the growth is attributed;

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.540
and then anything extra from the
prenatal vitamin is what your body just

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.739
gets rid of -- so keep in mind taking growth
aids, you really need to take water

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.280
-- if it has biotin in it -- you probably -- you might break out

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.120
depending on your skin type. This, I took
this in college; and this is kind of one

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.860
of the first things that I took when I
was -- before I even understood what a hair

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.340
journey was -- it was a shock to my system, so
it [my hair] grew like an inch; but after that I

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.880
really didn't see a difference with
growth in my third trimester. Basically,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.260
my hair, if you guys remember my bra
strap length video, my hair was just at

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.930
the 3, just below the 3, and in the video I
just posted last week, if you guys want

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.450
to check that out, my hair -- it's at the
4. So, my hair on average grows half an

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.190
inch or quarter inch to half an inch a
month, so that's pretty accurate for 4

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.350
months to get an inch this really didn't
grow my hair a whole lot. But, I do

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.890
recommend it, because I really did like these; not just
because they're gummies, but just because

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.110
it does work with the healthiness. With
the PreferaOB, the ones that were

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.910
prescribed that actually contain biotin,
I took these in the second trimester and

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.920
that was right -- in my bra strap length
video -- was at the very end of my second

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.019
trimester. As soon as I had my third
trimester -- so this really did help but it

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.640
does have biotin in it, so that's
basically why. These do have a lot of

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.390
great vitamins that actually help with
your hair growth, but if it had biotin

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.709
in it, I probably would've seen growth in
my third trimester. It was normal growth.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.930
But, it was healthy growth; so if you guys
have any questions, of course, comment,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.340
like, subscribe. Leave anything down below;
and yeah so like I said this is the first

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.239
segment. My next two videos on drugstore
growth aids will be coming up in next

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.300
