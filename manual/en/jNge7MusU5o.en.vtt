00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.147
Hi everybody, this is Eddie from Eddie is Toy Crazy and I have my playmat, right?

00:00:04.147 --> 00:00:04.647
Yep, you sure do!

00:00:09.594 --> 00:00:13.194
And a whole bunch of stuff and I added Take n Play track.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.820
I made it a little bit off the carpet.

00:00:16.404 --> 00:00:19.124
It's not big enough, we need more carpet!

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:23.025
And super glue or tape them together, right?

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.819
Super glue them? Oh, the carpets?

00:00:27.502 --> 00:00:29.262
Just need a bigger carpet.

00:00:34.207 --> 00:00:35.327
We need a big, big

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:36.684
There's his Tidmoth Sheds and his other island

00:00:40.897 --> 00:00:41.937
His engine wash

00:00:44.257 --> 00:00:46.417
Tunnel, that's a hanger, right?

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.936
This goes to the airport set.

00:00:55.194 --> 00:00:57.274
This is what he has set up today.

00:00:57.274 --> 00:01:00.289
Every day is a different adventure with Eddie and his trains.

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:06.332
Well, let's do it!

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.813
He's playing with Chuggington on his Take a long set.

00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:14.765
Let's see if they connect. Should we?

00:01:21.708 --> 00:01:25.308
Nope, it's not metal. We just need a bigger connector.

00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:31.376
Ooooh! Look what happened!

00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:34.154
Show them how that turntable works. That's pretty cool.

00:01:34.943 --> 00:01:37.023
Should I bring an engine? Yeah.

00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:43.677
I'm gonna bring out Colby. He's number 4 for some reason.

00:01:43.677 --> 00:01:47.463
I though Gordon was number 4. (laughs) 4 is my lucky number.

00:01:51.223 --> 00:01:53.543
You just move these things around.

00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:00.801
Well, how does it go? How does it go into one of the sheds?

00:02:02.877 --> 00:02:04.717
It's easy. Well, let's see.

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:09.313
You can pick a berth. And then, you put it in!

00:02:12.413 --> 00:02:13.053
Goodbye!

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:14.628
Now he's locked!

00:02:14.628 --> 00:02:16.253
He said, "hey, where did everybody go?"

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.180
What else you got here?

00:02:25.388 --> 00:02:27.308
Oh, can I show you something?

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.000
We got a tunnel over here.

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.859
Look, we have LEGO stuff over there for some reason.

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:45.247
Watch this. Do you want to see how this goes?

00:02:45.818 --> 00:02:49.498
It came with different stuff, but I can't find all of it.

00:02:51.515 --> 00:02:53.115
The signal! The signal!

00:02:59.536 --> 00:03:01.616
Ahhh! He's stuck on the signal!

00:03:03.512 --> 00:03:05.672
How about Henry without tender?

00:03:09.328 --> 00:03:09.828
Uh oh!

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.319
Get out of my way!

00:03:15.336 --> 00:03:16.936
I'm gonna do something.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.360
Crash!

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:30.353
(crashing noises) Eddie is crazy!

00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:36.346
That didn't look good, did it?

00:03:37.142 --> 00:03:38.742
Oh no! Lion on the track!

00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:44.045
OH no! Here comes Stanley.

00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:45.588
Where's the lion? I don't see it.

00:03:46.138 --> 00:03:47.338
Oh no, there it is!

00:03:58.858 --> 00:03:59.738
No more lion!

00:04:05.057 --> 00:04:06.497
Ooh! I got a good idea.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.559
What is that? Police officer hot wheel.

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.279
Chugga, chugga!

00:04:31.406 --> 00:04:34.366
OH no! Grandpa! He can't get it off the track!

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:36.775
He better not hurt grandpa's car! Oh no!

00:04:43.743 --> 00:04:44.243
Uh oh!

00:04:44.536 --> 00:04:46.776
That better not be grandpa's car!

00:04:48.407 --> 00:04:48.967
It's not

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:54.469
The wrong way! Look!

00:04:54.788 --> 00:04:56.468
Aaaaah! That's very cool

00:04:57.673 --> 00:04:59.033
It's a pull and zoom.

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:00.850
And it works on Take n Play track.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.285
You know when it was released?

00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:04.410
When? It was realeased I think either in

00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:06.981
2012, 2011 or 10!

00:05:09.138 --> 00:05:10.818
Can I show you something?

00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:15.981
I have the slow sign but this can not go slow.

00:05:17.096 --> 00:05:18.456
He can't go slow? No.

00:05:20.927 --> 00:05:23.167
Oh! He doesn't want to get washed!

00:05:24.027 --> 00:05:26.827
Look. He has Sir Toppam Hat in the caboose.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.570
He keeps going off of the track.

00:05:32.793 --> 00:05:34.793
It's because he has to go slow!

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:37.589
Can I tell you something really awesome?

00:05:44.467 --> 00:05:48.547
Can I show you something? Is it going to be something awesome?

00:05:48.547 --> 00:05:49.047
Oh no!

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.200
Watch out!

00:06:05.337 --> 00:06:06.937
I'm getting Spiderman.

00:06:06.937 --> 00:06:08.573
Spiderman can kick their butts.

00:06:15.635 --> 00:06:16.435
Where is he?

00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:22.991
OK. I will show you something.

00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:24.345
One more thing. What's he gonna do?

00:06:24.754 --> 00:06:29.634
OK. "Oh, what a beautiful day. I am just gonna sit down on the train track".

00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:39.041
Sitting on the train track can not be a good idea.

00:06:41.378 --> 00:06:43.858
Oh, this is not going to be a good idea.

00:06:47.204 --> 00:06:48.004
Look. Uh oh.

00:06:52.086 --> 00:06:53.366
Bye bye Spiderman.

00:07:00.926 --> 00:07:01.426
Its

00:07:01.426 --> 00:07:01.926
It's a me...Mario

00:07:06.073 --> 00:07:07.033
Good bye Mario

00:07:07.842 --> 00:07:10.642
