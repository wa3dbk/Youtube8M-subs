00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.430
Prejudice is a terrible thing.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.540
It clouds judgement and results in flame wars,
console wars, cola wars and - most horrifying

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.170
of all - real wars.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.450
So I’m going to go ahead and address the
elephant in the room, so to speak: This game

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.820
is full of furries.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.400
Anime-lookin’ furries, at that.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.310
It’s a JRPG full to the brim of anthropomorphic
cats and dogs.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.720
But I’m going to implore you, don’t hit
that Thumbs Down button until you heard me

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.480
out: Solatorobo is pretty kickass.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.970
Think you can hold out another three and a
half minutes?

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.820
Then let’s begin.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.219
First off, the name.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.270
Yeah, it’s ten letters and pretty weird.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.190
But in Japanese, it just means “Sky and
Robots.”

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.670
And that’s a pretty apt description of what
this game’s about: Airships and various

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.770
flavors of ride armor.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.840
Your protagonist, the eternally bone-chewing
Red, pilots a suit called the Dahak, apparently

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.420
named after that dude in Xena: Warrior Princess.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.960
And here’s where things get a little off
the rails: Rather than shooting or punching

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.300
enemies, this armor’s primary means of attack
involves picking up and throwing foes, snatching

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.950
enemy ordnance right out of the air and throwing
it back, or - during aerial combat - DOING

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.410
A BARREL ROLL and ramming the bastards out
of the sky.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:48.759
To this end, the capacity of this armor is
quantified in terms of Attack, Defense, and

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.569
Mobility, as well as Hydraulics, viz the lifting
strength of the Dahak itself.

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.610
Better Hydraulics means faster flipping of
foes, and consequently less time you’re

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.380
left open to counterattack.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.700
Once an enemy is launched helplessly into
the air, you can grab it again and bounce

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.380
it off a wall, the floor, or another hostile
unit, at which point it bounces again and

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.020
can be re-thrown, if you’re swift enough
and can avoid any oncoming fire.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.880
I realise I’m spending a lot of time discussing
the mechanics, but given their unique nature,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.630
I think it’s worth it.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.030
You can call this an RPG all day long, and
there are stats and EXP to be sure, but the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.570
player takes a much more active role.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.420
Rather reminds me of the Megaman Battle Network
series, come to mention it.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.700
Said stats are augmented through the Customization
menu, where you can install upgrades in a

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.330
grid, expandable through the use of points
found during your adventure.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.070
Here you can Tetris together a chunk of power-ups
suited to your own fighting style... further

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:49.250
evoking the Battle Network series.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.190
These power-ups will carry your armor through
the quests, tasks, and plot required to establish

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.140
Red as a leading Hunter, as well as solving
the mystery behind the mysterious child you

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.310
rescued during the game’s prologue, a robbery-I-mean-investigation
interrupted by the emergence of a colossal

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.510
stone beast.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.790
While the dialogue’s well-written, the only
vocal snippets are largely-unintelligible

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.490
outbursts of what could be Japanese, French,
or German, depending on how you squint your

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.490
ears.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.150
But regardless of how you parse it, know this:
It’s a better game than prejudice would

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.810
let you believe.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.030
Hairballs aside, it’s a nice return to the
JRPGs of old - linear plot with lots of sidequests

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.930
to explore - while being mechanically innovative
and genuinely interesting.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.410
Thanks for being good little girls and boys;
you may now pass judgement.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.350
I’m going to be over here, continuing to
have fun on a mech, while you do so.
