00:00:02.183 --> 00:00:03.720
- [Voiceover] So systolic heart failure,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.741
your heart can't pump
as hard as it used to

00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:08.017
and so it doesn't
squeeze as much blood out

00:00:08.017 --> 00:00:10.082
and it doesn't meet the body's demands.

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:11.639
It's called systolic heart failure

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.055
because we're talking about systole,

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:14.715
which is the phase of the cardiac cycle

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.132
where the heart contracts and ejects blood

00:00:17.132 --> 00:00:19.220
to either the body or the lungs.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.553
You can sort of think of it
like squeezing a water bottle

00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:22.714
and squeezing the water out.

00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:24.676
It's the same sort of
thing except with the heart

00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:27.363
it's actually squeezing blood instead.

00:00:27.363 --> 00:00:30.876
So systolic heart failure,
this force of contraction,

00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:33.547
or this squeezing force is a lot lower.

00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:36.141
And sometimes we say
that has lowered inotropy

00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:39.360
which just means the force
of muscle contraction.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.939
And we're just going to talk
about the ventricular inotropy,

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:43.797
which is the strength of these ventricles

00:00:43.797 --> 00:00:45.532
or these bigger chambers.

00:00:45.532 --> 00:00:47.505
So now think about
squeezing that same bottle,

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.992
but just pinching it
instead with two fingers.

00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:51.880
You can imagine it's
going to be a lot harder

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.822
to squeeze the water out, right?

00:00:53.822 --> 00:00:55.557
Well it's the same thing
with weakened muscles.

00:00:55.557 --> 00:00:56.637
If they're smaller and weaker,

00:00:56.637 --> 00:00:58.850
it's going to be way
harder to squeeze blood out

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.491
and your stroke volume
is going to be reduced

00:01:00.491 --> 00:01:01.919
and your body's not going
to get as much blood

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:03.471
as it used to.

00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:06.561
And this is all due to
this weakened heart muscle.

00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:09.278
But how does that muscle get weakened.

00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:12.556
Well it's usually caused by
some kind of underlying disease

00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:15.131
that causes the death
of cardiac muscle cells

00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:17.261
or cardiomyocytes.

00:01:18.823 --> 00:01:20.590
So I'm going to draw a few
of these cardiomyocytes

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.491
and basically they're
kind of holding hands,

00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:26.007
so when they contract they
end up pulling on each other.

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.040
And when they pull on each
other they get a little smaller

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.965
and this is what causes
that squeezing motion,

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:33.441
but what if a couple of these cells died?

00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.156
I mean, obviously they're
not going to pull as hard

00:01:35.156 --> 00:01:37.456
and you're not going to get
as good of a squeezing motion

00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:39.232
and your heart's not going
to eject as much blood

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:41.333
as it used to.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.958
So if you just look at
this heart and compare it

00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.548
to a healthy heart, you'll
see that these walls

00:01:45.548 --> 00:01:48.949
are way thinner and these
ventricles are way bigger.

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:50.272
These are classic signs of a heart

00:01:50.272 --> 00:01:51.981
with systolic heart failure.

00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:56.208
So what are some of these
underlying diseases?

00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:59.112
Well you've essentially
got four categories.

00:01:59.112 --> 00:02:01.949
And the first category
is heart muscle diseases

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:02.914
and a lot of times we're just going

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:05.191
to call those cardiomyopathies.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.408
You can essentially break
that down into cardio

00:02:07.408 --> 00:02:09.614
which means heart, myo which is muscle,

00:02:09.614 --> 00:02:11.956
and pathy which means disease.

00:02:11.956 --> 00:02:15.320
But typically with these, the
cause is going to be unknown,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.937
but in general they tend
to weaken the heart muscle

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.486
and make it harder to pump blood.

00:02:21.206 --> 00:02:23.313
The second category isn't
as straight forward.

00:02:23.313 --> 00:02:25.530
It's going to be reduced blood supply,

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.771
but I'm not talking about
the blood supply to the body,

00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:30.828
I'm actually talking
about to the heart itself.

00:02:31.578 --> 00:02:34.191
And so coronary artery
disease is a huge cause

00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:36.740
of systolic heart failure
because the coronaries

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.562
are what supply your heart with blood.

00:02:40.082 --> 00:02:41.574
So let's get some of
this stuff out of the way

00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:44.511
and move these guys over here

00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:45.951
and then I'm going to draw some vessels

00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:47.693
going to the heart muscle cells.

00:02:47.693 --> 00:02:49.631
These are going to be
our coronary arteries,

00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:51.034
well I guess there's just one,

00:02:51.034 --> 00:02:53.297
so it's a coronary artery.

00:02:53.897 --> 00:02:55.273
So usually you have blood coming down

00:02:55.273 --> 00:02:58.664
and giving oxygen to these muscle cells,

00:02:58.664 --> 00:03:00.730
but with coronary artery
disease you have this narrowing

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.605
of the vessel because
of a buildup of plaque

00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:05.701
and that buildup reduces the blood supply

00:03:05.701 --> 00:03:08.608
to the muscle cells and
those cells start to die off

00:03:08.608 --> 00:03:10.820
and as we're well aware,
this is not a good thing

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.792
because when muscle cells die off

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:16.804
your muscle gets weaker and
makes it harder to pump blood.

00:03:17.674 --> 00:03:20.489
If we go one step further and
that plaque builds up so much

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.292
that it completely obstructs
or blocks that vessel

00:03:24.292 --> 00:03:26.853
then none of those cells
get any oxygen at all

00:03:26.853 --> 00:03:29.371
and really they all end up dying off.

00:03:29.371 --> 00:03:32.087
This is really serious because
you can get whole areas

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:34.978
of cells that die and
also why heart attack

00:03:34.978 --> 00:03:38.530
is a major contributor to
systolic heart failure.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.874
Alrighty, so the third class of diseases

00:03:41.874 --> 00:03:44.451
are actually valve diseases.

00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:45.961
So your heart has four valves.

00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:48.224
Two valves that separate
the upper and lower chambers

00:03:48.224 --> 00:03:51.011
and then two valves that
separate the lower chambers

00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:52.485
from wherever the blood's going to,

00:03:52.485 --> 00:03:54.726
either the body or the lungs.

00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:56.548
So if we start with the
valves that separate

00:03:56.548 --> 00:03:58.510
the two chambers, we
can talk about something

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.345
called regurgitation.

00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:02.260
And this just means
that the lower chambers

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.635
are letting blood go back
into the upper chambers.

00:04:05.635 --> 00:04:07.511
So if we just watch this heart beat,

00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:11.048
usually those valves close
when the blood's pumped out,

00:04:11.048 --> 00:04:13.626
but regurgitation means
that the valves stay open

00:04:13.626 --> 00:04:16.180
just a little bit and let
some of the blood go back

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.651
into the upper chambers.

00:04:18.664 --> 00:04:20.714
Now blood is still pumped out,

00:04:20.714 --> 00:04:22.484
but some is allowed to go
into the upper chambers

00:04:22.484 --> 00:04:25.049
and so naturally you lose
the blood that's going

00:04:25.049 --> 00:04:26.826
into the upper chambers and less blood

00:04:26.826 --> 00:04:28.765
is pumped to the body.

00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:32.164
If we think about our favorite
water bottle analogy again,

00:04:32.164 --> 00:04:34.943
but this time there's this
like hole on the side,

00:04:34.943 --> 00:04:36.044
every time you squeeze it,

00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:37.344
most of the water goes out,

00:04:37.344 --> 00:04:40.001
but some's going to leak out the hole.

00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:41.663
And since now we're pumping less blood,

00:04:41.663 --> 00:04:43.462
the heart has to work harder to maintain

00:04:43.462 --> 00:04:46.035
that same level as it had before

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:47.978
and more work costs more oxygen,

00:04:47.978 --> 00:04:49.801
but with heart failure,
that's the whole thing,

00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:52.085
we can't supply more oxygen

00:04:52.085 --> 00:04:55.025
and more cells die off as a result.

00:04:57.975 --> 00:04:59.321
The other valve disease has to do with

00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:00.563
these other two valves.

00:05:00.563 --> 00:05:03.165
It's called stenosis and
that means that the blood

00:05:03.165 --> 00:05:05.218
is being pumped out through
this smaller opening,

00:05:05.218 --> 00:05:07.818
which makes it a lot harder to pump blood.

00:05:10.498 --> 00:05:12.409
Well I guess, let's look
at our water bottle,

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.497
but this time let's have our
nozzle being super small.

00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:16.862
Just think about trying
to squeeze it through

00:05:16.862 --> 00:05:18.058
that smaller nozzle.

00:05:18.058 --> 00:05:20.282
It's going to be a lot harder, right?

00:05:20.282 --> 00:05:21.959
Well it turns out it's also a lot harder

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:23.724
for your heart muscles to squeeze blood

00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:25.341
through a smaller opening.

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:27.018
And the same way as regurgitation,

00:05:27.018 --> 00:05:28.703
now the heart has to
work harder to maintain

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:30.433
the same blood supply

00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:33.857
and more work equals more
oxygen that can't be supplied,

00:05:33.857 --> 00:05:35.792
so more cells die off.

00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.279
Alright, last one.

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.145
This one's arrhythmias, which
means abnormal heart rhythm.

00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:44.504
This could be a rhythm
that's either too slow

00:05:44.504 --> 00:05:48.087
or maybe too fast or even uncoordinated.

00:05:48.087 --> 00:05:50.184
And uncoordinated, that
just means that the chambers

00:05:50.184 --> 00:05:52.526
don't contract at the same time.

00:05:52.526 --> 00:05:54.384
Usually they would
contract at the same time,

00:05:54.384 --> 00:05:56.857
but maybe now the left
one's going before the right

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:59.603
or the right one's going before the left.

00:06:00.063 --> 00:06:02.382
Either way, all these lead
to a serious reduction

00:06:02.382 --> 00:06:05.076
in pumping efficiency,
which means less blood

00:06:05.076 --> 00:06:06.973
is pumped to the body.

00:06:06.973 --> 00:06:08.361
And by kind of the same mechanisms

00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:10.962
as we talked about before, the more work

00:06:10.962 --> 00:06:14.399
means more oxygen demand
and more cell death.

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:16.415
So we start to see this pattern, right?

00:06:16.415 --> 00:06:19.050
Where each one reduces the pumping ability

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.459
and this makes it a lot
harder for the heart

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:22.641
to maintain the same supply.

00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:24.998
And those cells that work
harder will demand more oxygen,

00:06:24.998 --> 00:06:26.693
but the oxygen can't be supplied

00:06:26.693 --> 00:06:28.701
and those muscle cells die off.

00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:30.733
And when they die off
the heart gets weaker

00:06:30.733 --> 00:06:34.303
and your pumping ability
is lowered even more.

00:06:35.023 --> 00:06:37.898
So we see that pumping
ability is really important.

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:39.556
And one way we can measure pumping ability

00:06:39.556 --> 00:06:41.598
is by the ejection fraction,

00:06:41.598 --> 00:06:44.970
which is the percentage of
blood ejected with each beat.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.486
So if we look at our water bottle,

00:06:48.486 --> 00:06:50.862
we can take the total volume filled

00:06:50.862 --> 00:06:54.165
and then we can also take
the total volume ejected

00:06:54.785 --> 00:06:56.860
and then if we divide the volume ejected

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.986
by the total volume filled,

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:01.993
and then I guess multiply it
by 100 to get the percent,

00:07:01.993 --> 00:07:04.304
you get your ejection fraction.

00:07:05.254 --> 00:07:07.259
And usually we just talk
about the ejection fraction

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:09.915
for the left ventricle,
when it is possible to look

00:07:09.915 --> 00:07:12.722
at your right ventricle
ejection fraction too.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:17.411
A normal range is about 55 to 70%

00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:19.400
and abnormal range would
be considered anything

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.723
between 40 and 55% and then
evidence for heart failure

00:07:23.723 --> 00:07:26.186
is anything under 40%.
