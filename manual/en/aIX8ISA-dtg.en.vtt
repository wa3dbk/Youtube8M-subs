00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.440
Uhh...hup!

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.360
Hey Monty.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.080
Hey Miles.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.900
How ya doin'?

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.800
Pretty good. Whatcha doing?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.640
Uh, well, I heard that today's RWBY production diary

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.700
was going to be focusing on artwork and such

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.680
so I figured I'd make a masterpiece of my own.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.720
Why don't you tell the audience a little bit about what we're gonna be seeing today.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.480
That's right.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.840
This week, we're going to be focusing on concept, design, and modeling.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.940
Miles: We're also going to be taking a look back

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.080
at Velvet Scarlatina's battle gear design.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.580
Taking it from concept, to modeling, and to places unknown.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.000
-We're really trying to cram art into every second in today's episode
-Monty: Yes.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.200
which is why I made this.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.840
It's-- it's team RWBY.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.960
Monty: Beautiful.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.660
Miles: Thank you.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.400
Monty: RWBY as a show, it needs to be a very unique blend of

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.440
fantasy and reality, but to keep it slightly above normal design I often add

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.400
just a-- a touch of fantasy to them, so it very often lands into, like,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.220
um...contemporary or modern design plus.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.080
Having a winner for the Velvet design contest, we knew that it would be subtle changes

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.400
that will compliment her weapon, compliment the rest of her team.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.760
It really works for her 'cause it's very simple.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.640
It's very nice, like, she has the bits of armor and stuff on her that denounce battle

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.800
but she's still...delicate, I guess is the way I'd put it.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.640
Velvet's actually a mage

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.060
so it makes sense to have that elvish kind of armor to her, that fancy, but

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.100
dainty, delicate kind of armor to her.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.340
So it really lends well to her character. Nobody else in the kingdom has an outfit like this.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.260
The only thing we change is the color, 'cause we wanted to have a warmer air about her

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.400
so we changed it from green to a brown.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.500
Monty: In considering the rest of her team

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.940
I needed something that matched it more, and also

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.180
although I really like the original color scheme, it...it was a little too bright for her.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.780
We can build on simplicity, we can make-- and if that simplicity, in the beginning, is great

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.880
then there's very little that we do with it.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.940
Monty: It can-- it sustains these minor changes that none of the designers could've anticipated

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.200
it's like we know what the character is, we know where we want it to go, we know what she wields.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.520
Yeah, we loved where it was going, so it was just taking us to go

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.700
"alright, what can we do to just push it just a bit more to make her what we think of Velvet

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.460
and what we think she's gonna be."

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.700
So next up we'll be taking this process into actually making the 3D model

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.200
which I'm actually-- it's happening right over there.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.500
Right now I'm working on the Velvet model.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.280
We get a concept for the character, though most of it's already there for us

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.420
and we just have to translate that into 3D

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.740
but it's a 2D image, so when we bring that into 3D we have to make sure that from every angle

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.400
that character comes through.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.140
Now that I've layed out all the polygons onto a flat surface

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.780
I'm...coloring those polygons in Photoshop.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.660
This screen here is...shows like all the polygons layed out flat and organized into a square texture

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.180
'cause each one of those polygons on the flat surface represents a polygon on the 3D model

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.380
that way I can just paint on in a flat image and that'll transfer over to the 3d model

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.200
and it'll take all the color information from that texture, that flat texture

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.080
and show it on the 3D model.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.200
When you look at a design, you have to take into consideration the fact that this person

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.560
will also be moving.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.300
Even-- I'd even say to the non-winners of the Velvet design contest, there weren't losers.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.380
There were a lot of winners among them, but there can only be one we choose.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.540
(laughs) So this is what her weapon's gonna be in

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.380
we're not showing the weapon yet...'cause--

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.080
Patrick: Yeah, no.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.580
You're not gonna see that yet, but we need something--

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.940
we need something for her to carry it in.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.800
-The weapon is in the case.
-Patrick: Yeah.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.120
Gimme that case right now, just-- maybe a little thinner?

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.080
I don't know, it's just like...feels unwieldy. Yeah, that's right.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.840
We talked a LOT about like straps and stuff and like how many pieces like--

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.140
Patrick: The belt is just mainly the decorations, we'll put pouches on the belts and stuff like that.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.560
Yeah. Practicality for pouches is always important to me, so maybe she'll have a few pouches?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.260
Patrick: Yeah.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.920
But, the weapon itself, I'd say all--fit--would-- I gonna try my damnedest to fit it all in that box

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.760
and she just wears it around her shoulder.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.580
Patrick: The personality doesn't only come from the characters, but it comes from the weapons.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.720
And...the way they lend themselves to each other is...very unique.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.760
The weapons tend to be a pretty big part of RWBY.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.260
People were able to identify very early on unique aspects of some of the weapons.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.420
One of the earliest ideas I had was a

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.180
giant, like, high-caliber sniper rifle with a blade attached, where it would use the kick

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.320
and when firing the scythe whilst the blade is hooked on an enemy, the kick from the gun would just

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.800
you know, take that blade and just like (explosion noise) like pull it through an enemy.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.120
"Whoa! Is that a scythe?"

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.880
"It's also a customizable,  high-impact sniper rifle."

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.000
Monty: The first version of the sniper-scythe is very similar to one of those giant sniper rifles you see in modern day.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.040
I was like, "well, if I just attach a blade to this, I'm gonna get what I want."

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.540
The final version of Crescent Rose that you see

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.320
I took the barrel-end of it and turned it sideways because it matched the vertical shape of it more?

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.100
And so, in it's open form it looks like this. In it's neutral form it folds up to about this.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.920
You know, when I think of the four girls as a team, I almost look at it as if it were an RPG.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.740
So, they compliment each other in that they fill out a bunch of different classes that I would want on my RPG team?

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.520
People are gonna see some familiar locations that we visited in volume one, but we've already updated the look a little bit further.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.140
The world of RWBY as a whole has evolved since last volume, it's gonna be kinda neat to see what everybody thinks about that.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.360
Monty: When we had the need to have a concept artist for environments

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.860
I had one person in mind, and it was Kristina.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.440
This year you're art director because we need a lot more hands-on and the environments are looking so much better now.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.080
Kristina: I work one-on-one, mostly with the modelers.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.320
It gets the job done really quick 'cause I get to see their progress

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.160
and then I can do-- I can ask them to do a really quick color change. If that's not working they can change it

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.420
I learned a lot from just...seeing how the modelers work, too, and how they can work with me

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.160
so they don't have do to, like, too many big changes.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.660
"Now that you're awake, we can officially begin our first order of business!"

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.820
"Decorating!"

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.240
My job is to model and texture anything that

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.640
that doesn't have to do with characters or creatures

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.280
so, basically all buildings, some of the vehicles.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.900
RWBY hits a very unique note where it's an animated show where everything's done in 3D

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:17.340
so I kinda have to, like, find an area where the art can actually sustain the concept.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.820
Just communicate very-- very simply

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.600
Monty: Yeah
Kristina: not too much distraction in the background

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.220
'cause I like to-- in my environment I like to communicate more with just silhouettes and shapes.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.580
The thing that I understood from his less-is-more type design is that, in RWBY

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.020
it's very...a flat, but very colorful type of show.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.660
It's not simplistic. In texture-wise, there's no real textures, it's mostly like gradients

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.800
and that kinda good stuff so you get all these really

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.540
...I guess the word for it is emotional, kind of colors to the show, or into each setting?

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.560
César: This is New Vale. The textures have been reworked. This season we decided to

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.920
give a little more focus to the characters, so the coloring-- not just in Vale but in the rest of the backgrounds

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.040
is, uh, a little more muted. So, whenever you see the characters, the backgrounds aren't gonna be

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.140
right in your face along with them.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.240
We also added a lot of, uh, like, holographic assets into the scenes, so we're gonna see, like

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.680
holographic traffic lights, and uh, light fixtures and everything.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.520
See, so there's different sections of Vale that we can get into. Like, I think we saw it last year when

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.220
Torchwick pulled up a map of Vale. We saw all these districts and stuff like that

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.260
so now we'll actually get to go into more of those districts.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.000
Thank you, for joining us for another RWBY Production Diary.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.200
Monty: Yes. Next time we'll be taking a look at the voice acting, animation, and motion-capture process that goes into making the animation for the show.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.040
Miles: It is all very cool, it is all very technical, and it is all something we hope you can enjoy NEXT time!

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.080
So tune in again.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.940
Yeaaah!

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.300
You guys are messin' up my mo-cap.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.920
You're messin' up my day, Shane.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.160
You're messin' up my day-- you c-- why does he have those?

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.960
(laughing) why does he have those?
