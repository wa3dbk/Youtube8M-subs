00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.319
Hello.

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.970
It's Coach Tief.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.289
It's time to pack it in and run as a pack
with Tips4Running.com.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:17.510
Now, I'm talking about pack running for cross
country because it's a very effective strategy

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.930
to help you improve as a team, and also you
could run your best time ever.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.460
The first thing you want to do though is find
people on your team that are the same ability.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.520
That means don't run with someone that's way
faster or way slower than you.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.340
You talk to those people that you want to
run as a pack with before the race, set your

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.670
goals, and then it's time to get it done.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.540
Now, my second tip is don't go out too hard
at the start of the race.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.560
The reason why you don't want to go out too
hard is because you could sabotage the rest

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.560
of your race.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.270
You might lose the pack.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.350
So, set a goal time for the first mile.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.750
Try to be on that goal time, and then we come
to the third tip, which is pass people after

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.780
the first mile.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.829
My wife was a cross country coach.

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.409
She would always tell her girls the party
starts after the mile.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.070
That means it's time to pass people.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.440
In a pack, this is a really fun thing to do.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.590
You get one person on one side, one person
on the other, and when you come up on someone

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.920
you just eat 'em up.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.930
So, you pass them on both sides.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.990
We call it eating 'em up.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.590
So, make sure you guys are passing people
after the mile.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.000
Alright, the last tip is you want to stay
as a group because you can take turns leading

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.409
each other through the race.

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.660
Let's say it's a windy race, well, if you
lead a little bit, that helps your teammates,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.299
and you can switch leads.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.220
It's also very motivating because you can
talk to each other while you're switching

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.220
leads.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.220
You can cheer each other on.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.799
Now, I know you're not going to have a lot
of like breath, and talk for a long time.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.640
You can be like, alright, keep it up.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640
Good job.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.640
Let's keep going.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.420
So, it's very motivating to keep running as
a team.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.200
I always loved it when I was running with
my teammates when I could see the teams that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.590
I wanted to beat, and when you pass them as
a group, it's really demoralizing for the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.590
other team.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.170
It makes you feel good.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.190
Pack it up.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.040
Pass people the second half of the race.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.450
And another thing you can always do is talk
to these same people and maybe train in the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.040
off season with them, because you can establish
more than just, you know, a pack of good runners.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.410
You can end up with some really good friends
that train together and then race together.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.860
That's it from Coach Tief.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.690
Leave your comments below if you have some
other great pack running strategies, and take

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.820
care.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.090
Happy Trails.
