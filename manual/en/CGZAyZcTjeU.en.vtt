Hi I'm chef Rainer Wickel and I'm here today
with Expert Village.com well onto our first

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.790
traditional Spanish Tapas recipe and thats
Gambas al Ajillo and that's garlic shrimp.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.420
And this is probably one of my favorites it's
really, really tasty. Now there's only a few

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.529
utensils that we're going to need to prepare
this dish the very first thing that you need

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.500
is a good cutting board because we're going
to be cutting some garlic and we're going

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.950
to be mincing it and that's we're going to
be frying first before we put the shrimp in.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.460
We also need a good pairing knife to cut up
the garlic with, I always like to have a pairing

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.170
knife with me no matter what I do. And we
need a garlic press because we're actually

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.190
going to be mincing the garlic when we put
it into the olive oil, I also like to have

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.219
wooden spatula and the reason I like to use
a wooden spatula is cause we're using an iron

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.520
skillet today and I'm actually going to be
using this for a couple of the dishes. We

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.379
need a nice sharp knife because this particular
dish calls for bread too because we're going

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.649
to be using pieces of bread to go ahead and
dunk into the sauce mixture because its really,

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:18.109
really tasty. Bread is an essential part of
Tapas and lastly we need an iron skillet and

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:22.719
the reason why we're using an iron skillet
is this is what you traditionally fry it in.

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.849
You don't want to sere the shrimp we want
them to slow cook in the iron skillet and

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:34.709
this gives it a nice even heat and traditionally
when Gambas al Ajillo are served, they're

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:39.079
served in the skillet itself because then
you have the shrimp in there and then you

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:46.130
can go ahead and dunk the bread in there too,
and soak up all that really nice sauce. And

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.819
these are all the utensils that we need to
make Gambas al Ajillo.
