Hiya Food Tube,

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.840
my name's Natalie. I'm here to teach you how to cook posh nosh

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.380
for your friends, or that loved one. We're going to start with something really simple, which is

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.140
scollops

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.640
with a sauce vierge. It sounds fine dining,  but really, really simple.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.760
We're going to start with the sauce, and we've got these
beautiful plum tomatoes.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.000
You can get them at your greengrocers, at the market, they got a beautiful

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.970
flavour, but first we go get the
skin of it. So I'm just put in a little cross

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.910
in here,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.390
into our tomatoes, and and then that will
be the start

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.420
how we get this skin off them. Just grab the kettle.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.309
Fill it up. You only want it in there 15-20 seconds

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.879
I've got my little slotted spoon in, just gonna get it out. I don't wanna burn my fingers, and straight into the ice.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.819
That will just shock them. So, as you can see the skin's starting to

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:52.069
peel off lovely there. Put that to the side. So our tomatoes are peeled, and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:56.170
now we just want to take the seeds out. Get rid of the seeds. And then we can start with our

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.940
sauce.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.329
So, straight down the middle like that.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.329
And then just go along. So there.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.100
And just like that. Sort of like skinning a fish.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.830
Just along there, and that's them out. We've got no seeds.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.710
They go in the bin. Bosh. I just sort of then cut it in half again,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.560
and just chop, slowly, little
squares.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.960
Doesn't have to be perfect. Right, so we've got our tomatoes

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.520
chopped their lovely there. Put that into the pan.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.760
Just throw them in there like that. I've got a nice

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.600
banana shallot. The little ones, they're like little onions, you don't want that. 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.720
And what we gonna do, instead of peeling it first, we're going to slice it

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.490
straight down there like that and
then

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.880
peel off that extra layer, and off like that. Like an onion, 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.890
it's got lines. So follow the lines down here,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.600
and then I go along here. 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.570
Now, cos the shallots are quite small, I tend to just go one or two times, 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.020
now it's starting to look like a little hedgehog. And then I just

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.740
slice down, like that. Doesn't have to all be the same size

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.920
you know, it can be rustic. It is home cooking.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.019
And that's it all sliced up lovely.

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.269
Just throw that straight into the pot like that. Right, so now

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.689
onto our basil. Little tip for you. To keep it living in your fridge a little bit 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:20.280
longer

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.139
J Cloth, bit of kitchen roll, just dampen it and wrap your herbs in it. So take out our basil,

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.739
gonna just shred it up. Doesn't have to be
perfect again.

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.480
I'm going to take a couple sprigs of it, just pick the 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.480
leaves off like that. You can keep the stalks. Get all the bigger leaves

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.549
like that, and put the bigger one inside

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.950
all the little ones inside the big ones. Just like that.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.170
And then we roll them over. So we've rolled them over very nicely, 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.519
and again just gently shred it along.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.920
and now because we wrapped them all up, 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.110
means we haven't got to do each leaf by leaf.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.239
And just like that it's all finely shredded. So straight into the pot with that. So,

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.049
we've got some lovely olive oil. You want about a 100ml there.

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.239
You want to season with salt, everything has got to be tasty.

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.529
And then we're going to have the juice of half a lemon in there as well.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.840
Just cut it there, and juice into there.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.709
Right, straight onto the heat. Just a gentle heat. For a couple of minutes to warm

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.450
through. And then we're going to take that off, and let that sit for ten minutes for all the flavour to

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.090
get in there. Just give it a stir, so that it's all nice and mixed,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.999
around. That was bubbling away. We're going to take it off the heat now.

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:38.200
Let that sit for 10 minutes and get on with
cooking our scallops.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.919
Now we've got these beautiful, beautiful
scallops that we've got from our fishmonger

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.499
We're going to serve it in the shells, which makes it look even

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:47.700
posher. Things to look for when you're looking for scallops. You want

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.319
them to be beautiful and white and plump, because if they're all slimy

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.459
and start going a yellowy colour it means that they're no good.

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.909
And also, give them a little smell. they shouldn't smell fishy. If they smell fishy

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.409
there on the turn, just throw them in the bin or just don't buy them. What we want to do is, we want

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.529
season them up before they go in the pan, and pop them on the board, and keep the shells for later.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.740
So, a bit of salt.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.859
And a little bit of pepper.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.060
Like that. And now I'm going to get 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.030
olive oil. Whack that in the pan. Now, the thing with scallops they cook really,

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.550
really quickly. One to two minutes on each side.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.169
Once you've got that sear on the bottom, you flick them over

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.120
and then literally they're done within a
minute. I like to cook my scallops in a

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.410
clockwise direction

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.000
So I put the first one in at number 12, and just dot them around

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.910
then you know which ones to flip over first. We've put them in, and as you can hear, can you hear that

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:42.590
sizzle,

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.300
That's what you want. That's the sound you want coming from your pan. If it's not doing that then they're not going

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.620
to cook properly. They're already ready, I can smell them. Now we're going to flip them over, 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.820
because we started at number 12 we know which one needs to go

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.310
first. So using a spoon, you don't want to burn your fingers,

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.000
flip them over, like that, going around the pan.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.310
Be careful, cos the oil will be hot, and will splash back on you. I just want to get a bit of kitchen paper, 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.780
because I want to drain them off. We don't want them all oily, 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.970
and horrible. Squeeze that lemon juice in there, 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.780
and that will freshen them up. I'm just going to check

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.919
to see if the other side is all done, and that's ready to come off the heat. 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:28.180
It was that quick. Using the spoon just put them straight onto the kitchen paper, and what this will do

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.360
is it will just get rid of any excess oil, because you don't want to be eating a greasy scallop. 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.820
There's nothing worse than that.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.740
Just on there. Just gonna grab my plates. Just gonna put

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.980
a handful of this rock salt here, we're not going to 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.840
eat it, so don't worry about that. But this is for our beautiful scallop shells.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.210
The shells we saved earlier I've just blanched them under the kettle just to make sure that they're

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.400
sterilized and obviously because we had raw scallops in there we don't want to give nobody food poisoning. 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.180
I'm just going to lay them on there, and what happens is that the salt balances them out so they're not

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.220
slipping all over the plate. And then we want to take our scallops

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.650
and just put one in each shell and just
looks so pretty sitting in their natural shells.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.889
If you can't get shells you can just put them on the plate in a little triangle

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.010
and then drizzle the sauce all over like that. So we're going to get our lovely sauce

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.840
Just give it a little stir up, and that should have cooled down.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.220
Just want to spoon a little bit over 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.370
each lovely scallop. And look, it's already starting to look like something out of a fine dining restaurant.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.840
So we got these beautiful little cresses. You can get them now in supermarkets, if you can't get 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.479
hold of them then you can always garnish with a little bit of chopped up basil, or

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.639
you know, coriander. You want to just scatter them over just like that, they just look so pretty.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.860
And all these posh restaurants use these, these days.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.919
So there you go. There's the finished dish. Sweet scallops

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:53.270
with sauce vierge, little micro herbs. Beautiful posh nosh done

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.400
in 10 minutes at home. It's going to knock anyone's socks off.
