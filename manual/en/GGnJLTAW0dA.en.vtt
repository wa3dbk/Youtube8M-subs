00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:29.189
A 
great puzzle game should be simple, but challenging.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.180
It should have a premise anyone can understand,
but it should also offer complexity and challenge

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.550
to those seeking it.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.440
From Tetris to Angry Birds, the best puzzlers
have always done these things...and this one

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.440
is no different.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.489
At least, kind of.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.800
This is Space Holiday for the iPhone.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:59.300
Now, I’m not necessarily comparing Space
Holiday to Tetris and Angry Birds.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.589
This probably won’t be that kind of legendary
puzzle game, but it does do a lot of things

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.549
you’d expect from one...for example, using
a common little childhood activity like Connect

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.610
The Dots as the framework for some pretty
smart gameplay.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.670
So each stage gives you an arrangement of
stars.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.720
Your objective is to connect them with lines.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.810
You tap a star, and when you tap another,
a line forms between them.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.159
The idea is to connect them all, one after
another, without crossing any lines.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.899
So you’re basically creating shapes in the
cosmos.

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.670
Those turn into these time warps.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.829
And you travel all the way...to the next puzzle.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.439
The problem is, you have all these little
Meatwad lookalikes floating through space.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.819
Obviously, that’s an issue when you’re
drawing up portals.

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.459
So whatever shapes you come up with, the enemies
have be outside the lines.

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.909
So as you’d expect, there are also plenty
of different stars that can affect your line

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:53.909
drawing.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.289
There are flying stars that constantly change
your angles, there are some pulling stars

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.590
that pull others toward them...there are even
stars that can destroy enemies.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.829
Those are called ninja stars.

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.560
See what they did there?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:17.000
Anyway, I’m a really big fan of this game.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.880
It can get a little repetitive after a while,
unfortunately...but especially in short bursts,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.459
this really is a good puzzle game.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:33.390
It’s Space Holiday for the iPhone.
