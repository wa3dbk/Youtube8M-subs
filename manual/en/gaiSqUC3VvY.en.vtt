Hey, it’s Nichole Kellerman here and
we’re on to another episode of Health Nugs.

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.279
Today starts a 3-part series of I Care About
My Childs Health . I know that should be a

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.480
total given. But this is why I m starting
this series and I’m gonna tell you a really

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.489
really quick story. I was working with a client
and things went really really well and she

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.760
just had a really quick like 8-week coaching
program just trying to get her on and get

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.610
often and flying solo. And to know it came
to that point she was doing really really

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.830
well and I’m really happy to let her go because
things were going good, she is losing weight

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.830
and she has gotten the habit. She got it all
down. And you know I am Facebook friend with

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.690
her and she better watch out that Facebook
because she gets into trouble. And she posted

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.570
something and it really broke my heart . She
was talking about how she is really proud

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.570
of herself because her husband and her kids
went in to 7-Eleven and they got hotdogs,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.080
candies and slurpees and she’s really proud
of herself that she didn’t. And it totally

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.130
broke my heart and I was really really upset
when I read that. And don’t get me wrong.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.990
I understand. A trip to 7-Eleven and a slurpee
and a hotdog once in a blue moon isn’t gonna

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.150
hurt you one. I’m totally cool with that.
But I had a sense that it happened more often

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.650
that it should. But what is not okay for you
to ingested but it’s okay for them to ingest it. It

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.570
just doesn’t make any sense to me. If you don’t 
want to put it into your body then why do

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.229
you let your kids put it in into their bodies?
Because this is the truth. Your children-

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.840
your child is going to suffer with their health
more than you and I combine. And your kids

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.840
need this guidance and they need it because
they re going to have any single junk food

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.580
company. They’re going to knock on the door
and TV at anywhere you can think of. They’re

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.580
gonna be bombarding them with sugar and
junk food. So if you truly care about your

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.500
Child’s health you will stick with it just
like your taste buds can change, their taste

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.780
buds can change. Yes it takes consistency.
Yes it does takes work. Yes you re gonna pull

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.240
your hair sometimes trying to make them eat
vegetables, but they’ll come around, it will

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.700
happen. I promise it will happen. And when
you do that, and when you instill those habits

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.330
with them as children, they’ll gonna be more
likely to have better self-esteem; to not

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.730
get bullied or make fun of by others; to not
have to worry about cancer, illness, disease

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.690
and diabetes. You are saving them so much
heartache. You can trick them into eating

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.420
fresh vegetables and they won't even know
it. So I’m going to put a couple of books

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.160
and articles below this video so you can start
researching those. But one that is just comes

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.160
to mind is like a smoothie. You can easily
throw some spinach and kale into a smoothie

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.050
and of course put some berries in to kinda
mask the green because you know kids don’t

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.560
like the green color of eating anything. So
you can throw in some berries. Wham! They’re

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.530
gonna be starving a leafy green that so
much of what they need. So there’s a lot of

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.140
cool tricks here. And if you have any, I want
to hear from you. I want to hear in the comment

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.110
below. If you have met these cool tricks,
you can share with me that I drove to my clients

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.170
and any other women or moms watching this
video that worry a woman just to trick their

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.060
husbands and kids to eat vegetables right?
If you like this video, please like it. Share

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.050
it with other moms on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest
or anything like that. You know it's a subject

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.890
that needs to be talked about and needs to
be shared.
