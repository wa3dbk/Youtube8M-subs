00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.820
WORKER: Thank goodness you're here Rob! We have a major issue on our hands. You have probably 

00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:02.361
been briefed about this but let me tell you again. Our Ion Tank has been stolen, a biological weapon, 

00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:04.300
from our facility three days ago.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.747
ROBERT GEARE: Can you tell me exactly what happened?

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:14.485
WORKER: It started three days ago, on a day much like this, when a group of men destroyed… [Fades out]

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:19.385
[Intense Music Starts]

00:04:15.183 --> 00:04:19.568
WORKER: So, to my best of knowledge, that is how the tank was stolen. I would suggest that you travel

00:04:19.578 --> 00:04:25.601
over to Walter Liandri’s home and speak with him. He probably has some ideas of who may have stolen the tank.

00:04:25.857 --> 00:04:27.821
ROBERT: Well thank you for the update.

00:04:34.162 --> 00:04:35.990
WALTER LIANDRI: Who is this?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.916
ROBERT: This is Robert Geare, an agent from the FBI. I have come here to ask you some questions regarding the Ion Tank.

00:04:42.926 --> 00:04:45.412
WALTER: Please come in. I’ll open the gate.

00:05:04.198 --> 00:05:07.458
ROBERT: Hello Walter. I am Robert.
WALTER: Pleased to meet you.

00:05:07.868 --> 00:05:13.597
ROBERT: I wanted to ask you some questions about your company. What sets your company apart from other power companies?

00:05:13.607 --> 00:05:22.211
WALTER: We use ionic energy, a chemical that I may not mention the structure. But it has a unique property, a low ionization point. 

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:27.930
Because of this, we can start an internal reaction inside the chemical to produce massive amounts of heat.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.028
This in turn we can transfer water into steam and generate electricity from the turbines.

00:05:34.609 --> 00:05:38.113
ROBERT: It sounds much like nuclear energy. But then how is this different?

00:05:38.342 --> 00:05:46.025
WALTER: The Ionic compound when ionized breaks down into non-radioactive elements which when cooled down to reasonable

00:05:46.035 --> 00:05:52.043
 temperatures, can be shipped out to manufacturing plants elsewhere. In a sense, the substance recycles itself.

00:05:52.473 --> 00:05:56.436
ROBERT: That explains why workers were able to start construction so soon.

00:06:08.798 --> 00:06:12.723
ROBERT: I see you have a model of the Ion Tank. Can you tell me more about it?

00:06:13.155 --> 00:06:20.925
WALTER: Well actually I don’t know much about the Ion Tank. The US Government took interest in ionic energy after I proved how successful

00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:30.414
and safe ionic energy could be. They wanted my company to build a prototype Ion Tank for the military. It’s been a project I have funded 

00:06:30.424 --> 00:06:36.192
through my research and development team. The head of the project is Lindsey Cooke, a scientist working in the Infrared Lab. 

00:06:36.202 --> 00:06:40.334
You will want to talk to her to inquire more information about the tank.

00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:43.328
WALTER: Please follow me outside.

00:06:46.587 --> 00:06:54.280
WALTER: Would you like a drink?
ROBERT: No thanks. One last question. Who do you think might have wanted to steal the tank?

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:02.146
WALTER: I don’t have any major enemies that I know of. In most of the world I am praised for finding an efficient and clean way to produce energy,

00:07:02.156 --> 00:07:10.667
although one company in particular comes to mind. Axon Corporation is a nuclear power company in Russia headed by Vincent Kernoff. 

00:07:10.677 --> 00:07:19.340
Tensions began to rise when we started the secret Ion Tank Project. I’m just wondering if Vincent may have a spy in the R&amp;D Department.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:25.629
ROBERT: Thank you for your time. I will be traveling to the Infrared Lab later today to speak with Lindsey Cooke. 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:28.873
Hopefully we can get more information about the tank’s whereabouts.

00:07:29.472 --> 00:07:31.736
WALTER: It was a pleasure to speak with you.
