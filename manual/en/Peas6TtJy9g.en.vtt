00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.270
When you step onto campus for the first time
and it already feels like you're your decision

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.830
gets pretty easy pretty quickly.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.540
I saw every kid; every student was smiling
and was so exited to be on campus.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.400
Everybody here is so friendly.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.140
There was warmth at UK that there wasn't anywhere
else.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.434
It was just like, "Oh my gosh, I have to be
a Wildcat."

00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:26.750
I just want to be here.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.750
I fell in love with the campus that day; I
applied as soon as I got the opportunity.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.650
It's just one application and you apply for
all of your scholarships.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.080
That scholarship means everything.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.423
I already knew that I loved UK, but I wouldn't
have been able to come here were it not for

00:00:39.423 --> 00:00:40.423
the scholarship.

00:00:40.423 --> 00:00:43.850
There is not a day that I don't want to be
on campus.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.030
There are a lot of flowers and pretty spots
and pretty benches.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.430
I love the city of Lexington.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.039
You go downtown and you can walk around...It
has the different local restaurants, all the

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.039
shopping places.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.739
Then you drive 10 minutes and there are horse
farms.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.719
Lexington is horse capital of the world...green
grass and the horses.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.101
You have the horse farms and the Keeneland
races, but you're still in a university and

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:13.330
you still have amazing opportunities to learn
and grow.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.010
Undergraduate research is really big here.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.820
I was really surprised to see how many students
were getting involved right off the bat.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.690
All of a sudden I'm working in the lab of
a world-renowned professor.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.930
Research opportunities here at UK are incredible.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.290
My honors class was probably one of the best
classes I've ever taken....learn about stuff

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.020
that's not in your major but you still find
very interesting...My honors class has 17

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.160
kids in it.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.830
He knew all of our names by the second class.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.690
The professors, everybody, they're willing
to help you.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.520
He just had a way of making the class fun
and making you want to learn.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.840
My advisor is awesome.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.130
They are emailing you internship opportunities.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.190
The internships are there and UK will definitely
help you get them.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.530
I'll be interning at 3 chimneys farm, which
is one of the best farms in the country.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.140
I'm ready to go out into the real world and
I'm prepared to meet new people and try new

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.140
things.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.150
I think they make the education kind of about
you.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.490
Here I just have the motivation to learn.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.110
It's very exciting to be down here freshman
year and to look around the campus and to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.110
see cranes.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.510
We're going to have the most modern living
learning space you can find anywhere in the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.510
country.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.549
Being in a living-learning program, you get
to meet twice as many more people as you would

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:25.549
on a normal basis.

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.560
It gives you the opportunity to be in a small
little class with people who live in your

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.560
building.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.519
You learn more about different cultures and
to just hangout with different people from

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.879
all around the world.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.519
You definitely want to go check out the Education
Abroad office.

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.689
They've got a big library with all sorts of
opportunities.

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.791
The chance to teach in a different country
will help me be more diverse and help me connect

00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:46.310
with different sorts of students.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.150
I went to England for a semester and it was
amazing.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.620
The amount of things that are possible on
this campus is just amazing.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.510
K Week is the best way to get involved from
the beginning.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.719
K Week was just a great overall icebreaker
to the whole college experience.

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:08.909
My favorite part of K-Week would probably
be the Water Balloon Fight If you pay for

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.519
a meal during K Week you have done something
wrong.

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.970
You get to know all the university organizations.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.889
I've connected so much with a lot of people.

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:23.620
It creates this second home, this home away
form home.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.640
DanceBlue is an organization that benefits
the UK Children's Hospital.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.640
You have a twenty-four hour dance marathon.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.860
It's a great opportunity to help.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.370
We're on our feet the whole time but it's
for the kids.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.180
It's such a complete experience.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.379
I really enjoy Greek life just kind of the
bond you get with those people.

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.569
The academic side of it I have older people
in the fraternity that help me out with classes.

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.739
My favorite place on campus is definitely
Willy T Library.

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.969
Just walking in there makes you feel ten times
smarter.

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.329
It's big, quiet, comfortable.

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.900
Resources are just unbelievable there.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.900
I love Ovid's.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.529
I eat there almost everyday.

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:06.500
I am a sucker for Commons, not only because
it's five feet from my dorm but it can't get

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.739
better than a buffet.

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.529
The Johnson Center is great it's probably
the best gym I've ever seen in my life.

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:17.000
There's so much to do you can never get bored
in one area.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.070
Just the environments as a whole, the school
spirit, the sports it's all here.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.380
There is definitely a spirit that UK had that
no other school has.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.190
It was a spirit of unity.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.190
I love Rupp Arena, I love basketball.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.450
I got shivers just in the stands.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.620
We boast excellence in a lot of other sports
that are up and rising.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.040
We all have one common goal and that's to
support the Wildcats.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.680
If you want to go someplace where you can
be part of something bigger than yourself,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.340
this is definitely a good choice.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.380
Yeah everything I see is blue.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.380
See blue.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.380
See blue.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.380
See blue.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.380
See blue.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.380
See blue.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.380
See blue.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.380
See blue.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.380
See blue.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.380
Ver azul.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.380
See blue.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.380
See blue.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.380
Being a Wildcat is just the whole experience.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.380
You don't just see blue at the weekends or
during football season but all the time.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.430
You have athletics, when you have academics,
when you have that social life it all comes

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.140
together in a really good blend.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.320
UK is making me into a more well rounded person.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.120
I don't want to go home.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.170
I've made such good friends that I think will
last a lifetime.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.910
Just imagine what they're going to do down
the road, we're gonna make a mark.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.180
It is a really wonderful, wonderful feeling
to be a Wildcat.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.280
I've fallen in love with UK, honestly.
