"So I grab on to the wall."

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.500
'Cause that's just too darn far to fall."

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.130
"Think it's time to try to"

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.700
"run away."

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.730
"But the doctors they are fast. Now they're giving me the gas."

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.760

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.409
 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.229
"Writing songs is just something I've done for my kids since"

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.460
"they were really little."

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.200

"I just- I write little songs all the time
for them."

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.260
"The doctors here are phenomenal. We lived in Texas."

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.830
"I sold everything in Texas after I did
my research to move here"

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.700
"for this hospital. We did not know where
we were going, where we were going to live,"

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.000

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.700
"and I have not one minute of regret."
