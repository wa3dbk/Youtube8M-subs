00:00:15.706 --> 00:00:19.309
The Cardinal Marching Band represents about one hundred and eighty students 

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:23.921
and that includes students from UofL and also our colleges through 

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:29.726
the metroversity system and our primary goal is 
 to be ambassadors for the University. 

00:00:29.726 --> 00:00:34.348
We play at all of the home football games 
 at the Bowl Game and at 

00:00:34.348 --> 00:00:37.653
many of our spirit and pep type events. 

00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:57.384
Our students come a week and a half before school 
 starts for various days of band camp. 

00:00:57.384 --> 00:01:03.215
We start with a leadership camp, then a drumline and 
 color gaurd camp, a first year member camp,

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:07.912
then everybody is in for a full week together where 
 they go eight to eight on these days.

00:01:07.912 --> 00:01:10.328
It’s a very intense week and a half block.

00:01:10.328 --> 00:01:13.694
They move in early to the dorms and so forth to make that happen.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:35.750
Our fans are one of our biggest motivators, in 
 fact, we have changed many elements 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.764
of our pre-game show this year to make it completely fan interactive. 

00:01:39.764 --> 00:01:43.000
We just want to pump up our fans on game day. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.260
They are so good to the band, they’ve always 
 been good supporters and so we 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.310
have created elements and even new cheers for them to 
 do with us to have a more 

00:01:51.313 --> 00:01:56.130
interactive experience with the cheer team, with the 
 band, with everybody come game day.
