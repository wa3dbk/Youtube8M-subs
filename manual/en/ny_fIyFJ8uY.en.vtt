00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.240
So the headlines going around on the internet
say flies can feel fear.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.660
Excellent.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.490
(Laughs maniacally)

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:17.310
Hello to all you fly honies, Julian at YouTube
Space LA for DNews.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.790
Like I said, if the internet is to be believed
then we are giving poor wittle fruit flies

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.500
spaz attacks just from waving our hands at
them.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.690
The news comes from a study from the California
Institute of Technology but there’s more

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.760
grey area than some black and white headlines
would lead you to think.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.079
One of the study’s authors, Dr. David J.
Anderson, says we can only know if a creature

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.760
is feeling emotions by asking them directly.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.220
Of course if you ask a fly anything, all they’ll
say is (rubs hands together flyishly) so the

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.610
scientists had to set up some parameters that
separated emotions from a simple reflex.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.310
The criteria they settled on was that any
emotion has certain characteristics.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.500
These “emotion primitives” were scalability,
persistence, generalizability, and valence

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.829
(which in the context of psychology means
how attractive or aversive something is).

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.210
The scientists put the flies in a chamber
and occasionally passed a shadow overhead

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.659
to simulate a bird or Batman coming for them.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.869
When the shadow came, the flies would run,
hop, or freeze in place.

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.990
When the shadows swooped by more frequently,
they would run and hop faster, which showed

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.190
scalability.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.860
They repeated this with food in the flies’
chamber, and got the same result.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.220
This fulfils two other criteria of being generalizable
to different contexts and having negative

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.310
valence that overcomes the attractiveness
of that sweet mushy brown banana.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.759
The flies would also take longer to come back
to the food the more they were antagonized,

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.939
and that demonstrates persistence.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.570
Rather than just hopping away and coming back
when the danger had passed, they lingered.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.979
If responding to the shadows were just a reflex,
then the flies should come back to the food

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.660
in about time once the threat was gone, regardless
of how much they were threatened.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.220
It suggests to the researchers that they were
calming down from an emotional state, much

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.350
like how it takes you time to come down after
almost getting in a car accident, even though

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.670
the danger has passed.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.560
All of this fly torture may sound like scientists
just being bullies but there’s a good reason

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.560
for it.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.869
As first author of the study William Gibson
points out, flies have the same fundamental

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.520
drives we do, the four F’s, which are “Feeding,
Fighting, Fleeing and Fmating.”

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.950
But the deeper question is, “Do they have
emotions that can drive these motivations

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.659
or is it a mechanical response?”

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.159
Satisfied that the flies may be acting out
of fear, the researchers have proposed studying

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.689
the simple neural network of the flies to
see what molecules affect emotional states.

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.109
Maybe what we find in the flies brains can
be compared to what happens in other animals

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.109
or us.

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.689
We know other animals have similar survival
circuitry to ours in their brains, but we

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.469
couldn’t know if they felt the same way
we do.

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:30.469
Maybe it can help us nail down exactly what
emotions are and give us an objective and

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.469
universal yardstick for what to date has been
a very subjective experience.

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.409
Maybe it can help us learn about and combat
irrational fears too, like fear of spiders!

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.019
Actually maybe not, arachnophobia would be
a totally rational fear for a fly.

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.629
Most of us avoid fear but some of us can’t
get enough of it.

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:47.260
Trace explains adrenaline junkies here.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.530
Extreme!

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.409
So I think this all raises an interesting
philosophical question which is: At what point

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.709
does a survival instinct become an emotion?

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.010
Do you think there’s a difference?

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.409
Let me know in the comments or on facebook
or twitter @DNews, and I’ll see you next

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.430
time.
