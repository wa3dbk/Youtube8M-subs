00:00:02.583 --> 00:00:04.417
Hey, I'm Alicia Marie...

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:08.166
...and welcome
to my "Cardio World."

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:11.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:14.834
That was my dog, wasn't it?
Right?

00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:19.291
Twitter question,
just keep them coming.

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.625
Let's get to today's.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:25.250
Tired of being overweight,
30 pounds over where I should.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:29.875
Have never done any working out,
where to start and why so hard?

00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:33.417
Tweetzer, I applaud you
for standing up...

00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:35.500
...and admitting that you could be
a little healthier.

00:00:35.542 --> 00:00:37.750
Believe it or not,
by hitting me up on Twitter...

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:40.667
...you've already started
the process of getting in shape.

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:44.125
However, your query does bring up
the serious issue...

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.708
...of what is really involved...

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.834
...when you're trying to lose
larger amounts of weight...

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:53.291
...and to illustrate this,
as I can't believe I'm saying this,...

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.333
...you need to talk to Todd.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.500
-Todd --
-What, what?

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:02.667
You're going to fly into my stomach
again today or turn me into a pickle?

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:06.166
No, we here at Cardio World
wanted to know...

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:09.166
...what your fitness goals are,
right now?

00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:10.208
Oh, really?

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.542
Well, as you know I'm trying
to lose a couple of pounds of fat...

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:16.750
...so I can lean up and then bam,
my abs would be there...

00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:20.583
-...and it would be like really cool.
-And how is that going -- good?

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:22.208
No, it's actually a pain...

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.083
...because I find myself
having these cravings...

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:26.291
...and I'm nibbling on things
I shouldn't nibble on all the time...

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:29.667
...and then at night I drink this booze
and I'm crying in the bathtub alone.

00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:32.125
-And then I don't even go to the gym...
-See, Todd here suffers...

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:35.542
..from what I like to refer to
as the last ten.

00:01:35.583 --> 00:01:40.041
Those last few pounds that your body
fights you from trying to lose.

00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:46.000
Often this becomes a will power
discipline consistency Todd, issue.

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:53.500
But, when you have
a larger amount of weight to lose...

00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:57.250
...there are a multitude of lifestyle
changes that must come into play.

00:01:57.291 --> 00:01:59.583
Focusing on the ones
that start up here,...

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:03.333
...we can't moonwalk over the fact that
if you're starting from ground zero...

00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:06.667
...and looking to lose
20, 30, 40 pounds or more...

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.542
...that getting in shape for your life
is going to be a journey,...

00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:12.208
...an entire lifestyle overhaul...

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.250
...to put your body and mind together
in a healthier place.

00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:19.667
The hard part that you're referring to
is the change part.

00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:21.834
Breaking from a regular routine,...

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.583
...especially one
that's comfortably unhealthy,...

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:28.375
...to do other things that might not be
comfortable at the start, is hard.

00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:30.792
So you just get used
to saying, nope,...

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:34.667
...you can keep those old, hard dried up
Christmas cookies on your desk,...

00:02:34.708 --> 00:02:38.208
...I plan on racking a body
come New Year's Eve.

00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:42.208
Just talking about doing
something different...

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.000
...isn't going to loosen
gravity's pull on your body.

00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:47.792
So let's get your head in the game.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:50.375
Step one, motivating factors.

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:52.792
Identifying what is important...

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:56.500
...and the reasons why you want
and need to get in better shape.

00:02:57.917 --> 00:03:01.250
Todd, what motivators
are keeping you fit?

00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:03.875
So girls like me more.

00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:05.500
What?

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:09.542
Normally, these motivating factors
help you keep your mind right...

00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:11.834
...and focus 100 percent
on your goals.

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:13.917
These motivating factors
will keep you on track...

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.375
...when little things try to tempt you
and convince you...

00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:18.750
...that you aren't getting anywhere
when you are.

00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:21.792
Remember, this is
a cumulative process over time...

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.500
where every little bit helps.

00:03:23.917 --> 00:03:26.083
Step two, taking action.

00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:29.083
Action means moving.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:32.166
Walking every night,
taking the stairs, join the local gym.

00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:33.917
Buy an interesting workout DVD.

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.083
Or take the belly dancing class.

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:37.667
Whatever you do,...

00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:40.834
...make appointments
with yourself to move that body.

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:45.458
It's time to make you and that
your number one priority.

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:48.041
You think you're ready for step three?

00:03:48.417 --> 00:03:50.375
Watch what you put in your face.

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:53.125
You need to begin
to take serious inventory...

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.625
...of what goes in your mouth...

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:58.291
...and be honest because what you put in
equals what comes out.

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:03.125
White bread, white rice,
white sugar, excess salt,...

00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:04.792
...all of that lose it.

00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:06.834
If you're really lost
about the food thing...

00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:08.250
...and would rather seek a pro.

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:10.834
Ask your doctor for a referral
to a nutrition counselor.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.917
Someone who can shape
food requirements...

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.875
...specifically for your needs.

00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:17.750
Step four, support.

00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:20.041
Do yourself a favor
and let your loved ones...

00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:22.458
...and the people you're interacting
with in your everyday life...

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.625
...in on your plans.

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:25.875
Tell them that you're embarking
on a fitness regimen...

00:04:25.917 --> 00:04:27.458
...and that you're going
to need their support.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.625
A regular fitness support system
equals regular accountability...

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:32.875
...and success.

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:36.375
If you're having a tough time
getting started in any one area...

00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:39.458
...I cannot stress the benefit
of a good trainer.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.917
Drop and give me twenty private.

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:43.250
Even for just a few sessions!

00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:46.458
People spend more money
pimping out their car.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.041
Why not your body?

00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:51.041
We are just getting started!

00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:52.667
Todd.

00:04:52.708 --> 00:04:54.792
Oh, I think he can definitely
do ten more.

00:04:54.834 --> 00:04:55.625
Ten more!

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:59.750
Step five, it's up to you...

00:04:59.792 --> 00:05:01.417
...to not give up on you.

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:02.542
When you're getting started,...

00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:05.333
...especially if you have
a lot of weight to lose,...

00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:07.500
...getting moving
and just sticking with it...

00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:09.667
...is going to be
the name of your game.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:13.166
I mean, you are quaint
human technology.

00:05:14.458 --> 00:05:19.041
I mean, our --
cause we are all humans...

00:05:19.083 --> 00:05:22.917
Humans, everything
at your fingertip, technology age,...

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:26.000
...has made us
so for the first time in History,...

00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:27.000
...we...

00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:29.166
...can make a living...

00:05:29.583 --> 00:05:31.500
...without ever having to move.

00:05:31.834 --> 00:05:33.834
Never lose sight of the fact...

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.417
...that the human body
has evolved...

00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:38.834
...to pick up, to carry things,...

00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:40.333
...to kick, to lift,...

00:05:40.375 --> 00:05:42.083
...run and to walk.

00:05:45.542 --> 00:05:50.250
Man has not fought his way
to the top of the food chain...

00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:53.125
...in order to sit and watch.

00:05:56.375 --> 00:05:58.875
Ooh, so profound, Alicia.

00:05:58.917 --> 00:05:59.959
Ten more, Todd!

00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:01.208
Oh, God!
