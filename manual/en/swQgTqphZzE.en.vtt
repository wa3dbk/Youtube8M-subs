00:00:01.515 --> 00:00:02.655
- [Voiceover] Lets start with summarizing

00:00:02.655 --> 00:00:05.034
what we discussed up
until now about Pertussis.

00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:07.176
Pertussis is caused by
a microscopic bacteria

00:00:07.176 --> 00:00:09.104
having a rod-like shape
like I'm drawing here.

00:00:09.104 --> 00:00:11.185
It's a highly contagious upper respiratory

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:13.542
tract infection transmitted
through aerosols

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:16.683
or by touching the eyes,
nose, or mouth with

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.785
an infection source like this man's hands.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.225
And bacteria damages
airways and allows mucus

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:24.145
to build up in the airways
until it's forcefully

00:00:24.145 --> 00:00:26.963
removed by violent coughing
fits followed immediately

00:00:26.963 --> 00:00:29.304
by a whooping noise when
the air is finally able

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:31.094
to come back into the lungs after a fit.

00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:33.253
We also discussed that
the clinical symptoms

00:00:33.253 --> 00:00:36.633
of Pertussis infection can
last around twelve weeks

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:39.132
and these weeks are broken
down into three stages

00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:40.914
depending on the clinical
symptoms present.

00:00:40.914 --> 00:00:43.492
But we also talked about
a few modifying factors.

00:00:43.492 --> 00:00:45.274
A modifying factor can be anything

00:00:45.274 --> 00:00:47.213
that makes these three stages difficult

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.132
to tell apart because
the symptoms are milder

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:50.912
and the transmission rate is lower.

00:00:50.912 --> 00:00:53.091
So, one of these factors was previous

00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:55.067
infection with a disease.

00:00:55.067 --> 00:00:56.703
So, let's say that the
dad of the family here

00:00:56.703 --> 00:00:58.983
was infected with
Pertussis a few years ago,

00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:01.362
and his body, like yours
or mine, would mount

00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:04.161
an immune response by making
antibodies against Pertussis.

00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:06.062
These antibodies are like specialized tags

00:01:06.062 --> 00:01:08.841
that attach specifically
onto the Pertussis bacteria

00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:11.761
and proteins produces and
flags them for destruction.

00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:13.672
Once that clears the infection,
he's left with a level

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:16.650
of Pertussis antibodies in his
body for a long time after.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.691
So, let's give him an antibody badge here

00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:20.832
to remember that he has
immunity against Pertussis.

00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:22.691
This means that if he's
reinfected with Pertussis

00:01:22.691 --> 00:01:25.792
his immune system is ready
or primed for the infection

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:27.311
and can fight it more quickly

00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:29.312
so he becomes less contagious because

00:01:29.312 --> 00:01:30.591
he kills the disease faster,

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:32.031
and the classically clinical symptoms

00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:35.010
of the disease become milder
or may not occur at all.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.118
Now is a good time to bring in the rest

00:01:36.118 --> 00:01:37.478
of the family to discuss another

00:01:37.478 --> 00:01:40.263
modifying factor which is vaccine history.

00:01:40.263 --> 00:01:42.339
Vaccines are like training
with practice runs

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:44.359
so that you'll be able
to handle the marathon

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:45.480
meaning let's say that grandpa

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.982
had a Pertussis vaccine recently.

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:49.280
The vaccine causes his
body to produce antibodies

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.898
against the bacteria and proteins a lot

00:01:50.898 --> 00:01:52.239
like a true infection would

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:54.219
but this way if he's ever exposed

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:55.859
to a natural Pertussis infection

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:57.818
or in the analogy, a marathon,

00:01:57.818 --> 00:02:00.298
his body's primed to
fight just like dad's.

00:02:00.298 --> 00:02:02.160
So, he has an antibody badge too.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.379
But there are a few
Pertussis vaccines out there

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:07.218
and they vary in their components
that make up the vaccine

00:02:07.218 --> 00:02:08.878
even though they have all the same goal

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:10.978
of generating antibodies
against Pertussis.

00:02:10.978 --> 00:02:13.079
So starting with the whole
cell Pertussis vaccine.

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.098
Sometimes this is abbreviated
WP for whole cell Pertussis.

00:02:17.098 --> 00:02:20.040
It contains the entire
dead Pertussis bacteria

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.440
with the majority of its proteins.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.837
Then it's given in a
series of four vaccines

00:02:23.837 --> 00:02:25.720
between two months and fifteen years old.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.706
And while this series if about
seventy and ninety percent

00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:29.975
effective in preventing a
serious Pertussis infection

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:32.175
it also had a high
incident rate of discomfort

00:02:32.175 --> 00:02:33.776
at the injection site and mild

00:02:33.776 --> 00:02:36.157
Pertussis-like symptoms
following the vaccine.

00:02:36.157 --> 00:02:37.874
Seeing that it's (mumbling)
it's been phased out

00:02:37.874 --> 00:02:40.456
and it's been replaced by
acellular Pertussis vaccine

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:43.157
or abbreviated A for acellular Pertussis.

00:02:43.157 --> 00:02:45.935
These vaccines contain just
pieces of Pertussis bacteria

00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:48.335
and some of the proteins
and protein-based toxins

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:50.637
made by the bacteria that
we discussed previously.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:53.357
Which proteins and toxins
are in a particular vaccine

00:02:53.357 --> 00:02:54.757
depend on the manufacturer.

00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:56.215
And there are two vaccines that fall

00:02:56.215 --> 00:02:57.846
under this acellular category.

00:02:57.846 --> 00:03:00.206
They're both given with diphtheria tetanus

00:03:00.206 --> 00:03:02.747
which is why they have a D and
a T appearing in their names.

00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:05.606
They're DTaP and Tdap, and there are

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:07.651
a few differences
between the two vaccines.

00:03:07.651 --> 00:03:11.614
To start with, this capital P
instead of a lowercase p here

00:03:11.614 --> 00:03:15.753
represents a higher dose of
Pertussis in the DTaP vaccine.

00:03:15.753 --> 00:03:17.494
This higher dose is given in a series

00:03:17.494 --> 00:03:20.133
of five vaccines at two,
four, and six months,

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.133
and some are between
fifteen and eighteen months,

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:24.313
and then again between
four and six years old.

00:03:24.313 --> 00:03:26.473
This series is eighty to
eighty five percent effective

00:03:26.473 --> 00:03:28.654
in preventing a serious
Pertussis infection

00:03:28.654 --> 00:03:29.712
but it has less side effects

00:03:29.712 --> 00:03:31.552
than the whole cell Pertussis vaccine.

00:03:31.552 --> 00:03:33.971
It's important to know that
neither natural exposure

00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:35.872
nor any vaccine will give a person

00:03:35.872 --> 00:03:37.651
a hundred percent immunity to Pertussis.

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:39.553
This is because over time antibody levels

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.413
in the body drop to a point where they're,

00:03:41.413 --> 00:03:42.504
they aren't as protective.

00:03:42.504 --> 00:03:45.104
So, to avoid this from
happening there's the Tdap.

00:03:45.104 --> 00:03:46.722
Tdap is a booster that should be

00:03:46.722 --> 00:03:48.443
received every five to ten years

00:03:48.443 --> 00:03:51.245
and the last infection or vaccination.

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:52.470
I like to think of the boosters as,

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.794
like, our refresher course.

00:03:53.794 --> 00:03:54.790
You take a refresher course when

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.990
you've already studied
some material on point

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.070
but you need to see it
again to jog your memory.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.169
Booster does the same thing.

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.089
Grandpa may have had a Pertussis infection

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:03.991
when he was younger but
the booster's needed

00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:06.691
to refresh his body's
memory against Pertussis

00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:08.528
and bump up his antibody levels

00:04:08.528 --> 00:04:10.091
which tend to fall throughout the years.

00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:12.531
Everyone should take care
to get a booster on time

00:04:12.531 --> 00:04:14.530
but there are some groups
who should be extra careful.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.510
Those who have underlying
respiratory disease,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.250
those who are amino-compromised,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.548
or let's say grandma
is a healthcare worker

00:04:20.548 --> 00:04:22.887
and since immunizing can
help prevent the spread

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:24.402
of Pertussis from one person to another,

00:04:24.402 --> 00:04:25.982
she should take care to be vaccinated.

00:04:25.982 --> 00:04:28.035
And really anyone in this
family should be vaccinated

00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:29.738
'cause they're gonna be around an infant

00:04:29.738 --> 00:04:31.116
that they don't want to infect.

00:04:31.116 --> 00:04:32.789
Lastly, expecting moms at twenty seven

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.970
to thirty six weeks at
each of their pregnancy

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.448
you should get the Dtap
because the antibodies

00:04:37.448 --> 00:04:38.695
that mom produces in response can

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.038
be passed along to the baby.

00:04:40.038 --> 00:04:41.758
Then when the baby is born the baby will

00:04:41.758 --> 00:04:43.579
have some protective passive immunity

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:45.139
to Pertussis until he or she can receive

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.914
the first Pertussis vaccine at two months.

00:04:47.914 --> 00:04:49.710
Outbreaks for Pertussis are on the rise

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.250
and though there is a school of thought

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.347
that Pertussis bacteria is mutated making

00:04:53.347 --> 00:04:55.368
the available vaccines less efficient

00:04:55.368 --> 00:04:57.809
it's largely due to children
not getting vaccinated

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:59.648
and adults not receiving their boosters.

00:04:59.648 --> 00:05:01.809
So, this makes transmission
of the infection high

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:04.730
and symptoms and complications
from infections more severe.
