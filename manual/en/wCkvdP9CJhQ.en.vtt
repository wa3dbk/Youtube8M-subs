00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.120
Hello everyone. It's back! Metal Slug. Now, if you're playing this on a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 or large screen device

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.990
be aware you are going to get black bars
down either side

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.599
of your screen. This is a conversion.

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.660
If you're not familiar with Metal Slug
it is one of the arcade classics.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.690
 And the idea with Metal Slug, like many
of the classic arcade games is it's sideways scrolling, bullet storm hell
style game.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.489
 The idea is you've got to complete each
level killing everything

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:55.690
in your path.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.969
You have to jump, you have to run, you
have to shoot things

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.750
very very quickly. You can fire up in
the air

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.000
 as well as along the ground, and if you
are able to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.760
rescuing these guys, the hostages is
a really really good idea.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.040
Metal Slug has always been fast, furious
and just a little bit stupid.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.970
But what a fantastic game. You know

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.410
 at the end of the day what game makes
you pick up fish for points?

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.890
 But this is just a fantastic title. Whoops!

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.530
Let me just get out of the way.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.750
Gameplay is hard as you might expect

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.360
 with any of the classic kind of arcade
games.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.660
When they've been converted they don't
make them easier particularly.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.900
Although there is different difficulty
settings for this game

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.890
if you find yourself in a lot of trouble
but you know,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.990
Wow! It's so much fun to be playing this
again.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.000
Great great fun. I think it's also on
offer at the moment as well.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.380
So come and grab it while it's cheap
on the Play Store.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.950
 Yay! If you've never played Metal Slug
or If you're looking for a nostalgia trip
you can't

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.610
go far wrong with this one. You will

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.760
find a little bit of slowdown and as
I say,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.330
you have got this black bar problem going
on on larger screen devices

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.150
but other than that, this is a fantastic
release.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.340
Really really really solid.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.340
Brilliant. Boom boom!
