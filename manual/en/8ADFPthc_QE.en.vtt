00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
&gt;&gt; RYAN: OK. Or maybe I won't because I don't
know where he went.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.560
He seems to have just run away on me.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.750
OK, so I was meant to go...

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.070
here...

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:18.710
for some reason?

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.439
I don't know why it's directing me here.

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:26.880
&gt;&gt; I don't know what it was brought you to
Primm, youngster,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.310
but you might want to rethink your plans.
Town's gone to hell.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.640
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Who are you?

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.570
&gt;&gt; [new voice] Johnson Nash is my name. Husband
to Ruby Nash.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.100
Lived in Primm going on eight years now, think
and thin.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.489
I'm a trader primarily, for what it's worth
with things like they are.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.329
I also run the local Mojave Express outpost.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.059
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Um. Your voice actor just changed.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.329
You should probably get that checked out.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.230
I know this great doctor. He rooted around
in my head in Goodsprings.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.300
Oh, I'm a courier with Mojave Express.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.390
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't got any work right now, sorry
to say.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.810
&gt;&gt; RYAN: I lost a package I was supposed to
deliver.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.630
&gt;&gt; I'll tell you whatever I can. You have
a delivery order you can show me?

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.780
&gt;&gt; RYAN: What can you tell me about this job?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.930
&gt;&gt; Oh, you're talking about one of "them"
packages.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.850
That job had strange written all over it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.270
but we couldn't turn down the caps.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.619
&gt;&gt; RYAN: What was so strange about it?

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.400
&gt;&gt; That cowboy robot had us hire six couriers,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.180
each was carrying something a little different:

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.710
a pair of dice, chess piece, that kind of
stuff.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.689
Last word I have from the office,

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.960
it looked like payment had been received for
the other five jobs.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.030
Guess it was just your chip that didn't make
it.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.030
First deadbeat we hired to do the job cancelled.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.159
Hope a storm from the divide skinned him alive.
[sigh]

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.299
Well, that's where you came in.

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.149
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Some men stole my... Oh, I don't
know what I want.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.710
Uhh, hmm.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.739
Some men stole my package. A man and a blah
blah blah.

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.750
&gt;&gt; Well, now that you mention it, a few nights
back one of the townies was out scrounging

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.860
for supplies.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.520
He said he saw a fellow with a daisy suit
come through with one of them great con misfits.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.900
He was talking about a chip.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.230
&gt;&gt; RYAN: One of those men shot me.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.690
&gt;&gt; Well, for that your best bet is going to
be talking to Deputy Beagle.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.129
Since they came to town he was keeping a good
bit of notes on him

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.310
and he was slinking around Bison Steve when
your pretty boy friend came through.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.840
He may have heard where they were going.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.500
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Goodbye.
&gt;&gt; Don't go getting yourself shot.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.709
&gt;&gt; RYAN: I'll try not to.

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:52.569
So I've been told that I should be getting
like 10 frames a second in here

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.300
because there's like four NPCs.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.770
But... apparently not. Hm.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.849
Oh, actually, Internet people. You know what?
I think with that little bit of good news

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.019
and this ugly car

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.310
and this protectron with a broken voice

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.370
we're going to make that a video.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.239
So we'll see you again, Internet people.

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.819
My name is Ryan. You're watching Let's Play
Fallout: New Vegas for the kingdom.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.629
We'll see you again. Thanks for watching.
