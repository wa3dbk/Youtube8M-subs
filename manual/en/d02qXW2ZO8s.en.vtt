مرحباً جميعاً! معكم آية مجدداً~

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.920
كيف حالكم جميعاً؟

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.080
اليوم ودي أفضفض و أتكلم عن شغلة جداً قهرتني

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.800
Okay, for some of you guys it's not really that important, this is no reaction, not anything but a small talk..

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.500
because what's happening right now is sooo...

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.333
Any one have noticed this crazy dirty game that's happening in the K-music charts?!

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.440
for e.g, MNET or Inkigayo..

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.968
first of all, what i'm talking about might not be that important for some of you guys,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.080
But, me, as an EXO fan, I'm really so sad and mad..

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.960
okay so what we were saying is....

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.320
*LOST IT*

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.480
OMG this is so frustrating

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:56.980
why??cuz what's happening right now that they(MNET/INKIGAYO) say that they“forget” to put exo on the voting list

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.520
SERIOUSLY?! EXO who have achieved ALL KILL once  'LOVE ME RIGHT' was out?!

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.480
and the only K-pop band that is in the top10 on ITUNES worldwide

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:18.840
and these boys who are known as the RECORD BREAKERS and suddenly you forgot to insert their names in the voting list, WOW?!

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.980
I'm talking about the voting system in the K-pop music chart, Mnet, Inkigayo, KBS music bank all of these!

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:36.380
okay, so a powerful band as exo, again who broke so many records and the millions sellers, i'm not even exaggerating!!

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.560
and in the end you forgot? seriously?

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.980
what's worst mnet deleted their video that was about to get to 1 million hit!! and you deleted that?!!!! ***DO YOU KNOW HOW EXO-Ls WORKED SO HARD FOR THAT**

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.062
is EXO that scary for you?!!!

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.760
honestly I don't know why SM is not taking any actions regarding that,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.760
IS IT'S SO OBVIOUS THAT THEY'RE CHEATING!

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.341
I know that the other groups ARE REALLY STRONG AND I RESPECT THAT and all,,, ah now don't attack me *_*

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.820
I won't mention any name but everyone knows that this is cheating and they (THESE STATIONS)are really playin' dirty..

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.720
SO UNPROFESSIONAL!! again, SM u must say something XD!

00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:18.745
I know, i'm just saying and my opinion, it won't really affect :(

00:02:18.745 --> 00:02:23.725
but the good thing is the Korean Exo-Ls and the international fans are doing their jobs!!!

00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:24.885
so, Fighting!

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.140
That's all! JUST PLAY FAIR!!

00:02:29.386 --> 00:02:34.986
It's okay to lose, don't think i'm saying this cause we're afraid to lose or whatever

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:45.866
but, play fair, and win in a fair game! DON'T CHEAT AND PLAY DIRTY

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:56.240
and for the people who don't know what i'm talking about, CHECK THE BOX BELOW

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.200
I'm not saying random stuff XD

00:03:00.363 --> 00:03:02.763
that's all! good luck for every one!

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.220
Hopefully next week exo win! ;D

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.940
BTW i'm not underestimating any other group!

00:03:12.393 --> 00:03:15.193
