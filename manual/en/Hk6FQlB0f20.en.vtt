goat, a nefarious cat--

JACOB SOBOROFF: Joanne
Milne was born deaf.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.110
She's 39 years old and is about
to hear for the first time.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.452

a bit overwhelming at first.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.321
FEMALE SPEAKER:Can you hear
my voice coming through both

00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:40.820
sides?

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.360

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.750
Yeah.

JACOB SOBOROFF: She had cochlear
implants put in last month

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.875
but had to wait four weeks
to heal from the surgery

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:46.710
before this moment.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.800
This video just
came out, and it was

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.890
getting shared everywhere
over the weekend.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.620
You know, this is the latest
in a string of these videos.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.220
This one was posted
back in 2011.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.287
It has been cried to more
than 20 million times.

00:00:56.287 --> 00:00:58.328

technically your device is on.

JACOB SOBOROFF: And
more than 7 million wept

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.466
to this little guy getting his
cochlear implant turned on.

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.120
Did you hear that?

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.970
JACOB SOBOROFF: It
is truly amazing

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.428
to see how technology
can literally

00:01:13.428 --> 00:01:15.080
change people's lives
before your eyes.

(WHISPERING) I'm lying.

I don't like cats. (SPEAKING
NORMALLY) But I don't have any,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.060
and this is probably
the reason why.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.930
Rob Rants' latest video has
been all over my social feeds,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.640
and it imagines what
life would be like

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.224
if you lived with a
notorious villain.

00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:32.806
ROB RANTS: Spike, come on, you
know you got to get in the car.

00:01:32.806 --> 00:01:33.939
Why don't you ever listen?

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.355
BANECAT: Or perhaps
he's wondering

00:01:35.355 --> 00:01:38.100
why someone would give him
a treat before throwing him

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.510
into that cage.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.650
ROB RANTS: I'm the owner.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.221
BANECAT: And this gives
you power over me?

00:01:43.221 --> 00:01:45.220
ALI: If you loved this
as much as I did and want

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.200
to see BaneCat
turned into a series,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.020

can make this happen.

"Goat Simulator."

a person by its tongue.

it the world's dumbest game.
