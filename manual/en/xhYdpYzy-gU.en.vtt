00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:10.440
Hi, I'm Mark from Elmer's, and today, we're
going to be fixing this wooden window frame.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.940
I have both Elmer's Rotted Wood Stabilizer
and Elmer's Damaged Wood Repair Kit.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, with this window frame, you can see various
areas of rot.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.880
We're gonna want to get in to clean very thoroughly
any loose, rotted material, so that we can

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.920
apply the stabilizer.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.940
This particular area, I've cleaned off pretty
thoroughly, so I'm just going to come by with

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.079
coat of my stabilizer.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.120
Give it a good, even coat.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.780
We're going to let it soak in for a 24-hour
period.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.640
If it drips, that's just fine.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.149
The whole idea is to let this soak in thoroughly,
just to prevent any rot from continuing to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.579
occur.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.079
Let that sit up for a good 24-hour period.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.370
And then, I can come to pre-treated area over
here of damage that I'm going to use my two-part

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.210
epoxy to fill.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.130
I've got both a resin and a hardener material.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.380
I'm going to mix equal parts resin and hardener
together, and it's rather putty-like.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.420
When you get a uniform color, then you know
you've mixed in pretty thoroughly, and you'll

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.009
be ready to apply it.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.490
You've got about 20, 30 minutes before it
begins to harden.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.170
So, you've got some time to mix it up thoroughly.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.960
I've used this particular material to fill
cracks in deck posts; hardens up great.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.850
You can then go over and sand it and stain
it.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.590
Here now, you could use a putty knife to further
shape it.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.260
This particular damage here seems to work
just fine by working it in with your fingers.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.990
You may not need all of the material that
you grabbed initially and that's fine.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.479
So just loosely form it into the shape.

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.900
Don't worry that you're not exact because
in 24 hours after this hardens, we're going

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.340
to come by, we're going to sand it, get a
nice uniform shape, at which point you're

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.470
ready to stain or paint, and it'll be great
for years to come.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.020
