Hey guys, you're in the studio with Luke from
www.GuitarIQ.com.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.500
Today we're talking about a way to keep your
guitar cables tangle free.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.460
This tip has to do with the way we roll our
cables up in the first place.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.230
Why am I doing a video on rolling up guitar
cables, it's pretty simple right?

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.230
Well yes and no...

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.680
You need to remember that guitar cables are
essentially the life line between what we

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.160
are playing on the guitar and what people
are actually hearing, so we want to make sure

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.720
we're using good quality cables, we want to
take care of them and we want to spend the

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.220
least amount of time possible untangling them
every time we go to use them!

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.320
One really popular technique for rolling up
cables, which is actually quite counterproductive,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.239
is to roll the cable in the same direction
between our thumb and finger as we make loop

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.190
around our hand, I'm just doing this really
small to demonstrate.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.820
This often does feel like the way our cables
want to naturally go and we do end up with

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.309
a nice looking loop but as you can see when
I unravel this we've actually just introduced

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.800
twists into our cable in the process of rolling
it up.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.910
So we're actually tangled before we even start.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.969
The alternate method, which I'll talk you
through in a second, is very similar but this

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:10.610
time we'll introduce a bit of a counter-balance
in every second roll so that when we go to

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.290
pull this apart it unravels easily, tangle
free.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.290
Amazing.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.230
The way this works is that we start in the
same way, with the end of our guitar lead

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.650
in our hand facing towards us, making sure
there's no twists in the cable to start with.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.540
We then make our first loop rolling the cable
forward between our thumb and finger.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.400
But this time, on the next loop, we want to
roll the cable in the opposite direction so

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.980
that the cable folds in on itself.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:41.800
Then we simply repeat that process until we
reach the end of the cable; create a loop

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.030
rolling the cable away from us, then fold
the cable in on itself rolling towards us.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.140
We want to keep the overall size reasonably
compact but not too tight.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.100
At this point we would obviously use some
velcro or something to keep this from unraveling.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.390
Try this one out for yourself.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.070
If your cable is used to being rolled a certain
way it may take a bit of time for it to behave

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.420
properly, but persist with it and see how
you go.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.970
This doesn't mean you'll never get tangles
in your cables again but it does give you

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.160
a much better staring point.
