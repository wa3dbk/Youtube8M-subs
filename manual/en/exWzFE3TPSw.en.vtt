[YMS] Hey guys. I saw V/H/S/2
and it was uhh, it was good.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.760
It was a six out of ten but not a bad,
disappointed, six out of ten that I usually give

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.530
but a positive six out of ten.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.700
By that I mean it beat my expectations.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.710
It was definitely better than the first one.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.730
Even though I only really liked the
first segment from the first one,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.730
there were multiple segments from
the sequel that I actually liked.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.420
Most notably the one, A Ride in the Park,
if I remember correctly was the same

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.500
director as Blair Witch project.

00:00:28.953 --> 00:00:34.953
And Safe Haven was also really good, 
from the director of The Raid: Redemption

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.993
Which I still haven't seen yet.
God damn it!

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:38.765
But, uhh yeah.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:41.155
Slumber Party Alien Abduction was decent

00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:45.775
and Phase One Clinical Trials
was dumb as all fuck and stupid.

00:00:46.283 --> 00:00:50.973
And of course the meshed skit
Tape 49/Frame Narrative one.

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:58.222
That was dumb and stupid but its from the guy
that came up with the whole idea to do a V/H/S movie

00:00:58.222 --> 00:00:59.282
so whatever.

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:02.033
I'm giving you a pass.
I don't give a shit.

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:06.183
But if you want to see it it's available
for download on iTunes right now.

00:01:06.183 --> 00:01:07.483
(Cough) Torrent.

00:01:07.483 --> 00:01:12.753
Also, my review-- My next one,
which I'm not saying what it is.

00:01:13.737 --> 00:01:18.537
Ill give you a hint. It's a sequel of a movie
that I've already reviewed and it's three words.

00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:22.942
That one I've been working on
very, very, very hard

00:01:22.942 --> 00:01:26.762
and right now, at this point,
there's so many animations,

00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:29.502
technically animations, that I'm doing for them.

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:32.642
Clips, titles, rendering, blah, blah, blah.

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:34.502
It's taking a very fucking long time.

00:01:34.502 --> 00:01:40.242
About eight hours of editing time is
amounting to two to three minuets

00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:42.342
of actual finished review time at this point.

00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:44.242
So I appreciate your patience.

00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:49.152
And also, at the same time, I've only been able
to work on it like two days this week

00:01:49.152 --> 00:01:52.252
because I'm working a job and paying the bills.

00:01:52.252 --> 00:01:55.262
So I appreciate your understanding and otherwise

00:01:55.262 --> 00:01:57.052
V/H/S/2 six out of ten.

00:01:57.052 --> 00:01:59.562
Now I'm just rambling and, uhh,
this is just me checking up on you guys

00:01:59.562 --> 00:02:01.102
'cause I know i haven't posted anything in a while.

00:02:01.102 --> 00:02:03.562
Also, top 10 of 2011 video is back up.

00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:07.562
Uhh, fuck you, fucking copyright bullshit dicks.

00:02:08.256 --> 00:02:09.241
Uhh, so yeah.

00:02:10.516 --> 00:02:11.221
This is done.

00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:12.581
It's done.
