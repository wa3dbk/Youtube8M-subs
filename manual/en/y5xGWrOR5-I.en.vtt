00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.030
Hi.

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.800
Welcome back to the feed my friends series.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.310
I am Tess and in this episode, I am going
I am going to be making my cherry chocolate

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.670
fondant pots.
[music]

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:20.510
The first thing to do is to melt the chocolate.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.950
I have 300 grams of bittersweet dark seventy
percent cocoa chocolate here which I am going

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.010
to add over a sauce pan of simmering water.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.320
This is to melt it nice and gently.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.590
You do not want to melt it to quickly otherwise
it will crack.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.379
Once melted, add the vanilla and a pinch of
salt.

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.210
While my chocolate is cooling, I am just going
to beat together the butter and sugar.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.609
I am just going to beat this together slightly
with a wooden spoon before I use my whisk.

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.940
For the full list of ingredients and the method,
just check out the description box.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.769
The butter and sugar are now nicely combined
and light and fluffy so I am ready to add

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:58.769
eggs.

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.739
I am just going to give them a little whisk
up in the bowl.

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:11.000
I am just going to be adding the eggs a little
bit at a time.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.490
Once you have folded the eggs nicely and have
a nice, light batter.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.689
It is time to add the flour so just sprinkle
that in.

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.950
Carry on mixing.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.230
Now the flour is nicely incorporated.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.560
It is time to add the chocolate.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.560
Pour it in.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.799
Look at that.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.950
Now fold the chocolate into the batter just
gently getting it to combine in nicely.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.080
Here I have some ramekins which I have greased
and dusted with cocoa.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.600
First thing, add one big spoonful of chocolate
batter into the bottom of your ramekin.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.000
Now add a teaspoon of jam into each.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.310
Now you just want to cover the jam with the
rest of the fondant mixture.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.829
So just pop them into the open for 10 to 12
minutes at 200 degrees.

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.579
So my fondant pots have just come out of the
oven and I have left them to cool for a couple

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.720
of minutes so they are ready to turn out.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.720
This is the moment of truth.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.150
They are hot.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.450
You can use a tea towel for this.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.810
Do not burn yourself.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.340
Just simply place them on the plate.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:26.280
A little tap and there we have it.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.150
Our very nice little chocolate fondant pot.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.420
So I have made a really nice port balsamic
cherry syrup sauce to go with this.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.010
Actually all I have done is I have reduced
down some port balsamic sugar and some fresh

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.190
cherries and made it into a really nice kind
of fixed syrup and I am just going to spoon

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.739
that around our really lovely chocolate fondant
pot.

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.910
I am just going to pour a little bit of the
syrup on top.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.030
I have a bit of double cream here and I am
just going to add just a little drizzle in

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.230
the center there.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.280
So there you have it, my delicious cherry
chocolate fondant pot.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.659
I know you are going to love this recipe.

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.530
It is super simple to make.
