Hey, guys, and welcome back to my channel.

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.970
I am doing a review today of some awesome
hair extensions because I've been a hair extension

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.170
queen since I was about 13 years old surprisingly.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.530
My grandma used to wear hair extensions and
stuff and I wanted the wigs, but I used to

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.530
play with them at her house.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.289
And then, when I got old enough to be allowed
to wear them, I used to wear them.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.109
And back in the day, people never even wore
hair extensions.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.970
It was like the most weirdest thing in the
world to everyone if I did.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.460
And they were always just so crappy, so I've
been looking for a long time for great extensions

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.009
that look natural, that were shiny and stuff,
and I found this brand, Irresistible Me.

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.050
They make these great hair extensions that
are like supreme quality for a decent price

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.020
and the best part is they last long.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.650
And a lot of us don't realize that, if you
buy the crappy hair extensions that are like

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.910
$20 and they're like tiny little clip-in ones,
they're, you know, some of those extensions

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.110
that they just kind of don't feel natural.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.110
They don't mesh with your hair.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.500
They'll separate from your hair and it'll
look crappy when you wear it.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.180
Then, if you get the ones that are human hair
and you make your own clip-ins and stuff,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.160
if you don't get good enough quality hair,
the texture just feels disgusting after a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.160
couple of weeks.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.180
So, you wind up spending the same amount as
you would for a good quality pair of hair

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.900
extensions that'll last you for a year or
two.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.900
So, these extensions are great.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.900
I have them in right now.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.150
As you can see, it looks really, really natural
and my hair looks thick.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.780
It matches my hair color.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.330
And, with this kind of company, you can even
message them and ask them if they can customize

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.330
your color.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.330
That's what I did.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.760
I asked if they'd be able to put a mix together
of light blonde and medium blond.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.090
And they did and it looks awesome.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.790
The color is like exactly like my hair color.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.440
So, I can take it out and you could see my
hair is much thinner.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.490
It's just about as long, but way thinner.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.020
This just doubles the thickness of my hair.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.950
So, if I want to curl it and stuff, I can
put these in.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.540
Put it towards the bottom, put a couple of
curls in it, and then it looks like my hair

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.840
is super thick and gorgeous.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.220
And, if I leave it straight, I usually wear
it like by myself like this.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.450
But, if I'm going to a special occasion, I
would just want to like dress it up, I'll

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.549
stick these extensions in and nobody ever
knows.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:52.659
Everybody compliments me on my hair.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.670
They say it looks so long and thick.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.270
And I'm like, "It's extensions."

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.979
So, these extensions -- this piece right here
has three clips in it.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:00.979
This is all I need.

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.790
So, if you have longer hair and you just want
to thicken it up, you should put one piece

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.790
like this in and that's it.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.979
If you have shorter hair and you want to make
it look more balanced, and especially if you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.090
have layers, you want to put the whole set
in.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.810
And it comes with a bunch more, like you can
see this whole bag of different pieces that

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.920
are like two, one, three, four in obviously
a row, and you could just clip it in in all

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.920
different areas.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.510
Like the little ones you put towards the front.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.430
The thick ones you put around the back.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.440
And, then, you add this down below and it
just looks gorgeous.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.750
You'll never know that it's fake hair.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.750
So, oh yeah.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.720
So, I wanted to show you.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.740
This one, I've been wearing for the last -- I
think about five months and, quality wise,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.740
it's perfect.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.110
It's still shiny and I haven't done anything
to it.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.690
And I don't think I've even washed it, which
sounds kind of gross, but I haven't washed

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.780
it and it still just looks great as opposed
to my other extensions that would look like

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.250
Raggedy Ann at this point.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.250
So, you take these extensions, you wash them,
you add some shine serum to it, it's going

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.850
to look like brand new.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.300
Here's some extensions that I haven't touched,
so just so you can see how shiny they are

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.110
even when you first get them.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.620
They're just really beautiful, shiny, and
it looks just like natural hair.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.620
It's gorgeous.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.270
Let's see to see how long these are.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.270
These are really, really long.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.560
I actually cut the other one a little too
short.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.670
But, yeah, you put these in, it just looks
beautiful.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.680
It's great to wear on special occasions and
stuff.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.330
So, I highly recommend this product line being
a hair extension connoisseur and wearing extensions

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.070
for about 10 years plus, you know, of my life.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.460
I highly recommend this brand.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.460
I think it's great.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.879
I love that they come with the clips on it,
unlike the ones at the weave stores where

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:45.000
you have to buy a really fancy weave for like
$200 - $250 and add the clips on yourself.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.660
You could just get this set and it's perfect.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.660
It's already made.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.890
It's nice and -- cut nicely at the bottom
so it looks natural.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.890
And, yeah.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.035
So, I'll post a link below to their website.

00:03:56.035 --> 00:04:01.650
And I'm sure they're -- you know, sometimes
they have deals and things like that based

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.650
on holidays and stuff.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.650
So, I'll check it out and see if there's any
kind of deals for you guys.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.489
But, hopefully, you'll get these in time for
Halloween and, if not, for the rest of the

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.489
holidays this year.

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:07.489
So, I'll see you guys.

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:08.489
Thanks for watching.

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.489
Please subscribe and leave a comment below.

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.860
If you guys have any other favorite hair extension
products that you think I would like or any

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.049
hair products in general, just let me know
and I will try them.

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:17.329
Bye.
