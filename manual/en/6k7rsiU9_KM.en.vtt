Hi this is Matt Dinatale representing expertvillage.com
and in this clip we are going to talk about

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.251
choosing the right keyboard. Why would you
want to choose a keyboard? Well you need it

00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:14.549
to run your PC without it, it is not going
to do very much. First you want to make sure

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.841
when choosing a keyboard it depends what kind
of connection you have on your PC. If you

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:27.080
look at the back of your PC these right here
they are usually color coded. They look like

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:37.850
little circles with about 6 pins in them these
are PS2 pins. Usually now days the newer PCs

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.590
usually don't have these but some of the older
machines do. Now you may have USB, which is

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.790
kind of a rectangular shape and you may have
you know 2, 4, 6, you may have a lot of them

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:59.060
on your PC or you may have both. So first
you want to make sure what connection you

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:07.420
have. Then when you go to purchase your keyboard.
This is a standard keyboard here it has a

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:16.380
107 keys, the number pad; pretty much standard
keyboard. Some have the arrows other ones

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.180
don't. This is a standard qwerty keyboard.
So if you look over here at the Q, spells

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.840
out qwerty. This is basically your standard
and the other end of the PS2 looks like this

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.511
so that would fit into that port there. Usually
the box label PS2 USB or sometimes they are

00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:44.479
both they have a adapter to them. Now USB
keyboard, which is here pretty much looks

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.730
like the other keyboard that I just showed
you which it is pretty much is just that the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.480
connection on the other end looks like this.
It is the rectangular which fits into that

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:04.670
port. So this is also corded which is standard
for keyboards. Now if you want to be not connected

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.830
by a cable you could get a wireless keyboard,
which I have here. You see there is no cables

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.940
attaching it all this is pretty much the same
as the other ones except this is a little

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.560
different layout. There is also cord qwerty
keyboard. This has a few more options on the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.060
top like if you want mail, volume control
and things like that. The way that connects

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:38.940
this particular one here is a PS2 connection.
They also come with USB you just have to look

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.129
for that on the box and this here is what
connects it would be a wireless. You may to

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.780
have those special functions on the keyboard
you may need to install the software that

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.640
came with the keyboard so that those options
would work. Now if you are having like cramps

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.959
in your hands that they could be ergonomics
keyboards so that our angle properly so you

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.330
don't have to bend your hands and that is
choosing a keyboard.
