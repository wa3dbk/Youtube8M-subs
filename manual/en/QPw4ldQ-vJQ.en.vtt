00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.250
when i was commercially dog

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.310
that we were doing most of them

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.910
these clips which we lost within the
first couple days of dog the single

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.620
would become away from the right size

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.340
the devil nobody abolition of the score
a few people was doesn't that give your

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.570
body and that's the annual always the
initially we didn't meet scientifically

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.270
pocket that people

sov twelve or thirteen blore week seven
forty eight just that they just put

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.570
profit then obviously dialup zero
dollars interpretive statements that

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.210
then is therefore they don't have any
big effort pocket at this stage had a

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.530
nice among other things to do it was the

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.259
start strengthening any other for pocket

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:28.949
that i know of

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.039

really a model

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.279
uh... all the complaints really a model
although i would have arrived at the age

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:20.769

little since the end of the stones

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.399

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.930
up joins noise

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.229
i would say pretty much resupplied

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:59.249

and they were doing was used to make
some kind of things with work

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.109
this one is a remarkable liza

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.400
it first ask what is best and brightest

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.819

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:36.860
different nop used to be that you would
creeping up

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.409
experiences

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.419

blanks

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.990
because the principal victoria are not
pushing the board as well and that's

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.970
where these really pay off severely
constant
