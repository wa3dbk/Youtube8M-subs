00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.310
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.260
I like to go into a
MAC store and, rather

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.260
than looking for the
particular type of product,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.570
I like to look for color.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.560
That's what drew me to
MAC in the first place.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.540
I'm not sure why people
are hesitant with color

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.550
or hesitant to go
for it with makeup.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.092
I don't know, maybe
there's a thought

00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:24.967
that people are gonna
look at them strangely,

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:26.320
but I kind of enjoy that.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.425
I'll give them a wave.

00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:30.400
(LAUGHS)

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.780
Life is too short to be beige.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.030
So we're going to be doing
some Chartreuse green eyes

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.040
and of course some pink lips.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.490
I'm going to do
colored eyebrows,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.113
cause I need to match my hair.

00:00:42.113 --> 00:00:44.530
It's not like a hair color or
tattoo-- you can wipe makeup

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.010
off if it doesn't work.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.010
You can play around.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.370
We're gonna start with eyebrows.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.340
We're going to use
Viva Glam lipstick,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.280
and I'm going for this cool,
peachy tone of the lipstick

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.640
because it's the perfect
color to match my hair.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.160
I haven't seen my natural hair
colors since I was about 12.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.200
God knows what I am.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.190
I like to do the base, first, of
the brow, to create the curve,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.540
and then I'm just going
to soften this color up,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.013
otherwise, you could look a
little bit like a Thunderbird.

00:01:14.013 --> 00:01:15.430
Now, because it's
a lipstick, it's

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.060
pretty creamy so I'm actually
going to set it with a blush.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.650
Just to set that cream in place.

00:01:23.347 --> 00:01:25.180
What I'm going to do
is I'm going to give it

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.610
a little bit of depth.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.810
I'm using a lip pencil.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.920
It's in a slightly
deeper pink shade

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.380
and I'm just taking this just
along the base of the brow,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.050
very lightly.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.143
And blend.

00:01:38.143 --> 00:01:39.810
And what this does
is it kind of creates

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.980
an anchor for the brows.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.313
It just really gets it a
little bit more of a 3D effect.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.110
The fun thing about the colors
that we're going to do today

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.620
is that we're not doing
the normal shading

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.420
and highlighting
of the eye makeup.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.480
We're just going to go for
intense color blocking.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.000
If you make any mistakes with
the brows, with my concealer

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.940
you can clean up the base
of the brow really easy.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.800
Gives you a really
nice polished look.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.200
All right.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.824
I've painted on my personality.

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:10.949
(LAUGHS)

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.420
Everything pink makes me happy.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.700
I know, how sad, isn't it?

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.992
It was like that when I was
five and it hasn't changed.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.450
I'm going to be using
the Chartreuse green

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.400
and this can suit all
types of skin colors.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.890
We're going to go straight in
with this great green pencil.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.850
I've got quite small eyes so
I love a really diffused edge

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.870
of this eye makeup.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.200
It makes my eyes look bigger.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.570
You know, if you don't
want to take it this far,

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.775
you can keep it a little
bit closer to your eye.

00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:42.650
The reason why I'm doing
the green underneath

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.067
is because I'm
going to be putting

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:45.770
a really bright
Chartreuse over the top

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.770
and we want to get some
really strong intensity,

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.438
and you can't get it from
just a powder eyeshadow.

00:02:50.438 --> 00:02:51.980
You need to put some
color underneath

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.540
to really get it full on.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.850
Start a movement.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.780
It's all about green.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.980
We're going to start adding
eyeshadow over the top.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.255
The green that I'm using
today is called Swimming.

00:03:03.255 --> 00:03:05.630
It's got a shimmery texture
so it's really easy to blend.

00:03:07.807 --> 00:03:10.140
I'm going over the top of the
green, and what it's doing

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.015
is it's lining it up.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.590
Yeah.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.020
Loving this.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.456
Mascara.

00:03:21.456 --> 00:03:22.970
You can never have
enough mascara.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.296
I could be here for hours.

00:03:25.296 --> 00:03:28.930
I'm just using Zoom Lash here
cause I love chunky lashes.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.007
No effort.

00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:32.465
All right, so what
I'm gonna do now

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:33.970
is I'm going to use
the same lipstick,

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.845
and I'm going to use it
on my lips this time.

00:03:35.845 --> 00:03:37.920
Heaven forbid.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.310
I want to press it
in like a stain.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.638
I'm just going over the top
with a little bit of concealer.

00:03:43.638 --> 00:03:45.930
Just so we're getting a little
bit more Brigitte Bardot

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.640
feeling.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.707
The pink version.

00:03:49.707 --> 00:03:51.540
I'm using the same lip
liner that I actually

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.760
used in my brows.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.620
Just underneath and
just at the top.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.853
Just gives your lips
a little bit of shape.

00:04:01.853 --> 00:04:03.270
This lipstick is
clearly a winner,

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.630
because I'm going to
use it all over my face.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.740
If you have different colors
on the eyes, lips, and cheeks,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.070
you can feel a
little bit clownish,

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.900
so I'm going to be
using the same color.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.540
I'm just going to use,
once again, my finger.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:20.459
All right.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.510
The finishing touch here--

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.385
this is probably one of
my favorite products.

00:04:23.385 --> 00:04:24.785
I'm using Soft and Gentle.

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:26.160
What I'm going to
be doing is I'm

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.342
going to be giving
my skin some shine.

00:04:28.342 --> 00:04:29.800
I like to look as
fake as possible.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.654
Can you tell?

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.110
I'm just going to spritz my
brush here with a bit of Fix+.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.480
I'm going to go right
into the Soft and Gentle

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.660
and I'm just going to
sweep this over the top.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.160
The reason why I'm
wetting the brush

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.420
is because it gives the
powder more intensity--

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.232
Like I needed more
intensity with this makeup.

00:04:52.232 --> 00:04:53.198
Yes!

00:04:53.198 --> 00:04:55.620
Excellent.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.050
And there we have a really
nice, natural, day look.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.200
