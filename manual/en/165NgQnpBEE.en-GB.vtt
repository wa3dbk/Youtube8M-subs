00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.540
Hi welcome to How-to-Repair! this video is
on a CDA oven that is not heating and how

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.830
to replace the fan oven element what we're
doing is we've got the appliance on the test

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.770
bench the customers brought the appliance
into us and complaint that the electricity

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.810
had tripped in his house and after resetting
it there was no heat in the oven so we´ve

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.140
quickly just wired it up on the test bench
and we set the thermostat to 100 left it run

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.689
for about 10 minutes and there was no heat
in the oven this leads me to believe that

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.560
it's the fan oven element as the fan is running
and the thermostat light is coming on the

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.920
first thing that needs to be done is the appliance
needs to be disconnected from the electricity

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.460
I would also recommend knocking it off at
the mains or disconnecting the appliance completely

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.800
from the electricity supply you can either
work in situde in its housing or you can remove

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.780
the oven completely I always recommend removing
the oven and I also recommend removing the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.351
glass door to save any damage happening to
the appliance there are two clasps you can

00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:08.300
see me bending over towards the glass make
sure that they're locked in place and by lifting

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.999
the door up you will be able to get the hinges
out of their slots now the door is off remove

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:20.880
the oven shelves and inside the oven you will
find a back panel which covers the fan and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.950
also the element this is held on with four
screws on this model some models have two

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.979
screws and some have retaining bolts just
undo the screws and then the back panel will

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.030
come off right while I'm doing this you'll
find the link on this video that will take

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.090
you through to the full tutorial and will
also put a link on the video which will take

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.749
you through to all the CDA elements that we
have for sale and if you can't find the element

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:56.680
that you're looking for your appliance please
just email us your model number and will look

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.289
it up on the database for you and direct you
to the right part also please remember to

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.270
subscribe to our channel that´s what keeps
us going and able to make these free videos

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.459
for you. You can also join us on Facebook
there we go the panel has come off now you

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.459
can see some distortion at the top of the
element here and in the bottom right hand

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.099
corner which is a good sign that the element
has blown but we're going to check it with

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.900
a meter in a minute there are three screws
holding this element in place one at the bottom

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.760
and two on the main bracket that you can see
here once you´ve removed the two screws you´ll

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.680
then have access to pull the element towards
you now on some models you will have nuts

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.860
and bolts holding the element in place if
this is the case you will have to actually

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.190
to remove the oven to get to rear to undo
the nuts once the element is pulled out you'll

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.069
see two wires attached to terminals just disconnect
them but make sure that they do not fallback

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.860
through the back panel as you will have to
take the appliance out again to actually retrieve

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:12.270
them. Now here you can see the element with
the distortion on both sides but what we'll

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.959
do is using an electrical meter is set it
to continuity and if the element is blown

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:27.090
there will be no circuit in other words no
resistance at all it will be open circuit

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:36.730
and as you can see on the meter there is no
reading at all. Do remember elements can blow

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.400
in different ways you may end up with an earth
fault on the element so when you actually

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.580
turning the fan oven on it trips the electricity
supply in your house or it may just trip all

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.920
the time in this case you will need to replace
the element and the only way to test it properly

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.920
is with the mega which most people do not
have just testing the element here so you

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:07.560
can see the comparison between the old and
the new and now we´ll connect up the wiring

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:15.469
and replace the element if your oven is constantly
tripping up the electricity supply it might

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:20.419
not necessarily be the actual fan oven element
that´s at fault it could be another component

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:27.050
or another element while I'm putting this
back in please remember to mark the website

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:34.500
down to your favorites has we do all types
of diagnostic repairs on all appliances and

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.680
at the site you will have in-depth articles
and videos showing you how to the repair tumble

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:49.139
dryers washing machines dishwashers etc. just
getting the last two screws in and then we´ll

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:57.699
reassemble the oven and I'll also show you
how to put the door back on correctly at the

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:04.080
website you will find other tutorials on how
to remove built-in oven's from their housing

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:19.199
also for the videos on how to change a thermostat
and so on. Some of them are general not on

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:25.000
specific models. But it will give you a good
idea how to go through the repair now when

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.069
replacing this back panel it´s just an idea
to get one screw in half way and then you'll

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:41.169
be able to adjust the panel up or down just
to lineup the screws once you've got to in

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:50.110
place it should all line up again while I'm
just finishing this back panel of please remember

just send us an email through the contact
us form Right! Now we´ll replace the oven

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:23.479
shelves 
now when fitting the door make sure that you

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:30.360
get the hinges lined up in the correct location
holes and the bottom part of the hinge has

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:38.840
got slot in it which will sit in the retaining
bracket Lift it up and down a few times before

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:45.919
letting the door go as to make sure it is
locked in place correctly just in case you

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:51.030
haven't done it correctly and then the door
falls off and you could smash the glass now

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:59.360
we're turning the oven on now to the fan setting.
setting it up100 again wait 5-10 minutes and

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:06.460
you'll see the light should go out once it
reaches temperature there we go and when you

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.860
go inside the oven it'll be nice and hot and
you can actually see the element there glowing

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.720
red and it´s heating. and there you go your
oven it's fixed thanks very much for watching
