00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.320
Hi I'm Lazze and I'm back here with tips and
tricks again. And this time we are back with

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.000
the English Wheel. This is an important thing
to remember for you when you using your English

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.480
Wheel at home. And this is the same principals
so you can use that for many different brands

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.060
of English Wheel. Long time ago when we wheeled
up a door skin like this, because that's what

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.060
I going to talk to you about. We could wheel
it up this way, and cross it this way. And

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.870
sometimes it came out okay, but I had a feeling
that it could look better. And it must be

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.879
another way to do it. So many times when I
have a problem and I go to sleep then I wake

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:56.199
up in the middle of the night and find out
that, oh, there is the answer. So this happened

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:03.199
even this time. So I going to explain if you
wheeling it across like this in the English

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.730
Wheel. So you cross it both ways like that
but 90 degrees to each other. You can see

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.360
how much overlap we have in the center there
between those two tracks. When we wheeling

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.690
it in a diamond shape, and I turn it over
like this to diamond shape. Can you see there

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.690
how much we increase that area? So that means
that when we wheeling up a door skin like

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.500
this in a diamond shape, it's the same amount
of wheeling to cover the whole area but the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.650
overlap is more so we can get it up faster
and we can make it better quality too.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.990
So if you have big panel like this that door
skin one thing to remember for you is that

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.460
you need to be two people to hold the panel
like this. You can't do a panel like this

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.760
by yourself, because the gravity going to
hang down one side and the door skin or roof

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.760
skin going to take a totally shape that you
want. So and when you wheeling this by two

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.540
people it's important that if one person holding
their hands wide like this, it's important

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.670
that the other person holding his hand the
same symmetrical to this side. If one person

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.190
holding it like this, and the other person
on this side holding it tight, like this,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.300
those sides going to hang down because of
the gravity. And the panel going to take a

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:42.200
different shape that you want. So when you
have a flat piece and you going to wheel it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.530
I put some help lines like this. So those
three lines is just help lines and then I

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.450
cross it the other way in a diamond shape
so we have six lines that help us to keep

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.810
those lines parallel to the wheel. And then
we start in one corner and wheeling it as

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.810
far up as we can until this corner here touching
the frame in the English Wheel. Then we go

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.790
out with the wheel to here, or to here, and
then turn it around and continue wheeling

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.370
this part. The next step is to cross this
so we go the another direction and do the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.370
same thing there. Then we have a little convex
on the panel. And what we do you can see those

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.540
rectangular that I put up on the panel here.
So we start in one corner here and wheel this

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.580
and then we cross this first one this way.
Then we go over to the next rectangular and

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.180
start in one corner wheel it a diamond shape
over the center one. And then we cross this

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.180
one and go over the center one again. And
then we do same the thing with the third rectangular

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.180
and then the whole sheet. That means that
we cover the center section four times more

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.670
than the, the big sheet. And that means that
we are raising it up more in the center. And

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:17.130
that's what we want. So that's a good tip
and remember that when you wheeling up something,

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.130
roof skin or door skin, like this. If your
shape of the panel if it's a trunk lid you

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.400
maybe have this little further up, so you
can actually when you put those rectangular

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.300
on the sheet you can actually move this high
spot wherever you want where the highest spot is.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.300
And sometimes you maybe don't want the
roof skin so top on the center so you maybe

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.430
have only this rectangular and this and then
whole sheet work on those so you don't using

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.639
the center one and wheeling that up. So it
depends little on the shape, but principal

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:59.639
is the same. So this will help you a lot with
wheeling up a big, big skin. And if you have

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.599
your English Wheel frame is stiff enough it
shouldn't take you longer then one a half

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:11.400
hour to wheel up a door skin roof skin like
that what we do many hands on class when the

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.270
student making a door skin like this for '33,
'34 Ford and they never stand in the English

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:24.270
Wheel before. So it can be done pretty quick
if you do it right. If you want more information
