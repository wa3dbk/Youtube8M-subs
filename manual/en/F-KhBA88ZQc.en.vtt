00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:03.279
Okay.

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:19.590
Today I thought I would show you how to change
the batteries on a Swifter Wet Jet.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.760
Now the key part here is to flip this thing
upside down.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.840
Before you replace your liquid here.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.600
To release the liquid we are going to push
this button.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.450
So flipping it upside down will mean you do
not get a mess all over you.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.450
Okay.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.720
The battery compartment is right here.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.720
It's very simple.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.520
Slide it down and there is our batteries.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.140
Change out our batteries.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.350
Good to go.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.560
Nice and simple.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.700
Anyway that is how you can get into the batteries
for a Swifter Wet Jet.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.370
Once again once you are finished, once you
have replaced your batteries.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.920
You want to hold it this way and insert your
liquid this way.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.090
Again you won't be getting your liquid all
over you.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.090
Making a mess.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:03:42.400
That is how to replace the batteries on a
Swifter Wet Jet.
