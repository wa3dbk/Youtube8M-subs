Braided Hairstyle #3

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.500
Hello girls ! If I were to say « Fishtail braid » 
would it mean anything to you ?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.500
This is what I’ll be 
teaching you to do today !

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.100
Let’s start first 
with a french fishtail braid.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.500
To do it, you first need 
to take a reserved section of hair.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.800
Watch carefully 
and you’ll see it’s not difficult !

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.000
If you know me, you’ll know that
I hardly ever use ponybands !

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.000
In this case, just backcomb the end of braid
and fix it with a small bobby pin.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.000
You’ll see how easy it is ! 
And very discreet at the same time.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.500
Braid your hair just how 
you like it, thin or thick.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.100
The wider the braid, 
the wider the strands you’ll use.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
But whichever you choose,
they must always be equal.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.600
There you are girls ! I hope you enjoyed it !
A la semaine prochaine !
