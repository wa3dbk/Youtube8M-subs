00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.170
Welcome to the SPECT section of the course
in Biomedical Imaging.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.320
My name is Dr Rajiv Bhalla and I am the Radiochemistry
Team Leader at the Centre for Advanced Imaging,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.320
at the University of Queensland.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.930
Not all of you will be familiar with the acronym
SPECT. It stands for Single Photon Emission

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.210
Computed Tomography.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.000
This section will introduce the concepts and
applications of SPECT in molecular imaging.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.280
You will see that SPECT is a remarkably sensitive
imaging technique and understand why it is

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.350
widely used to diagnose neurology, oncology
and cardiovascular diseases.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.670
SPECT is a non-invasive imaging technique
that uses a radiopharmaceutical, which is

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.979
typically injected into the bloodstream.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:52.059
As we have previously discussed, a radiopharmaceutical
is a drug molecule which contains a radioactive

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.969
isotope.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.579
Radiopharmaceuticals are used to diagnose
or treat diseases.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.129
During this course we will focus on their
applications for diagnosis.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.220
We will also discuss the common radioisotopes
used in SPECT.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.250
I will describe the properties of these isotopes,
which makes them useful in applications for

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.940
imaging.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.850
As an example, this current slide shows some
of the common radiopharmaceuticals used in

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.160
SPECT.
I will describe how the radioisotope is introduced

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.160
into these molecules, and then explain how
clinicians use these radiopharmaceuticals.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.140
Another section of this course will provide
an overview of SPECT scanners. These scanners

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.850
are the instruments used to image patients
after they have been injected with a radiopharmaceutical

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.710
drug.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.140
We will study examples of images produced
after the scan, and then explain how they

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.500
help clinicians to diagnose patients.
By the end of this course, we hope that you

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.140
will understand the common radioisotopes used
in SPECT, understand how these radioisotopes

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.400
are introduced into drug molecules to form
radiopharmaceuticals, understand the patient

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.340
experience and what happens during a SPECT
scan, understand how clinicians use these

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.780
images to diagnose patients.
