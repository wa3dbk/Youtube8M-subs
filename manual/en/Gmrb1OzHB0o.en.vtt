The Ultimate Style Icon
Manhattan A New American Classic

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.350
When I was with Pottery Barn in the nineties
one of our favorite things to do was to

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.030
go to Europe to look for product ideas and
the very best places in Europe to find the

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.130
best product ideas were in the flea markets
two of my favorite flea markets to go to uh

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.530
in paris were Clignancourt

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.949
in paris and the other was a flea market called
Porte de Vanves

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.869
and they were probably the best flea markets
in all of Europe

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.130
we would get up early in the morning

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.809
usually the flea markets would start at about
four in the morning and so you had to get

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.810
there at four because the best

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.760
items which show up and all the dealers from
all over would be there at four I remember

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.049
well one flea market when these 

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:46.200
leather chairs began to arrive I think that
they were

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.140
becoming popular with europeans which is why
they were starting to appear for the first

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.730
time

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.620
uh and when we first saw them we knew
they'd be perfect

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.430
after we started seeing these chairs pop-up
in flea markets all over Europe

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.730
uh we started to learn about the origins
from paris and looked for the perfect chair

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.620
what we learned is the origin of the club
chair was in paris in nineteen twenties when

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.810
the first club chairs were created and they
were created for men's clubs in paris

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.360
uh in fact the chairs that we bought

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.100
if you look closely you'll see the original
logo of the club

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.560
uh was printed on the back of the chair and
then over the years was scrubbed off so you

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.860
have to look pretty carefully to see it

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.910
after we started seeing the chairs appear
in all the flea markets in Europe we decided

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.090
that we would focus on the chairs from the
nineteen thirties and look for a generously

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.690
proportioned

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.920
leather chair

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.009
our search took us to Manhattan

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.000
and we ultimately found the perfect chair in
Manhattan

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.630
there were design details on the original chair
that we knew we wanted to keep

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.830
there was a

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.250
beautiful line of piping all around the edge of
the chair. The other thing about the chair

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.600
is it had wooden feet that were beautifully
designed that we wanted to maintain

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.930
We went and found leather to wrap around
the chair it was a cow leather from argentina

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.539
with a perfect

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.600
patina for the chair

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.400
the Manhattan chair officially launched in
the mid-nineties. We gave a full page shot it was

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.609
a beautiful chair it photographed very well

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.010
and it was an immediate success

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.120
our customers love the chair and it became
one of the iconic pieces in the collection

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.370
I think the beauty of the Manhattan chair
is that it's timeless no matter how styles change

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.419
in people's homes this chair is beautiful
in any room

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:33.439
at any time

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:39.049
it brings back a time in the twenties when
people spend time in clubs

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.720
and enjoyed life

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.239
and it's a very romantic time that I think
everyone can

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.250
feel a part of

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.239
when they sit in this chair

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
