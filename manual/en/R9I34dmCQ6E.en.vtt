Ohio State Bee Research at the Wilds

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.220
KAREN GOODELL: What we're interested in is
how pollinators are using these

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.180
reclaimed mine landscapes.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.469
JENISE BAUMAN:The Wilds is a conservation
center.

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.010
This whole area was strip mined

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.200
in the 1950's and reclaimed throughout the
60's and '70's.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.839
Here at The Wilds we want to know how to put
that landscape back.

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:26.839
We have many

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.090
academic partners.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.999
OSU is one of them and one of our oldest and
greatest academic

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.999
partners.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:38.160
KAREN GOODELL: These plots are designed to
attract pollinators.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.890
I planted them in the

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.649
Spring of 2009, they were bare ground then
- we had tilled up the ground.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:46.649
This being

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.079
the third year is the real peak year.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.670
One of the factors is what kind of flowers
you plant

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.960
so this is a plot that has one of three different
seed mixes that I've used.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.470
And the other factor that's going to influence
the movement of pollinators across the

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.239
landscape is where they're coming from in
the first place.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.239
They may be coming from the

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:08.850
forest edge where there's a higher plant diversity.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.670
They may be coming from a butterfly

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.670
habitat.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.810
We've put the plots out at varying distances
from these higher quality habitats and we're

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.530
interested in, you know, which species make
it all the way out.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.690
GROUP: A fly.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.840
Probably a fly.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.869
KAREN GOODELL: If I didn't have students nothing
would get done.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:30.869
It just takes many

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.570
hands and many eyes to do this work.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.630
KAREN GOODELL: Down here we've got leaf, leaf
--

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.470
KAREN GOODELL: I have been extremely fortunate
to get great students from both

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.560
the Newark campus and the Columbus campus
and to be able to employ my graduate

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.560
students with the help of grants from the
Newark campus and from the Columbus Zoo.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.560

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.829
HOWARD ROGERS: My specific study is looking
at the different nesting plots, trying

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.950
to establish what kind of bees are nesting
out there, what their resources are and how

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.250
they're using them.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.110
We start by looking at the nest boxes and
taking down which of the chambers are

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.460
occupied, and then will bring more nesting
boxes out if it looks like they need more

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.460
space.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.460
FEMALE: Eight.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.460
Sixteen.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.190
HOWARD ROGERS: We take a random compass direction
and get four different

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.160
distance measurements that we each go out.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.960
We use our one meter squared quadrant
- lay it on the ground, and then we first

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.190
look at what kind of floral density there
is the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.190
what type of different species.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.250
[MALE: Zero and one.]

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.280
HOWARD ROGERS: We then do ten minute increments
of netting.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.280
We'll go out and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.280
catch any bee we find...

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.270
[electronic music]

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.270


00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.440
...and then we bring them back, put them in
the jar, and use the duster - carbon dioxide

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.380
gas - that slows down their metabolism enough
for us to be able to identify them take

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.380
any notes we need.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.070
Then, after a while they'll kick back up and
fly away.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.380
STEPHANY CHICAIZA: My work is focused on looking,
not just at pollen limitation but

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.660
also looking at research limitation, because
in a reclaimed mine site the soil, itself,

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.660
is

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.230
just so difficult.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.370
Being a freshman and getting an internship
is amazing.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.570
I think it puts

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.800
at a different level and its just great to
work out here.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.510
You know, the people here are

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.300
great and as Jenise Bauman has said, "It's
our playground."

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.980
JENISE BAUMAN: We've had an internship program
running basically as long as we've

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.010
been here.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.450
Our new Conservation Science Training Center
allows for a hub for students

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.230
to come, stay long-term in our cabins, and
really dive into ecological research.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.220
[acoustic guitar strumming]

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.900
KAREN GOODELL: What can we do out at the Wilds?

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.500
We can promote native plant

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.250
populations, such as prairies.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.890
But those aren't going to be successful unless
we have

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.280
the mutualists, the pollinators, to help the
plants reproduce.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.590
That all fits into restorat

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.370
because if the bees aren't there, the plants
will never be able to produce enough seed

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.920
to get the plant population self-sustaining.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.570
Bees are really the organisms that are moving
genes around for plants.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.570
Pollinators

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.870
are absolutely essential for agricultural
production.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.910
We need them here.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.910
We need to

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.360
understand what drives their diversity and
what makes their populations thrive.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.100
What we are doing to our habitat really impacts
the bee communities in ways we don't

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.100
totally understand.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.880
I think there's a lot of information that
needs to be gathered as we a

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.720
humans continue to have a very big influence
on our natural surroundings.
