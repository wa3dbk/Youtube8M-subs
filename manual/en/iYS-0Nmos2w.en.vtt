what up fish tank people fishtanktv.com

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.710
dustinsfishtanks trying to bring it to
you on a Tuesday and I had a great day

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.110
the weather's shaping up here in
Lexington

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.710
things are looking good and I want to
talk about the recently dirted tank just

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.380
because I feel like it's important that
people understand kind of what you're

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.670
going to get when you dirt a tank and I
want to talk about all these plants over

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:32.099
here so here's what's up when you dirt a
tank you know you're going to have

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.329
excess nutrients in the water so they
say to really really plant the heck out

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.460
but they say I say to plant the heck out
of it

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.910
and it works and here's why it works
because the plants absorb the excess

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.430
nutrients not all of these plants that I
put in here are all brand new they've

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.149
got they comfortable completely
different water than me might be my

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.800
water so they're going to melt and
they're going to change and if you'll

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.870
notice in the back here there used to be
a line of jungle val that's completely

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.760
melted it's withered away I'm even if
you can see it it just looks like hell

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.080
it's hidden behind there you can't even
see it yeah you can kind of see it it's

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.000
gone and that's fine that's what jungle
bio does it's a very like quick growing

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.310
thin leaf plant Sagittarius is similar
to that as well and you can see that

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.520
that's going bad but I talked about this
lesson I'm gonna talk about it again

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.750
don't focus on the leaves that are dying
focus on the leaves that are growing up

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.079
okay that is what you need to look for
um he the persistent and long loved'

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.180
aquarium kid also known as Josh asked me
how long it takes crypts the kind of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.229
bounce back well depends on the crypt in
it between depends on the ASP

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:51.479
the species of excuse-me depends on the
crip and it depends on the system that

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.610
the crypt is in sorry I don't know I
can't talk tonight and that is important

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.909
so I can't just say you know crypts
melting three weeks later they're better

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.329
I got these crypts on Friday and they're
doing fine haven't melted and they've

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:10.050
got new growth
so see that new growth new growth new

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.860
growth new growth so I really can't tell
you meanwhile the Liguilla that I got is

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.930
looking like hell it's like all withered
up but you can see new growth and kind

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.440
of like some leaves that are green and
some spots that are doing better

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.930
that's just what you got to look for now
what I'm gonna do in this tank is I'm

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.620
gonna this weekend I'm gonna do a big
old 50% water change maybe even more

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.950
than that just to really kind of clean
out what kind of junk I've got going on

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.850
here I'm also going to kind of spruce up
the plants a little bit and I'm also

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.640
gonna scrape the algae you'll notice
I've got a little algae on the front

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.640
here and I'm really not doing any work
to show you this is like the I don't

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.170
want to say worst-case scenario but you
know if you do it right you do an inch

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.420
of sub into dirt over your substrate
shit I said that wrong I must be tired

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.300
if you do an inch of gravel over your
dirt underneath your substrate always

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.459
put your dirt underneath your gravel you
know you might get a little bit algae

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.400
you're going to get a little bit of
plants that wither but they're all going

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.120
to come back and everything is going to
be good so this is like you know kind of

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.790
part of the process but when you get
going you get something going like that

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.590
so I just I want to explain this because
it's it's going on its raw here I'm not

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.770
freaking out a lot of people are like oh
my god I drew my tanks what am I gonna

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.090
do this is all screwed up it's just like
just chill relax everything will be good

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.130
your tank will be rolling like that tank
is rolling I'm really happy with with

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.820
220s going so that's what's going on
also I'll show you the jungle Val over

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:01.090
here is really just growing crazier
growing great all up

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.590
like wig is looking good Crips are
looking good this sad is growing good

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.690
the chinensis right here that I moved
from the I move this plant from the

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.450
other tank it's got a nice yeah just got
that one green vein right there that's

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.380
all it matters it's all I need so I'm
going to get in there and trim the ones

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.910
that are getting lighter and that that
plane will be fine I feel bad that it

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.140
got to that point but I had to move it
and uh so that's what's up just kind of

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.310
want to give you guys a lowdown what's
going down and now we're having some fun

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.570

rock for sale I also sell aquarium
