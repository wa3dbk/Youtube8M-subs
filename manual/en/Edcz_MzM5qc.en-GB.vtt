00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.590
Homology and Analogy of Plants and Animals

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.660
The central idea of biological evolution is
that all life on earth shares a common ancestor.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.590
There is much evidence for the theory of evolution.
Homologous and analogous organs in animals

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.571
and plants are considered to be major evidence
in favor of the theory of evolution. Some

00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:40.750
traits in different organisms are similar
because they inherited them from a common

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.329
ancestor, and some similarities evolved in
other ways. These are called homologies and

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.210
analogies. We will look at the different characteristics
and identify the homologous and analogous

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.430
organs in the plants and animals we have selected.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.120
Homology

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.210
Homology is similarity in structure among
different organisms which is inherited from

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.539
a common ancestor. Though similar in structure,
the function of the structure is different

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.420
in different organisms.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.320
Homology in Animals

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.860
In animals, although structures are similar,
they have different functions in different

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.849
animals. For example, the forelimbs of the
some animals have a similar set of bones because

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:32.350
they derived from a common ancestor. Depending
on life style, these bones have different

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.580
shapes and will perform different functions.
For example, let�s look at organs such as

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.630
bat's wing, wings of birds, seal�s flipper,
forelimb of a horse, and the human arm. We

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.720
can observe that although the shape and size
of the bones are not similar, there is still

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.990
a similarity in their structure. They have
the same set of bones: humerous, radius and

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:07.710
ulna, carpals and metacarpals. Humans use
the hand for grasping and doing work. Whales

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.840
use flippers for swimming and bats and birds
use their wings for flight. The horse uses

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.280
its forelimbs for running.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.370
Homology in Plants

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.600
In plants, as well as animals, we can also
observe homologous structure. In some plants

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.450
like pea and barberry, the leaves show a different
function and shape from the leaves we normally

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.500
see. The tendrils of the pea plant and spines
of barberry plant are homologous organs showing

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.880
different functions. The tendril of the pea
is a modified leaf and is used for providing

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.200
mechanical support for plant. In the case
of barberry, the leaves are modified into

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.760
spines and are meant for protection. The tendril
of a pea and spine of barberry originated

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.230
from leaves, so they are homologous organs
in plants, but have different functions.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.940
Analogy

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:14.200
Analogy is a similarity in function in different
organisms due to evolution. That is, species

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.800
may also have similar traits even though they
are not related to each other. This usually

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.300
results because the species live in similar
environments, fill similar ecological roles

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.680
and through natural selection the same type
of structure is favoured in different ancestors.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.410
The structures in this case are known as analogous
structures.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.410
Analogy in Animals

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.680
Analogous organs have similar functions, but
different origins. This is the opposite of

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.069
homologous organs, which as we explained,
have a common origin, but different functions.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.610
An example of an analogous trait in an animal
would be the wings of insects, feathers of

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.319
birds and wings of bats, which have common
functions, but different origins. The wings

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:00.431
of an insect originated from the inner or
outer surface of the insect�s body. Feathers

00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:06.150
of birds originated from forelimbs and wings
of bats originated from both the forelimb

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.819
and membranous skin of the abdomen.

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.230
Analogy in Plants

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.900
Take a look at the leaves of Opuntia and Peepal
plant. In the Opuntia, the stem is modified

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.600
into a broad succulent leaf-like structure,
which will perform photosynthesis in the same

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.910
way as leaves. The Peepal leaf is a normal
leaf which will also perform photosynthesis.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.270
So, both Opuntia and peepal leaves perform
the common function of photosynthesis, but

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.490
have different structures. Therefore, they
are analogous organs in plants.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.060
In the case of potato and sweet potato we
can observe that they have similar characteristics,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.270
but different origins. The potato is a modified
underground stem, which is meant for storage

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.900
of food. It has eyes which represent nodes.
Sweet potato is a modified underground root,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.360
which is also meant for storage of food. It
has root hairs.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.950
Here are the main points you should know about
homologous and analogous structures.
