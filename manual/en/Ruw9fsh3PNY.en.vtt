00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.640
Do You like Huey Lewis and the News?

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.440
Yeah... They're okay.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.100
 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.660
 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.280
Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.580
But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own;

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.100
 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.860
commercially and artistictly

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.580
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.120
 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.440
The whole album has a clear crisp sound

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.200
and a new sheen of consummate professionalism

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.180
that really gives the songs a big boost.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.180
 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.180
 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.180
 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.180
 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.180
 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.180
He's been compared to Elvis Costello but I think

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.180
but I think Huey has far more bitter,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.180
cynical sense of humor.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.180
Hey, Halberstam?

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.300
Yes, Allen?

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.180
Why are there copies of the Style section all over 
the place?

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.180
Do you have a dog?

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.180
A chow or something?

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.180
No, Allen.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.900
Is that a raincoat?

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.140
Yes it is!

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.860
In '87,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.860
Huey released this, For!, their most accomplished album.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.520
I think their undisputed masterpiece is ...

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.280
"HiP To Be Square,"

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.700
a song so catchy

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.520
most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.520
because it's not just about the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.520
pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520
It's also a personal statement

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.360
about the band itself.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.880
Hey Paul!

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.880
Aaaaagh!

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.560
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking 
stupid bastard!

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.880
You fucking.... Bastard!

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.360
 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.360
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.460
 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.960
 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.940
 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.940
 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.940
