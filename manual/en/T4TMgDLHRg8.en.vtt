Hello my name is Luis Estrada and I am a software
developer. In this video I'll show you how

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.870
to print an entire page on Internet Explorer.
Internet Explorer is a registered trademark

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.990
of Microsoft and I have no affiliation with
Microsoft. Click on the file tab then select

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:32.660
print preview. Here is the preview of how
the web page would look on paper. At the bottom

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.980
part you can see how many paper pages would
be needed to print the web page. In this case

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:47.320
you would need three. Click on the arrows
to see the other two pages. To see the three

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:56.800
pages at the same time, select three pages
view. To reduce the amount of paper pages

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.360
needed to print this you can make the entire
web page smaller. For example if you select

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.709
a fifty percent reduction, then you would
need only two paper pages. Obviously the text

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:14.119
and images might appear too small when printed.
For a better look at each of the pages select

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.829
the view total width option. You barely see
the information on the screen but it is still

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.990
readable. However when printed this could
be a different story. The best bet before

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.770
you print a lot of pages is to print only
one and make sure that you have chosen the

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.319
correct size. Press the print document button
then under pages interval instead of selecting

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.759
all, choose the pages option and enter the
page number that you want to print. Then simply

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:49.799
click the print button. Get a look at the
printed page and if you need to make the texts

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.749
bigger select the one hundred percent option
or even the two hundred percent for text twice

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:04.399
as big. I'm Luis Estrada and I've just shown
you how to use your web browser.
