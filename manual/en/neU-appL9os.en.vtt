A lace front wig is a great option for 
 a believable hairline with no bangs. 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.536
The first step in achieving this look is to 
 pin the hair back around the face.

00:00:20.874 --> 00:00:25.911
If you have long hair, put it into a ponytail 
 and create a low and flat bun. 

00:01:04.017 --> 00:01:08.504
Next, apply a weave cap to control any flyaways and stray hairs. 

00:01:11.224 --> 00:01:14.878
Start at the front and pull all the way across the back. 

00:01:17.482 --> 00:01:19.117
Tuck any hair underneath.

00:01:20.453 --> 00:01:22.944
Pull out the ears and tuck in the bangs. 

00:01:28.118 --> 00:01:33.435
This lace front wig has adjustment straps at the back 
 and three comb clips across the front. 

00:01:33.916 --> 00:01:39.269
If your lace front wig doesn't have any any security straps 
 across the back or any clips in the front,

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:45.140
you will probably want to use a little bit of bonding 
 tape adhesive to hold the front in place. 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.280
In order to put this one on, we are simply 
 going to slide that clip into the front.

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:59.850
Work our way to the sides, and then down across the back. 

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:04.290
Then we are going to find our ear tabs in the front,

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:11.290
adjust it to where they need to be and make 
 sure that that front hairline is securely in place.

00:02:13.392 --> 00:02:15.930
The last step is to remove the additional lace. 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.170
We are simply going to comb it away from the front hairline.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.250
And pin the hair out of place.

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:39.670
Next, we are going to start at one side 
 and work our way across the front. 

00:02:46.673 --> 00:02:48.740
We are going to cut against the natural hairline.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.910
And here we have our finished lace front wig look.
