00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In Formula One, every fraction of a second counts…

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Thousands of man hours go into improving the performance of the cars….

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.500
But thousands more go into ensuring their reliability

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.250
One of the toughest environments is inside the engine and gearbox

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.500
and finding the right lubricants to keep them running properly

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.000
produces some of the most innovative developments in F1.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.500
It’s one of the few areas that we can still develop under the current regulations.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.500
It’s horsepower for free so we try and get as much as possible.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.250
By working closely with the Ferrari engineering team, Shell works to push that development to the limit…

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.000
When you develop a fuel and an oil, you cannot just take a good fuel, put on an engine and expect it to work.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Lubricant isn’t just a fluid that’s thrown in afterwards, it’s a component like a piston or a conrod or a camshaft.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.500
Engine, and fuel and lubricant have to be developed together.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.800
Inside the engine, the lubricant forms a film to protect moving parts like the pistons, camshaft and crankshaft bearings,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.900
while keeping to an absolute minimum any losses of energy those areas may produce.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.000
The art is, first of all, getting the performance as high as possible with

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.500
just enough protection with a suitable margin for safety.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.750
Formula One cars use a 'dry sump' system – which pumps oil around the engine via a separate oil tank.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.000
It’s more efficient than the wet sump in the average road car but it also causes engineers one major headache……

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.500
There's a lot going on inside the engine, the oil is thrown around and it picks up air.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.250
You want to lubricate with a liquid with a minimum amount of air in as possible because

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.500
you want to lubricate with a liquid not a compressible, spongy material.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.800
Through the careful combination of additives, Shell's lubricant engineers can speed up the removal of large air bubbles…

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.900
But they also need to make the oil’s passage through the engine as easy as possible…

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:18.400
We're always trying to drive down the viscosity, the thickness of the oil, but not so far that you actually lose protection

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.500
We want it to foam to get to parts of the engine that is hard to reach

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.500
but if there is too much foam that stops the lubrication, you don't get the film and it stops it doing its job..

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:40.000
The lubricant acts as a cleaner for the engine too, but with the refuelling regulations forcing engines to run leaner this season the cooling properties of the Helix lubricant will also come into focus…

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.750
The amount of energy going through the oil purely as a coolant will go up, so that’s something we have to cope with.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.600
For all its headaches, lubricant development remains one of F1's most dynamic and fiercely-competitive areas.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.732
Not that advances can ever be made overnight.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.500
The new F1 is a F1 that cannot produce results in a few months, a few days.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.600
Long partnership is the basis for developing true advanced components.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.500
Ultimately though, any advances that are made are good news for everyday motorists.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.500
My response to the technical regulations will eventually be translated into things we can use in Shell Helix Ultra on the road.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:36.000
You may see it first in F1 in better power – but in the road car, you're looking for better fuel economy, better mileage from your fuel, and going with that, lower CO2 emissions.
