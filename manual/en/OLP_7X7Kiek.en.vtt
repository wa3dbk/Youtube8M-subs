00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
ONE MORE TIME

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.871
Close, to see

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.629
what's the taste of your lips

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.789
You lie, I just know

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:36.749
But there is something about you

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.521
which is driving me crazy

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:44.315
Your kisses, your smile

00:00:44.631 --> 00:00:48.431
what is hanging on my skin

00:00:48.752 --> 00:00:53.552
come back though it's one more time!

00:00:57.364 --> 00:01:00.300
But you leave one more time

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.530
There is no air without you, nor faith

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.090
My loneliness, is no taste

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:23.675
Give me back my life once more time

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.121
And you will leave without a goodbye and I stay here

00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:31.154
Crying

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:35.705
if it was, or what could be one more time

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:38.739
Without you

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:40.630
But my love is so

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.580
It takes the gray cloud

00:01:42.618 --> 00:01:44.900
And turns it for you

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:47.000
The entire galaxy

00:01:47.227 --> 00:01:49.400
Come for me

00:01:49.603 --> 00:01:53.900
Or come back only one more time

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:00.600
But you leave, one more time

00:02:05.102 --> 00:02:09.000
There is no air without you, nor faith

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:16.650
My loneliness, is not a taste

00:02:20.124 --> 00:02:25.360
Give me back my life one more time

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.390
One more time, one more time

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.780
You lie, I know

00:03:13.757 --> 00:03:16.270
But you leave, one more time

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.300
My loneliness, is not a taste

00:03:35.992 --> 00:03:40.210
Give me back my life one more time

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.550
But you leave, one more time

00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:55.290
There is no air without you, nor faith
