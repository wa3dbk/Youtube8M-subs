HI, this is Beamer, and today we are taking
apart a moped carburetor. Right now we’re

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.809
about to talk about all of the different pieces
of a carburetor. This right here is your main

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:22.920
carb body. This is the float bowl. This is
the float. This is the choke slide. This is

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:34.300
the jet. This is the main slide spring. The
main slide and the main slide pin that comes

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:43.690
through the middle of it. And then the top
of

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.629
the carb. Basically, the main functions of
a carburetor are to mix air and fuel in the

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:59.210
right ratios together before they’re sent
into the pistons chamber. This is where your

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.760
fuel line attaches to. Gas pours into here
and comes out this main hole right here where

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.090
this small metal fitting with the rubber tip
sits. This rubber tips connects to your float

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:20.980
bowl. These pieces right here basically serve
about the same function as a toilet. When

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.770
the gas comes in, it fills up in this float
bowl right here. It raises the float up, and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.370
once it gets to a certain level, the rubber
tip on that will plug the hole where the gas

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:41.240
is coming in, not allowing any more gas to
come in. Once the bowl is full of gas, then

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.750
you have your jet here, which screws into
the bottom of the carb, which sits just right

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:56.330
above the gas itself. When air floats through,
this is where the air flows through. Air flows

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.140
through here, and it creates a vacuum once
it enters, and as it flows through the middle

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.050
of the carburetor, it sucks gas up through
the jet, and then out of here it sends it

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:21.410
to the combustion chamber. Each jet is a different
size hole. There’s a tiny little hole in

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.840
the middle of this so the gas flows through.
Imprinted on the top of each jet is the number.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.100
The number indicates what size the jet is.
And that changes how much gas mixes with the

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:46.040
air. Your main slide, which comes in through
the top here, works in conjunction with all

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:54.840
that. When you pull the throttle of a moped
or a scooter or a motorcycle or anything,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.390
it pulls this up against the spring that sits
in the top of it. As it pulls it up, it allows

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:10.600
the air to pass through, creating the vacuum
which pulls gas into the chamber. Your choke

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:19.370
slide, which sits in the back of it, is an
optional piece, usually sits up which has

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:29.569
no purpose whatsoever. When you push it down,
the slide comes down and blocks all air from

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.980
coming through. This helps it start up when
the engine is cold or when it hasn’t been

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:42.420
run yet, which allows much more gas to pass
through, which is much easier to start up.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.430
And that’s all the parts to a small moped
carburetor.
