00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.400
OK, here we are with Defender 2. I didn't play the first game

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.400
but the second game is all right.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.830
OK, so you have to tap

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.640
to direct your

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.390
spears

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.269
at the enemy,

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.399
trying to kill as many of them as you can.

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.500
Stop them getting to your wall.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.430
If you feel like you are getting overwhelmed you can throw that at them.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.390
No idea what these little things are meant to be

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.390
well, other than targets, obviously.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.940
If you hold your finger on

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.590
it saves tapping.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.060
You can tell I've played this game a lot so far, can't you?

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:34.050
The graphics are quite good though.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.589
It's all going horribly wrong!

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:13.949
Strange munchkin men are probably going to win.

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:18.709
Go away munchkin men.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.079
So that's Defender 2, I'm sure you get the idea.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:28.559
You're probably better at it than me.

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:29.249
It don't suck that bad!
