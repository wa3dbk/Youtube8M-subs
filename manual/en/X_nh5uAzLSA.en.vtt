00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.068
- Today, we are going to, where?

00:00:03.068 --> 00:00:03.901
- The fair.

00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:05.432
- Do you know what the
theme of the fair is?

00:00:05.432 --> 00:00:06.265
- What?

00:00:06.265 --> 00:00:07.098
- You don't know?

00:00:07.098 --> 00:00:07.931
What is it?

00:00:07.931 --> 00:00:09.156
- I don't know.

00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:09.989
- Magic.

00:00:11.438 --> 00:00:12.271
- Magic?

00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:15.145
- What ride do you wanna go on?

00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:17.534
- [Bailey] I wanna go on that one.

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:18.367
- [Chris] Which one?

00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:19.200
You're pointing to all of them.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.033
That's what you're pointing to right now.

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:21.679
- No, I'm not.

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:22.776
- [Chris] Which one?

00:00:22.776 --> 00:00:25.026
- I'm pointing to that one.

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:27.470
- The rollercoaster?

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.189
- Yeah. That rollercoaster.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.661
- So the theme this year
is 25 years of magic,

00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:35.661
so I thought we would vlog the magic

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:38.900
that's gonna happen at the fair today.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.218
This is Jacob's favorite ride

00:00:40.218 --> 00:00:43.385
because he gets to drive a police car.

00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:48.264
It's my favorite ride because it's free.

00:00:50.957 --> 00:00:52.707
Do you like the fair?

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:55.590
You're getting your face painted?

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.244
What did you get?

00:00:57.244 --> 00:00:58.989
- Elsa crown.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.259
- [Chris] An Elsa crown?

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:01.092
- Yeah.

00:01:01.092 --> 00:01:03.175
- [Chris] That's so cool.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.498
- I'm brushing the animal's fur.

00:01:06.498 --> 00:01:09.081
(upbeat music)

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:15.315
- I'm taking off all the skin.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.581
(Bailey laughs)

00:01:25.817 --> 00:01:26.650
Hi!

00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:33.254
- [Chris] What do you think of the pigs?

00:01:33.254 --> 00:01:34.837
- They smell.

00:01:34.837 --> 00:01:36.477
- Baby.

00:01:36.477 --> 00:01:37.894
- [Chris] Aw, look at that little baby.

00:01:37.894 --> 00:01:38.727
Oh, okay.

00:01:39.852 --> 00:01:40.685
Thank you.

00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:44.479
- [Bailey] I got to pet him.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.562
They love us.

00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:47.449
- [Chris] He's eating your shirt.

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:49.250
Don't let him eat your shirt.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.891
Tell us what goat milk is used for.

00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:53.857
- Milk, yogurt, kefir, ice cream,

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:57.163
cheese, butter, soap, and lotion.

00:01:57.163 --> 00:01:58.660
- [Chris] Would you
eat any of those things

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.160
if it was made from goat milk?

00:02:02.327 --> 00:02:03.635
- Milk, butter, yogurt,

00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:06.151
kefir, ice cream, cheese, and butter,

00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:08.484
but not the soap and lotion.

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.435
Does it hurt the goat?

00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:17.905
- [Woman Milking] No, it
doesn't hurt the goat.

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:19.251
- Just feels good.

00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:21.295
- [Jessica] Wow, can you see that Jacob?

00:02:21.295 --> 00:02:22.186
- [Jacob] Oh.

00:02:22.186 --> 00:02:23.394
- It's got hair in it.

00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:24.394
- [Woman Milking] Yeah.

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.500
- [Chris] Do you wish
you had goats, Bailey?

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.323
- [Woman Milking] Would you milk the goat?

00:02:29.323 --> 00:02:30.650
- So, to ride the rides,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.130
it's really expensive,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.174
and so we told the kids they

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:36.598
could each pick one ride to ride on.

00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:39.598
So Jacob is choosing this ride here.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.227
(playful music)

00:02:56.508 --> 00:02:57.341
- [Jessica] How was it?

00:02:57.341 --> 00:02:58.331
- Good.

00:02:58.331 --> 00:02:59.164
- [Chris] Did you have fun?

00:02:59.164 --> 00:03:03.331
- Yeah, do you know why we
said "ah" when it turned?

00:03:06.056 --> 00:03:06.939
- [Chris] Why?

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.917
- Because it was super fast.

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:10.622
- I got to choose one ride,

00:03:10.622 --> 00:03:12.789
and I chose the fun house.

00:03:31.352 --> 00:03:32.589
(Bailey laughs)

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.280
- [Chris] How was it, Bailey?

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.276
- Fun.

00:03:35.276 --> 00:03:37.025
- You've probably never ever seen

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:39.956
a magician do what I'm about to do,

00:03:39.956 --> 00:03:41.194
in my price range.

00:03:41.194 --> 00:03:42.902
It's called the amazing, incredible,

00:03:42.902 --> 00:03:47.069
world famous cutting a girl
in two with a chainsaw trick.

00:03:48.363 --> 00:03:49.827
Yeah!

00:03:49.827 --> 00:03:50.660
(claps)

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.493
(chuckles)

00:03:51.493 --> 00:03:53.450
This'll kill ya.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.779
No, I'm just teasing there, sweetheart.

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:57.822
We're not gonna really use a girl.

00:03:57.822 --> 00:04:00.114
We're gonna use a boy.

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:03.630
Your job is to be our
lovely magician's assistant.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.561
Now, sweetheart, all you have to do

00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:08.602
is simply look at the
audience and be lovely.

00:04:08.602 --> 00:04:10.833
Oooh, she's got that down pat.

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:13.255
Give her a big round of applause, yeah.

00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:14.588
One, two, three.

00:04:15.654 --> 00:04:17.592
- [Audience] Abracadabra!

00:04:17.592 --> 00:04:18.950
- Holy macaroni, now we've done it.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.159
Let's give a big round of applause.

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.625
Yeah.

00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:25.261
- [Chris] We did a bunch of stuff,

00:04:25.261 --> 00:04:27.542
like the cars that Jacob liked,

00:04:27.542 --> 00:04:29.704
Bailey saw a magic show,

00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:31.324
we saw all the animals.

00:04:31.324 --> 00:04:33.237
Did you have fun today?

00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:34.070
- Yeah.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.134
- Yeah. Do you have to go potty?

00:04:35.134 --> 00:04:35.967
- Yeah.

00:04:35.967 --> 00:04:36.926
- Yeah, really badly, huh?

00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:37.759
- Yeah.

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.259
- Okay, we're gonna go potty.
