Hey there, this is heather ford at twoblooms.com
and in this light room tutorial I’m going

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:09.610
to show you how to organize your photos inside
of light room.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.330
I’m also going to show you how to move around
folders, how to rename them so you can have

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.960
Optimal organization inside your library module.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.420
So as you know, light room is a database and
a data base works if you are really really

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.420
organize.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.720
So I’m going to show you how to be even
more organized than you already are.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.360
So I’m going to come down to here to my
third folders and you can see how i have this

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.140
separated in two years, now i have two 2013
years just because i never got around to combining

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:55.670
them and i have my 2014, now under my 2014
folder i have lots of little subfolders these

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.340
are all of my different folder sessions or
times that i came to import.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.729
Now i haven’t organize all of these folders
appear here and some of them might haven’t

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:07.729
be renamed.

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.479
So I’m going to show you how to rename folders
and move them into subfolders.

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.780
Okay, so i have these appear and I’m going
to scroll down and i have a personal folder

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.250
which is where i dump all of my personal stuffs
and my family and..., i have a two blooms

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.999
folder which i have all of my folders that
i shoot exclusively for two blooms and then

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:35.499
i have my two blooms photography folder and
i also have a subfolder down here where i

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:37.770
put all of my client work.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.300
So let’s get started and just to show you
really quick how to move a folder you’ll

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.149
just click on it now this folder from Easter
i haven’t even touched it for editing lines.

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:58.689
I’m just going to grab it with my mouse
and I’m going to scroll it down and just

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.859
put it underneath my personal folder and you
can see how it was moving and now it’s in

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:06.259
my personal folder.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.680
So it’s really easy to move, I’m not going
to go through all of these just because that

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.360
would take too much time and really don’t
want to watch me do all of these.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.220
Now sometimes if this happens, you can’t
move a folder just go ahead and try it again.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:32.720
One tip i want to say before i do anything
else is make sure you are moving folders and

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.920
renaming them inside of light room, don’t
go do it outside of lightroom because then

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.310
you are going to mess everything up, and light
room is not going to be able to find your

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.450
folders in that feature and then you gonna
have to do search and that’s gonna be a

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.070
big...so just word of the wise do this in
the light room library module.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:00.130
Okay so after you move your folders around
the way that you want, if you want to add

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:10.570
a subfolder, you just click anywhere in here
right click on your mouse and you can create

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.300
a folder inside of whatever folder that you
just clicked on so let’s say i want to click

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.910
inside, i want to make another subfolder under
2014 so I’m gonna..over 2014, I’m gonna

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.320
right click and I’m going to create a folder
inside and i can name this folder anything

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.390
that i want and then i can drag and drop you
know my other folders or folders underneath

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.260
this folder just to organize it even more.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.510
So if you like to be super detailed in what
how you are organizing a new one by month

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.850
or by week or depending on how this you are
this is how you can do it, right click under

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.600
the name folder you want to put this folder
under "create folder" and then you can move

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.730
this little subfolders down into it.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.510
Now if you want to change the name of a folder
cos i have all of these are marked as a date,

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.239
now i like to keep the date, i usually get
rid of the 2014 because it’s underneath

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.110
the 2014th folder but i would go ahead and
not just hover over it and ill right click

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.250
and im going to rename it, so I’m going
to get rid of this 2104 in front of it, but

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.470
i want to keep the date because that kind
of keeps uhm it makes sense to me as i can

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:40.349
scroll through my folders and I’m looking
for certain photo shoot i know exactly what

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.460
it is because of the name and the date.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:53.080
So I’m just gonna name this uhm this was
a cake smash i did a couple of weeks ago,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:03.289
so as you can see its renamed and I’m going
to drag it all the way down to my client folder

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:04.900
and here it is.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.860
Now i don’t have a lot of my client folders
because they are all like up in here so what

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.889
I’m going to do later is I’m going to
rename all of this and move them.

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:19.650
So it’s really easy to be organize in light
room, it just take a little bit of time, so

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.710
if you are really far behind its going to
take even more time.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.529
But remember you know if you want to add folders
you’ll just right click, create a folder

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:40.520
and then drag and drop and then if you want
to rename something, right click, rename and

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.159
I’m just gonna do sunset park because we
went to a park at sunset and that gives me

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.490
a description of what this folder has inside
of it.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.500
So i hope you find this quick tutorial useful
and now you’ll be able to start organizing

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.550
your folders better so you can start using
light room more efficiently.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.250
