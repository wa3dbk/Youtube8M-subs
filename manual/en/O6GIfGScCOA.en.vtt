00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
&gt;&gt;[music]

00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.133
&gt;&gt;In an effort
to keep the trucking

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.600
industry as
safe, reliable,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.467
and productive
as possible,

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:09.033
this video was
produced to show

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:11.567
drivers and inspectors
how to maintain

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:14.867
highway haulage
vehicles.

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:18.266
At the mine site, you'll need
the following equipment:

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.867
a flat quarter-inch
blade screwdriver,

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:23.600
a folding-type
tape measurer,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.333
knee-pads,

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.800
hard hat,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.800
safety
glasses,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.533
coveralls,

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:34.467
Mechanic's Creeper for use
on concrete or asphalt,

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:38.233
pad for use on
gravel or dirt,

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:40.533
and wheel
chocks.

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.800
Select a flat area
for the inspection.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.667
As the truck approaches,
stand clear and signal

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:49.633
where you would like
the operator to stop.

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:53.333
Stand clear and ask the
operator to open the door.

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.200
Explain that you would
like to do a inspection

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.667
of his truck and ask
the operator to set

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:00.433
the park brake and
hold the service brake

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:02.633
while you install
the chocks.

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:05.333
After you install the
chocks, ask the operator

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:08.200
to release all brakes,
place the transmission

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.066
in neutral, and see
if the truck moves.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:15.367
Now ask the operator
to turn off the truck.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:19.033
Climb the steps to the cab
area, introduce yourself,

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:21.300
and ask if a
pre-operational check

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.934
of the vehicle was done
prior to being operated.

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:27.934
Ask to see the operator's
training records.

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:30.767
As the operator looks
for the training records,

00:01:30.767 --> 00:01:33.300
observe the condition
of the cab, windows,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.667
and
mirrors.

00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:36.400
Look at the training
record's date

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.734
and type of
training received.

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:41.834
Check the seatbelt
and fire extinguisher.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:44.633
Explain to the operator
that you will now move

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:46.834
to the front and
back of the vehicle

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:49.667
to check lights and
other functions.

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:52.767
Signal the operator to
turn on the headlights.

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:56.800
Check high and low beam,
right and left turn signals,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.300
and emergency
flashers.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.734
Check windshield
wipers and horns,

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:04.600
steering wheel
and air.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.233
&gt;&gt;[honk]

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:08.433
&gt;&gt;[honk]

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:11.000
&gt;&gt;At the rear of the
truck, motion the operator

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.166
to check the park
lights, turn signals,

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:17.467
brake lights,
emergency flashers,

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:19.800
and back-up
lights.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.934
Move back to the
operator's compartment,

00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:25.900
and ask the operator
to raise the hood.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.066
Explain that you're going
to test the steering,

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.700
the brake
components, and look

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.500
at the undercarriage
of the truck.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.900
Next, go to the driver's
side front wheel

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.767
and observe the
linkage as the wheel

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:40.500
is turned quickly,
right and left.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.834
&gt;&gt;And I'd like for you
to rotate your, uh,

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:48.800
steering wheel
back-and-forth for me.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.533
&gt;&gt;Look at the pitman
arm, drag link,

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:54.767
and tie rod ends
for slack or play.

00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:58.100
No more than
1/8th-inch is allowed.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.300
Look at any shock mounting
brackets and shocks.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.667
Instruct the operator
to apply and hold

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:07.767
the service brake
when you say "brake,"

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:11.166
and release when
you say "release."

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:13.834
Insert a flat screwdriver
under the brake pad

00:03:13.834 --> 00:03:16.333
and yell "Brake!"
to the operator.

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:16.967
&gt;&gt;Brake!

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:19.033
&gt;&gt;If the components
are working properly,

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:21.567
you will feel the
brake shoe apply.

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:24.533
Next, measure the stroke
of the chamber arm

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:26.633
to be sure that it
is in compliance

00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:29.800
with the North American
Out-of-Service Criteria,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.533
which is one and
three quarter inches

00:03:31.533 --> 00:03:34.567
for a type
20 chamber.

00:03:34.567 --> 00:03:37.767
&gt;&gt;Release!

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:39.200
Cotter
pins in.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.033
Slack
adjuster.

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:44.467
I felt the brake reply
against the drum.

00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:45.800
Canister's good
and tight.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.400
Everything looks
good there.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.600
&gt;&gt;Ask the operator to
turn the steering wheel

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.033
left and
right,

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:54.166
measuring the slack of
the steering wheel.

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:56.667
To check the slack
or steering lash,

00:03:56.667 --> 00:04:00.166
begin with the tires
pointing straight ahead.

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:02.600
Next, turn the steering
wheel in one direction

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.900
until the tires
just begin to pivot.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.834
Vehicles with power
steering may require

00:04:07.834 --> 00:04:11.967
the engine running to
turn the wheel.

00:04:11.967 --> 00:04:14.567
Place a mark on the
steering wheel,

00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:17.200
then while holding the
marker at that point,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.266
turn the wheel in
the other direction

00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:22.133
until the tires
again start to move.

00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:26.633
Measure the distance
between the two points.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:29.200
This is the amount
of steering lash.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.066
Excessive lash
can indicate

00:04:31.066 --> 00:04:34.033
worn or loose
steering components.

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:36.266
The amount of
allowable lash varies

00:04:36.266 --> 00:04:38.600
with the diameter of the
steering wheel,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.600
and this measurement
must be consistent

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.600
with the size of
the wheel listed

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.166
in the North American
Out-of-Service Criteria.

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:49.567
Move to the other side
and check the same items

00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:53.367
on the passenger
side front wheel.

00:04:53.367 --> 00:04:55.200
Climb under the front of
the truck and look

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.900
for any cracks in the frame,
loose or missing bolts,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.900
spring hangers, and
axel mount bolts.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.867
Look for cracks in
the leaf springs

00:05:05.867 --> 00:05:08.433
or loose or
missing springs.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:13.066
Look for combustible
material and leaks.

00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:15.166
If you can clear
the front axel,

00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:17.734
continue to the
center of the engine.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.367
If you can't, climb
out and go back under

00:05:20.367 --> 00:05:23.000
behind the
front wheel.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.100
Look for broken engine
mounts, frame cracks,

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.433
and cracked
cross members.

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:30.500
Look at the transmission
mounting bolts,

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.600
and cross
member.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.367
Check u-joints and carrier
bearings by applying

00:05:35.367 --> 00:05:40.467
pressure with
your knee or foot.

00:05:40.467 --> 00:05:42.633
Observe all mounting
brackets for tanks

00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:45.133
and combustible
material.

00:05:45.133 --> 00:05:46.967
Proceed to the
front rear tandem

00:05:46.967 --> 00:05:49.433
and repeat the
brake sequence.

00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:52.533
Place a screwdriver into
or on the brake shoe

00:05:52.533 --> 00:05:54.500
and yell
"Brake."

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.433
Feel for movement and
measure the travel distance

00:05:57.433 --> 00:06:00.834
and the plunger out of
the brake chamber.

00:06:00.834 --> 00:06:03.333
This is usually a type 30
chamber and is allowed

00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:05.734
two and a quarter
inches maximum.

00:06:05.734 --> 00:06:08.734
And travel should not
exceed two inches.

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:12.600
Do a test for
each side.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.533
&gt;&gt;Brake!

00:06:14.533 --> 00:06:15.133
[brake noise]

00:06:15.133 --> 00:06:15.934
Release!

00:06:15.934 --> 00:06:17.266
[brake noise]

00:06:17.266 --> 00:06:18.233
The adjustment's
good.

00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:19.734
Cotter
pin's in.

00:06:19.734 --> 00:06:22.533
Slack adjustment looks
good on both of them.

00:06:22.533 --> 00:06:25.500
But I do have a problem
with this rear brake

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.633
on the
passenger side.

00:06:29.633 --> 00:06:32.000
&gt;&gt;Come out, and go to
the rear tandem brakes,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.567
repeating the
same sequence.

00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:39.166
&gt;&gt;Brake!

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:41.600
And
release!

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.433
Good.

00:06:42.433 --> 00:06:43.734
&gt;&gt;After checking
the brakes,

00:06:43.734 --> 00:06:46.033
look for any broken
or missing bolts

00:06:46.033 --> 00:06:49.400
in the frame or
springs hangers.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.367
Look at the frame
and cross members.

00:06:52.367 --> 00:06:54.333
Check the fifth
wheel for any loose

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:56.133
or missing
bolts.

00:06:56.133 --> 00:06:59.433
Look into the frame area
and see if torsion bars

00:06:59.433 --> 00:07:02.100
and bushings
are intact.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.633
Turn around and look at
the trailer frame,

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:07.033
and look at the components
of the trailer,

00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:11.500
back to the front
trailer axel.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.734
Check brakes as
before.

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:16.533
Insert screwdriver
and yell "Brake."

00:07:16.533 --> 00:07:20.400
&gt;&gt;Brake!

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.834
Release!

00:07:22.834 --> 00:07:24.500
Brake!

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.166
&gt;&gt;Observe any
movement and measure

00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:29.533
brake chamber
plunger for travel.

00:07:29.533 --> 00:07:30.867
Yell
"Release."

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.800
&gt;&gt;Release!

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.100
&gt;&gt;Then check the S-Cam
bushing by checking

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.166
for movement
with your hand

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.834
when the brake
is not applied.

00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:43.533
Move to the next axel
and check the same

00:07:43.533 --> 00:07:46.433
until all axels
are completed.

00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:48.200
Some companies
choose to remove

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.033
brake shoe
dust covers.

00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:51.867
In this case, the
inspector would be able

00:07:51.867 --> 00:07:53.934
to observe the
brake shoe movement

00:07:53.934 --> 00:07:57.233
when brakes
are applied.

00:07:57.233 --> 00:08:02.533
Look at all mounting
brackets, springs,
00:08:02.533,00:08:01.834
and cross
braces.

00:08:01.834 --> 00:08:03.967
Move out of the
rear of the truck.
