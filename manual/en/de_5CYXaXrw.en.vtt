00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.510
So we start by sectioning off the hair in
the front from the hair in the back.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.160
That is just right from the top of the ear
all the way up to the part.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.321
We're then going to take kind of a C shape,
a larger section right behind there and we're

00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:23.950
going to take this hair and we're going to
braid it over the top.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.179
Remembering of course to braid in the direction
that we want to hair to be in.

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.419
So I want this braid to cross over the top
of her head onto the other side so I'm going

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:33.740
to braid it that way.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.790
If you were doing this at home you would probably
braid about half way up and then just switch

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:45.181
sides and then just finish the braid off with
the a tiny elastic band on the end, and then

00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:47.100
do the same thing on the other side.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.610
So we're going to take that section in front
of the ear, section that off.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.710
If you want to if it makes it easier you could
always clip that section in place so that

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.640
it doesn't interfere with whatever it is you're
doing.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.740
Making sure not to take hair from the very
top of the head because when you have your

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.840
braid to be able to lay over the top of it
like that.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.719
So now I'm just going to braid this one to
the other side also.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.520
This is a Sienna Miller look but you could
absolutely do this with like fishtail braids

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.009
or a different type of braid and create a
similar look.

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:28.570
Braid all the way to the end and then secure
with an elastic pony tail or a clear band.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.270
Once you've done that to both sides cross
them in front of the head to create a braided

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.520
effect on the top.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.000
And what I do is I just kind of hold it with
my hand and then I go in.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.960
I like to do the ends first so that I know
they are nice and secure and then secure the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.200
center as well.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.299
So just wherever you feel like it could be
a little bit tighter or secure, go ahead and

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.149
add bobby pins.

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.409
So probably every two inches, but wherever
it needs it.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.760
So now we're going to create the back.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.820
We're going to put the back into a very low
beautiful bun.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.130
Section this back part, all the hair that
you have left, in half going across the head

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.130
just like that.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.290
And then I just place this top section on
the top of the head and we're going to take

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.370
this bottom section here and we're going to
put it in a very low tight little flat bun.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.620
So I'm just going to begin to twist the hair
and as soon as it starts to wrap around the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.120
face here I'm just going to continue twirling
keeping it very low and flat.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.650
It doesn't have to be perfect.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.650
Remember this is kind of a bohemian feeling
look anyway so it's nice not to have it not

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.650
be so done.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.030
Then you're going to take two bobby pins and
you're just going to crisscross them.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.490
So this first bobby pin I place going up and
then the next one I'm going to place going

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.129
the other way so it'll cross over and make
an X.

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.680
Then you can go ahead and release the top.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.099
Now what we want to do is we want to integrate
these side pieces and definitely to cover

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.700
up this portion here.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.610
So the way we're going to do that is we're
just going to brush it away from the head,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.459
leave it a little bit loose and then just
do a couple of quick little twist in it too

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.550
and then wrap it around the bun and secure
it with a bobby pin.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:18.079
And then do the same thing for the other side
and then secure that with a bobby pin as well.

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.500
When that's complete go ahead and let down
the very top.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.810
We want to make sure that you can't see the
seam that you created, your partings; you

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.870
can't see any of your rubber bands so you're
just going to place the hair over the top

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.870
of all of that.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.790
And I'm just going to very lightly take this
and then twist it around our bun and then

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.959
secure that with our bobby pin.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.870
Make sure everything on the side is covered,
and loose and flowy and then do the same thing

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.959
on the other side.

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.599
And then I'm just going to secure these kind
of remaining end pieces, find a place to stick

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.470
them and then you end up securing that whole
end.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.739
And there you have the Sienna Miller braided
up do.
