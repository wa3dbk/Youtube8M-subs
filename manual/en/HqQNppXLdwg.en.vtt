hi guys so I wanted to know how to
record my voice on the top of my videos

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.210
on the ps4 I wanted to use my ps4 headset
to do commentaries over my gameplay and

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.590
I wondered if you could do it with the
microphone that's built into my ps4

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.660
camera and if I could use a USB
microphone to plug into the ps4 as well

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.130
turns out you can do all three of those
but it's really hard to find out how to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.250
do it I looked everywhere online but i
finally found the answer so i thought

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.329
i'd share it with everyone in case they
have problems doing it as well so the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.290
first thing we need to do is we need to
activate the microphone so you press the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.550
share button and you can do this from
the dashboard or inside a game or

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.219
whatever then you press options go to
share settings go down to the video clip

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.050
settings and then all you have to do is
click this button so that the little

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.180
ticks in the box at include microphone
audio and video clip it says underneath

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.869
it include microphone audio from the
headset or playstation camera when

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.520
recording gameplay video and also works
with USB microphone because I've got one

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.720
plugged in right now

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.470
so if i go back now we've activated the
microphone

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.700
it's very very quiet you can hardly hear
yourself over the top of the gameplay

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.140
so all we need to do and i had to find
this out myself the hard way to go to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.860
settings on our dashboard and then we go
all the way down to devices is obviously

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.890
a microphone is a device and then we go
to audio devices click on microphone

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.220
level and then you turn the microphone
all the way up to the top

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.200
so there you go you can see my voice and
you click ok and there you go

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.799
when you record now you'll be able to
hear your voice too loud clear above

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.219
your gameplay and you guys should try
out for yourself and hopefully this has

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.020
helped you guys out so it has

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.290
please give a thumbs up and subscribe

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.390
