00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:09.786
Let's go! Tamagotchi!

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:11.446
Yah-tchi!

00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:29.386
You can do it, keep it up, Big Brother!

00:00:32.686 --> 00:00:34.916
Our project is a success, Chamametchi!

00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:38.446
I just knew you could do it, Big Brother,
it's really amazing!

00:00:41.746 --> 00:00:44.146
We really made something incredible this time!

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:47.486
Come on, let's go show our new invention to
Memetchi and Kuchipatchi.

00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:49.286
Let's show 'em our new invention!

00:00:49.846 --> 00:00:53.986
I had this idea when I practiced for
the inter-school math and science competition.

00:00:54.016 --> 00:00:56.786
I was at the #1 tower doing some problems,
and.. 

00:00:56.816 --> 00:01:00.316
...I thought there may be a better way to do
our problems. Then I had this great idea.

00:01:00.346 --> 00:01:01.916
And that's pretty much the jist of it.

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:04.916
I'm really excited to see this thing in action!

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:06.216
Me too-tchi!

00:01:06.786 --> 00:01:08.446
Okay, let's give it a shot then.

00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:12.416
Wow!

00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:13.186
12 x 22

00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:13.986
75 x 30

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:14.686
50 divided by 2

00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:15.346
77 x 7 

00:01:15.386 --> 00:01:16.486
46-38 = 

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:24.416
It's a machine that produces the math
drills all by itself; isn't that so cool!?

00:01:24.446 --> 00:01:26.416
Yeah, isn't that so cool?!

00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:28.616
Um.. Yeah..

00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:32.446
I think I'd rather have a machine
that can produce snacks-tchi.

00:01:37.216 --> 00:01:38.416
Thanks for dinner.

00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:45.186
The life of a great inventor is a lonely one.

00:01:46.446 --> 00:01:48.146
Poor Big Brother...

00:01:57.886 --> 00:02:01.746
Let's see...
Just have to solder this here...

00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:03.846
Twinkle! Twinkle!

00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:05.486
Mametchi!

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:08.786
what's going on you guys?

00:02:08.986 --> 00:02:11.146
Your invention is totally amazing!

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:12.216
Huh?!?

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:16.716
This thing can make the most perfect curls
I've ever seen in my entire life!

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:26.316
Not only that, but it also went out and
got me all kinds of goodies to eat-tchi!

00:02:26.686 --> 00:02:28.946
You truly are a genius, Mametchi!

00:02:28.986 --> 00:02:30.746
Yeah, thanks a lot-tchi!

00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:35.346
I guess I must have somehow programmed
all that in without even realizing it.

00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:38.846
It's scary to think how much
I underestimated my abilities!

00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:42.316
I'm so glad you feel better now Big Brother!
