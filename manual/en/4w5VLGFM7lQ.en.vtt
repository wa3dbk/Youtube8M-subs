00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.792
- [Voiceover] Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.792 --> 00:00:04.880
My name is Effie Trinket,
and you're watching my

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.527
Effie Trinket makeup tutorial.

00:00:07.527 --> 00:00:10.197
If you want to know how to
go from looking like a poor,

00:00:10.197 --> 00:00:12.728
meager resident of the districts

00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:16.629
to glamorous high-society
resident of the Capital,

00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:19.136
well, you've come to the right place.

00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:21.180
As you can see, this is a very subtle,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.758
everyday Capital look,

00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:24.964
for something simple
like grocery shopping,

00:00:24.964 --> 00:00:27.704
so you'll only need a couple
of very basic supplies.

00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:29.671
You will need moisturizer,
foundation primer,

00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:31.599
liquid foundation,
concealer, powder foundation,

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.619
eyeshadow primer, a glue
stick, translucent powder,

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:35.824
a white eyeliner pencil, gold
eyeshadow, marsala eyeshadow,

00:00:35.824 --> 00:00:37.844
highlighter, blush, an eyelash
curler, black eyeliner,

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:40.143
false eyelashes and glue,
black mascara, bronze lipstick,

00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:42.047
brown eyeshadow, and
about a thousand different

00:00:42.047 --> 00:00:43.978
makeup brushes, just your basics, really.

00:00:43.978 --> 00:00:46.528
First step is to make sure
you moisturize and prime

00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:48.850
your face, or you will
look like absolute trash.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.009
Now we want your skin to look flawless

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.515
with a capital F, so be sure
to cover your face entirely

00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:56.117
with liquid foundation

00:00:56.117 --> 00:00:59.409
before moving onto concealer
to cover those trouble areas.

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.196
Be sure to cover your lips as
well, because we will want to

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:04.332
entirely reshape them later.

00:01:04.332 --> 00:01:07.072
Now set it all with powder
foundation and a brush

00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:09.695
that is big and fluffy, like my cat,

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:11.274
Mr. Tickles.

00:01:11.274 --> 00:01:14.868
Then prep your eyelids
with some eyeshadow primer.

00:01:14.868 --> 00:01:17.701
Now it's time to get out your
glue stick to cover up those

00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:20.046
dreadfully boring eyebrows.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.066
Squish the glue stick into your eyebrow

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.599
in every which direction,

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:26.106
ending by smoothing it down flat in the

00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:27.862
natural direction of hair growth.

00:01:27.862 --> 00:01:31.345
Go ahead and whisk away any
flaky pieces with your finger.

00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:34.131
Now, wait a minute for the
glue to dry just a bit.

00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:37.033
Then set them lightly
with translucent powder.

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:39.959
Now, put on a second smooth coat of glue,

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:41.863
wait another minute for it to dry,

00:01:41.863 --> 00:01:44.301
and set it again with translucent powder.

00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:46.530
Now whisk away any excess powder with your

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.318
fluffy foundation brush.

00:01:48.318 --> 00:01:50.640
Now, use a white eyeliner pencil to trace

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.962
a large sideways capital D

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:54.633
around your eyebrow.

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:57.350
Then carefully fill it all in with white.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.902
This white will act as a base
to make the gold really pop.

00:02:00.902 --> 00:02:02.946
Be sure to be extra careful with the white

00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:04.455
on top of your eyebrows.

00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:07.241
Try using the side of the
pencil to shade, as it is

00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:10.283
much more delicate than
the point of the pencil.

00:02:10.283 --> 00:02:14.160
Then go over all of that white
with a nice glittery gold

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.363
eyeshadow.

00:02:15.363 --> 00:02:16.408
Gorgeous.

00:02:16.408 --> 00:02:18.103
Now, with the gold eyeshadow,

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:21.144
reach a bit below the white
area, towards your eyelid,

00:02:21.144 --> 00:02:23.294
to make blending easier later.

00:02:23.294 --> 00:02:25.964
Grab a sparkly marsala eyeshadow,

00:02:25.964 --> 00:02:27.516
fill in the rest of your eyelid,

00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:29.303
and blend it in with the gold.

00:02:29.303 --> 00:02:31.091
Grab a powder highlighter,

00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:33.692
and highlight the bridge of
your nose, your cheekbones,

00:02:33.692 --> 00:02:36.780
your forehead, your chin, and your lips.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.845
Then use a powder bronzer
to define your cheekbones

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:41.192
and your nose.

00:02:41.192 --> 00:02:44.791
Use a bright rosy blush to
cover your entire cheekbones

00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:46.811
for a nice subtle look,

00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:49.202
and blend it in with
your foundation brush.

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:52.801
Quickly curl your lashes,
then line your upper lash line

00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:54.380
with black eyeliner.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.375
Then fill your waterline
with some white eyeliner.

00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:59.418
Now, for the false eyelashes.

00:02:59.418 --> 00:03:01.085
My favorite part.

00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:04.336
Carefully apply glue to the
edges, and give them a minute

00:03:04.336 --> 00:03:06.565
for the glue to dry and become tacky.

00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:09.816
Then carefully press them
on top of your upper lashes,

00:03:09.816 --> 00:03:12.393
as close to your lash line as possible.

00:03:12.393 --> 00:03:14.738
Blend your real lashes with your fake ones

00:03:14.738 --> 00:03:16.526
using some mascara,

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:18.476
and don't forget to apply some mascara

00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:20.171
to your lower lashes as well.

00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:21.657
Now for the lips.

00:03:21.657 --> 00:03:24.861
Apply bronze lipstick just to
the inner portion of your lips

00:03:24.861 --> 00:03:27.137
to make a small, pouty mouth.

00:03:27.137 --> 00:03:31.549
Now give them some shine with
a few dabs of gold eyeshadow.

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.172
Then use dark brown
eyeshadow, or lipliner,

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:37.725
to carefully line your lips
and give them dimension.

00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:39.095
Just perfect!

00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:41.231
Your lips look adorable.

00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:45.225
Now throw on the most glamorous
gold hairpiece you can find,

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.711
and you're done.

00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:50.333
You're ready to go grocery
shopping in the Capital!

00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:54.879
And may the odds be ever in your favor!

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.359
Thank you ever so much for watching.
