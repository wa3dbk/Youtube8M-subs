Hi, my name is Joe, I’m 26, and I’m from Surrey.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.000
I started playing drums, sort of learning drums, when I was 13. Playing in Wembley is...

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
it doesn’t compare to anything I’ve done so far, I mean, I’ve never actually set foot in this arena

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.500
to see a gig and for the first time that I’m here,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.500
to actually play on the stage! “When in Rome” at Wembley

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.500
to play on a massive drum like this, I can’t really put it into words.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.700
I’m still pinching myself a bit, I’m in shock about it, so it’s a great experience. 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.000
I caught a glimpse of all the different locations, the shots from all the different locations,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.300
there was one, the guy in the garage with his girlfriend in the background,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.700
he actually goes to the school that I teach in, it’s the Academy for Contemporary Music in Guildford.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:06.000
When the auditions for this gig were going on one day, he came up to me in class, and said he needs to leave early to get to an audition.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I sort of gathered what audition it was for, and I was sort of saying I don’t know whether I can let you out,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.866
but I did let him out in the end, and low and behold he’s on TV! So, you know, I’m pleased for him.
