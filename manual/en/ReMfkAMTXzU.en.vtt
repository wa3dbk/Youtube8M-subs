Hi! My name is Shawna on behalf of Expert
Village, and in this clip we are going to

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.670
talk about thimbles. Thimbles are really necessary
in sewing, especially if you are doing hand

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:22.600
work, doing embroidery, appliqué, hand quilting
of course, but even in simple things as beading

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.770
or anything like that, sometimes just to have
that extra pressure to push the needle through

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.800
makes it easier on your fingers instead of
having little holes in your fingers, makes

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.649
it really nice to get those needles through.
There are lots of different kinds. A newer

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.399
type, this is a silicone. It has kind of a
hard tip. There are different sizes, but it

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.920
is a nice one to have. It’s not sweaty or
hot. It doesn’t stretch. It’s quite nice,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.959
and people have really enjoyed this and they
are like $2 or something like that. Another

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:07.680
type is just the metal everyday looking thimble.
Usually you wear it on your middle finger.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.940
You may wear one on your thumb too, depending
on how much work you are doing, but again,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.852
as you are pushing something through the bottom
that you push up with the thimble, and it

00:01:18.852 --> 00:01:23.920
makes it a lot easier to get it through the
fabrics. They also have some really nice leather

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.980
thimbles. Usually the needle doesn’t go
through the leather unless you use the same

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.672
spot over and over again, but a lot of people
like the leather thimbles because it is so

00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:42.480
nice on your finger. It’s not tight or it
doesn’t cut off circulation or anything.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.420
For hand quilting though, one of the favorite
thimbles is the Roxanne thimble. It has an

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.070
opening here where your fingernail comes out,
and then it sits on the tip of your finger,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.230
and it has this ledge so that you can pivot
the needle back and forth and get lots of

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.450
stitches on the needle, and also help that
pull through. That makes a huge difference

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.340
when you are doing hand quilting than just
doing it little by little. The Roxanne goes

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.650
really great for that. So thimbles are also
a great thing to have, and there are different

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.689
types for the different type of sewing that
you are doing.
