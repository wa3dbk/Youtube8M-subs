00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.050
Today I will be making aloo chaat.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.020
Which is a spicy potato snack.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.620
Aloo chaat is a popular snack found at North
Indian road side vendors.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.760
This is one of the very few chaats served
without any chutney.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.620
However you can always add cilantro and
tamarind chutney.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.400
This recipe is inspired by the chaat.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.820
I used to enjoy near my childhood home in India.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.880
I incorporated a special spice mix also known
chaat masala.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.860
I would suggest trying this recipe without chutney.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.700
This mouthwatering chaat is just perfect for anyone

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.180
who loves spicy food.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.940
This recipe will serve 4.

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:05.509
For making aloo chaat we will need:

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.200
About 4 cups cubed potato.
Firmly boiled, peeled and cut into bite size.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.620
3 tablespoons oil

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.900
1 teaspoon salt

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.260
1 tablespoon finely chopped green chilli

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.560
1 tablespoon thinly sliced ginger

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.820
2 teaspoons lemon juice

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.880
About 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro (hara dhaniya)

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.520
For chaat masala spice mix we need

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.640
1 tablespoon of roasted cumin seed powder
(bhuna hua jeera)

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.590
1 teaspoon red chili powder

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.080
1 teaspoon mango powder (amchoor)

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.400
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.460
1 teaspoon of black salt

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.980
1/8 teaspoon asafoetida (hing)

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.980
1/8 teaspoon citric acid

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.960
1/2 teaspoon ginger powder (saunth)

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.420
2 teaspoons sugar

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.120
First I will mix all the spices.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.800
And this spice mix is known as chaat masala.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.740
This chaat masala is really good. It can spice
up any food.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.440
It specially tastes great if you sprinkle

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.100
over plain yogurt, cucumber slices or tomato slices.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.300
And especially over pakoras when you don’t have any chutney.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.520
You can make the chaat masala in large quantity

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.120
and keep it ready whenever you need it.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.240
And sugar.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.440
Mix it well.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.920
And your chaat masala is ready to go.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.200
And it smells really great.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.180
So I am ready to make the aloo chaat.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.580
For that first I have to stir fry the potatoes.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.960
I like to use heavy bottom flat frying pan.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.600
Heat is on, medium.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.800
So after pan is little bit hot then I am going to put the oil.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.880
So this is the time to put the oil.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.060
And just make sure the bottom is really greased all over.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.760
And now put the potatoes.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.100
Spread the potatoes.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.480
And now sprinkle the salt.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.140
Covering all.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.320
And do we have to stir them occasionally.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.720
And potatoes have to be golden brown from all sides.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.700
But don’t keep stirring, potatoes will break.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.190
I am going wait for about 1-1.5 minute
before I turn them over.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.959
So this has been about 1.5 minutes.

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:27.019
So I am just going to turn them over.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.740
And then just wait again for about 2 minutes.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.500
It has been about 2 minutes

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.360
so I will turn them over again.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.640
And as you see now it has started getting some color.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.860
And I have said before that don’t keep
turning them very quick.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.200
So just wait every time for couple of minutes
before you turn.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.720
You can adjust the heat.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.960
It depends sometimes your burners are not very high

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.000
so you can turn them to medium high.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.960
So I am turning them over again.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.240
And it has started catching a nice color.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.340
But it will take about 2-3 more minutes.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.560
Potatoes are looking good.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.760
Nice, brown and crunchy.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.240
Now turn off the heat.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.300
And add the cilantro.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.700
Green chillies

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.080
Ginger

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.000
Lemon juice

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.620
And mix it well.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.460
All the potatoes are coated.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.120
And now add about 2 tablespoons of chaat masala.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.800
Mix it well.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.320
And you can smell the spices, such a nice hot aroma.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.720
Aloo chaat is ready to serve.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.500
This aloo chaat is making my mouth water.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.400
My both daughter-in-law’s and my granddaughter
love this.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.140
And will be coming over in the afternoon to eat this delicious aloo chaat.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.500
Enjoy.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.560
Thank you.
