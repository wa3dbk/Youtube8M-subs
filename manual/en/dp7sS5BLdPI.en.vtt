00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.231
It is me again and this time we are going
to go over the different connections on a

00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:09.040
woofer. Now, he may ask that sounds kind of
boring, but actually terminal connections

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.740
are crucial in loading a woofer, which we
will be going over a little later here. This

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:23.590
is a press on or for press fit for terminal,
now you might not see this on many drivers

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.720
these days or if you do see it on there it
will be on a lower priced driver. But what

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.910
is important about noticing these posts here
are that these type of posts which you will

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.390
find in an enclosure anyways ninety percent
of time. So let us go see what goes on to

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.760
these connections so that you do not get confused.
These are terminal post connectors, they are

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.250
insulated and jacketed. Why you may ask, is
so if say a wire gets pinched to tight, you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.540
do not ground out and set your driver on fire,
or ground it out or blow it up. You slide

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:07.679
on the driver, like a and they come off so
that you can service a woofer in the future.

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:14.159
Now these type of drivers are a little more
time consuming on connection so let us go

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:24.049
onto the next driver. Again we are at the
this nice diamond D-three ten inch driver,

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.240
this has press fit terminals. What is the
significance of a press fit driver? You can

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.900
use just stripped bare wire and plug it in,
very easy and very serviceable in which you

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.490
will find on ninety percent of todays drivers.
Let us go on to the other type of positive

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.979
connection terminal which is a screw down.
Screw down and screw it up type connector,

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:56.719
it is usually reserved for a larger drivers,
that require a bigger gage wire in order to

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.799
accommodate larger power handling levels.
Notice that this is red and black, it is marked

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.819
positive and negative and that is the basic
overview of different connection types.
