00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:08.340
The most logical place to me to keep your
dishtowels, and hand towels are over near

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.630
the sink, because that's when you're usually
going to be using them the most. I don't have

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:21.300
any storage space left over by my sink, so
I keep mine over here by the oven, which I

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.750
don't have that big of a kitchen, so it doesn't
make that much of a difference. But, I just

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.649
have all my dish towels folded in here, and
just kept in this drawer, and then in another

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:51.399
drawer, I have my napkins, and my dish towels,
and my tablecloths all in this drawer. I don't

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:58.629
have paper napkins, or paper towels, but there
are several options for places to store those

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:05.460
too. Again, I think the most logical place
to keep them is over by the sink. There are,

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.710
you can find things where you can stand up
paper towels. There are lots of containers

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.990
that you can keep napkins in. You can even
just keep napkins in a cup, or on a tray.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.789
Just anything to keep them contained in a
certain space. So after you use your dish

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.420
towels, then you also need a place to put
your dirty dish towels. And I put them, if

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.439
you don't have a laundry room, which I don't,
I just have this basket here with a removable

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:44.249
insert, that I just put all my dirty dish
towels, and washcloths that I use for cleaning,

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:54.010
and hand towels in here. And then when I want
to wash them, I can just take this whole little

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.220
bag out, and take them to the Laundromat.
