00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.180
Surgery is something that we do every day.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.620
I always tell my patients it’s absolutely
routine.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.740
It’s just like an airline pilot that gets
into his jet and flies off and comes back

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.840
at the end of the day and drives home.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.760
We show up at the hospital and we’ll operate
2, 3, 4 times a day and we go home.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.300
It’s absolutely routine.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.789
We do not expect to ever see a plane crash,
as I like to say.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.070
It’s just like an airline pilot never expects
that in his life.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.110
The actual procedure is so routine here that
I tell patients it is like clockwork.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.670
A patient will come in in the morning.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.360
We’ll meet their anesthesiologist at 7:30.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.890
They’ll get a little medicine which makes
them kinda sleepy and we take them back to

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.430
the operating room.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.290
Once they’re in the operating room they
get more medicine which makes them go absolutely

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.290
asleep.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.710
And then we get them really comfortable.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.800
We put them up on their side.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.530
We put pillows front and behind.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.520
We wrap them up in a nice warm cuddly blanket.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.300
And we get them all snug in there to hold
them in place.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.350
And then we put the head in a head holder
so their head stays absolutely still.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.430
We then use a computer on all our operations
to map the brain.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.040
And this is what’s made neurosurgery so
incredibly safe and accurate.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.660
There are cameras in the ceiling that are
taking continuous movies as I’m tracing

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.270
out all around the patient’s face and head,
making a three dimensional model in space,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.120
of the patient’s head.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.050
That is then matched up with the MRI scan
of the patient’s head and brain.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.870
And then on the screen then is a three dimensional
rendering of the brain and I can then take

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.190
a wand and I can point at a spot on the patient’s
head and it will show me on the screen exactly

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.350
where I’m pointing at.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.920
So if they have a tumor, and let’s say that
the tumor is right here, I can find that spot

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.010
exactly using this computer.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.760
And then plan my incision and plan my window
in the bone to be exactly right over where

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.760
I want to be.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.780
So it’s allowed us to make operations safer,
smaller, easier for the patients to tolerate.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.460
So once we’ve mapped the brain, we then
– we don’t cut any hair, makes our patients

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.500
very happy – what we do is we find the spot.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.000
And then we part the hair and we put a lot
of shampoo in the hair to hold it in place.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.850
And I make my incisions in the line of the
part and that opens the scalp up and allows

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.929
us to expose the skull.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.969
We then use the computer again to exactly
identify where that window needs to be.

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.840
And we have very special drills and tools
that allow us to remove a small piece of bone

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.769
which then gets put in some antibiotic solution.

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.200
Once that’s done, there’s the covering
of the brain which we then open and that exposes

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.280
the surface of the brain.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.239
And this is where it gets interesting.

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.950
The brain is an unbelievable, beautiful organ
to look at.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.260
And it’s very complex.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.060
We have to wake the patient up from their
sedation so that we can map the surface of

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.900
the brain which involves stimulating the surface
of the brain.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.160
And when you stimulate it, whatever’s there
will be activated.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.599
And the patient will then tell us what they’re
feeling.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.219
Maybe their hand will move or their leg will
move.

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:51.219
Sometimes they’ll have memories.

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.569
It’s always very interesting to map a person’s
brain.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.219
And once we’ve mapped it and determined
where the important areas are that tells us

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.510
where the safe area is that we can then make
an incision and go in to the brain to where

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.200
the tumor is located.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.400
Once we’ve gotten to where the tumor’s
located we then use a very special instrument

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.540
called an ultrasonic aspirator, which is a
long needle-nose instrument – the tip of

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.650
it vibrates at ultrasonic speeds – ultrasound.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.439
You know ultrasound will dissolve a kidney
stone which is like a rock.

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:24.409
So ultrasound can be set at a frequency that
will dissolve the brain tumor but leave the

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.940
brain that’s healthy completely normal.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.900
And we put that ultrasound device right in
the middle of the tumor and we turn it on

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.529
and we just sort of paint around with it so
the tumor dissolves and gets sucked out the

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:37.549
inside of that needle.

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.251
And then we can leave the surrounding brain
intact.

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:44.090
And we can remove a brain tumor even in the
deep, critical parts of the brain very very

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.639
safely using this very precise ultrasound
device.

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.030
Once the tumor’s been removed we just rinse
things out real well.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.359
If the patient’s been awake we say good
night and let them go back to sleep.

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.120
And then we close up, put the bone back in,
we connect the bone to the skull with little

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.249
titanium plates and screws.

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:00.249
These are non-magnetic.

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:04.019
They don’t set off metal detectors, you
can get MRI scans.

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.669
But they hold the bone in place so the bone
can fuse.

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.809
So over the next three months, and you know
six months later if we were to come back the

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:13.819
bone would be just like new just all fused
across.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.389
We then sew up the scalp, put some staples
in the skin, and sort of fluff the hair up

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.490
again so no one can see the incision.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.490
And that’s it.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.320
That whole procedure, on an average typical
case, takes about two hours.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.370
So it’s not a long surgery.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.960
Three hours would be one that’s a little
more complicated.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.650
But this is a very routine, day in day out,
two to three hour procedure.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.669
The patient wakes up.

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.570
They spend 45 minutes in recovery.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.389
If they had the operation first thing in the
morning they’re eating dinner, out of bed

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.159
walking around that evening.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.860
Many patients go home the next day.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.490
It’s two to three days at most, depending
on how they’re reaction to anesthesia and

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.490
pain medicines.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.940
But it’s a very very routine thing.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.400
I tell every single patient, I say look it
seems like a big deal because it’s brain

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.400
surgery.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.780
But the reality is if you’re at a center
that does this every single day, that has

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.819
a team in place that is doing this 300 times
a year, it now becomes routine.

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.409
And for us we see it that way.

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.980
We’re going to get you through this safely.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.300
We’ll get you back to your life.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.000
We’re going to find out what it is that
we’re dealing with.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.979
And then we’re going to talk about the real
work which is going to start if you do need

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.389
radiation and you do need chemotherapy.

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.169
That starts in about a month after surgery
ends.

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.169
So that’s the routine.

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.389
And again it’s very well tolerated and patients
are always amazed.

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.919
Their families are always amazed at how well
they are after surgery.

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.610
And particularly, if they haven’t had general
anesthesia, they just been done with sedation

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.490
where we wake them up, it’s the same sedation
that’s given for colonoscopy.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.159
So they really do feel like going home right
away.

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.900
They feel really well because they haven’t
had the general anesthesia.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.980
