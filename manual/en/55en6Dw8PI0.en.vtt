00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.400
Over the last seven years the Nissan Qashqai
has spawned an army of imitators.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.680
But now the original crossover is about to
be replaced by this all-new model.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.410
It's bigger, cleverer and cleaner than ever
before and it could be about to teach those

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.750
copy cats a lesson or two.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.880
The sleek new design is a bit less rounded
and friendly-looking than before.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.840
The DNA from the original Qashqai is still
very much intact.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.660
With a same basic shape, while the prominent
new V-shape grille will become a feature on

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.820
the new Nissan range.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.330
The overall length has been stretched by about
47mm and it's lower and wider too.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.220
New headlights on top-spec models use LED
technology and sap half the power of normal

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.320
halogen bulbs.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.019
Our Tekna model also came on flashy 19-inch
alloy wheels.

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.269
Here inside the Qashqai definitely feels like
a bigger car this time around.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.870
Some clever packaging means that there's more
headroom and more shoulder room than before

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.000
and it feels wider, too.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.870
This particular model - which is the top-spec
Tekna version - even comes with a swanky panoramic

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.490
glass roof like you get in a Range Rover Evoque.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.100
For the really good stuff you're going to
need to take a closer look because the quality

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.370
this time around has really taken a quantum
leap forward.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.690
There's squashy soft-touch plastics all over
this dashboard and there's also a lot more

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.440
technology at work too.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.340
Even the switchgear from the steering wheel
to the indicator and the doorhandles have

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.710
a really solid robust feel and it's definitely
a more premium product.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.550
The new Nissan connect system well on Tekna
and Excentra premium models that's a seven-inch

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.840
touch screen.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.810
There's also a small screen here between the
dials.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.450
And that's to help you control some of the
different driver assistant systems which I'll

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.049
tell you about later on when we're on the
road.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.060
Okay, now we're here in the hills outside
of Madrid and we've got a chance to test the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.690
handling a bit more.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.780
Although the new Qashqai keeps the 4x4 styling
that made it so popular the first time around

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.690
with plastic-cladding and roof rails and all
the rest, 90% of the cars at Nissan are going

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.050
to sell are all going to be front-wheel-drive.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.700
The new front-wheel-drive car comes with a
twist-beam rear axel instead of the complicated

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.379
multilink suspension that you got on the old
car.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.939
The reason for that is that it saves them
an awful lot of weight - about 35 kilos they

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.219
told me last night.

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.890
That means they can cut the CO2 emissions
really easily.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.290
But, to compensate and to make sure it still
handles really well they've done a few things

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.319
to tweak the chassis.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.840
There's a double piston shock absorber on
the back and that helps it absorb bumps at

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.569
low speed but also maintain a really nice
ride for when you're going round corners so

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:39.879
it doesn't roll too much.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.180
They've also got two different active systems.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.799
The first is called ActiveTrace Control and
that's just basically a fancy way of saying

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.549
torque vectoring so that when you pile really
hard into a corner to stop it understeering

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.499
the car will brake one of the inside wheels
and that helps you slingshot round and out

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:57.879
the other side.

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.560
The second is called Ride Control.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.709
That's standard on all new Qashqais and it
works by braking either the front or the rear

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.309
axel when you go over a bump or even a pothole
something like that.

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:11.219
Anything that moves the body up and down.

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.639
The breaks just apply really gently and that's
to flatten out the ride as soon as possible.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.890
Stop you dipping up and down.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.879
It's very subtle the way the system works
but overall it means the Qashqai is really

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.639
really comfortable and quite refined.

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.250
It does feel a little grown up though and
probably think it's a little bit less fun

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.250
than it was before.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.159
That's not a bad thing it's going to suit
most people a lot more but if you're looking

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.919
for something really really fun to drive this
particular engine probably isn't the one to

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:36.919
do it.

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.079
Although the performance is fine when you're
cruising and in town actually I've found up

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.359
here in the hills you've got to make sure
you're in the right gear and work it quite

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.939
hard and it's not that eager to rev.

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:53.069
It's very refined but you'll probably want
to wait for the 1.6-litre 161bhp turbo petrol

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.069
which is due in September if you want to go
for a really sporty drive in the new Qashqai.

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.859
The Qashqai has lost none of its practicality
either.

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:06.290
The boot is now 430 litres which is 20 more
than you got in the old car and there's plenty

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.790
of room in the back thanks to the low transmission
tunnel and tall roof.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.109
You can split the roof with a helpful divider
that's built into the floor and there's even

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.310
space to carry the tunnel cover when it's
not in use.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.450
Sadly the seven-seat Qashqai plus two will
no longer be offered so you'll have to buy

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.169
the new X-trail if you want some extra seats
in the back.

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.389
The new Qashqai has only just arrived but
it's already an award-winner.

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.530
But does it deserve those plaudits.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.170
Well as you can probably tell from the in-car
footage I really enjoyed spending time with

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.060
it and driving it here in Madrid.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.449
This time around it's a little bit less innovative
- Nissan have played it safe and it's a crowded

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.009
market so some of the magic of the original
has definitely been lost.

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.550
Then again, it's also much more high-quality
and the amount of technology and some of the

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.060
efficiency of the new engines really is very
impressive.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.139
Those combined will help it rocket straight
to the top of the crossover class and it's

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.370
likely to stay there for some time.
