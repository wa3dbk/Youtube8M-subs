00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.730
In this clip we're going to talk about the
skinning profession. There are thirteen different

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.490
professions in the game of World of Warcraft,
and you can only do two professions at any

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.670
time. Once you've learned a couple of professions
you can't learn anymore without sacrificing

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.130
the professions you already have. There are
exceptions to that, but for the most part

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.290
that's the general rule. Now, in this particular
profession, skinning, what you do is you after

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.379
you kill an animal, you can skin it, just
like a hunter or something when in real life,

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:40.569
and with that skin, you can make things like
leather armor, or you can make leather backpacks,

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:45.930
or variety of other things that you would
use leather for. Like you would use leather

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.140
in the real world. So, in order to skin a
creature, first you have to kill it. So, lets

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.620
choose this wolf over here, we've got him
targeted. So we'll cast a spell, do a little

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.770
damage to him, oh and he's dead. So, we've
killed this wolf, then we loop the body. Once

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.720
we've done that, we can remove the skin. This
little icon will appear that lets you know

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.280
that you can go ahead and skin the critter.
And we do it. Now we've accumulated some ruined

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.320
leather scraps, so it was not very good a
skinning job, but it's still, you can use

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:36.600
those ruined leather scraps to make better
leather and with that better leather, you

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.120
can turn into an even better leather than
that, and ultimately you'll be able to make

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.140
good stuff out of it. Good things like leather
armor, for example, if you go to your leather

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.560
working, and here you'd be able to make these
kinds of armor and things like that. Leather

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.970
skinning also allows you to help other professions.
Many professions beyond just leather working

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.070
require leather in order to perform them.
For example, certain engineering professions,

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.590
and certain other professions require types
of leather in order to accomplish the crafting

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.809
of other kinds of equipment.
