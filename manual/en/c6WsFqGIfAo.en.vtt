00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.820
Hello, this is JB. I'm with Austin Homebrew
Supply here in Austin, Texas. And today we've

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:13.589
been discussing equipment and process and
ingredients that you would need to make your

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:19.430
own beer or wine at home. Well one of the
things that you will encounter as a home beer

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:28.480
maker or home wine maker is every once in
awhile you'll be requested by the the recipe

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.500
or just by your general knowledge or by us
and the home brew store saying, "Hey, you

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.420
know what? If you want to make this recipe,
you need to put more yeast into it so that

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.690
those yeasts can fully process your sugar
into alcohol fermenting to dryness is what

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.559
we call it." So if you put too little yeast
into it, a lot of times it'll mess up the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.010
batch. So sometimes you have to build your
yeast colony into a stronger yeast colony

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.061
with simply more cells. How would you do that?
You would use a yeast starter. A yeast starter

00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:16.670
includes or what actually consist of some
equipment and some ingredients. OK? So I'm

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.360
going to show you the equipment. The equipment
that you would need would be a flask or a

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.150
bottle such as this one here and then a foam
stopper. A foam stopper allows a little bit

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.530
of oxygen to interact because during the first
stage of yeast growth they're going to want

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.909
to absorb oxygen. So combination of a flask
and a stopper along with their food source

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.650
which in this case would be our yeast starter
and then the actual yeast itself. All those

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.330
things would constitute your yeast starter.
So if you want to really get a good, vigorous

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.420
fermentation, make sure that your beer or
wine comes out the way you want it to. Make

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.800
a good solid yeast starter and everything
will kind of come together.
