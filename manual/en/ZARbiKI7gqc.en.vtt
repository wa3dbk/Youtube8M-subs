00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.040
Sharp's IGZO could be one of the next big
advances in LCD technology.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.840
On show at this week's IFA expo in Berlin,
it uses a new semiconductor that brings several

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.880
big advantages over today's LCD panels.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.150
Guillaume Villecroze, Marketing director,
Sharp

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.160
"This new technology has a faster response
time than LCD panels.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.330
It's below 1 millisecond response time, so
this response time allows us to have a very

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.010
fast panel, better transparency, and also
we can do ultra-high-definition panel.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.230
Because thanks to this high transparency,
we can do more pixels in the same surface,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.840
increasing the resolution while still having
very good brightness and contrast performance."

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.130
The IGZO semiconductor base means smaller
transistors and that means smaller pixels

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.170
and higher definition panels.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.650
This 6.1-inch display boasts a resolution
of 2,560 pixels by 1,600 - that's about 50

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.680
percent more pixels per inch than the retina
display on Apple's iPhone 4S.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.400
You won't see it on this video, but the screen's
display in real life is stunning.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.590
The panel also benefits from lower power consumption.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.609
The IGZO panel on the right draws two thirds
less than the conventional LCD and, depending

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.940
on the image, half as much backlight power.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.490
Another advantage of the smaller transistors
is the thinner bezel.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.299
Here it's less than half that of a current
LCD panel.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.850
IGZO means transistors don't need to be switched
as frequently for static images, and that

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.550
means a much quieter electrical environment
for touch panels.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.439
The IGZO panel on the right has to fight much
lower noise to detect a finger press and that

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.970
makes for a more accurate and responsive touchscreen.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.030
Sharp is expecting to begin production later
this year.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.399
"We know that this technology is very much
applied for mobile products whether they are

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.119
tablets, smartphones, PCs maybe as well, so
the product planning is undergoing to see

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.200
which will be the most applicable fields."

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.780
This prototype monitor could be one of the
first products to use IGZO.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.980
It's targeted at the CAD/CAM, medical and
broadcast imaging markets.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.540
Prices of the displays haven't been announced,
but Sharp says it shouldn't be too much more

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.420
than current LCDs because it uses the same
basic manufacturing process.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.730
At IFA Berlin this is Martyn Williams, IDG
News Service.
