00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.180
Last episode we talked about the early
days of paleoart

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.100
and how, after an initial boom, there was
little change in paleart in the

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.990
first half of the 20th century.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.940
Dinosaurs you seen as slow, tail dragging
beasts with little inkling

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.820
of a relationship to birds. This image of
dinosaurs is often attributed to Gerhard Heilmann

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.710
and his 1864 book "The Origin a Birds",
where he dismissed

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.150
the possible relationship between the
two groups.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.900
This mode of thought combined with the pressing issues of

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.800
a Great Depression and then a World War led to the less active interpretation of dinosaurs.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.860
Wait forty years and in runs Deinonychus. 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.160
 While studying the fossils of this raptor dinosaur

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.340
palaeontologist John Ostrom discovered many similarities between it and birds.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:55.500
In his words, "Deinonychus must have been a fleet-footed, highly predacious,  extremely agile and very active animal."

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.960
This was the beginning of a new era: The Dinosaur Renaissance.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.940
When Ostrom published his Deinonychus paper it included this reconstruction of the
animal.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.640
 This piece was drawn up by Robert Bakker, one of Ostrom's students, who became famous

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.580
for really pushing the idea of warm-blooded dinosaurs.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.870
Bakker would continue to portray dinosaurs in his art

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.510
even ones not that closely related to
birds, as active and lively animals.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.560
These ideas were then picked up on by
ink and oil artist, Gregory S. Paul.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.220
Paul was probably the biggest artistic contributor to the Dinosaur Renaissance

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.740
though, in order to get a complete
understanding of his impact

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.960
we need to take another look at our old
friend Charles R. Knight.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.420
Knight was an extremely skilled artist
so there's good reason that is paleoart was so influential

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.680
But if you take a look at some of his
work, especially his dinosaurs

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.860
you can tell he did not pay the closest
attention to the exact anatomy on this subjects.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.040
This is odd, because he argued, that in order to depict living animals in art

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.880
you need to understand anatomy, and even his fossil mammals were very anatomically correct.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.080
So what's with his dinosaurs?

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.280
Well, it seems like this had a lot to do with those advising Knight on his reconstructions.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.099
Most paleontologists in those days looked at dinosaurs as big lizards

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.139
and weren't too concerned with the details of their body.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.319
So, while Knight's work was beautiful it wasn't all that accurate.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.939
When Greg Paul around in the
1970's, he realized

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:33.180
he realized, in order to create an accurate view of the prehistoric world, one has to pay close attention to the anatomy of the subjects.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.950
This is where the classical skeletal
running pose first comes in

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.820
and Paul even published one of the  the first how-to of paleoart in 1987.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.620
Other artists that began to appear at this time were Douglas Henderson, Mark Hallett and Ely Kish.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.850
While the more academic side of paleoart
received a rather sudden paradigm shift

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.180
the pop culture side was a little bit
slower to catch on.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.060
One of the best ways to see this trend is
to look at children's media featuring dinosaurs.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.019
The Land Before Time being a
good example.

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.349
Half the time the dinosaurs are active
and running around

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.120
but there's a good chunk of the movie where they look like they could have walked out of one of Knight's paintings.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.640
It wasn't until 24 years after Ostrom
publishes paper on Deinonychus

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.100
 that audiences everywhere received the pop culture equivalent with Jurassic Park.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.280
It's difficult to express how much of a
game changer this film was

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.690
and I already talked a lot about it when
I talked about Jurassic World

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.820
so all I'm gonna say is it must've been
really nice for paleontologists the bird dinosaur relationship

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.120
vindicated in a modern Hollywood movie.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.400
For better or worse, Jurassic Park changed the way society viewed dinosaurs

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.240
and its effects can definitely still be felt.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.700
But dinosaur science is always changing, with dinosaur art just trying to keep up.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.120
It could be we are in the next great era of our understanding of prehistory: The Soft Dinosaur Revolution.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.790
Thank you for watching part two of our
history of paleoart, we would like to

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.000
know what you thought, let us know in the
comments

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.560
or hit us up on Facebook Tumblr or
Twitter. 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.320
W e have a new segment starting this week called featured paleoart.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.480
  This week's piece is "The Evolution of T. Rex" by Pachyornis, links to their work in the doubly-doo.
