00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.069
MARK BLOCKER: In this segment, we're going
to cover cleaning the brake parts part two.

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:10.619
Okay, now that we've got the caliper mounting
bracket and--where the brake pads attached

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:15.500
to it cleaned and prepared, I've got the silencers
cleaned and prepared. You want to check the

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.840
caliper itself. There's two places where it
bolts onto. Those are two caliper mounting

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.650
bracket spots. You'll want to take that wire
brush and just dry dust on it. You'll just

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.190
brush it off and make sure there are no contaminants
on there, dirt, grime or anything that's going

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.040
to get sandwiched between that mounting spot
on the caliper and the bracket. That could

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.980
cause the caliper not to sit in there absolutely,
perfectly, squarely, change your braking and

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.300
cause binding or other deficiencies in the
braking system. So those two spots, we just

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.441
wanted to take the wire brush and quickly
brush them off, and make sure that they're

00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:52.190
clean, remove any debris. And it's a little
bit more difficult to get this bigger brush

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.300
back into this application. If you've got
one of those small wire brushes that are kind

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.969
of like a toothbrush size, those work really
well. And they're cheap and inexpensive and

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.139
available at all parts distributors. But you
can do it with a big brush. It's just a little

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:13.299
bit more inconvenient. As I said before, there
are a lot of tools that can be bought that

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:21.799
makes the job a lot easier and faster for
you to do. And you just kinda weigh out the

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.789
cost versus the return and how important it
is for you. Sometimes, the aggravation factor

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:33.210
alone is worth every dollar to some people.
Later, in another segment, we're going to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.112
cover compressing the caliper itself, but
we just want to look around there and make

00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:41.779
sure we don't have any large built ups of
dirt or deposits in there that can anyway

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:46.680
affect the operation of the caliper. And then,
this outer portion of the caliper here where

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.469
the caliper makes contact with the brake pad
and holds it in, we're going to twist that

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.810
around and get a good look at it. But we want
to brush that area outright in and through

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.549
there. It's hard for me to get a good angle
for you on the camera there because of the

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.741
limitation of movement that I have with the
brake cable and brake hose. But basically,

00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:08.930
I just want to make sure that this environment
up here is clean and free of any dirt that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.160
can sit between that and the pad and also
cause the caliper to be in an awkward angle

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.810
or cause the pad or the caliper movement binding.
So, now we've concluded the cleaning of various

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.340
brake parts and the caliper itself. Please
watch our next segment. We're going to cover

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.030
compressing pistons in a caliper itself.
