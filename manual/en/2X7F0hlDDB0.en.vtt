00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.200
As we've seen, just because a game springs
forth from Technos Japan's venerable stable

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.400
of Kunio-kun games doesn't mean it's always
going to be good... just most of them. Yes,

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:00.600
these next couple games from our friend Ahmed
in New York are head and shoulders above the

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:00.800
rest. You don't really think of the Famicom
or the NES when you think of fighting games,

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.000
do you? Outside of, what, TMNT Tournament
Fighters, there wasn't much to speak of. But

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.200
Kunio-kun's here to fix that, as we enter
the world of two-on-two street brawling in

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:01.400
Nekketsu Kakutou Densetsu, AKA River City
Ransom meets Hell in a Cell.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:01.600
The goal is simple: Beat the spit, excrement,
and yes, even BARF out of your opponents in

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:01.800
seven hazard-laden battlefields full of spikes,
conveyor belts, waterfalls, electrified grates...

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.000
the mind boggles. Upon starting the game,
you're invited to make a character, detailing

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.200
everything down to birthday and blood type,
before choosing a brawler out of the field

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.400
of sixteen to act as your partner and going
to work putting your fists and feet into other

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:02.600
people's faces. And I'll tell ya, there's
a heck of a lot of detail on offer, despite

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:02.800
the fact that this is a mere Famicom game.
You've got punches and kicks, combo attacks,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.000
team attacks with your partner, grabs, throws,
standing-to-ground drops.... pretty much every

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.200
permutation of inflicting pain on an opponent
is fair game here.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.400
As is typical of Technos Japan titles of this
era, you've got an expressive and well-designed

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.600
group of sprites (which tend to be rather
mix-and-match, but to great effect) combined

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:03.800
with one of the better soundtracks in the
business. Everyone goes nuts about how good

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.000
Capcom and the like were back in the day,
but Technos deserves mention as well for the

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.200
rousing compositions found in most every Kunio-kun
title. And there's the diversity. Each team

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.400
of fighters handles differently, and after
combining that with the number of stages available

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:04.600
- pretty impressive for the old 8-bit machine
- it's easy to see that this was a step ahead...

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.800
just as Street Fighter II was busy setting
the bar much, much higher. Hey, work with

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.000
what you've got, am I right? You're not gonna
get Street Fighter-tier fighting out of the

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.200
Famicom, you're lucky to get even the most
basic fighting out of something like Flying

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.400
Dragon: the Secret Scroll. The fact that they
managed to make something this profoundly

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:05.600
fun and playable at the time, and had the
sense to open it up to multiplayer action,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:05.800
is commendable.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.000
It might not be as immediately recognizable
as some of the actual sports titles, and it

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:06.200
suffers from flicker to hell and back, but
that's alright with me. It lets me live out

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.400
my dream of being a badass in a Japanese high
school, from the comfort of my own editing

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:06.600
booth. And while it might not be the most
technically complex brawler you'll ever play,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.800
it's a heck of an effort for 1992 and the
tail end of the Famicom years. It's an utter

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.000
shame that we didn't get this one in the States...
but we did get Crash 'n the Boys. I'd say

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.200
something like "Perhaps there is no justice
in the world," but that wouldn't be particularly

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.400
badass. I'll just hang out over here and electrocute
a guy.
