00:00:05.853 --> 00:00:09.313
My Xbox One controller keeps turning off.

00:00:09.313 --> 00:00:10.823
What do I do?

00:00:10.823 --> 00:00:11.883
Watch TV.

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:15.933
I worry about it being something wrong with
the Xbox.

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:21.452
The Xbox One has generated reports of disconnecting
at random without rhyme or reason.

00:00:21.452 --> 00:00:23.263
What is the fix?

00:00:23.263 --> 00:00:26.043
Sometimes the problem is tied to the game.

00:00:26.043 --> 00:00:29.223
Xbox one had a controller update with Titanfall.

00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:33.673
I’ve heard it could be a wireless communication
signal problem.

00:00:33.673 --> 00:00:37.953
Is your house wireless phone on and right
next to the game console?

00:00:37.953 --> 00:00:43.763
Is your household wi-fi for the whole family
sitting on the shelf three feet from the Xbox?

00:00:43.763 --> 00:00:44.763
No and no.

00:00:44.763 --> 00:00:46.913
Then that’s not the problem.

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:52.873
Now, if you were using a wireless headset
to talk on your cell phone while playing and

00:00:52.873 --> 00:00:57.732
a wireless internet connection for a family
member was two feet away, I’d say demand

00:00:57.732 --> 00:00:59.633
for wi-fi could cause it.

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:02.883
I wonder if the controller might be broken.

00:01:02.883 --> 00:01:07.302
There are people who’ve reported the same
issue remaining an issue even after they replaced

00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:08.562
the controller.

00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:10.722
So it is a software issue.

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:17.043
An Xbox update in September 2014 fixed the
problem for some people, but it still occurs

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.373
for a lot of people.

00:01:18.373 --> 00:01:21.162
It has been occurring for a while.

00:01:21.162 --> 00:01:26.613
The glitch was reported by lots of users as
soon as the Xbox one came out.

00:01:26.613 --> 00:01:31.683
At the end of 2014, Microsoft said they knew
about it and their engineers were working

00:01:31.683 --> 00:01:32.793
on it.

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:36.083
Which means it’ll be fixed in the Xbox Two.

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:40.522
Now if it suddenly started up, my first suggestion
is checking the batteries.

00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:45.942
That’s more likely if it stopped vibrating
earlier and now too weak to connect.

00:01:45.942 --> 00:01:48.522
This is not just connection.

00:01:48.522 --> 00:01:51.412
It seems to turn on and then die.

00:01:51.412 --> 00:01:55.952
Then the batteries should be replaced, because
the batteries may only have enough juice to

00:01:55.952 --> 00:01:58.792
turn on but die when it tries to connect.

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:02.952
Microsoft’s forums say you should move all
the metal around the house.

00:02:02.952 --> 00:02:05.173
Including your tin foil hat?

00:02:05.173 --> 00:02:10.082
Yes, if you have a metal door between you
and the controller, it won’t communicate,

00:02:10.082 --> 00:02:12.452
but you do not live in a bunker.

00:02:12.452 --> 00:02:15.503
They said you should move metal shelves and
dividers.

00:02:15.503 --> 00:02:19.763
Don’t have stuff around the console that
block air flow or signals.

00:02:19.763 --> 00:02:25.103
That’s a given, both so it doesn’t overheat
or fail to communicate.

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:26.983
What else can I check?

00:02:26.983 --> 00:02:32.643
If there are already eight wireless controllers
connected, another controller won’t connect.

00:02:32.643 --> 00:02:37.843
There are so many devices in the game room,
it only feels like there are that many.

00:02:37.843 --> 00:02:41.153
So the Xbox one hardware is malfunctioning.

00:02:41.153 --> 00:02:45.173
Power-cycle it to see if that fixes the software
glitch.

00:02:45.173 --> 00:02:47.383
If in doubt, reboot.

00:02:47.383 --> 00:02:48.003
That is so Microsoft.
