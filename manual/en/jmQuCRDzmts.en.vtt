JOE WILES: Hi, this is Joe Wiles with the
Rock and Roll Conservatory on behalf of Expert

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.299
Village. In this segment we're going to talk
about "Ballroom Blitz". We're only going to

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.379
do the key riff, the key guitar riff that's
in that song. It's a really simple riff but

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.640
totally effective. Pick up the song, go download
the tablature from the internet so you can

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.900
learn the whole thing; it's a really cool
tune. Let's go to the guitar and take a look.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.900
Now this is another song that doesn't start
off with the guitar. In fact it starts off

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.320
with that signature drum pattern. When the
guitar finally kicks in you're going to want

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:41.180
your index finger on the 7th fret of the A-string,
okay. Put your ring finger on the 9th fret

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.760
of the D-string. That's going to be the basis
for this whole riff, okay. After this we're

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.559
going to stretch our pinkie up keeping our
index finger here not so much important about

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.070
our ring finger. We're going to put our pinkie
on the 10th fret--excuse me, the 11th fret

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.840
of the D-string. We're going to slide up to
the 12th fret and back to the 11th fret. Slowly

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:25.259
it sounds like this.
Again that sounds like this. To speed, that

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.990
same riff sounds like this. Oh, remember it
doesn't start on the downbeat of this song.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.790
If you were counting at one, two, three, four,
one, two, three, four. Your riff would actually

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.860
start on the two. One, two, three, four. One,
two, three, four. You don't come in on the

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:59.630
downbeat, okay? Sounds like this. One. One.
Practice that one a few times. It's a good

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.399
lick to have in your guitar lick arsenal.
So make sure you have it at the ready in any

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.000
given key that you maybe required to perform
it in. In our next segment we're going to

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.520
talk about "Black Hole Sun" by Soundgarden
and I'll see you there.
