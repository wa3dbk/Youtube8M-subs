00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.600
On 19 december of 2001, the second Tibia server is created: Nova. From this moment, players had the chance to restart from nothing and perhaps get a shine spot on this new world.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.766
Since the beginning, Nova has already registered a lot of aggressive player styles, hence wars would be readily consequences. In short time, Nova was known as a war server.

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:19.366
It was necessary a high accumulation of experience to at least impose respect in the server, then the first level 100 was around 2002~2003 by a knight called Lecius. However, in that new server, other names and one guild would write the initial history.

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:25.266
The great master sorcerer Messiah and his real life brother the knight Breaker have made history in Nova. Were the founders of a renowned guild called Knighthood with strict rules that would be reproduced in other world's guilds.

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:32.332
Messiah's history is divided in two parts: Pre and after level 50. Before such level, the original owner was a intelligent, serious, tolerant and protective sorcerer. After solving several quests and some tibia's mystery he decided to give the char to his brother.

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:38.399
Breaker became a serial killer with Messiah's power. Anyone who messed with him was killed, in that time didn't exist skull system, therefore if a player killed complained to a GM about it, you could easily throw some excuse like: "he  has killed my monster".

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.766
The people of Nova got tired of being killed by Messiah and decided to gather themselves against the powerful sorcerer, in the end was Nova vs Messiah. However, Messiah seldom died, his power and pvp were beyond everything.

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:50.999
Witnessing this slaughter, the Gods decide to delete Messiah for several rule violations, especially mass killing

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.900
But Messiah's legacy is still remembered like the standard outfit of his mass killings and guild: Black hair and red clothes. And another more obscure path, who ever heard about blackd tools?

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.900
Blackd was Messiah's original owner first char in Antica, hence that name inspired to that famous illegal tools like BOT and services as trading real money for Itens, Tibia money, World transfers.

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:09.433
Moreover, several HK's members and ancient nova's players were deleted like Breaker for rules violations, Paca, Sula (Another sorcerer as powerful as Messiah), Annie Happy (First sorcerer level 100 on Tibia, also the first level 100+ deleted).

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:20.800
In 2004, another legion of war seekers were born, hegemonize Nova as the war server and transmitting spectacular battles. The newest Nova's TOP EXP was the knight Undead Slayer who were the first Nova's level 200. Before him, the paladin James Dark got the first 150.

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:32.366
Their guilds would protagonize one of the most bloody wars of Nova: White Eagle vs Endless Shine. The war's cause was a death of WE's member (Xibitz) during a trap by ES in response to Xamox's murder (He wasn't a WE, just a ally) of a future Nova's legend: Exequter.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.400
In Endless Shine were skillful players: James Dark, Exequter, Kargax, Isahias, Meroti.

00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:17.032
At White Eagle: Miller (A very dangerous mage, he was constant dueling with Exequter for the position of best mage in the war), Xiblitz, Xamox, Obb (Owner of tomes' set which he stole), Augeas

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.800
Here we see Augeas shooting SD's where ins't possible due to the roof.

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:11.166
Here we see three top fraggers of WE: Miller, Mastro Daro e Nidhoog using bot. Also Obb...

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.700
Besides Endless Shine pwnage, White Eagle won the war (Overall of 175 frags) after 3 months by using bot which allowed to shoot runes on the battle list. Meanwhile, Exequter became more powerful acquiring the first sorcerer's level 350 of the game.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.033
That was a bit of Nova's history that unfortunately will remain only in our minds because Cipsoft has merged some empty servers (including Nova) which destroyed the history of this memorable world...
