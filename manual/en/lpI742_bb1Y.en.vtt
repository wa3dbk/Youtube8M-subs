00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.860
In MSU's nationally recognized
equine science program, students learn

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.910
about horses, themselves, 
and the culture of the West.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:20.240
This is Kid over here, and he's 
one of our equitation horses

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.050
and Kid gets used primarily in the

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.609
beginner classes.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.519
He's one that's very sweet to people.
He's higher in the pecking order

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.449
in the herd,

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.790
but with people he's generally pretty

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.430
willing to try whatever they ask him.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.010
The benefits that students get from
having the horses here are they can come

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.190
and most of them even if they have a
horse can't afford to bring it to school with them

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.920
and the students can then use 
these horses in classes.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.940
Many students come in from

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.150
you know, all over the country 
and other countries

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.510
and their in Montana and they 
get to learn how to ride.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.010
Sweetpea, she's also a sweetheart.
She has a little more pep to her

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.060
than Kid has maybe,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.730
but she's also one that is easy to get
along with for students.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.790
Because MSU

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.480
is in Montana and there's
mostly western riding

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.430
in this state, this offer students the
opportunity, even students from the East Coast

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.720
an opportunity to ride western.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.010
Horses teach people

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:31.439
things about themselves that either
they didn't know or that they find out

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.039
and that they want to change and that
horses help them change things about themselves.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:44.970
Horses are symbolic and iconic,
especially in the West that I

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.010
think the the mustang 
symbolizes freedom

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.339
and majesty in the American West, and I think
students are drawn to the West because

00:01:55.339 --> 00:02:00.130
it symbolizes freedom. The open  
spaces, the mountains, the clean air.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.819
We have this I think unique 
type of lifestyle

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:10.149
that's relatively conservative not
politically speaking but,

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.489
the lifestyle of conservation.
We consider our environmental features,

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:22.609
we use the lifestyle of horses in nature and
farming. And I think students are drawn to that,

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:28.940
not only the wide open spaces but the
history of the American West and the cowboy.

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:38.990
We try to preserve some of that, a lot of that,
then add some of the modem equitation with that.
