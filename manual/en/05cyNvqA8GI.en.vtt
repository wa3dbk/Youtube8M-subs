We, the Nomobile team, have recently discussed what if they built GMS module in a camera

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:24.619
that  would allow to automatically upload photos
to Instagram. And today, on August 29th, 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.550
Samsung have presented a Samsung Galaxy camera, the camera on Android. The device has Wi-fi, GPS, 3G and even 4G. 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:53.719
There is also the function of automatic upload of all photos and video to the cloud services such as Dropbox, Google Plus, Instagram and so on.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:08.039
The display is 4.8", HD-definition (1280 x 720). 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.460
The display is huge, user-friendly and capacitive and has 21-fold optical zoom.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.860
To start shooting you should  press the special icon and move the slider. The optical zoom on Android, guys, it's awesome.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.100
 Then you can go straightly to the gallery and enlarge the image even more and more. That's crazy. What do we also have?

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.420
It's written that a remote view finder is built in the camera. There are several accessories to the Galaxy camera. 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.160
Let go and have a look at them. 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.030
Apart from the already mentioned remote view finder, the feature that allows to look at a picture having the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.390
camera in one hand and the device in the other,
there are also several accessories such as

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.390
a micro-tripod. Taking into account that the
camera weights about 300 g, 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.160
such form of the tripod is justified. It's quite convenient
to use it. Above all, there is a special rig

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.700
which makes the Galaxy camera even more user-friendly
and it looks more like a mirrorless camera.

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:08.739
There are some additional lenses and a crazy
flash. I suppose that Samsung will release

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.590
some other accessories such as additional
mics and so on. I don't know how much it

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.590
will cost but I hope the price will be reasonable.
We're looking forward to the official release

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.530
of the Galaxy camera and we like it very much,
because it's awesome.
