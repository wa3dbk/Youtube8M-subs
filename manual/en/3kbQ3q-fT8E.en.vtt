00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.100
~At the gym the day has come to an end~

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.100
~leaving the day behind without any weariness~

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.100
~I can't recall how the sensation of chasing

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.700
after the ball in a daze is like~

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.500
I'm not even close to getting there,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.300
and I want to improve even if it's bit by bit

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.300
The times that I could only think of

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.300
doing none other but my best

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.300
I wonder why

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.100
it's almost mysterious

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.100
The two of us

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.200
We really got along well on the court

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.500
Those nostalgic memories

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.500
That would be

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.100
our starting point of one day

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
Our growth and our sentiments

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.500
are all packed all together

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.100
~its Ray of shine~!

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.500
we live everyday

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.500
in the middle of that brightness

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.100
A season that is forever etched onto our hearts

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.100
What fell into my hands, was someone like me

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.100
my pride of being the first to see you

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.500
I received my duties to this team

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.100
and was able to become one of the members

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.100
just like a fool

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.100
to going straight ahead without looking

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.100
but somehow it became enjoyable

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.100
Revolving around things I like

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.100
it's become something occuring regularly

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.100
The both of us

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.100
are lively

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.100
I already knew

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100
That we were standing

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.100
together at that place

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.100
That's something that I cannot let myself forget

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.100
I recall

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.100
that was the first miracle that happened to us

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.100
Yet there was no reason at all

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.100
for noticing it

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.100
it's a ray of shine

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.100
the days when everthing seemed that it was brimming over

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.100
A bond that was

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.500
surely accepted between us
