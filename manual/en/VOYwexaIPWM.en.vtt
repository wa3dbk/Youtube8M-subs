00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.000
Our video tour today is in sunny Holland Michigan. We're at the Hazelbank Estate and it's the largest estate for sale with direct access to Lake Michigan.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.000
Now this home is shingled... It's also a casual variation of a Queen Anne Style Home, It's Coastal inspired.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.000
This home for sale sits on 38 pristine acres with another 16 acres for sale and available right next-door.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Now the hub of entertainment in any home is the kitchen and this one exceeds expectations. From the reclaimed Chicago brick fireplace to antique Terra-cotta tiles, to the ultra distressed custom cabinets.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You may have noticed the wood detail in the kitchen and the dinning room but take a look at this. This ceiling bracket was hand crafted onsite and each piece of wood was bent to get to the product you see today.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.000
This pillared gallery hall bonds you to the experience of the home for sale and each room you pass offers beautiful views of the waterfront to Lake Michigan.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
This Master Suite is a private oasis, I'm excited to show it to you.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:44.200
This instate for sale does not sleep! When the sun goes down it's the perfect time to sit back and enjoy the views.
