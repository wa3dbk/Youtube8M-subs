00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.900
What are the Best Proven Natural Remedies
for Joint Pain, Arthritis and Inflammation

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.900
By

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.900
Dr. James Meschino, DC, MS, ND

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.240
I want to tell you about this eBook that I
produced called Proven Natural Remedies for

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.910
Joint Pain, Arthritis and Inflammation.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.670
There are a number of proven, natural treatments
for joint pain, arthritis and inflammatory

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.080
conditions that effect muscles, joints, and
so on.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.800
The reason I want you to know about some of
the natural things available to you is because

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.239
with many of the drugs that are typically
suggested – aspirin, ibuprofen, indomethacin,

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:49.230
diclofenac and acetaminophen – for blocking
pain, studies are now showing that when used

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.660
over time, they have significant adverse side-effects.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.230
I’m not saying never use them; I’m just
saying try to reduce your reliance on them

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.230
as much as you can.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.879
This is where natural supplements can be helpful
because those drugs can create not just stomach

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.191
upset, but also internal bleeding.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:10.150
A lot of people end up with bleeding disorders
from taking those drugs, and now we’re beginning

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.530
to see an increased risk of heart failure,
high blood pressure, liver damage and liver

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.990
failure and kidney damage and kidney failure
to the point where many people are needing

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.030
dialysis or a kidney transplant.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.180
This is serious, and the thing is, doctors
aren’t often trained very well in how to

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.409
prescribe natural supplements, so they believe
the only thing available are synthetic drugs;

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.350
they don’t really study a lot of nutrition
and natural medicine in medical school and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.320
unfortunately, there is a bias against it.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.990
It’s not the doctor’s fault; they just
haven’t really seen evidence.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.880
I can tell you, lifestyle management of arthritis
and inflammatory conditions are both significant

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.880
and important.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.120
There are proven remedies that can make a
big difference for someone suffering with

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.120
inflammation.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.970
It begins with understanding what an anti-inflammatory
diet looks like.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.860
You have to get the raw materials out of your
diet that are creating the building blocks

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.860
for inflammation.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.799
There are also anti-inflammatory herbal agents
– like curcumin, boswellia, white willow

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.690
bark extract and ginger – that when taken
in the right combination can really put the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.780
fire out and suppress inflammation.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.489
Also things like quercetin, Vitamin D and
medicinal mushrooms can help.

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.689
But the thing is, you have to know what doses
to use and understand the importance of standardized

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.959
grades; how it all works together so you get
the best effects.

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.599
I’ve explained it all in my eBook that has
the entire lifestyle program so you can understand

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.599
it.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.880
This eBook is called Proven Natural Remedies
for Joint Pain, Arthritis and Inflammation,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.999
and it explains it all.

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:48.140
If you have any lingering or recurring joint
pain, or any form of arthritis, joint problems,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.319
muscle problems, tendinitis or bursitis – inflammatory
conditions – also disc herniation or chronic

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.819
low back pain, I strongly recommend you download
that eBook right now, read it from cover to

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:12.849
cover and then put the information and advice
to use.
