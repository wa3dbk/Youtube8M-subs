00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:06.933
Originating in China,
Sumi-e painting

00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:07.933
was brought to Japan

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.600
by Zen Buddhist monks
in the 14th century.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.400
Sumi-e literally means
'ink pictures'.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.300
This lesson plan takes
traditional Sumi-e painting

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.600
a step further.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.633
Liquid wax is painted
on the surface

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:21.033
to create a resist,

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:24.533
and then colour is incorporated
along with black ink.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.000
Traditional calligraphy
brushes contain a sizing

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.800
when they're new,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.900
so they will need to
soak in water

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.933
for a few minutes
to remove it.

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.767
AMACO Wax Resist
is for use with ceramics,

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:37.300
but when thinned with water
it can be used as a resist

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.367
on paper or fabric.

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:40.600
After you've thinned the wax,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.967
it's a good idea to
practice on newsprint first,

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:44.167
and when you're ready,

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:48.367
move on to watercolour paper.

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:50.667
Sumi-e artists try to focus
on the essence of

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.500
the subject matter
they are portraying.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.600
The traditional way to prepare
Sumi-e ink

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.633
is to place a small
amount of water in the well

00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:58.933
of a grinding stone,

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.767
and then work
an ink stick into it

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:02.467
until it makes a dense liquid,

00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:05.267
however liquid Sumi-e ink
is also an option

00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:07.633
for this project.

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:09.100
When you move on to
the watercolour paper,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.900
make sure to tape the paper
to a board to keep it flat,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.433
and allow plenty of time
for the wax to dry completely

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:18.367
before moving on
to the next step.

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:20.400
If you don't want to wait
on the drying process,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.900
a product called aquabord is
very absorbent

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.133
and the wax
will dry quickly on it.

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.900
When the wax painting
is done and dry,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.233
it's time to apply Sumi-e ink.

00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:31.233
Add strokes with
the brush and washes,

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:33.067
revealing the clear wax.

00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:36.400
Adjust the ink to water ratio
in order to vary the intensity

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.967
from black to pale grey.

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:41.400
Since this ink is
permanent and will stain,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.533
use caution or substitute
black liquid watercolour

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.133
for a very young student.

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:57.633
As a final step,
I'll add washes of

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:00.467
Blick Liquid Watercolour
to the composition.

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:13.033
The result is a traditional
Sumi-e painting

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.000
with a fresh modern twist.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.033
