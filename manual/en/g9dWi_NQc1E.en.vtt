Yo yo yo! Sparky Sweets, PhD. here. Check me out as I break down 10 banned books off

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.379
my banned books playlist.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.660
#5 A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.589
In a violent future, a teenaged troublemaker
smacks up strangers, rapes housewives, and

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.660
robs the rich before he's captured by The
Man and brainwashed.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.150
Why was it banned?

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.970
Supposedly for its objectionable language
and themes. And probably the rape. I'm pretty

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.169
sure the rape had something to do with it.

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.930
#4 Slaughter-house Five by Kurt Vonnegut
Your standard World War II story, if by standard

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.160
you mean time-jumping, alien-abduction, intergalactic
zoos, and a bangin' actress in that zoo with

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.390
aliens doing the time-jumping. Oh yeah, and
surviving the bombing of Dresden, too.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.190
Why was it banned?

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.110
A Michigan judge called it depraved, immoral,
psychotic, vulgar, and anti-Christian, probably

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.280
referring to the novel's profanity and depictions
of sex. Though I'm guessing it has something

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.080
to do with the ILLUSTRATION OF TITIES ON PAGE
209. Drawn titties! And drawn titties are

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.450
my second favorite kind of titties!

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.969
#3 Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
In a futuristic state full of pill-poppin'

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:15.659
orgies, a savage outsider succumbs to the
artificial temptations of the dystopia and

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.479
offs himself to escape it.
Why was it banned?

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.770
Language, being anti-family and anti-religion,
and for being pornographic. I guess they're

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.240
afraid it'll make teenagers want sex and drugs.
We all know teenagers typically HATE sex and

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.429
HATE drugs.

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.150
#2 Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov
The story of a middle-aged man who has an

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.990
ongoing relationship with a 12-year-old girl,
ending with him murdering the man she runs

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.670
off with.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.819
Why was it banned?

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.749
I don't know, maybe it has something to do
with the GROWN MAN HAVING SEX WITH A 12-YEAR-OLD

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:46.389
GIRL.

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:51.469
#1 The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck
A family of destitute farmers travel from

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.100
Oklahoma to California for work, only to be
met with low wages and mistreatment.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.100
Why was it banned?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.299
The Grapes of Wrath was burned all across
America because of its anti-capitalist propaganda,

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.119
with the Associated Farmers of California
calling the novel a "pack of lies." Also controversial

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.230
was its ending, where a woman lets two hungry
workers drink the milk from her titties. Wanna

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.239
know what titties look like? Well just turn
to page 209 in Slaughterhouse-five!

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.840
