Music and Lyrics: Tamaazu
Piano: Kongmu
Singer: KAGAMINE Len (act2)

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.540
...High noises of cicada.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.190
In front of me

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.510
there was a big stone.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.160
Though I didn't know

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.820
the meaning I did

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.130
I just prayed.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.120
On summer vacation

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.770
I woke up that morning

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.090
I went away with my family

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.740
"Where are we going?"

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.400
"Mom?"

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.710
We passed along the country road

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.990
They kept me waitng

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.650
I felt boring

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.960
"Dad, I wanna go home now"

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.280
"Someday you'll see it"

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.590
Mom said sadly

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.880
White smoke rose against the blue sky

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.530
I didn't feel I like it

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.270
There was something sad...

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.510
Autum is past

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.170
Winter is over

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.470
Spring

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.480
and Summer has come again

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.130
The cycle

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.790
of years

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.100
made me understand the meaning of the words

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.010
I fell in love

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.670
"Grandpa, you hear me?"

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.980
I have my sweetheart now

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.640
Your have a great grandchild

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.290
"Grandma, can you hear me?"

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.610
I have my dear little baby now

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.260
Summer has come again

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.920
Visiting my family grave

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.230
We go to my parents' home in my car

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.890
The good old I feel

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.540
in that place

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:08.000
I pray with my child

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
