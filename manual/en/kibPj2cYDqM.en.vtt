00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm employed here at TLC as an artist in residence

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.060
So this is my work environment.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.060
Most of the artefacts I have here are from my travels

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And being a 6th generation artist, you see some paintings of my forebears.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.060
That is all to stimulate the mind.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Over there is my Great Uncle's work.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:45.000
That is my Grandfather being seduced in Paris by the nightlife.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That is my Father's work the negress above.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.060
The top one is actually an uncle of mine.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is one of my Father's works, the small painting.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.060
That small painting at the top is his son.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So we carry on. Quite a few.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.060
That is my Grandfather's work, that portrait is my Grandfather's work,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.060
My Father's work, this is by my Father.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
They have been quite inspirational by the mere fact that they have their own integrity

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.000
and don't really compromise on that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.060
I think it's very vital to have a work environment where I'm surrounded with my artefacts.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.000
A bit like a think tank.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.000
I think if you look at all artists, you look at the environment they live in,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.000
it's particularly clean at the moment because my canvases are blank.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:58.000
But then I start working, I don't tidy up because it takes away the essence of what I'm busy with.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.060
I went to see an exhibition in Amsterdam just the other day on voodoo in Haiti

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And those things to me are origin, and most of my interests and also within my work

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.000
I use origin quite a lot; things that come from the roots.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:27.000
My works are about things rather than... like if you have the wind

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:36.000
you only can see the wind because of the trees moving or the smoke, or the clouds.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.060
So my paintings are about that space in between the movement and the wind.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I'm off to China, Xiamen - the sister city of Wellington.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And from, I don't really know, about 80 people who submitted their work, 6 were chosen

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.000
and I just happened to be one of them.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So I'm going there for about 3 weeks and it's required that I take a couple of works with me.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.000
And work on works over there and give a one and a half hour talk about my work.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I have three different plans; I have plans where I take small canvases with me,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.060
That is Plan A.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Plan B is to take grinders with me so that I get a large mirror over there

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.060
and just go berserk on it, just grind my images on the mirror.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And leave the mirror over there. That is my best plan so far.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.000
And the third plan is not to take anything with me and scrounge around in market places

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.060
and just see what I can come up with over there.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.060
So I've three kind of plans.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Normally when there's no excuse for me anymore to change my mind

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.060
and when I'm totally squashed, and I'm cornered, I probably make my best work.
