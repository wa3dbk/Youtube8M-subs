00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:12.040
When my mother was pregnant, she had German
measles, so I was born with no iris and they

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.280
call that Aniridia, and apart from the light
bothering me when I was a baby, they didn't

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.860
think there was anything wrong. And when I
was 11 I got congenital Glaucoma which was

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:35.879
linked with the Aniridia, the left eye was
much worse and I had about 13 operations on

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:42.969
that eye. They removed that eye so I have
got an artificial eye now and I was 16 then,

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:54.019
so I managed with the 1 eye quite well until
I was 40. I had some operations on that and

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:04.920
then when I was 47, it just started to get
worse, and after some more operations they

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.460
can't do any more, and the glaucoma robbed
me of the vision that I did have, I also had

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.220
cataracts which they couldn't remove all of
it , just a little because its basically holding

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:29.260
it all together. And so it's a very compromised
eye and gradually as I have got older its

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.780
got much much worse. And I can't see very
much now, I can see a little bit but it is

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.490
very very blurry, very foggy.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:49.880
When we moved to Clacton and I always went
out on my own, and I found for some reason

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.390
I couldn't walk in a straight line. I used
to bump into people in the shops and that,

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.740
and I came home and said to hubby I don't
know what is wrong with the people in Clacton,

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.390
they keep walking into me. He said no actually
it is you, I just couldn't believe it and

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.780
so I saw someone with those shopping trolleys
which you push along, and I decided I would

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.709
buy one of these and push it along in front
of me, well you can imagine what happened,

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.909
I used to run into people with that. So somebody
mentioned to me about Guide Dogs and I had

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:33.370
never heard of it, never heard of Guide Dogs.
And like I said today I couldn't imagine how

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:41.370
a dog could help me because I'm not a doggy
person, I'm alright with the dogs now but

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.370
I never was.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.260
I had difficulty getting around and I couldn't
go out on my own after the bumping into people

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:58.769
and I had to rely on anybody that was going
out, and I don't really like that. So when

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:06.430
I got my dog that meant that I could go out
on my own independently and when I first had

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:14.830
Robyn, I could see a bit more in those days,
but he was ok and he got me out and I started

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:27.780
to go on the buses and stuff. So at least
I was able to go out on my own so that's how

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.510
it happened really. Was strange at first as
I had to learn to trust a dog and I couldn't

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.409
get my head around it you know. Now I understand
after three.

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:50.209
Yoko went to another man another Guide Dog
Owner, and she was working well with him for

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:57.620
Six weeks and the man had a stroke and so
Yoko couldn't work with him anymore. Molly

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.469
was coming up for retirement anyway and she
had got a bit slow, she's not 9 until Sept

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:10.449
but she was brilliant, really brilliant.

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:15.319
Has Yoko got any funny habits?

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:23.390
She spends most of her time on her back, she
loves her tummy tickled. She is pretty good

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.370
at shopping, she offers me every door even
if I don't want to go in there, I love shopping.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.120
In between Robyn retiring and Molly coming
I trained with a long cane, and I didn't like

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.530
that at all. People don't talk to you when
you have a long cane, they tend not to they

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:50.460
don't know what to say, but when you have
a dog everybody talks to you. It means to

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:58.660
me that I can go out like I said today on
the script and I can just grab the harness

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:08.500
and go. Like if my daughter she lives quite
far away, needs help with the children I can

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:16.100
just go. I mean my husband will very willingly
drive me there but I love my independence,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:23.420
I just love to do it on my own and I get such
a buzz out of it, its so much nicer then holding

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.750
someone's arm and to be able to walk along
the road and know you are going to be safe

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:37.910
and they are guiding you around things, its
just an amazing feeling. Well it makes 100%

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:49.890
difference to my life. It's made a difference
to my personality as well and made me much

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:58.450
more outgoing and I will take on any challenge
whereas maybe I wouldn't have before.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.601
I mean I could stay at home if I wanted and
do nothing but I don't like doing that, I

00:06:04.601 --> 00:06:15.580
like to go to church I like to do all manner
of things, give Guide Dog talks, I like that.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:24.250
There are no boundaries now, I can go anywhere
and do anything I want. I think Yoko is going

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:32.950
to be really good, a very assertive guide
dog, she's already showed signs of making

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:33.950
decisions.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.910
Q. Why do you think people should donate money
to Guide Dogs?

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:51.670
A. Because there is no other funding and it
is a voluntary charity and we have no government

00:06:51.670 --> 00:07:00.320
funding and without donations it wouldn't
exist, there wouldn't be Guide Dogs for the

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.660
Blind Association. It's a difficult time that
we are living in because people haven't got

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:13.360
much money with the recession. But Â£2 per
month is nothing really is it?
