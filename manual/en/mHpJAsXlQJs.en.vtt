00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:07.589
Ok for our next incredible woodworking adventure
we're going to cut a slot called a rabbit

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.800
in the bottom of this box so we can put a
bottom in it. I've already cut the bottom

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.850
and I'm going to cut a slot that this fits,
fits in. What I'm using router is called a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.280
rabbit bit if you can get a good shot on this.
This is a bit with two wings on it and it's

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:37.200
going to cut a, a slot that looks like that.
You can see this one's been cut on the other

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:48.020
side and that's what that looks like so we'll
go ahead and lay this down and cut that rabbit.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.750
I've set it for about a quarter of an inch,
that's about as much as you want to a try

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.681
to cut in one pass with the router. So if
you want to put a thicker bottom in it and

00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:04.449
you want that slot to be deeper do it a quarter
of an inch at a time. But a quarter of an

00:01:04.449 --> 00:02:13.890
inch will be a quite sufficient for our purposes
today. Ah, that's some dusty business, now

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:24.370
we look at our depth here, that's going to
fit. Our next step then is to make a, these

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.060
corners square because since the bit on our
router is round, when you come this corner

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.250
it cuts a round corner. So unless you want
to go through all the trouble of trying to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.030
make these corners exactly the same shape
as this, the easiest way is to grab your chisel

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.870
and make these corners square and I'll show
you how we're going to do that. We got our

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.940
trusty chisel; it should be pretty good and
sharp. Test it against your thumb nail, if

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.620
it sticks it's sharp enough to go.
