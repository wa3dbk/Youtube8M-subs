&gt;&gt; ...and then it goes the mode where it autonomously lands. It slows down the hovering until it lands.  That is the main protection it has against failures.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:30.430
&gt;&gt; Unlike many other air vehicles, it uses only the sensors and processors onboard to plan and generate a new trajectory forward.  As soon as Brian starts it, it will autonomously take off, go and land.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:45.430
&gt;&gt; You can see how it builds the map here and the the trajectory in green.  This is the trajectory the robot generates. This where it thinks it is in the world.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:01:03.430
&gt;&gt; Jon has walked out - it has detected Jon - and it will re-plan and go around the side to avoid Jon.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.556
&gt;&gt; "How much mass can it lift?"

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.756
&gt;&gt; A few kilograms.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.690
&gt;&gt; Certainly enough for a camera.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.823
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The lasers and the batteries are pretty heavy, but on top of that it can lift about a kilogram or so.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.556
&gt;&gt; All set? Yes.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.490
&gt;&gt; It uses its onboard stereo lasers to do the estimation of where it is and how high it is and things like that.  Any other questions?
