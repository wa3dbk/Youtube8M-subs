00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.070
Hi my name is Tia Ward and this is my series
Models Corner.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:12.570
Today I am going to show you my acne busting
solutions, my blemish busters, so stay tuned.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.780
[music]

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.150
Today I am going to talk to you about acne
and the products that I have tried and tested.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.140
It is a subject that is really close to my
heart because I have suffered with it for

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.140
so long.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.990
I think most of my adult life I have had spots
and varying degrees of acne and it is only

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.800
in the last six months or so that my skin
has really started to clear up.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.989
I tried drug store products, I tried expensive
boutique products, but in the end I had to

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.170
resort to going to the dermatologist.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.770
They had to put me on Roaccutane, which is
a last resort, but it has worked for me I

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.190
think, getting there.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.469
Now I am dealing with scarring so I am going
to talk you through my acne products, my tried

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.039
and tested, my favorite, and what I do to
avoid being spotty.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.320
Acne is usually associated with oily, greasy
skin but mine is actually quite dry and I

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.320
struggle to find products that combat the
dryness but help my spot situation.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.070
This is my favorite cleanser to use as it
is quite balmy, it melts into your skin and

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.990
dissolves all over your makeup.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.740
Vogue actually voted it "probably the best
cleanser in the world," I quote.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:29.490
It is like a balm and when you take the solid
and put it on your skin it literally melts

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.440
into your skin and dissolves any makeup, any
city grime, and it takes it all off.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.350
So I will show you how I use that.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:45.109
I literally use about this much and it is
the tiniest amount, really takes off everything.

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.159
I have not got anything on my face at the
minute apart from my eyebrows in, but just

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.439
to show you how I would use it on a daily
basis, you put it on your face like this and

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:54.439
you massage it in.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.960
It actually comes with a manual and it shows
you the different exercises you are supposed

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.960
to do.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.219
Some sort of massage, just to help your lymphatic
system drain away toxins and things.

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.050
This is more a cleanser I would use in the
night time.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.850
During the day I find it maybe would make
my skin a little bit too greasy as the day

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.470
goes on.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.030
Then to remove it, it comes with a muslin
cloth.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.050
This is famous.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.970
Eve Lom famed this muslin cloth for the removal
of any sort of balmy cleanser.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.530
So I am just soaking it in some warm water,
nothing too hot because I do not like to aggravate

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.080
my skin or dry it out too much.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:46.700
Then cover my face and gently, with swiping
motions, just remove it gently so as not to

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.680
damage any skin or if I have got spots and
they are quite sore this is great.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.840
Once I have taken all of that off my skin
is not tight, like when you use soap I feel

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.590
like your skin can feel like it is going to
crack once it dries.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.840
This does not leave you with any of that feeling
which is great.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.880
I then pat my face dry with a towel.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.930
I never rub because that can really damage
your skin.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.530
I then go about using a re-texturing pad.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.110
Now these are from Space NK, they are by Cane
and Austin, I think they are exclusive to

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.010
Space NK actually, and they are re-texturing
pads with 10% glycolic acid.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.470
These are aimed at women who are struggling
with their skin so I am the perfect candidate

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.650
for these and they look like this and they
are just little cotton pads that are soaked

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.930
in the glycolic acid treatment.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.020
This stuff actually gets to work on breaking
down the glue that holds your skin together.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:51.570
Now that sounds a bit deadly but it works
to loosen up scarring, fine lines, and break

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.760
down the bacteria that acne thrive on and
again I am not rubbing hard because the texture

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.190
of the bad is quite thick and quite, it is
not sharp, they know what they are doing,

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.290
these people, so it is not damaging but you
just do not want to rub too hard on your skin.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.390
You can see my skin is a little bit flush
but not too red and that is what you are aiming

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.390
for.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.880
The next step in my routine is StriVectin-AR
Advanced Night Repair which is a retinol cream.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.620
Now retinol is a vitamin A derivative and
it is used widely in the treatment of acne.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.620
It looks like this.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.910
It is a really light cream, you do not need
a lot.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:37.630
This is probably overzealous, but I would
take this and just gently start to rub it

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.280
in and it is really easily absorbed.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.150
It does not leave a greasy film on your skin
if you give it a couple of minutes and you

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.680
rub it in well enough.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.490
It is super gentle, it does not feel like
it has got any hard working ingredients in

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.490
it.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.680
It does not tingle, or it should not tingle
at least.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:07.740
Once you have patted it in you would not even
know it is there.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.010
Now this is something I swear by.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.889
It is Mario Badescu, I think is how it is
pronounced.

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.150
It has two parts to it.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.330
It has got like a calamine lotion at the bottom.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.470
Did you ever get chicken pox and your mom
daub you with that pink lotion that smells

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.470
like Calpo?

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.639
That is what is in the bottom of this, and
the top is like a zinc solution.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:35.560
I will take a cotton bud and you dip it through
the watery solution and into the more gloopy

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.020
bit, which is pink.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.270
And with that, if I have any spots, I will
just dab them on like this.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.490
This really helps to calm the spot down.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:52.620
By the morning the size of the blemish is
significantly reduced and it is brilliant.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.420
I have not found anything as good as this.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.280
This is more of a higher end product as well
but it is really worth the money.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.730
It is not expensive, it is about, I think
it is about Â£15.00.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.900
I will put all of the products below and link
to them directly underneath the video so make

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.510
sure you look at that.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.060
This is my acne routine.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.280
It has really served me well over the past
couple of months and it is such a struggle

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.780
when your skin is not up to its best you feel
it and I completely understand, as a woman,

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.520
how it feels when you do not feel your best.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.650
Make sure you subscribe to keep up-to-date
with my videos and I will be back next week.
