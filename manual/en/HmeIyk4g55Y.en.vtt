00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.720
Hello my name is Dennis Davenport.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.520
I'm Vice President of Sales and Marketing
for Monte Carlo Fan Company.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.130
Proud partner of the Generation Brands Company.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.900
We look at the market and identify niches
that are open for us as a company as well

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.439
as look for fashion forward designs and innovations
in both technical and product design.

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.130
This is the Great Lodge family of lighting
which is a Ponderosa pine log with also the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.190
antler and it's very well received.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.549
It's sold throughout the United States, not
just where you're thinking, the Rocky Mountains

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:39.510
but it sells nationwide.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.089
We have a broad array of Energy Star fans
all the way down to the entry level builder

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:49.330
type product in Energy Star, all the way up
to very high performance fans which we just

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.170
introduced to the show.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.690
It's called a DC 60 and it's has a DC powered
motor versus AC which has been historically

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.510
in the marketplace for ceiling fans since
the beginning.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.620
It's the ultimate energy saver.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.290
One fan will save you 45 dollars in energy
per year.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.460
This fan is a Crystoria, limited edition.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.030
Being a limited edition there will only be
2500, they're all numbered.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.200
We think over years to come that the original
purchase price of this will be nominal because

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.650
once this fixture is sold out the price will
escalate greatly.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.480
All the crystal is 24 percent hand cut led
crystal, it is in the English pewter.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.000
It's 66 inches in diameter with mahogany finished
hand carved wooden blades.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.500
The fan we're looking at now is the Airlock
model, 44 inch, 8 blades with an uplight,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.500
downlight.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.540
If you can see it now it's spinning up and
as it goes faster and faster the blades open

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.960
by centrifugal force.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.560
And it does move a tremendous amount of air
so it's not just for the novelty.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.630
We give the retailers as well as the home
owners an option to do a companion light kit

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.610
on the wall because these are actually dual
now.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.660
They come with a canopy when these can be
put on a ceiling as a semi-flush so they don't

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.880
have to necessarily go on a ceiling fan.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.629
Now we have 72 different light selections
that work on various of 600 fans that are

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.860
on our line.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.630
Even hand carved wood, we have it in light
medium dark walnuts, down to actually we call

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.490
it chestnut which is very beautiful light
finish.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.940
We pride ourselves on quality, value, versus
the dollars spent as well as design and product

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.310
innovation.
