00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.570
When you see �Final Fantasy� in the title,
you can expect certain things.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.419
Moogles, chocobos, bombs, airships, a dude
named Cid, the usual litany.

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.019
What you don�t always expect is beach-platform
ass-sumo.

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.630
As a minigame.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.370
I�ve been wrangling with my feelings on
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.170
Bearers for some time now, and here�s what
I think: despite being in no way whatsoever

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.399
an RPG - let�s get that out of the way first,
this is an action game full of quicktime events

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.159
and waggle and other eldritch machinations
- this feels like a drastic change of pace,

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.680
funny enough, right around the height of the
�Japan is Over� sentiment.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.040
And while this game�s execution is kinda
flawed in places, particularly where targeting

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.760
and camera are concerned...

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.430
I have to admit, I like this world they�ve
crafted.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.710
You�ve still got the boilerplate four-tribes
Crystal Chronicles concept, only now there�s

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.390
trains and televisions and a delightful lack
of annoying verbal tics and Lilties are no

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.850
longer the Tarutaru-esque midgets they once
were.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:32.070
TJ�s Lessons for not-quite-RPG Dumbasses,
chapter whatever: When a cute girl offers

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.460
to buy you tea, even if she�s from outside
of your species, and EVEN if you were very

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.950
recently terrorized by her pet ferret, you
sit your ass down in that chair and drink

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.690
your goddamn TEA!

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.940
Or stand there.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.810
This particular dumbass, the star of our story,
is the Crystal Bearer Layle, a kid endowed

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.860
with incredible, arcane, powers of telekinesis,
which means of course he�s on the run from

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.860
the law.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.229
After a chance encounter with one of the last
remaining Yukes - not youths, for a change

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.910
- who appears to be up to no good, Layle finds
himself attempting to thwart a resurrection,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.610
using the power of throwing crap into other
crap.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.450
Seriously, that�s all he�s got.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.170
No oversized sword, no gunblade, just whatever�s
on hand: rocks, cacti, fungi, other enemies.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.310
Clear the area quickly enough and you can
earn another segment of your health bar, in

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.010
case you didn�t think this felt Legend of
Zelda-ish enough.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.189
Yeah.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.819
Doesn�t look like any Final Fantasy I�ve
ever played, either.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.560
But then again, perhaps I was just so disappointed
in Ring of Fates that I needed anything else.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.870
Despite some hang-ups with the point-and-waggle-intensive
controls, though, Crystal Bearers felt...

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.909
liberating, I guess is the word.

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.239
The gameplay can vary wildly between action
platforming, beating up monsters, tinkering

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.510
together new equipment, and stealthing your
way through a train car on lockdown.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.489
Through it all, you�re being hounded by
- or stalking, one or the other - a mischievous

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.099
Selkie named Belle, who I swear I�ve heard
somewhere before...

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.319
Anyway, it�s all the adventure of a Final
Fantasy, just without the number-fixated gameplay

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.730
or stat micromanagement.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.940
So, wait, isn�t this what everyone was clamoring
for?

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.269
A non-RPG that could live up to its notorious
name?

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:25.980
Well, maybe folks wanted that stat micromanagement.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.879
Maybe folks wanted a main character who was
a bit more energetic than Trent Lane.

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.499
Maybe folks wanted control that wasn�t dependent
on holding a cursor over a target (while bouncing

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:40.870
around in a Chocobo-drawn carriage) or whose
combat was a little more elaborate than �Throw

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.549
crap at crap.� It starts off as a cool idea,
but can quickly turn repetitive since, unlike

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.499
most RPGs, you can�t really break your damage
output.

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:53.269
Maybe folks were nervous, thinking Belle was
gonna call them �Sempai� and wouldn�t

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.890
that be confusing.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.790
Maybe they wanted an actual Final Fantasy
game, instead of this well-meaning yet very,

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.909
very different substance.

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.659
Eh, more for me.

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.079
I�m fine with action-adventure with Moogles
and crystals and Cid, especially with the

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.329
intense focus on comedic timing that Crystal
Bearers provides.

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.599
Isn�t that right, dude-whose-cart-just-got-absconded-with?
