00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.190
Hi I'm Andrea.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.510
And I'm Sarah.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.270
And we're from the lifestyle blog Peanut Buttered.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.340
Welcome back to our spoon full of comfort
series.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.420
Today we're going to be making baked brie
bites.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.580
These are the perfect thing to serve at your
Christmas party.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.890
[music]
So the assembly of these is a little bit fiddly,

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.360
but it's so worth it, these are absolutely
delicious.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.360
They're amazing.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.070
We're going to just dust the surface of our
workbench with some flower just so it doesn't

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.220
stick.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.789
And we're going to start off with some pastry.

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:37.409
We're going to cut it into squares.

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:41.839
The easiest way I find is just to cut it with
a pizza slicer, and so you cut them into two

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:42.839
different sizes.

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.629
Yep, I'm going to cut some them slightly smaller
than the other half, and you will see why

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.649
in just a moment.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.100
So this is the sort of thing you can make
ahead of time and just throw into the oven

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.500
just before your guests arrive, so they're
nice and worm when they get there.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.210
Okay, we're going to brush half of these squares
with some egg wash, and we've just beaten

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.210
an egg here.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.040
And this is later going to act as a glue between
the two squares of pastry.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.720
So you keep going until half the squares are
covered.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.230
Okay so we have some small pieces of brie
that we've cut up, and we also have some quince

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.260
jelly here.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.500
We'll get one small bit of brie, and we'll
place in the center of one of the pieces of

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.350
pastry that has egg wash.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.270
Just a small bit of quince jelly here.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.470
We're going to take one of our squares that
doesn't have the egg wash on it already and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.890
just gently tug it out, just a little bit
as you can see, so it's slightly bigger than

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.390
the one we're going to place it on top of.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.640
We're then going to get the egg wash, and
go just around the outsides.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.300
So it's literally like a glue.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.850
Place it over the top of the brie and quince
jelly.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.540
And then we're going to take it, and just
squeeze the edges together to seal them.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.060
So for a full list of ingredients please check
the description box below.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.840
Now we're going to quint the edges with a
fork, and this is your opportunity to make

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.460
yours a little bit more plentiful.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.690
Mine look fine, and they're going to look
even better when they're puffed up and golden.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.040
Sure.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.650
So this just helps to seal in the edges even
more.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.300
I think you spoke a bit too soon on how yours
were prettier than mine.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.550
I know, I did get a bit over excited with
the fork, but anyway, never mind.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.390
And we'd love to see your versions of them,
so tweet us or Facebook us with pictures.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.230
Okay to finish these up we're just going to
give them a light egg wash which will make

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.180
sure the pastry gets nice and golden.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.410

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.780
So now we're going to finish putting the egg
yolk onto these and then they're going to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.780
go into the oven.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.620
Yep, they'll go into the oven for about 10
minutes or so depending on how hot your oven

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.490
is, just watch them, but when they're puffed
up and golden they'll be ready.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.490
How great do these look?

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.490
They look amazing.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.340
So they're fresh out of the oven, and they;re
looking lovely and golden, and they've risen

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.340
beautifully.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.010
So we're ready to take these to our Christmas
party now.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.010
Have fun.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.250
We hope you have a very merry Christmas, and
thank you for watching.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.250
We'll see next time.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.251
