for money, for those who dont know what scentsy

00:04:42.466 --> 00:04:47.330
is click the link here, but thirty six euro
for a candle in spain, so all our scentsy

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:54.039
spain customers will be very happy when they

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.419
you for coming back to wickfreecandles.net
channel, we are leaving barcelona very shortly

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:06.129
and i am very tired after two full days of
lots of eating and general fun, we are off

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:14.301
to our cruiseship Liberty of Seas for our
all expenses paid scentsy incentive trip so

00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:20.319
we are very excited, it always been a dream
of mine to go on a cruise ship, last year

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:30.680
i managed to make it on, and here comes the
waiter, say hello, olla, olla, so there you

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:38.869
go we have always wanted to go on a cruise
ship and last year i got to go on my all time

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:43.969
dream holiday to Las Vegas with scentsy so
i really cant wait to see what they have instore

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:50.560
for us this time, if you are a scentsy consultant
you should make it your number priorty to

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:58.879
earn the incentive trips every single year
because its the holiday of a lifetime and

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:04.949
unless your very rich and you have alot of
spare cash, because scentsy only take you

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.699
on the best and relly splash out, and if you
are not a scentsy consultant, then maybe you

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:14.789
should look into being a scentsy consultant,
i dont know what you do for a living but i

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:20.009
dont think you boss pays for you to go on
a all expenses paid trip just for you doing

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:29.400
your job, we will check in from the boat anyway,
we are off to cannes tonight so bye bye
