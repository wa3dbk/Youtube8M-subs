Hey guys, I'm Alicia with GN Gonzales.
And I have here Gabe, our Service Manager.

00:00:04.113 --> 00:00:05.613
And today we are going to go over

00:00:05.613 --> 00:00:07.142
a couple pre-ride checklist for the dirt bike as well

00:00:07.142 --> 00:00:08.216
as some maintenance tips, so stayed tuned.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.800
Hey everyone, I'm Gabe Scofield, Service Manager at GN Gonzales in Baton Rouge, LA.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.960
and today we are here with the 2014 Yamaha YZ450F.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.620
I'm going to show you a little pre-ride inspection 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.100
and some maintenance to touch on, just to stay safe on the track, before a race, before practice

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.160
before any type of riding is done.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.274
What I tend to do is start from the bottom of the bike and work my way up

00:00:32.274 --> 00:00:35.194
so I touch on everything and don't forget anything, so let's jump right into it.

00:00:35.194 --> 00:00:40.710
Basically I like to start here at the rear of the bike.  You want to check your tire for any

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.790
Inconsistencies in the tread pattern, in the knobbies, anything like that that might cause

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.117
a problem out there on the track or on the trail.

00:00:47.117 --> 00:00:50.514
You also want to take good note with the tension of the chain.

00:00:50.514 --> 00:00:54.769
I like to use the three finger rule so basically it's three fingers right here on the chain slider.

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.080
This one, as you can see, is a little off

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.750
All depends on where you are going to ride and how you are going to ride.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.720
You want to make sure your chain is properly adjusted, lubricated, clean, and, this is the life of your bike, ride-ability.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.680
You also want to check your sprocket to make sure there is no inconsistent

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.040
wear, or over-wear, from not changing it.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.760
Your chain is affected by your sprocket and the rear wheel drive is affected by your sprocket itself.

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:33.489
Also you want to check your rear brake pads.  You want to check for any inconstancies in the brake pad wear

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.720
or too much wear and if it's time to change those, then do that as soon as possible.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.640
While you are here at the rear of the tire, you want to check your spokes.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.480
Make sure there are no loose spokes, if there are, you want to get a spoke wrench, the proper type of spoke wrench, and tighten those.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.760
All these specs you'll find in your service manual or shop manual for your make, model, and year of your motorcycle.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.080
After you've checked it over, you'll want to check for proper air pressure.

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:09.389
in your tire.  I like to run 10-12 pounds, but you may do something different.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:14.579
That is just my opinion.  Depending on where you are going to ride, how you are riding, and your level of riding experience.

00:02:16.273 --> 00:02:20.993
After the rear wheel, you going to want to check the foot peg and spring.

00:02:20.993 --> 00:02:23.760
Just to make sure there is no damage and it's good to go there so you are safe on your motorcycle.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.324
While you are down here, you'll want to check your oil level and coloring.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.880
If it's too dark, that usually means it's time to change your oil.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.440
Just check it out there, make it a force of habit before you ride every time.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.560
And if you need to top it off, you can access your oil fill cap very easily.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.440
Moving to the front of the bike, we want to check much like the rear tire.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.440
You want to check the knobbies on the tire itself.  Look for any inconsistencies, anything that might look dangerous.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.360
Not normal wear or anything like that.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.680
You also want to check the air pressure and you want to check your spokes, while you are here.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.240
Any loose spokes need to be addressed.  If you leave loose spokes on a wheel, in the future, it's just

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.640
going to make it worse on your wallet, and for your health, and for your safety.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.000
You also want to check your brake pads and just check them to make sure everything is good there

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.960
the thickness is the way it should be, just keep you riding safe.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.754
Next we are going to move to the top of the bike and the handlebar area.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.280
Check your levers, your cables, and your throttle.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.520
Make sure everything is working properly the way it should.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.000
You also want to check suspension.  Now, on some bikes you'll find on the smaller bikes do not

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.040
have a release valve on the forks. The bigger bikes, 250s, 450s, some of the 150s, most of the 125s, two strokes,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.540
and things of that nature, will have this.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.120
Whenever you ride around with the bike in the back of your truck or trailer, and it's strapped down,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.160
it builds up air. and you want to let that air out before you start riding.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.067
It's going to differ in the ride-ability of your motorcycle.

00:04:03.067 --> 00:04:09.951
There are two screws, one in each fork, that you'll want to release. You release it and you'll hear the air

00:04:09.951 --> 00:04:13.120
be removed when you do that.  If you don't feel comfortable then please don't do it

00:04:14.073 --> 00:04:17.113
and let your service department show you how. 

00:04:17.113 --> 00:04:18.200
Do not mistake the air valve for the compression settings.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.280
Moving right along, you'll want to move down and check your fuel vent hose.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.640
Your fuel vent hose, it's taken off very easily, but you just want to check it for any

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.360
obstructions or anything that might be blocking the regular job that it has of basically venting your fuel tank.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.120
On this bike, the fuel tank is under the seat.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.815
 You'll want to check your air filter.  Most guys have their air filters hidden underneath their seat.

00:04:49.815 --> 00:04:52.040
This one happens to be right here.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.400
You'll want to make sure it's clean, oiled, everything is good to go, when it comes to your air filter because this is how your motorcycle breathes.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.275
 Finally you'll want to move to the back of the bike where your exhaust is.

00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:05.560
Just give it a good tug and make sure everything is good to go and tightened.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.360
Also if you have a wash plug from last time you washed the bike, take it out before you start it.

00:05:08.713 --> 00:05:13.513
Last but not least, check that you have the proper amount of brake fluid.

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:17.400
In your rear brake, you can look at the service window or take the top off.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.145
Also you want to make sure you have enough radiator fluid.

00:05:21.473 --> 00:05:24.033
Pop the cap off and top it off if needed.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.280
And while you are here, check your front brake fluid.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.680
There is a service window you can look at or take the top off to check it out.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.674
Alright guys, that about wraps it up for this episode.

00:05:32.674 --> 00:05:33.805
