00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:21.900
Boy, talk about surprises.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.770
I thought this was some sort of farming simulator
in which harvesting shade-tolerant legumes

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.420
was your primary objective.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.810
Imagine my surprise when I looked at the box
and saw people dressed like **** Griff Tannen.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:46.100
You can’t farm for cowpeas in those outfits.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.120
Turns out this is a very different kind of
Black Eyed Peas Experience, something in which

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.920
repeating “Imma be, Imma be, Imma, Imma,
Imma be” not only makes you an exorbitant

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.559
amount of money...but also proves that human
beings have no business participating in a

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.549
representative democracy.

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.780
Imma be.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.729
There are six letters in that, and only two
of them form an actual word.

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.159
The other 66 percent of them are used to spell
the sound dumb people use to preface their

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.900
rudimentary attempts at sentences.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:31.700
Geez, and people make fun of my puns.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.000
Apologies to those who are fans of this...group...thing.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.929
Obviously, I am not, but this is not a review
about the Black Eyed Peas.

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:48.969
If it were, I’d at least focus on Ms. Ferguson’s
assets to be positive, but I gotta tell you,

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.640
even those...

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.710
Kind of overrated.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.579
The Black Eyed Peas Experience follows in
the footsteps of Michael Jackson: The Experience,

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:01.850
also released by Ubisoft.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.759
The difference is the hands behind them.

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.690
This game was actually developed by the same
team that did Elite Beat Agents, so you might

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.360
expect big things from The Black Eyed Peas
Experience.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.660
Unfortunately, this is no Elite Beat Agents.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.630
Also, I cannot dance.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.770
In fact, The Black Eyed Peas Experience is
a lot like the Michael Jackson one.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.110
You have a slew of music from the Black Eyed
Peas, and you dance to it.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.190
This is basically Dance Central: The Black
Eyed Peas Edition...only nowhere near as good

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.590
as Dance Central and with a lot less impressive
motion recognition.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:55.550
The game has a party mode that lets you jump
right into the dancing, but for a more ambitious

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.230
BEP wanna-be who wants-to-be, you can also
participate in the campaign mode.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.840
That’s where you actually learn real dance
moves step-by-step, customize a character,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.250
unlock new dance venues, you get the idea.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:29.480
To me, the interesting thing about the Black
Eyed Peas Experience is that someone actually

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.760
proposed, “Hey, you know what musical group
has a catalog strong enough to have their

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.540
very own video game?

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.900
The Black Eyed Peas.”

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.070
I mean, you’ve got bands like the Beatles
and Aerosmith getting their own video games

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.340
because they have decades of music to celebrate.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.870
The Black Eyed Peas have silly outfits.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.060
And Fergie’s ass.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.890
And yet somehow, they’ve packed 30 songs
into this thing.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.060
If it were any other game, that would be a
low total.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.710
But for a game based on the Black Eyed Peas...I
mean, I’m kind of surprised 30 Black Eyed

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.140
Peas songs actually exist.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.289
That’s an achievement in itself, and it’s
also the kind of approach you have to take

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.030
to The Black Eyed Peas Experience.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.600
This is a pretty average dancing game with
pretty average motion recognition, but then

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.460
again, what better describes this particular
recording group...than pretty average.
