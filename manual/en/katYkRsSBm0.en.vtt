Hi. This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV.
I'm going to show you how to create a digital

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.500
portrait from a standard photo and how to
replace the photo without having to redo the

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.320
effects. This is an update to a tutorial I
did on an earlier version of Photoshop. 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.060
Open a photo you'd like to use, I downloaded this one from Shutterstock.com. To add effects

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:41.180
to the photo non-destructively, convert it
into a Smart Object. To do this, click the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.980
icon at the upper, right of the Layers panel
and click "Convert to Smart Object".

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.100
 Go to Image and Image Size. To ensure that your results will be the same as mine, make the

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:05.220
Resolution: 150 pixels per inch and the Height:
850 pixels. The Width will automatically update

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.290
itself to another amount because the width
and the height are linked. Then, click OK.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.900
To fit the photo back onto your canvas, press
Ctrl or Cmd + 0. For the best results, the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.660
subject should be on a white background. If
your subject isn't on a white background,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.290
we need to make a selection around the subject
and then cut it out. For this example, I'll

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.440
use the Quick Selection Tool. I'll make the
Size: 15 pixels and drag the tool over the

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.820
subject. The selection doesn't have to be
perfect. If you want to see it as a quick

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.740
mask, press "Q". Press "Q" again to revert
it back into a selection. 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.660
Press Ctrl or Cmd + J to cut your subject from its background and copy it to its own layer. 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:07.560
Make a new layer below it. To do this, Ctrl-click or Cmd-click on the New Layer icon. We'll fill the empty

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.810
layer with white and since white is the background color, press Ctrl or Cmd + Delete.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.960
Merge these layers by clicking on the thumbnail of your subject to make the layer active and pressing

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.190
Ctrl or Cmd + E. Make this layer into a Smart Object

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.700
 and go to Filter, Pixelate and Mosaic. 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.820
Make the Cell Size: 15 pixels square and click OK. 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.940
Go to Filter, Noise and Median.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.060
 Make the Radius 5 pixels. 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.320
This modifies the square mosaics into round shapes. 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.180
Go to Filter and Filter Gallery. 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.240
Open the "Stylize" folder and click "Glowing Edges". I'll make the Edge

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:15.459
Width: 1, the Edge Brightness: 15 and the
Smoothness: 15, however, feel free to experiment

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.569
with the amounts to get the combination you
like. To replace the photo with another without

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:27.209
having to redo all the effects, double-click
on a Smart Object to open the source photo.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:36.680
Open the new photo and go to Image and Image
Size. Make the Resolution: 150 pixels per

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.530
inch and Height: 850 pixels. Then, click OK. 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.500
Press "v" to open your Move Tool and drag

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.680
it onto the tab of the .psb file, which is
the Smart Object. Without releasing your mouse

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.080
or pen, press and hold Shift as you drag it
down onto the image. Then, release. 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.040
Go back to the Smart Object tab and click the small "x" to close it. 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.120
When you see this warning,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.960
click "Yes" to accept it. 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.599
Click back on the tab of your portrait to open it and your new

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.659
photo will automatically update itself with
all the effects. To crop it,

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.500
open your Rectangular Marquee Tool and drag a rectangle over you image. 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.660
Go to Image and Crop. Then, deselect it.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.400
This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV.
Thanks for watching!
