A lot of people in tech blogs
are talking about the

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.670
new Google TV platform.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.720
If you're interested, but you're still
not sure exactly what it is, we're

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.040
here to explain the details.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.640
Hi there.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.900
I'm Veronica Belmont.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.630
Today, we're going to talk about Google
TV. We'll explain what it is

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.640
and all the great things
you can do with it.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.370
Let's start off with the basics.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.300
Google TV is a platform built into
televisions or other devices, like

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.970
Blu-ray disc players.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.540
Google TV allows you go beyond the
features of your existing cable or

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.730
satellite service and provides access
to unlimited entertainment and

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.460
information from the internet.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.680
In short, it's the best of television,
meaning the best of the internet.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.130
When you have a Google TV platform built
into an HDTV like this one, you

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.280
can enjoy both television and
the web at the same time

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.330
and on the same screen.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.380
It's quick and simple to find
the content you crave.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.160
Watch this.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.210
When you search for a topic, you not
only get to see results from the

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.760
entire internet, but you also get to see
the regular TV listings, web apps,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.410
video, and more.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.030
You can even bookmark the web pages, TV
channels, and apps that you love.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.600
Plus, this TV also keeps track of your
most viewed sites for easy access next

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.740
time you turn on your TV. Another
advantage is that it

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.310
enables you to multitask.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.560
For example, you can quickly pull up an
actor's name without ever missing a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.350
scene of the movie.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.100
Very cool.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.730
Or if you're sports fan, you can watch
a game, check your team's stats

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.080
online, and post comments
on Facebook or Twitter.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.260
Many Google sets like this one offer
full HD 1080p picture quality, LED

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.570
backlight technology, and other features
you expect in a high end

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.590
television.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.180
But this TV also has something others
don't, a powerful processor.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.110
It makes searching and website loading
faster and provides smooth online

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.440
video playback.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.780
So if you want fast performance, make
sure you look for Intel inside.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.360
You can also access tons of
pre-installed apps, such as Netflix,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.240
Pandora, and YouTube, plus so many
more apps available through the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.640
Android market.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.539
You can even download the Google TV
remote application that can turn any

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.430
smartphone into a wireless remote.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.430
Or you can use this handheld keypad with
full QWERTY keyboard to navigate

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.710
your TV and surf the web.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.440
And I'm sure you're wondering, what
happens when this technology is

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.130
replaced by a new platform or features
that are bigger and better?

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.670
Well, the great news is that
the Google TV platform

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.490
provides automatic updates.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.410
So your internet TV is running on
the latest and greatest version.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.700
So that's Google TV. If you're looking
for an experience that takes you

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.620
beyond traditional TV viewing, then
internet television powered by Google

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.420
TV is the way to go.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.890

Sony with Howdini.
