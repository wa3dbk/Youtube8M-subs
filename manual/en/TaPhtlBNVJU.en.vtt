00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:04.020
This is andrew with hitchanything.com and
we will be demonstrating the

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.630
tekonsha p3 90195 prodigy proportional brake
controller.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.009
So what is included is all
this here, the brake controller, installation

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:12.550
hardware and
instructions.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:19.320
The universal wire here, plugs in right in
the back.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.779
And
a few different mounting brackets.

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.519
You have the traditional mount which
would be more drilling required but that is

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.730
more permanent
Installation.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.890
You also have the temporary mounting bracket,
which is

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.840
very common for those who do not tow too often.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.440
Easy snaps right in.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.642
You bolt this part underneath the dash.

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:43.090
And it can swivel and you are
are ready to go.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.430
When you are not towing, you just unhook it,
place it

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:58.090
in the bag and store it in your locked glove
box or take it inside with

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.090
you.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.329
Our first option we will go through is the
menu button on the P3.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.530
You
have display, brake type and help.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.460
Click on display you can change the
brightness, color and the contrast.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.370
Scroll through some of the colors
here.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.910
This is a good feature if you have the brake
controller mounted

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.860
higher on the dash, where you can see it while
towing and at night you

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.350
do not want something bright in your eyes.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.000
You can change to whatever
color fits your needs.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.320
Our 2nd option is the brake type.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.790
this controller supports electric
Brakes as well as electric over hydraulic.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.830
Just press the okay button,
if you want hydraulic brakes or electric just

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.370
hit okay and confirm and
you are ready to go.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.870
Tee “H” on the bottom left shows you are
signify for

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.390
electric over hydraulic.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.640
GO back we can change that back to electric,
confirm again.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.510
Now it has the E on there to show we have
the electric

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.510
setting.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.180
Next button we will be looking at is at the
top right and this is the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.840
Boost feature.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.200
What this does is it changes the initial amount
of

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.200
braking pressure.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.610
So level is 13 percent, level 2 is 25 % above
normal

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.310
and level 3, the most aggressive is 25% above
normal and then keep

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.270
going through as a more aggressive braking
pressure.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.640
The last set up here is on the left side you
have these up and down

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.640
arrows.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.750
What this will do is, this will set the maximum
output to the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.450
trailer brakes.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.630
The goal of this is to prevent locking up
the trailer

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.730
tires with the brakes when you are at a really
high brake pressure

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.280
situation.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.240
You just set this and we are going down in
voltage and that

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.330
is less pressure and now we are going up and
this is more pressure.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.690
Tekonsha gives a guide that is included with
the P3 on how to set this

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.690
amount.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.910
Another great feature is the ability to save
the settings if you have

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.530
more than one trailer.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.200
You see this T1 at the top left go ahead and
set

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.100
the setting here, your max output and your
boost level.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.260
You want to
press and hold the boost button for 2 seconds,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.040
set the trailer you want
the settings to be saved to and now you are

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.900
on trailer 1.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.850
If you wanted
to pull-up a different option.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.680
Just press and hold the boost button for
2 seconds and select the 2nd trailer and hit

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.840
okay, you are now on
trailer number 2.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.760
One of the safety features on the P3 is the
ability to self-diagnose

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.790
the trailer continuously while driving.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.600
I'll give a quick example of
that.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.240
So I disconnected the blue wire that will
run the brakes from the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.330
vehicle to the trailer.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.260
So now no trailer is connected to the brakes
and it will flash red.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.080
Let’s plug it back in.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:02.510
Let’s say you had a ground
Connection go loose, it will show you that

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.700
as well.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.120
It will also show
you if the trailer brake are being overloaded

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.879
as well as if any other
disconnect in the electrical system.
