00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.920
Tanks are 4 years old.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.440
We don't plan to stop.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.200
16.000 players played our game four years ago,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.080
now more than a million plays our game simultaneously.

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:21.480
World of Tanks is present on every continent,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.000
players from more than 220 countries play the game.

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:29.840
Initially we made the game so

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.000
that it would be interesting for ourselves.

00:00:33.413 --> 00:00:37.600
Currently every games expo in the world has World of Tanks representation.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.506
The project is not just a game now, it's a cultural phenomenon.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.413
During these 4 years

00:00:48.413 --> 00:00:54.306
we released more than fifty game updates for different regions.

00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.640
We recently added new and improved models of tanks.

00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:02.440
We have more than three hundred tanks in the game.

00:01:03.213 --> 00:01:07.826
Now we re-work the landscape and vegetation display.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.026
More than 40 maps.

00:01:10.026 --> 00:01:12.626
We took great effort for

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:15.000
visualizing physical damage.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.466
This is so called Havok.

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:22.906
We added many interesting gameplay features.

00:01:23.453 --> 00:01:28.440
We'll add physical tanks' motion, turnarounds.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.826
We'll continue making historical maps,

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:35.960
like the liked Kharkov map.

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:45.026
Thanks to our users we are a member of Guinness Book of Records.

00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:47.653
Our project has hundreds of awards.

00:01:47.653 --> 00:01:49.653
Among the most prestigious ones - 

00:01:49.653 --> 00:01:52.973
surely, two game "Oscars" - the Golden Joysticks,

00:01:52.973 --> 00:01:56.093
Runet award, European game awards,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.973
Dice industrial award.

00:01:58.706 --> 00:02:02.293
In January 2014 we set a record.

00:02:02.653 --> 00:02:06.613
1.114.000 players played simultaneously on our servers.

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:10.013
These awards are not just our merit,

00:02:10.013 --> 00:02:13.906
but also a merit of our users, that we would like to thank.

00:02:20.746 --> 00:02:23.666
When we created the game we didn't even think it would 

00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:25.480
be an e-sports discipline.

00:02:25.706 --> 00:02:29.320
But the number of tournament participants and the tournaments themselves

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.266
increased and it was clear - e-sports is crucial.

00:02:34.146 --> 00:02:37.586
"Ural Steel" was the first tank e-sports event.

00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:41.000
This was a serious international tournament

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.013
that gathered numerous teams from 32 countries.

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:49.373
Communication with the players is one of the most important parts of our work.

00:02:49.373 --> 00:02:52.960
We held more than a hundred meetings with our players during the passed year.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.506
We launched our own Wargaming League.

00:02:55.653 --> 00:02:58.973
Recently we held the Grand Finals in Warsaw.

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:05.320
About thirty thousand teams tried to get to the finals,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.213
and that means more than two hundred thousand players worldwide.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.906
But only the best made it to the finals.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.290
More than 2 million people watched the tournament all over the world.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.826
As well as tens of thousands live in Warsaw.

00:03:27.413 --> 00:03:30.400
All feedbacks are accounted for.

00:03:30.706 --> 00:03:33.866
We work them through and try to make them happen.

00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:38.133
The players greatly helped us create the "Stronghold" game mode.

00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:40.040
Because the clans requested something 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.093
different from Clan Wars for a long time.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.906
Apart from meeting our players in real life,

00:03:44.906 --> 00:03:48.653
we also host a lot of events on our servers.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.333
Numerous in-game events are held that are

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:54.333
linked to historical events.

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:57.853
It's really important for us and our players

00:03:57.853 --> 00:03:59.506
to remember our history and be proud of it.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.666
In the end of 2013 we initiated and launched the "Remember all" project.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:14.520
Last December we helped lift the KV-1 tank,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.826
that spent 70 years on the bottom of the Don river.

00:04:19.466 --> 00:04:22.080
We help many museum complexes,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.080
like the "Prokhorovskoye Field",

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.880
the Central Museum of Armed Forces of Russian Federation.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.626
Many of our players took part in different initiatives,

00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:34.733
like restoring the memorial complex in Medyn in Kaluga region.

00:04:35.786 --> 00:04:39.106
Specially for May 9th we prepared a documentary project

00:04:39.106 --> 00:04:41.106
that filmed veterans

00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:44.613
that told about their military fate and their way to victory.

00:04:51.573 --> 00:04:53.506
The tanks became a hit only thanks to you.

00:04:53.973 --> 00:04:57.200
We thank our users for support,

00:04:57.573 --> 00:05:02.786
their participation in all the activities we organize.

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:03.813
Dear players!

00:05:04.626 --> 00:05:05.960
Thank you for being there.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.840
Thank you for your numbers.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.053
Thank you for staying with us.

00:05:10.426 --> 00:05:14.693
Our main content are risky tank battles,

00:05:15.226 --> 00:05:17.426
that we create together with you

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.533
and that bring great pleasure to us all.

00:05:23.146 --> 00:05:23.840
Thank you!
