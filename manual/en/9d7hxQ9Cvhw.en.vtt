00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.300
Hey everyone.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.430
I'm Mindy from Cute
Girls Hairstyles

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.170
and today I'm going
to show you how

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.210
to do the bow braid on yourself.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.100
So lots of you've asked after we
posted the last bow braid video

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.200
how you do it on yourself,
and in particular we

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.640
got a lot of comments
on the headband.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.880
So I'm going to show you how
to do the headband version.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.210
So I have started
already by just

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.090
doing the headband
part of my hair.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.760
Now just for a little
bit more grown up

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.810
look which I
personally like better,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.780
doesn't matter you can
do whatever you want,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.600
but I opted not to take
the headband all they way

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.530
starting by my left ear.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.259
I decided to start
the braid right here

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:46.300
where my part line is and
then just bring it over

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.810
to my right ear.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.610
So it left a little more curl
here and not so slicked back,

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.190
but you can do
whatever you want.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.320
So after you get this
all French braided

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.780
and you put in in an elastic--
I have one that just matches

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.610
my hair color, you can see
right there by my ear--

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.360
then you're going to kind
of pull your hair back.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.340
And where that part
is from the braid

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.010
I'm going to just switch
my little rat tooth

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.580
comb around here.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.350
And I'm going to do kind of
a secondary part like so.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.860
And you can-- wow, that was
a really good one actually.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.000
That's pretty much
all the hair I needed.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.360
So you don't need too much hair.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.280
And don't worry, like here I
can see that it doesn't quite

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.610
match up perfectly,
it doesn't matter

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.726
because ultimately that hair
is going to fall forward

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:34.350
and it's going to
hide the part anyway.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.148
So I'm going to take this,
pull it out of the way

00:01:39.148 --> 00:01:41.410
and then we are going to begin.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.880
So we need to pick up--
my personal preference

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.680
is I don't want bows like
right here on top of my head.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.329
I did that one day and it was
OK, but it wasn't my favorite.

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.370
So I'm going to actually
start my bows like right

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.630
here, kind of right above
the point of my eyebrow

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.590
and do a few going down.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.470
So take a small
section of the hair.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.790
And I'm going to just
use a little hairspray.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.020
I'm using today Touchable
Finish hairspray by Suave.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.840
And it is the lightweight hold,
which actually holds really

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.670
well.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.120
And I'm really digging on
the Suave professionals

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.060
line of stuff lately.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.590
So I'm going to start
maybe right here.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.057
So I'm going to go through
the loop with my hair pin.

00:02:27.057 --> 00:02:28.640
Now with the section
of hair I'm going

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.520
to create a loop with my finger.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.770
And I'm going to slide
it through the hairpin

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.830
and then hang onto that with my
finger here so I have that loop

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.670
and just pull it
through like so.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.380
And we have our
first little bow.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.010
OK.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.530
You can see that my hair, the
ends actually work really well,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.140
the length of my hair does, just
because the ends end perfectly

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.070
with the bow.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.830
But if they don't just pull
them into the next bow down,

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.000
it doesn't matter.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.740
There's lots of ways
to hide the ends.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.823
Or don't worry about them
and just leave them out.

00:03:11.823 --> 00:03:16.340
A little bit of hairspray,
take the hairpin,

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:26.560
go through the next section
of hair, make your loop,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.090
take it through.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.310
That's the hardest part,
I swear, right there.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.912
Give it a tug back
and forth a little bit

00:03:35.912 --> 00:03:37.495
until you get the
perfect looking bow.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.250
Once you've got it don't
be afraid to tug it

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.630
if you need to, situate
it the way you want to.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.420
And go down to the next loop.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.710
OK, so I did do--
the other day I

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.660
tried the Katniss
version on my hair.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.783
And I could do it just fine
with a good mirror, you know,

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:05.390
to see the back of my head so
I could see what I was doing.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.120
But my hair just wasn't quite
long enough to make good loops

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.390
once I pulled it all the way
back into the Katniss braid.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.080
So, just FYI, you're going to
need a little bit longer hair

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.190
than I have to do
the Katniss one.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.950
OK, there's another loop.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.320
And I think I've got
enough hair for one more.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.480
Same thing, just going
to take hairspray.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.780
This is just to help control
the fly aways a tiny bit.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.325
Go through the loop like so.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.600
Tug it till you likey.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.020
OK.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.620
I'm going to give
that one-- they're

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.450
kind of wanting to
twist anyway so I'm just

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.408
going to go ahead and
give them a little twist.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.270
So there.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.770
When you get it
fixed up the way you

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.850
like it then release
the rest of the hair.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.930
And I'm just going to make sure
I have one piece fall forward

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.230
just to kind of hide
that band right there.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.450
And viola.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.760
Add a little spray,
hold it in place.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.890
And you're good to go.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.890
I have, you could
even take if you

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.280
wanted to here a
little piece of hair

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.380
and just tuck that
rubber band even more in.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.240
But it really hides
so well in my hair

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.750
I'm not going to worry about it.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.000
So there you have it.

00:05:37.654 --> 00:05:39.570
I'll show you, you can
see what it looks like.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.285
And I'll turn all the way
around so you can see.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.260
Plus it just gives me an
excuse to swivel on the chair.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.100
So I hope you enjoy.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.637
Have fun experimenting with it.

00:05:54.637 --> 00:05:56.970
Please send me pictures, stick
them on my Facebook page.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.469
I love to see what you guys
have done, different ways you've

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:01.220
come up with to try
out the bow braid.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.120
See you later.
