00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:19.449
Look!

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:20.560
Up in the sky!

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.380
Is it a Quantity Surveyor?

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.130
Is it a Church Warden?

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.130
NO!

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.300
IT’S HAMSTER THURSDAY!

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.989
Where I, TJ, take you through a slew of old
Hamster-related Game Boy games, mostly in

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.480
Japanese, because my homegirl Felicity in
Worcestershire just dropped a BOMB on me.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.629
A bomb made of HAMSTERS.

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.449
And we start with Hamster Paradise, where
you raise a hamster!

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.310
In paradise!

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.840
All with the ultimate goal of breeding the
MIRACLE HAMSTER.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.469
A HAMSTER THAT WILL NEVER DIE.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.840
It’s cute, fuzzy, Game Boy Color eugenics
at its finest, screw what those Pokemon fans

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.230
have to say.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.019
Just look at the cuteness!

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.400
… okay.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.110
So maybe these kinds of games make a whole
lot more sense in Japan, where spaces are

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.940
smaller and pet resources more expensive.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.970
Let’s face it, if you can buy your kid a
video game to simulate the experience, and

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.320
not have to obtain the animal and a cage and
bedding and food and food and food and sunflower

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.329
seeds, wouldn’t you?

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.310
It’s an obvious choice.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.290
So, confined to my Gamecube, Sando here lives
out her hamster-y existence.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.390
She drinks.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.490
She wanders around.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.150
She defecates.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.649
She engages in a wheel-running minigame.

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.250
She engages in a ladder-climbing minigame.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.190
She explores the room, if I deign to let her
out of her pink, heart-patterned prison.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.719
She chews up my copy of Hamlet, thus guaranteeing
that I’m going to fail my entrance exams

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.020
and be subject to a lifetime of ridicule.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.020
She doesn’t care.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.690
She knows she’s just a stepping stone in
this joker’s master plan to biologically

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.790
engineer the perfect hamster, and she’s
going to go kicking and screaming.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.509
Or just rolling around on her back and being
cute.

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.539
One of the two.

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.860
One in-game day is only a couple minutes,
so there’s no Pokemon-second-gen real-time

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.400
clock to worry about.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.910
Nope, you get to dote on your hamster all
you want during that time, brushing it, feeding

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.840
it, tending to its every whim, making it defy
gravity, and injecting it with various off-brand

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.980
pharmaceuticals whenever it magically develops
an icepack on its head.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.730
I’d love to know exactly who makes those,
who manufactures icepacks so small, but I

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.450
get the feeling it’s THIS *******. Yes,
because every Game Boy game needs some professor

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.200
to place into the hands of a complete n00b
his life’s dream in eugenics research.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.180
Both he, and his distressingly perky assistant,
can take a powder.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.400
I don’t need their hegemony in my care and
feeding of this assemblage of bits that resembles

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400
a hamster.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.670
WE’RE GOING TO BREAK FREE, SANDO AND ME.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.870
TO CLIMB INTO FLOWERPOTS, OR TO FASHION THIS
COPY OF HAMLET INTO A SLIDE.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.830
TO HECK WITH YOUR NUMBERS AND YOUR METRICS
AND YOUR DATA!

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.420
Wait, what the heck am I saying?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.430
I think the sunflower seed fumes have been
getting to me.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.099
Tune in next week for another HAMSTER THURSDAY,
when hopefully I’ll be in a better-ventilated

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:18.459
room!
