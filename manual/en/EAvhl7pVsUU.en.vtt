Hey, Coach Rudy, Big Ten alumni. Let's talk
about the 5-3. This is what we ran at the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:15.200
school I played for. This is a very, very
good defense for a team that doesn't have

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.260
any defined superstars, a team that plays
well together. Everyone flies to the ball.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.609
Everyone believes in each other and honors
their commitments. Let's talk about the responsibilities.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.719
Again, you've got the "Mike" and the "Will"
taking care of the gaps coming off the defensive

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.999
line. We're shaded inside to the gap. On the
outside, we're on the gap on the defensive

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:49.420
front. We're cover 3 behind, which means corners
have to play run support. So they start at

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:57.909
six, seven yards and as the wide receivers
break down that cushion, right, the defensive

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.709
backs have to have peripheral vision. They
have to be able to look forward and see outside

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:06.790
the corner of their eyes. They've got to be
able to see in the backfield, right, while

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.700
making sure that the receiver, they have to
know what the receiver is doing in front of

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.420
them. If he's stopping to block or if he's
trying to go around him or whatever is happening,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.820
but noting that it's not a fake. It's definitely
a running play, coming up to make the tackle

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.920
that's coming up on your side. Or it's a fake.
It's definitely a pass play, getting out in

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.361
pass coverage, right, and playing the particular
technique that you need to play in order to

00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:39.500
make a play. All right. So we've got the "Mike"
linebacker. His options are that way, that

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.930
way, that way, that way. The "Will" linebacker;
that way, that way, this way, and this way.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.030
You've got "Sam" who's in the gap between
the defensive end and the corner. So that's

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.050
a traditionally defense to stop anything that's
going out into that gap. So "Sam" is going

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.010
to break all that stuff up and keep an eye
on the tight end releasing. Anything out of

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.370
the backfield, that's all that. 5-3 is a good
defense to run against a team who has a strong

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:14.260
running game and a decent passing game. It's
a decent defense to run on a team that throws

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.829
the ball. I'd recommend it in conjunction
with some other defenses. For a team that

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.019
primarily throws the ball, 5-3 is not the
best defense. But for a team that mixes it

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.021
up, it's the one you want to go with.
