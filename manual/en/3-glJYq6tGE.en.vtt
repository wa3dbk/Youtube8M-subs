00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.450
How did you come to be involved in the student
project symposium?

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.670
So, I have actually presented this research
at another, similar conference: the NSERC

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.580
undergraduate student fair.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.500
And so I saw - I had seen this thing - the
symposium - advertised and it seemed like

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.869
a really good opportunity to present my research
and get involved in that sort of thing.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.590
So, really it was through the publicity of
the USSU that I discovered it and found out

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.420
about it and was able to become involved.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.490
Do you know have others could be involved
in this in the future?

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:47.030
It's definitely talking to your department,
getting involved in different research and

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.409
really just signing up and putting your project
out there.

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:55.600
I think letting people know all the different
projects that you can do at this university.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.730
Could you briefly describe for me your project?

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.610
Ok, so my project is in theoretical computer
science, so I'm looking at the borderline

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.760
between math and computer science, in particular
here I was looking at the different ways you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.700
can use computers to help kind of prove different
theorems and prove different things about

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.040
math and with the different ways that you
can interweave letters of different words,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.820
different strings of zeros and ones.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.600
It's something called the shuffle operator.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.990
So I was looking at the properties of that
and trying to explore something that really

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.020
we don't have a lot of knowledge about right
now.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.229
So what did you ultimately find out?

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:42.450
Ultimately, I was able to discover about 40
patterns I'll call them that words of this

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.570
shuffle operator always follow.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.119
By discovering these patterns, I was able
to classify the different words and speed

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.219
up techniques for determining things which
before had been really slow.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.479
So what people or departments did you work
with while doing this project.

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.979
So, my supervisor is Ian McQuillan with the
Department of Computer Science and I definitely

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:15.220
worked entirely with the Department of Computer
Science through the NSERC program in particular,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.390
which is a really good way for students to
let me do research as my summer job.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.799
Could you just tell us what NSERC stands for?

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:24.799
Oh, sorry.

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.950
NSERC is, I think, National Science and Engineering
Research Council.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.400
So they do a lot of funding for different
research projects in the sciences and engineering,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.650
and in particular they have an undergraduate
scholarship that lets a students even as young

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.410
as first year do summer research and work
with a professor.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.849
So, from doing this project, how do you think
this has inspired your future aspirations

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.150
or career goals?

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.799
The project has definitely inspired me to
do more in research, right?

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.769
Computer science in particular is often very
industry-focused and I've really discovered

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:08.209
how much I enjoy finding new knowledge, finding/creating
things and discovering things which really

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.549
literally no person has ever understood before.

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:19.870
So, definitely the classes you take in school
are very much focused on fulfilling your particular

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.879
goal or solving a problem that somebody gives
to you and I think that this has enabled me

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:31.500
to realize that how much I enjoy creating
something totally new instead of trying to

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.170
fulfill some goal or meet a requirement.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.550
How do you think this experience is more valuable
than a regular classroom experience?

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:50.640
Like I said, it's really valuable at showing
you how to do something entirely creative

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.610
instead of just meeting a requirement/doing
an assignment.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.720
You're actually finding new things and, in
particular, being undirected.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.760
It's learning how to - because there is no
right answer, there is no way for you to go.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.829
Nobody's telling you how to solve this problem
because nobody has solved it before.

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.250
And so I think it's really good at teaching
students how to direct their own research

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.810
and how to discover new things on their own.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.970
So that's the skill which you can apply in
so many different ways.
