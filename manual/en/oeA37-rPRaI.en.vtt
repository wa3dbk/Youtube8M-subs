Ok next we are going to do lunch. Today we
are going to make a southwest turkey wrap

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.980
and I do want to remind you all that the three
recipes I’m doing today are all part of

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.770
the tipsheet you got this week so can look
on there and see the calories and grams of

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.080
fat for each recipe. Like I said I’m going
to do a southwest turkey wrap. Now if you

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.050
are a vegetarian and you don’t eat turkey
you can just leave that out. But we are gonna

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.450
start as I said I’ve kind of predone the
beginning stuff. What this is is fat free

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.280
sour cream three table spoons and two table
spoons of salsa and I’m gonna use this the

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.299
kind of condiment instead like mayonnaise
on the wrap. This is a whole wheat wrap and

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:11.770
it actually has 100 calories only for this
big wrap and 3 grams of fat and 13 grams of

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.860
fiber which is about half of your daily fiber
which is great. You want to be really careful

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.960
when looking for wraps such as this one or
tortillas. You really need to read the label

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.030
because a lot of them ones even half the size
can have almost double the calories of this

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.030
one and some have no fiber and some have partially
hydrogenated oil which is the transfat that

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.530
you don’t want. So you really do want to
read the label. So as you can see I have spread

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.609
some of this mixture onto the wrap. And I’m
going to set this aside. I like to use this

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:46.140
for actually dipping during eating. So you
can set that aside. Next we are going to put

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.909
some turkey on here. I have some really little
slices that are prepackaged but if you get

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.039
turkey from the deli counter they may be bigger
so you may only need like two slices. So you’ll

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:05.439
see we have the turkey on here now. I’m
gonna add some black bean and corn mixture.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.580
This is 1/3 cup of black beans and ¼ cup
of corn. And these are both canned products.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.800
They are really convenient. The only thing
you want to be careful of is the added salt.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.670
So when you open the cans you want to put
them in a strainer and you want to rinse them

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.990
with water to get the some of the salt removed.
You can also look for some of these products

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.850
I know the corn I bought has no salt added
so you can also find those products as well.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:39.330
So you are just gonna kinda sprinkle this
on however you want here and next what we

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.190
are going to do is add some avocado in here.
Now avocado is a great choice instead of cheese

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.240
for example because it does have fat in it
but it has the healthy fats the monounsaturated

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.790
fats and it can give a great creamy texture
to your sandwiches. So to cut an avocado you

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.530
want to start in the middle and cut around
it and there is a big pit in the middle of

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.970
one for those of you who have not one before.
So you are going to cut all the way around

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.120
it and then after you are done cutting around
it you are going to twist it and then you

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.340
have it open like this. So the thing about
an avocado as I said it has healthy fat but

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.560
it does still have a fair amount of fat in
it. So today we are going to use about and

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:34.080
1/8 of an avocado which is about 5 grams of
fat. So this is about a ¼ and this is about

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.320
and 1/8. Ok so what we are going to do is
you are just going to take away that 1/8 part

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.640
and set that aside and you are going to slice
that very very thin and just kind of lay it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.690
in the center of the wrap you are not going
to spread this all the way out since you don’t

00:03:50.690 --> 00:04:05.430
have much to work with. Ok like so .And a
lot of people say that they don’t have any

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.970
way to store an avocado and it gets brown.
But the best thing you can do is get a baggie

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.850
and put the rest of the avocado in there and
sprinkle some lime juice or lemon juice on

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.881
the make sure that all the air is out of the
ziplock bag and you will be able to save it

00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:33.670
for a few days. Next we are going to sprinkle
this with some shredded lettuce OK. And then

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.969
the toughest part is probably rolling this
and getting it to form into a sandwich. So

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:42.980
were going to want to take this and you may
loose some ingredients out of the side so

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.740
you want to just shove them back in. As you
can see this is a big big sandwich and actually

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:56.111
it’s only about 360 calories or so and 10
grams of fat. But if you cut it in half you

00:04:56.111 --> 00:05:01.800
are only getting about half that so half of
it is only about 185 calories and you can

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.310
see after you’ve cut it you got all those
yummy ingredients right in there like I’ve

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.379
said you can use this other sauce for dipping
and you’ll just dip it in here and Ill talk

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.240
the first bite. It’s good. Thanks guys.
