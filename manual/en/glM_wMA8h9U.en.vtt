00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.990
We are here today in this fabulous little
bathroom to talk about how to toilet train,

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.960
that is train your cat to use a human toilet.
Now this process can take months so you want

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.049
to be sure that you can have a dedicated bathroom
that you can have your cat use. So what we

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.060
have done here is we start out by putting
the litter box on the ground right next to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.420
the toilet. So you are going to want to get
your cat used to using the litter box in this

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.170
little room next to the toilet. There is a
product that you can use that you can add

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.590
to the, an herbal product, an herbal additive
that you can add to the litter box that will

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.670
help attract the cat to the litter box that
can be an added benefit as you move through

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.829
the phases. You want to move through this
phase very slowly and you want to make sure

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.260
that the litter box is stable at all times.
So we start out by just raising it just a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.210
little bit. The idea is that we are going
to raise it more and more and more until it

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.170
is at the same level as the toilet. As it
gets taller you may want to duct tape your

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.560
old magazines or books together just to make
sure that it is real stable because the last

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.551
thing that you want is to have the litter
box slide anywhere or fall. You are going

00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:19.150
to want to have some sort of step stool just
to make it easier for the cat to get up there

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.139
and not have to make a lot of really calculated
jumps. You want to make sure that the box

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:27.749
is secure so the cat is not going to end up
tipping it over or anything. You may want

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:34.219
to use a slightly smaller box. It may actually
take you a while to get the cat from the point

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.409
that they are down on the the floor using
the litter box to where they are actually

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.469
up on the top of the toilet using the litter
box. This is going to take a different amount

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:46.270
of time for every cat and you may find that
it gets up there and they are kind of like

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.539
not so interested in using the toilet up there
and then you may have to lower it again and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.520
start building up to the top of the toilet
again or you may have a cat that is really

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.909
fine with doing it. You are going to life
the lid. Now there is a product you can buy

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:08.150
that actually fits right into the toilet here
that has, starts out with no hole and it gets

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.930
a bigger and bigger and bigger hole. It is
basically a litter box that is fitted into

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.909
the toilet and the idea is that you start
with no hole, get the cat used to sort of

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.680
perching its paws on the seat and pooping
into the litter box and it can scratch around

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.959
and stuff and then the very first step is
to open up that hole a little bit so that

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.460
you can see the water come through and that
is where the real decisive moment comes. Your

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.579
cat may be like there is no way I'm using
that and then you may want to take a step

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.709
back and go back to using the litter box.
You may also want to keep your eye out whenever

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.230
you see the cat using that. You may want to
give it a treat, give it copious praise. It

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.659
is kind of like potty training a child. So
you are going to have that little hole. You

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.680
want to be sure that you are using a litter
that is flushable because you will get litter

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.250
that falls through into the water and you
don't want it to clog up your plumbing. So

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.799
you have your flushable litter. You have your
basin and then you have your little hole.

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.790
If your cat is comfortable with that little
hole which is a big stopping point for a lot

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.400
of cats, then you can start making the hole
a little bigger, a little bigger, a little

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.030
bigger and basically the idea is, and you
can use a little, pick up something at the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.790
hardware store to line the inside of the hole
so the litter doesn't fall right through but

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.030
as it gets bigger and bigger the goal is to
get it big enough so that there is just a

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.359
little bit of litter on the outside and then
there is no litter at all. The cat is just

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.379
perched on the toilet and pooping right into
the toilet.
