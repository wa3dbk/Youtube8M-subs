00:00:01.198 --> 00:00:04.132
-[Orange babbling]

00:00:04.132 --> 00:00:05.473
Hel-lo, Minecraft.

00:00:05.473 --> 00:00:07.423
Whoa! Look at me!

00:00:07.423 --> 00:00:10.028
I'm a real blockhead!
[laughs]

00:00:10.028 --> 00:00:11.463
Hey, hey! Who are you?

00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:13.061
-Uh, I'm Steve.

00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:14.368
-Don't take this the wrong way,
Steve,

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:16.971
but you kind of look like a square.
[laughs]

00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:20.200
-Ha. Good one.
Haven't heard that before.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.682
-So, I'm new here.

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:24.523
Can you show me
around the "block"? [laughs]

00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:25.381
-Wow, cool.

00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:28.093
One square and two block jokes
in less than ten seconds.

00:00:28.093 --> 00:00:29.606
What are you, some kind of griefer?

00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:31.888
-Grief her? I didn't even know her.
[laughs]

00:00:31.888 --> 00:00:34.724
-[scoffs]
I am out of here.

00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:37.830
-Wait, wait. I'll "roll" with you.
[laughs]

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.922
[boing-boing-boing-boing]

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:41.247
-Why are you following me?
-I don't know.

00:00:41.247 --> 00:00:43.819
Why are you punching that tree?
-I am mining wood.

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:46.408
You're very welcome to
stop being useless and help me.

00:00:46.408 --> 00:00:48.685
-Well, I would,
but I don't have any hands.

00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:51.650
Or arms. Or legs.
[laughs]

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.942
-Are you some kind of
noob or something?

00:00:53.942 --> 00:00:57.050
-I'm not a noob. I'm a cube.
[laughs]

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.139
-You're not going to be
able to mine anything, are you?

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:00.075
-Ah, who cares?

00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:03.136
None of it's "mine," anyway.
[laughs]

00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:05.886
-Look, I don't think you know
what kind of danger you're in.

00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:07.484
This is Minecraft, buddy.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.332
Before the sun sets, you need to
get wood, make sticks,

00:01:10.332 --> 00:01:13.523
make planks, craft a crafting table,
make tools, mine stone,

00:01:13.523 --> 00:01:17.329
and build a house. Otherwise,
the Creepers will eat you alive.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.640
-[singing]:
Jeepers creepers

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.650
Where'd you get those peepers

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.275
Jeepers creepers

00:01:24.275 --> 00:01:26.564
Where'd you get those eyes
[laughs]

00:01:26.564 --> 00:01:28.145
-What the--
who are you talking to?

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:29.313
-This square sheep.

00:01:29.313 --> 00:01:31.887
He has weird-looking eyes.
[laughs]

00:01:31.887 --> 00:01:35.425
[demonic music plays]
Weird... square... eyes.

00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:37.005
-Dude, wow.

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:39.278
You are ANNOYING.

00:01:39.278 --> 00:01:40.682
Good luck, griefer.

00:01:40.682 --> 00:01:42.710
-Ah, poor Steve has
anger management issues.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.346
He should really "block" out some
time with his therapist. [laughs]

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:50.355
-Phew, finished the house
just in time before nightfall.

00:01:50.355 --> 00:01:52.976
I kinda feel bad about
not helping that orange fellow.

00:01:52.976 --> 00:01:55.971
Oh well, he'll respawn and learn.

00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:59.153
I'll just make myself a snack in the
kitchen before I hit the sack and--

00:01:59.153 --> 00:02:00.073
Whoa!!

00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:01.827
-Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, Steve!

00:02:01.827 --> 00:02:03.651
-Dude,
what are you doing in my house?

00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:05.752
-Hey, hey, Steve, hey!
-What?!

00:02:05.752 --> 00:02:09.044
-"Orange" you glad you built us
a Minecraft kitchen? [laughs]

00:02:09.044 --> 00:02:10.260
-"Us"?
-Yeah,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.431
I'm actually not a green block,
though. I'm a--

00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:13.412
-Square-Pear!

00:02:13.412 --> 00:02:14.815
-I hope you don't mind
that we brought our friends.

00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:16.516
-Yeah, thanks a bunch, Stevereno!

00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:18.013
-Yay! I love being a block

00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:20.666
full of loving gooey
marshmallowy goodness! Yay!

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:23.338
-We really appreciate you
saving us from the mobs out there.

00:02:23.338 --> 00:02:26.032
-The mobs out there?
What about in here?

00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:28.580
-Hey! Hey, Steve! Hey! Hey, Steve!

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.886
-Don't want to hear it, griefer. You
and your friends have got to go.

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:35.240
-Steve, hey!
-I said I don't wanna hear it!

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.815
I built every part of this house
on my own.

00:02:37.815 --> 00:02:40.390
Laid every stone,
every piece of wood.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.554
Made every doorway to second.

00:02:42.554 --> 00:02:44.098
If you guys don't have hands,

00:02:44.098 --> 00:02:45.518
then how did you get in here?

00:02:45.518 --> 00:02:46.532
-The back door was open.

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.045
-Hey, Steve!
-What?

00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:48.860
-Creepers!

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.623
[Creepers snarling,
Steve screaming]

00:02:50.623 --> 00:02:55.470
Whoa! Looks like Steve took it
"square" on the chin! [laughs]

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.232
-[groans] Can we please just go
build something cool?

00:02:58.232 --> 00:02:59.698
-You're ruining it, Square-Pear.

00:02:59.698 --> 00:03:03.571
