I'm trying to up root some of this stuff here.

And also we are going to get rid of some of the main chuncky stones

00:01:20.184 --> 00:01:22.292
so we can put down the turf.

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:28.119
I'm a bit worried about this one.

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.061
It might be the beginning of an oak tree.

00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:31.796
and to be honest I want to get it out now

00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:35.026
because it that is going to be an oak tree later

00:01:35.026 --> 00:01:36.141
thats going to be massive

00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:37.858
and the roots are just going to be chaos.

00:01:37.858 --> 00:01:41.086
So i'll get rid of that.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.696
May be a human skull, or the remains of one.

00:01:48.696 --> 00:01:51.836
So we ought to get that out.

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:03.516
It took some time but we finally got the oak tree out

00:02:03.945 --> 00:02:06.937
We're not going to have any more troubles from this.

00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:12.306

Good afternoon Lambether services this is

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:02.787
This is Amber speaking how can I help?

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:06.609
Hi there? I phoned up last week and

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.534
arranged for our garden waste to be collected
ummm hmmm

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:12.637
It was meant to be collected today,

00:03:12.637 --> 00:03:14.365
the guy said this morning but it hasn't been collected yet

00:03:14.108 --> 00:03:15.297
Sorry

00:03:15.297 --> 00:03:16.882
It hasn't been collected yet.

00:03:17.414 --> 00:03:19.108
Hello?
Hello!

00:03:19.108 --> 00:03:21.593
When was it supposed to be collected?
This morning.

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:24.109
For garden waste?
Yeah

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.358
um well if it's booked in for today it won't necersarilly be this morning

00:03:27.358 --> 00:03:29.233
they've go the whole day to collect it.

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:29.595
Oh right ok.

00:03:29.595 --> 00:03:31.177
It's just the guy said in the morning.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:33.178
No it won't necersarily be in the morning

00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:34.317
They've go the whole day to collect it.

00:03:34.317 --> 00:03:36.690
Right
If by tomorrow, they haven't collected it

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.391
give us a ring back and we can arrange for it to be done.

00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:41.157
But they have go until 6 this evening to do so.
Sure

00:03:41.157 --> 00:03:45.757
Ok no worries. Also can I arrange another collection

00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:48.689
because I've got a lot more waste to go

00:03:49.157 --> 00:03:50.782
I just don't have the right bags for it.

00:03:51.256 --> 00:03:53.212
Is there anything else I can help you with?

00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:55.114
No that's it thanks.

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:57.881
Ok thanks for calling Lambeth service centre
Ok bye bye

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.728
Ok so um....

00:04:07.154 --> 00:04:09.789
Anytime today I gues they will come hopefully.

00:04:10.277 --> 00:04:12.725
But I booked another collection

00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:14.430
because there is a hell of a lot of stuff outside.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.930
Waiting to go.

00:04:18.631 --> 00:04:21.711
Ok it's not 6 o'clock and the council still hasn't

00:04:21.964 --> 00:04:24.287
picked up the waste bag.

00:04:24.287 --> 00:04:26.741
So if it is going to take 4 days to get did of that much rubish

00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:30.494
It is going to take a long time to get through everything

00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:36.152
We might have to resort to some other tactics.
