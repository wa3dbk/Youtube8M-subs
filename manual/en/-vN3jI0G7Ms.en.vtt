00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.810
Porterville City Fire Department has partnered
with Porterville College.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.150
They've developed a great partnership.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.950
All Fire Academy classes are hosted here at
the Fire Station Number Two, with a drill

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.499
ground facility that is five acres, with props
that have been developed to accommodate the

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:23.839
students to be able to hone their skills that
are necessary.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:30.179
Our basic program at Porterville College consists
of two academies, we have a fall Firefighter

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.320
1 Academy, State Fire Marshal accredited Firefighter
1 Academy.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.760
And then in the spring we offer an Inter-agency,
Basic Wildland Firefighter Academy.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.840
We're learning the basics of being a firefighter,
anywhere from pulling the hose off the truck

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.350
to climbing ladders, your tools, there's a
lot of teamwork and camaraderie.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.249
We do some search and rescue stuff, where
they'll black out our vision, we're crawling

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:55.440
on our hands and knees.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.890
We do ladders, we do B.A.s, we do HAZMAT.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.790
All the things that encompass being a firefighter
throughout the valley here, different scenarios.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.520
You know, sweeping rooms for victims, working
along side your buddies just a lot of teamwork

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.340
a lot of fun with everything we do.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.229
The instructors in the Fire Academy are working
professional firefighters.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.490
They bring in their actual experiences while
providing the necessary tools, and mentorship

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.810
if you will, to those in our academy.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.070
The faculty is definitely very helpful, they're
dedicated and they care about you as an individual,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.799
they don't just preach to you as a class,
they do a lot of one on one, especially when

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.149
we do hands on training, they're right there
with you leading you through the steps.

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.200
The Porterville Fire Academy is offered during
weeknights and weekends to accommodate most

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.200
working people.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.540
Our Wildland Academy is conducted on the weekends,
Saturdays and Sundays, for twelve weeks, weekends.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.330
And our Firefighter 1 Academy is done at night,
which is pretty unique, most college academies,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.719
you go 8 to 5, five days a week.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.790
Through Porterville College and the partnership
that we've had, we could say that we've provided

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.290
most of the skills that are necessary for
a cadet to complete the academy.
