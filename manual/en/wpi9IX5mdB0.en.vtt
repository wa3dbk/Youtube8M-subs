00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:10.036
Hi! I’m Mathie from Pintura Facil Para Ti
(easy painting for you) and today I want to invite you 

00:00:10.036 --> 00:00:13.047
to paint with me this lovely drier with tulips

00:00:13.047 --> 00:00:15.256
that I hope you like

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:17.147
We’ll start the work

00:00:17.147 --> 00:00:22.506
transferring the design to the dryer

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:24.676
and also we’ll prepare 

00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:26.897
a dark yellow

00:00:26.897 --> 00:00:28.166
or mustard color

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:31.167
just by mixing yellow with a little brown

00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:35.707
you can also use a sienna color

00:00:35.707 --> 00:00:39.677
with this mustard color and and the “dry brush” technique 

00:00:39.677 --> 00:00:44.817
we’ll paint the background or the dryer.

00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:49.086
puting small quantities of paint in the brush

00:00:49.086 --> 00:00:50.327
wiping it 

00:00:50.327 --> 00:00:53.746
into a napkin to paint the fabric later 

00:00:53.746 --> 00:00:57.497
use small quantities to create shadows

00:00:57.497 --> 00:01:00.937
finishing with the background

00:01:00.937 --> 00:01:03.737
we’ll start with leaves

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:06.557
so let’s mix

00:01:06.557 --> 00:01:08.807
a nice green 

00:01:08.807 --> 00:01:14.087
with yellow, blue and a pinch of red

00:01:14.087 --> 00:01:15.737
to get this nice  green bladder

00:01:15.737 --> 00:01:20.247
with this color we’ll paint the base of each leaf

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:24.497
now, with white and with the green still wet

00:01:24.497 --> 00:01:27.347
we’ll apply the lights

00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:33.327
starting on the leaf midrib and going along it

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:36.867
and blurring towards the end

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:42.317
so we’ll paint from the center to the right and then from the left 

00:01:42.317 --> 00:01:46.557
to the center vertically but never touching the midrib

00:01:46.557 --> 00:01:51.947
in the next step we’ll emphasize volume using shadows

00:01:52.887 --> 00:01:56.347
to do this, we’ll mix yellow and a little black

00:01:56.347 --> 00:02:00.637
to obtain a nice olive green to make shadows

00:02:00.637 --> 00:02:03.087
we’ll apply these shadows 

00:02:03.087 --> 00:02:05.636
along the leaf

00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:10.857
in the opposite areas of lights

00:02:10.857 --> 00:02:14.446
and blur to the center

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:18.536
this way we’ll obtain some natural leaves

00:02:18.536 --> 00:02:22.206
now you can paint all the design leaves this way

00:02:24.146 --> 00:02:29.886
Let’s start painting now the red tulips with deep orange

00:02:29.886 --> 00:02:33.476
that you can obtain mixing red and yellow

00:02:33.476 --> 00:02:35.657
with this deep orange

00:02:35.657 --> 00:02:37.926
or light red

00:02:37.926 --> 00:02:39.187
we’ll paint 

00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:42.267
the tulip base

00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:43.936
Now, with red paint

00:02:43.936 --> 00:02:46.916
we’ll apply some

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.106
vertical shadows

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:53.166
going along the petals from the bottom to the top of them

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:54.946
Now with yellow paint

00:02:54.946 --> 00:03:00.526
we’ll stand out the tulips lighter areas

00:03:01.016 --> 00:03:05.636
we’ll also create many and different colors for the flower

00:03:05.636 --> 00:03:08.566
To create real lights 

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:09.826
on tulips

00:03:09.826 --> 00:03:12.400
we’ll apply some white a hacer

00:03:12.406 --> 00:03:16.976
to highlight the upper edges

00:03:16.976 --> 00:03:22.467
Once finishing with the tulip, we can start painting the stem

00:03:22.467 --> 00:03:28.136
with the same colors we had used for leaves

00:03:28.136 --> 00:03:32.926
To paint yellow tulips the first thing we need

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:37.596
is to mix yellow and a tiny pinch of red to get a cadmium yellow

00:03:37.596 --> 00:03:38.576
with this color

00:03:38.576 --> 00:03:41.116
we’ll paint the base of the flower

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:45.376
as we did with the red tulip, we’ll apply
some verticals 

00:03:45.376 --> 00:03:47.467
with orange

00:03:47.507 --> 00:03:50.356
the same we have used for red tulips

00:03:50.356 --> 00:03:54.137
remember go little by little with this deep orange

00:03:54.137 --> 00:03:59.606
if you put too much, it’ll be hard to blur it well

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:01.366
Now, with white

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:05.656
we’ll apply lights in the uppers borders of the petals

00:04:05.656 --> 00:04:08.427
to create the volume 

00:04:08.786 --> 00:04:13.356
that we need for realistic flowers

00:04:13.356 --> 00:04:14.526
Again

00:04:14.526 --> 00:04:16.247
finishing 

00:04:16.247 --> 00:04:17.646
the yellow tulip

00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:22.427
paint the stem

00:04:22.427 --> 00:04:27.566
with the same indications I explained before. Continue painting all the dryer

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:31.897
trying to alternate the tulip colors

00:04:31.897 --> 00:04:35.316
One finished with all tulips

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:38.346
remember to let’s your work dry very well

00:04:38.346 --> 00:04:40.196
and fix the painting

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:43.157
to last more time and endure 

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:44.927
all the washes a dryer

00:04:44.927 --> 00:04:46.726
needs

00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:51.736
I hope you enjoy painting with me this tulip dryer
