BECAUSE I KNOW YOU LIKE
VEGAN STUFF.

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.533
- THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT.

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.066
- OKAY, SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TWO DISHES:

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.200
SOME BAKED EGGPLANTS,
WHICH WERE GONNA BAKE

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:43.066
WITH, LIKE,
A RATATOUILLE TYPE THING

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.933
WITH EGGPLANTS
AND EVERYTHING IN IT,

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.700
ONIONS, GARLIC,
AND SO ON.

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.866
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA MAKE
SOME PAD THAI NOODLES

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.466
WITH TOFU,
BUT NO CHICKEN IN IT.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.733
NOTHING.

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.500
- I LOVE PAD THAI NOODLES.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.533
NOW, HOW FAR IN ADVANCE
DO YOU DECIDE

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.433
WHAT THE MENU'S GONNA BE
FOR THE ACADEMY AWARDS?

00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.433
- WE DECIDE, LIKE,
A MONTH BEFORE, MAYBE,

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.766
WHAT WE'RE GONNA COOK,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.833
BUT THEN WE ALWAYS FIND
WHAT WE CAN FIND AT THE MARKET.

00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.633
SO REALLY IT'S THE LAST SECOND,
MORE OR LESS.

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.666
- OKAY, LET'S DO SOME STUFF.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.666
- LET'S DO SOME STUFF.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.233
OKAY, LET'S HEAT IT UP.

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.000
- AND WHAT'S THE--DID YOU EVER
HAVE A DISASTER

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:12.000
WHEN YOU WERE COOKING?

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:13.000
- A FEW TIMES.

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:14.000
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST--

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:15.133
- LIKE, HOW MANY--

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.600
YOU'RE FEEDING, LIKE,
1,500 PEOPLE.

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:17.866
- YEAH, 1,500,
1,600 PEOPLE.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.200
SO ONE TIME WE DID IT
AT THE SHRINE AUDITORIUM,

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:22.300
AND IT WAS SO COLD.

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.766
WE HAD OUR KITCHEN
IN THE PARKING LOT.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.100
IT STARTED TO RAIN,

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.600
AND THE GAS FLAMES
DIDN'T COME UP.

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:29.266
AND I WAS MAKING RISOTTO
FOR 1,600 PEOPLE.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.266
- WHAT HAPPENED?

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.666
- WELL, I ALMOST GOT
A HEART ATTACK,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.133
BUT THEN WE HAD TO PUT
ALUMINUM FOIL AROUND THE OVEN,

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.000
SO THAT WAY WE COULD
GET A LITTLE FIRE.

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:39.033
AND NOBODY REALLY--
NO, EVERYBODY KNEW.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.566
BARBARA STREISAND
AND JULIA ROBERTS,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.766
EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY AT THE END.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.033
- WOW.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.733
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S START TO COOK
A LITTLE BIT.

00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:47.466
LET'S--LET'S ADD
A LITTLE AROMATICS IN HERE.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.666
IT'S NICE AND HOT ALREADY.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.666
- WHAT IS THAT?

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.266
- THIS IS ONIONS--
GREEN ONIONS.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.033
- GREEN ONION.

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.500
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD SOME
VEG TO THE GREEN ONIONS

00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:56.766
AND ALSO A LITTLE GARLIC HERE.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.766
WE MADE ONE ALREADY.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.400
HERE WE HAVE OUT VEGETABLES,

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:02.400
SO LOTS OF VEGETABLES.

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:04.866
OKAY, MM, SMELLS GOOD ALREADY.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.233
A LITTLE SALT,
AND HERE WE HAVE RICE NOODLES.

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:08.766
- UH-HUH.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.966
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA
THROW THEM ALL IN HERE.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.600
SO IT'S SO EASY.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.033
ALL RIGHT, YOU--YOU KNOW--

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:16.033
- I'LL DO SOMETHING.

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:17.066
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.200
- WHERE DID THEY PUT
MY EGGPLANTS?

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:21.333
- IS THAT AN EGGPLANT?

00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:22.800
- OKAY.

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:24.266
- IS THIS AN EGGPLANT?

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.266
- THIS IS AN EGGPLANT.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.300
YOU THOUGHT IT SAID TELEPHONE,

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:27.300
BUT IT'S NOT A SAMSUNG, NO.

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:29.400
- OKAY.

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:30.900
- AND NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT IN
A LITTLE HOISIN,

00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:32.100
AND WE'RE GONNA COOK THEM.

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:33.333
- HOISIN?

00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:36.100
YOU KNOW, IT'S--IT'S USED
IN CHINESE FOOD.

00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:39.000
- OH, I WAS--OKAY.
- OKAY.

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:40.933
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAYING
"POISON," AND I SAID--

00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:42.933
- NO, NO, NOT QUITE.

00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:44.700
- AT LEAST YOU'RE BEING HONEST
ABOUT IT.

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:49.033
"I'M PUTTING POISON
IN YOUR FOOD."

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:51.500
ALL RIGHT.
- NOT YET, NOT YET.

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:52.566

NOT YET?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.633

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.600
DID I DO IT?

00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:58.166
- NOW WE PUT IT IN THE OVEN,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.866
AND TAKE IT SO EVERYTHING IS--
AND THEN A LITTLE OLIVE OIL.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.133
- HOW LONG DO YOU BAKE IT FOR?

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:03.300
- UNTIL IT'S NICE AND TENDER,

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:04.633

00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:05.633

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.600
IT'S LIKE TELEVISION.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:20.833
ALL RIGHT, SO WE STIR IT

YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO
DO ANYTHING.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.500
JUST SOAK THEM IN WATER
LIKE THAT.

00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:29.500

HAVE TO BOIL THEM,

00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:34.533
AND THEN THEY JUST MELT HERE.

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:36.400

SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
WITH THEM,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.366
BECAUSE IT IS HOT.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.633

IT'S LIKE A THAI PAPAYA SALAD.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.766
THERE'S A LITTLE SPICE,
BUT IT'S NICE AND CRUNCHY.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.200
- WELL, WHEN YOU SAY
A LITTLE SPICE--

00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:51.200

- IT'S GOOD, HUH?

00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:03.900

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.633
SO YOU HAVE A GOOD--
THE YIN AND THE YANG.

00:05:06.666 --> 00:05:07.933
A LITTLE SPICY AND SWEET,

00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:09.133

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.233
ALL RIGHT, I THINK YOU SHOULD
TAKE A FEW CHILIES HOME,

00:05:20.266 --> 00:05:21.833
AND THEN YOU'LL GET A KICK
