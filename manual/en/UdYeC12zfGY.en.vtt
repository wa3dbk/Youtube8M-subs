00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.860
In this video we will show how to replace
the T-Con board in the Samsung sixty inch

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.540
LED TV.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.110
For these TV models, you will want to replace
your t-con board if your TV is showing the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.610
following symptoms.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.940
The first symptom: If your TV has backlight,
but has no video or picture.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.070
The second symptom: If the video or picture
on the screen fades to all black shortly after

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.800
turning on the TV.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.600
We will now show how to replace the T-Con
board.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.120
I have removed all of the screws from the
back of the TV and removed the back cover.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.489
As you can see, we have three boards.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:11.509
Over here is the main board, here we have
the power supply / LED board.

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.570
Down here we have the T-Con board.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:21.530
We will take a closer look at the T-Con board
and how to remove the board from the panel.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.200
I will start by disconnecting the LVDS cable.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.150
Pinch in on the sides of the connector and
pull back gently away from the board.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.220
Be sure to use caution as this cable is fragile.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.840
Next, I will disconnect the ribbon cables.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.120
First I will flip up this black tab using
my finger and then lift out the ribbon.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.130
Never use a screwdriver or any other tool
to flip up the tab or remove the ribbon.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:57.130
Be sure to use caution as these cables are
fragile.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.929
After I have disconnected the cables from
the T-Con board, I will remove the screws

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:10.179
that hold the board to the TV panel.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:29.569
After I have removed the screws, I can simply
lift the board from the panel.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.120
I will now install my replacement board.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:43.810
I will begin by securing the board to the
panel with the screws.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:54.670
Next, I will reconnect the ribbon cables.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.870
I will make sure the black tab is still flipped
up and then I will line up the ribbon cable

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.319
on the connection.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:10.080
Once it is in place, I will close the tab
to secure the ribbon.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:18.239
Next, I will reconnect the LVDS cable.

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.120
I will again pinch in on the sides of the
connection and then gently push it into place

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.120
on the board.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.879
After we have installed the replacement T-Con
board I will then put the back cover on the

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.439
TV and reinstall the screws to secure it.

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.629
