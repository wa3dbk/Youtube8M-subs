Hello and welcome to mDhil. This season, it's time to play with colors and make yourself very beautiful

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.260
Here are some makeup tips from hair and beauty expert

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.360
swati gupta

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.580
so swati, if we were to show our fans

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:24.700
three interesting tips for this festive season,

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:26.800
when it comes to makeup, what would they be?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.180
the most important aspect when it comes to makeup is the eyes

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.900
I tend to work the most on the eyes; you can

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.280
be very creative, you can try different looks, you can work with different colors,

00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:40.980
you can play so much with it it's not funny and that's what i will try and show you

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.740
to compliment the looks that we are working on with the eyes

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.480
i will give you options you can work with the lips.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.360
in terms of the base and the foundation and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.600
stuff, you try and keep it as

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.120
nude as possible

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:53.440
ready for you to show us!

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.860
Great, perfect. We've already worked a little bit of foundation

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.180
on her. For a day look, I would do

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.700
shadows which are really soft and neutral

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:11.740
working something quite soft in a silverish goldish tint

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.640
so if you're doing very white gold or platinum or diamond kind of jewelry, then you work

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.800
slightly silverish. But if you're doing more antique, so if you're doing a marriage, and you're doing more antique gold or

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.700
very gold-embroidered sari or something like that, then you want more gold-based.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.040
I would do just a shadow as soft as that

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.520
i might if I feel the need to

00:01:33.524 --> 00:01:36.520
top it up with a little hint of color

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.800
I'm giving an example of a pink

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.500
but you can in cases of a brown go with more of a rust, so do very earthy day-tones

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.520
you can do a very very nude

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.860
shadow base, and just work a really interesting glitter on top of it

00:01:50.864 --> 00:01:53.960
it immediately just enhances them

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.420
to me this is a look that can be carried by anyone

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.000
another very very good tip is to just smoke it up a little

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.880
create a little bit of a V in the corner

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.380
If you're doing eyes which are slightly heavy where there's a lot of smoking done,

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.460
I think you should work

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.320
very sheer with the lips

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.400
when I'm doing something so soft I may not even choose to

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.460
line it too much, or make it too heavy in that sense

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.960
it's a very very wet lip kind of look, where you

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.360
you just have lots and lots of gloss

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.040
for the cheek in a look like this, I would again play it very neutral and soft

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.580
so you totally work the angle

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.780
that you're getting once you suck your cheeks in

00:02:39.788 --> 00:02:44.860
Swati, that looks absolutely beautiful. I really like what you did

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.820
And I think it didn't take much time at all.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.100
It didn't, no. 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.840
So there you go, not just three but lots of tips for this season, I hope you get some time to experiment.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.480
