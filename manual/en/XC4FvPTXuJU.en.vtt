[SOUND] This is
the crispy rice and

00:00:05.045 --> 00:00:08.564
it's called tahdig.

00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:09.208
In some places,

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:10.910
it's actually, people
get offended if you

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.658
serve that cuz that means
you ran out of food,

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:14.322
cuz you've reached
the bottom of the pot.

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:19.036
But it's,
it's truly the best.

00:00:19.036 --> 00:00:20.034
Wow, really good.

00:00:20.034 --> 00:00:21.292
Hi, I'm Golari and

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:23.739
this is our guide to
the food of Tehran.

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:29.938
[MUSIC]

00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:31.656
We're going to go to
the old tea houses.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:34.642
Here, it's the different
sweets that are served

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:35.928
with the good old DZ.

00:00:35.928 --> 00:00:40.688
[MUSIC]

00:00:40.688 --> 00:00:43.802
We are right now in the
Grand Bazaar in Tehran.

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:48.367
This is the place where
everybody comes to

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:52.940
buy their spices,
nuts, dried fruits.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.699
About 4 to 5,000
people come to

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.960
this restaurant daily.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.895
This is why the
production line's like

00:00:59.895 --> 00:01:01.659
boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.713
It's a very small space
but just lots of people,

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:05.577
as you can just see in
the bazaar in general.

00:01:05.577 --> 00:01:15.577
[MUSIC]

00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:17.850
We're right now
at a fish farm.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.300
And here they
harvest vulgar fish,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.550
for getting
the caviar out.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.092
So, these
are the two types of

00:01:25.092 --> 00:01:26.710
caviar that
we're gonna try.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.052
[MUSIC]

00:01:32.052 --> 00:01:32.991
It's really nice.

00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:36.531
[MUSIC]

00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:39.168
&gt;&gt; I think we made
you do a lot of work.

00:01:39.168 --> 00:01:40.309
&gt;&gt; Yes!

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:43.965
&gt;&gt; We're gonna visit
a family where they're

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:46.707
gonna cook some
Ghormeh sabzi,

00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:49.252
Iran's oldest
type of stew.

00:01:49.252 --> 00:01:51.667
It just goes through
a whole experience.

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:53.292
Right there in one bite.

00:01:53.292 --> 00:02:00.669
