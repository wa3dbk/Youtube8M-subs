00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.110
The information I’m after here is all about
bees - not just what bees, but how many bees

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.599
are out here in this great big forest.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.220
This is the best trick there is for studying
bees... you put out an attractant that gets

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:40.520
a male bee to come out of the forest and I
count it and measure it and do all my science

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.880
and there are bees coming in already.
When I put out a little bit of the chemical,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.550
the bees come to it thinking ‘I’m in luck!
I’ve found an orchid and I’m going to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.400
collect some of that smell from the orchid,’
because male bees must have this to be successful

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.800
mating with the females.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.440
It’s perfume, if you want!

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.250
But only males get it and they keep it in
the hollow spot in their hind legs, which

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.189
is a very bizarre thing, there aren’t other
bees that do this, just these rare orchid

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:16.880
bees in the tropical forest.
It so happens right here in Panama I have

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.760
the chance to do things that no one has ever
done before. Years ago we used to think in

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.900
the tropics things are very stable. Life just
thrives and everything stays pretty much the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.900
same.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.390
Once we have real information like from these
bees, we see that things go up and down and

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.760
they go up and down in drastic ways.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:45.799
It’s becoming very important in this world
to keep good records on how abundant things

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.979
like bees are because of the very important
work that they do. They pollinate flowers.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.409
They make this forest possible. With no bees
to visit the flowers and move pollen around,

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.409
there’s no seeds, there’s no fruit, there’s
nothing.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.590
This is absolutely the most interesting, fun
activity you can imagine. It’s not work!

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:17.730
It’s creative fun, this feeds me everyday.
It gives me energy, gives me hope, makes me

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:26.871
happy I’m here.
See if anybody’s really there... bees do

00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:35.379
live somewhere. These normally live in trees
but this one happens to be a colony I put

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:43.139
in a nest box like this.
First thing that comes out is pollen. Bees

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.889
have a long and successful relationship with
flowering plants, mostly because of this stuff,

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.129
called pollen. They start with a good food
 - pollen is about 30-40% protein, that’s

00:02:51.129 --> 00:03:01.389
better than steak, it’s also tasty! I’m
not kidding, this is very good.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.091
Every social bee colony is actually a little
information gathering station, if you want

00:03:06.091 --> 00:03:11.790
to think of it that way. These bees fly out
maybe a kilometer away, survey the whole area,

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.090
pick the flowering plants that they can use
and bring the pollen or nectar back to their

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.459
nest. So once you learn to interpret the information
that’s here, which is by identifying the

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.739
pollen that bees have brought in, you know
their ecology completely from A to Z and there’s

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.650
no other way to get that information.
After getting a bee pollen sample out of a

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.219
bee hive I bring it back to our lab at the
tropical research institute and we take that

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:42.849
pollen sample, we wash it, we dress it up,
put it on a microscope slide and then we compare

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.340
it to our known species reference material
on known kinds of pollen grains to figure

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.670
out what that bee’s been up to, what it’s
ecological ties are, what food it eats and

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.709
what it pollinates, basically.

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:06.999
About one in fifty is in perfect condition,
the rest are kind of shredded looking, that’s

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.629
too bad.
If nobody had a chance to take a good, long

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.209
look at bees and what flowers they really
go to and what pollination they really do

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.919
or don’t do, we would have a pretty biased
and inaccurate picture of what they’re about.

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.310
Every bee tells its own story, that’s what
I’ve been finding all the way through this.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.690
And it comes out making me feel a lot better
because I feel we’re a few steps closer

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.440
to finding out how nature really works.
