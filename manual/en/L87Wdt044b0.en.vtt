00:00:13.783 --> 00:00:15.450
SEAN CARROLL (VOICEOVER):
A smooth stone

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.780
is given an edge and the
course of life on Earth

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.090
has changed forever.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.550
This was the first
step on the journey

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.943
to our technological present.

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:29.626
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.230
Though tool use is
not uniquely human,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.990
the sophistication of
our tools, and our degree

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.010
of reliance upon them, sets
us apart from other species.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.820
So, when did human tool
making begin, and why?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.360
And what does it tell us about
the evolution of our ancestors?

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.540
Like fossils, stone
tools can be dated

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.810
by geochemical analysis of the
sediment layer in which they

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.380
were buried.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.290
The oldest yet found, was
in East African sediments

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.260
formed 2.5 million years ago.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.490
The nearly 2-million-year-old
sediments of Tanzania's Olduvai

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.840
Gorge were first made famous
by the thousands of stone tools

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.160
found there by Louis
and Mary Leakey.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.920
Paleontologist Tim
White has access

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.230
to a number of
Olduvai stone tools

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.030
at the University of
California, Berkeley.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.455
Tim, these are actual
tools from Olduvai Gorge.

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:44.080
TIM WHITE: The bottom
of Olduvai Gorge.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.690
SEAN CARROLL: So, these
are 1.8 million years old.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.710
TIM WHITE: That's right.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.620
SEAN CARROLL: And they
were made by someone.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.620
TIM WHITE: That's right.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.037
SEAN CARROLL: But
at first glance,

00:01:52.037 --> 00:01:55.840
you can easily walk past these
and say, they look like a rock.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.650
How do you know this was made
intentionally by somebody?

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.400
TIM WHITE: Well, there
are two reasons you

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.470
know that they're stone tools.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.670
Number one, they're found in
very fine grained lake beds.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.710
There's no way that they
could have gotten there

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.930
by themselves.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.340
And secondly, this sharp
edge and these scars.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.320
Because, as you can see it's
a rounded, water-worn cobble

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.860
that has been broken by repeated
strikes of a hammer stone.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.080
This is called a core.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.300
And what is struck
from the core,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.170
are smaller shards of
rock called flakes.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.610
These kinds of tools are
where technology begins,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.050
stone tool technology designed
to create sharp edges.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.140
And those sharp edges
are used to remove meat

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.808
from large mammal carcasses.

00:02:49.808 --> 00:02:51.350
SEAN CARROLL: The
carcass, like what?

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.030
TIM WHITE: Like a giraffe.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.860
Like a wildebeest.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.010
Large mammals that are a big,
big, rich resource of fat

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.390
and protein for things
like lions or hyenas,

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.980
but never primates.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.840
Primates don't go in the
neighborhood of these carcasses

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.970
because they're also a
very dangerous place.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.310
And for a hominid, without
the speed and agility

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.370
of another carnivore, it
would be basically suicidal.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.920
You'd be becoming a snack.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.300
Unless you can approach the
carcass, remove the tissue,

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.170
and then exploit
the bones for what

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.045
lies inside the fatty marrow.

00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:40.690
SEAN CARROLL: So you have to cut
your way in through the flesh.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.580
And then, how do you
get to the marrow?

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.830
TIM WHITE: You break the bone.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.506
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.710
Primates can't do that
without technology,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.130
so those first hominids
did it the simple way.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.788
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.970
We have bones that have traces
of these cutting activities

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.580
and traces of the
hammering activities.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.920
This is an actual fossil
from Olduvai Gorge.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.940
And it shows that some
hominid impacted the shaft

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.250
with a hammer stone and formed
this scar on the inside.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.600
That is evidence of
access to marrow. .

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.840
And marrow is a really
rich dietary resource

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.010
for these early hominids.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.490
SEAN CARROLL: So the
combination tools, diet,

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.817
and I imagine ingenuity,
brains, a little bit,

00:04:31.817 --> 00:04:33.900
both in terms of what you
need to do to figure out

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.940
when you can go
out after the kill,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.640
cooperating with other hominids.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.410
All that's taking place.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.180
This is becoming a
very different creature

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.860
than its ancestors.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.630
Stone tools are datable evidence
of sophisticated behaviors.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.510
Far more durable than the
bones of their makers,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.400
they reveal a
critical transition

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.310
in the lives of our
early ancestors.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.610
TIM WHITE: These tools
represent an expansion

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.450
of the behavioral capabilities
of these organisms.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.050
They're no longer foraging
for roots and tubers

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.940
and a few fruits in
the trees, they're

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.600
out competing with
carnivores who can eat them.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.850
SEAN CARROLL (VOICEOVER):
That's a very different kind

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.370
of primate.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.020
A primate whose tool
making descendants

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.520
would change the
face of the planet.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.570
