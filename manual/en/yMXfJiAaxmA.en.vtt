Hi my name is Greg Goldberg I'm here on behalf
of Expert Village and you can check us out

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.280
a www.minettis.com. In this segment we are
going to be talking about chicken Alfredo

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.199
pizza, specifically how to get the sauce started.
We are going to start the Alfredo sauce with

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.599
Béchamel, which is a very simply base sauce
you can use to make a million different things.

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:26.190
We are going to start over here. A little
bit of butter and flour; that is going to

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.170
make the wroth. From there we are going to
add the cream and season it. It would be Béchame,l

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.500
and then we add the garlic and the cheese
and everything else and then it is Alfredo.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:43.080
So we are going right here a turn our sauce
pan on. Maybe on low is adequate. You can

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.160
see over here the chicken is done cooking.
The sauce has reduce dramatically and it's

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.079
been brought to 165 degrees, which is what
you need for poultry. We are first going to

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:03.650
melt the butter for the sauce because the
wroth thickens based on the reactions of the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.719
fat and the flour. Butter has water in it,
so ideally what you want to do is cook some

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:21.560
of that water out first; it will make your
wroth more effectively. So we are just going

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:39.490
to melt that down. Just like that. You could
probably see it to start to bubble, that is

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:48.380
the water. When all the water disappears the
butter would start to brown. We want to catch

00:01:48.380 --> 00:02:25.390
it right in between there. While that sizzles
away, I would get the flour. It will take

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:36.590
a few minutes. Interesting thing about the
broth the longer you cook them the more effective

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.310
they are. So the is a lot of different types
of wroth French cooking, Italian cooking,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.370
you can use a blonde wroth a Cajun cooking
they got some dark, if you want some extra

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.240
dark wroth is to cook and cook. Gumbo and
Cajun and that. It looks like we start bubbling

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:54.230
pretty much apart. We are going to add our
flour. Just like cover the butter equivalently

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.230
in flour. Stir that in. Doesn't really need
to be exact proportion. That is the start

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:29.230
of our sauce. We are going to let that cook
a little more and then in the next segment

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.063
we would talk about how to turn that into
a Béchamel.
