00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.340
What am I doing with this
darn one-two-three thing?

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.380
Well, it's like this...

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.440
I saw my friend Gary one time
and there was this homeless person

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.080
who came up to him, and he had told
stories about doing this very same thing,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.500
I just didn't believe the stories,
I'm like, "Yeah right, sure..."

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.420
Because I thought
this can't really happen.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.320
In the stories he would tell he'd say,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.800
look when a homeless
person comes up to me

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.920
and says, "hey buddy
you got some change?"

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.754
I say to them, 
"you really want change?"

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.060
and if they say yes, he pulls all the
money he's got in his pocket at the time,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.260
all the change,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.340
and as he gives it to them
he goes.....whooo... and changes their reality.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.400
Now, he said he's never seen the same
homeless person in the same place,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.380
he never sees him again
after he does this change

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.440
even if they've been there for years on
the same street corner begging for money.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.340
So, I saw this one time in action.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.700
He and I were on a trip
and I saw this guy,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.300
Gary was outside of the car,
I was on the phone.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.300
Gary was outside the car pumping
gas and this guy walks over to him

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.040
and I know the guy is going
to ask him for change and I'm like,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.920
"buddy don't do it,
you're going to get change!"

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.040
And I literally felt this energy like a nuclear
bomb of energy had gone off behind me

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.240
and I looked and I
watched the guy stagger,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.340
now he had walked
over in a straight line.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.300
I watched him stagger away from
Gary who'd just given him change

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.320
and I went, "wait a minute
there's something in that."

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.954
And I realized that when
you have an awareness

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.780
of something that's
greater, that's possible,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.660
there are these moments,
it doesn't happen all the time,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.660
for whatever reason I'm not sure why, 
maybe it can someday

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.620
but there are these moments
where you can affect a change

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.740
in either somebody's world personally
or in a larger aspect of all of our worlds.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.380
When we all get
together to facilitate that,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.880
like in a being you class,
I'll have everybody put up their hands

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.740
and gather all the energy
and all the awareness

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.520
of what we can change
together in a particular area.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.800
And we'll direct it at a particular
thing or to a particular person

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.820
to give them an awareness of
something they never could have before

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.900
that they're now willing
to receive and we go,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.100
"1, 2, 3"

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.120
Change

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.380
What if it could be that simple?

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.660
So, the simple answer to what
are we doing with this 1, 2, 3?

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.760
We're using our consciousness,
our awareness and our potency

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.160
to gather all the energy of what
can be possible for somebody

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.060
or the world or a particular
group and gifting it to them.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.960
It's part of ask and you shall
receive in a really dynamic way

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.300
that we can all
contribute to together.
