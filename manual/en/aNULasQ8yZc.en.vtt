00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.150
I wanted to make this video to help
anybody that's trying to remove a tick

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.099
from an animal especially a Dog I had a unique
situation today

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.070
"April Here"

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.820
Clapping sound "Bark"

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.019
ok sitz

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.269
this is on my German Shepherds her name is
April

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.680
look pretty April for the camera hello
everybody okay

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.280
so I'll she had and I Noticed right
under her eye

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.390
right here about three-quarters down from
three-quarters of an inch down from her eye

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.540
she had a little pea looking thing and I realize
it was a tick

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.500
so the first thing I do is I googled
the easiest fastest

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.360
and most painless way to remove a tick
from the dog

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.060
everybody said take a pair tweezers make
sure you get the mouth parts out

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.310
you know its really painful for the dog so the
way I did it

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.689
was pretty unique and I couldn't find it on the
internet which is why I'm doing this

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.340
video

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.500
and April obviously remembers this and what I
did is I went and got this frontline

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.880
that I had because I use Frontline on a
regular basis my Vet recommended it

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.140
this is like the fourth month or the
fifth month i just didn't apply it because it was

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.979
wintertime

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.990
and I'm pretty sure that's how the tick latched on in the first place

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.899
it was right under her eye so I was
kinda nervous that if I just grabbed the tick

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.130
and pulled it off the ticks mouth parts might
stay in her skin

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.229
and then it could get infected inflamed
and its painful

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.350
was kinda close to her eye I wish I got it
on camera

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.130
when I did it but my camera guy wasn't here yet
this was about three hours ago I took

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.340
this little dropper here and i put about two
drops of

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.369
frontline right above the tick

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.829
right on the fur and I was really
surprised because literally in about

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.289
twenty or thirty seconds

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.800
I noticed and here''s the tick right kinda shriveling up already

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.180
within about 15-20 seconds the tick
just-released

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.720
let go and fell to the ground and that was
pretty much it

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.110
so the dog as you can see there's really
no swelling

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.160
I mean is a little something here left
over from the bite so that's where the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.140
tick latched on

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.470
and all the mouth parts are intact and
the tick has been dispatched

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.160
took about two hours but he has now
passed away not many things discussed me

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.550
or get under my skin but

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.750
this thing looks pretty nasty and It was
still walking around

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.400
even though he was engorged and I don't
think this is fully engorged cause

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.570
iv'e seen bigger than this

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.240
even though he was engorged he was still
like walking around he was able to walk on

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.210
the side, pretty impressive nature

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.780
you know so and thats how I remove the tick from April and  I think this will help a lot of

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.700
people because

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.760
I put gloves on just for safety but in
reality I never touched the tick

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.370
I never had to do any kind a mechanical
intervention

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.230
nothing I just put two drops of frontline right

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.810
above where the tick was and the tick fell
right off the dog in 20-30 seconds

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.700
thank God for frontline and thank God for my vets recommendation

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.470
hope this helps you
