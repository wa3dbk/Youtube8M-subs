00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:25.810
It’s time to pump up the tunes, get the
Biofreeze ready, tighten up your jock strap,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.019
and put on a shirt you don’t mind getting
blood on.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.050
It’s time to play some sports.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.559
So get yourself down to the gym and prepare
yourself, cause only real players are allowed

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:42.039
to compete in a hardcore game of … foosball?

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:52.370
Ok, so maybe foosball isn’t the most intense
game out there, but that doesn’t mean people

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.869
don’t take it very seriously.

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:58.120
When I’m down at the local watering hole
and have had a couple, and playing a game

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.159
of foosball, it’s almost a given there is
going to be some yelling, crying, and bleeding.

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.640
And now you can bring that excitement home
with you, and not by buying a foosball table

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:16.549
that will surely become your new bed after
your loved one kicks you out.

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.850
Foosball 2012 is what you would expect from
a game with the name foosball.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.229
It’s foosball, plain and simple.

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.259
You know, that modified version of football
that is played by people who can’t handle

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:27.869
running for ninety minutes.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.110
The game aims to bring the action home, and
for the most part succeedS well at that.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.020
You control the game with the analog sticks.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.310
The left stick moves the levers up and down
and the right stick controls your turns and

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.310
flicks.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.680
The object is simple, get the ball into your
opponent's goal, and the controls allow for

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.680
that.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.979
There is an arrow that appears, indicating
where you shot will go.

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.249
And if you get a nice shot off, you can see
a trail of fire behind it.

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:56.619
The controls are simple enough and won’t
take that long to get used to.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:08.850
Soon you will be doing bank shots and using
all your foosmen.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.269
There are several different game modes to
play in from a quick match to the World Tour,

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.620
where you will probably spend most of your
time.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.209
Here you go through a series of challenges
from competitors from all around the world.

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.019
They start off simple but with each one they
become harder and harder until they really

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.120
test your foosball skills.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.069
Winning matches will unlock more items for
your customization, including countries banners,

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.659
new table designs, foosmen, and rules.

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.760
All encouraging you to play more.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.760
And when you feel up to the challenge, you
can play online against others, no alcohol

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.099
or bar room required.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.739
Foosball 2012 aims to bring home foosball
without a cumbersome table that gets in the

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.739
way.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.250
It may be a little limited in game modes,
but if you are looking for a virtual foosball

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.700
table, you can’t do much better.
