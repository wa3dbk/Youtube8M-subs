00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.029
- Hey guys, this is the Finals Week bomb!

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:05.743
- [Skyy] I didn't say do it, you're

00:00:05.743 --> 00:00:08.202
supposed to do it sexy and, never mind.

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:09.289
- (laughs)I did!
- [Skyy] That's cool

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:10.926
though, (mumble) all right?

00:00:11.312 --> 00:00:12.331
Thank you very much.

00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:14.091
- [Meghan] To make this drink, all you're

00:00:14.091 --> 00:00:16.584
gonna need is Kahlua, a cheap beer,

00:00:16.584 --> 00:00:18.853
some coffee and Ramen noodles.

00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:20.502
- [Skyy] Kahlua!

00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:24.016
Okay right there.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:27.755
Fresh coffee, we using
Starbucks, pop the lid.

00:00:28.093 --> 00:00:29.797
That stuff's steaming
hot though, watch it.

00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:36.448
Relax, relax, Ramen noodles!

00:00:36.648 --> 00:00:37.609
- [Meghan] Oh God.

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:38.784
- [Skyy] Okay?

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.444
Here, that's chicken.

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:48.645
Cheap beer, just a little
bit 'cause it's just a bomb.

00:00:50.702 --> 00:00:52.837
Now here's where stuff gets tricky!

00:00:52.837 --> 00:00:55.016
According to our instructions, I'll do

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:56.639
this part because this is real surgical.

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:58.006
- [Meghan] Oh, okay.
- [Skyy] Okay?

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:01.698
You just get a bit of
the Ramen juice in there.

00:01:02.942 --> 00:01:03.962
Okay, cool.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.142
Ladies and gentlemen, this bomb style shot

00:01:09.142 --> 00:01:11.799
is called Finals Week!

00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:14.171
Okay?

00:01:14.846 --> 00:01:16.008
- Ew...
- The reason why it's

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:17.725
called Finals Week is because it

00:01:17.725 --> 00:01:20.523
contains a lot of stuff that (mumble)

00:01:20.523 --> 00:01:23.342
guys are going through
the last phases of school.

00:01:23.762 --> 00:01:25.741
Okay, and this drink
was sent to us by who?

00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:29.855
- Andres Rodriguez-Campbell
from UCF in Orlando.

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:31.398
- He's over 21, okay?

00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:32.635
College kids, don't drink unless

00:01:32.635 --> 00:01:34.353
you're 21, okay, we don't encourage

00:01:34.353 --> 00:01:35.572
underage drinking.

00:01:35.724 --> 00:01:36.870
And there you have it!

00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:39.574
Finals Week!

00:01:43.732 --> 00:01:45.508
You usually drop it from
higher, but that's fine.

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:49.071
No, that's not...

00:01:49.468 --> 00:01:50.216
(laughing)

00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:52.168
Okay, okay.
- It looks rancid.

00:01:52.168 --> 00:01:53.466
- Okay, here's the thing.

00:01:53.944 --> 00:01:56.231
If you cannot get it down, just

00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:57.685
spit back in the bowl, okay?

00:01:58.303 --> 00:01:59.129
I'll be able to throw up.

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:00.390
- I really wanted to eat that.

00:02:00.427 --> 00:02:01.494
- Aim for the bowl, I know,

00:02:01.494 --> 00:02:02.853
I got more, man, we got some more

00:02:02.853 --> 00:02:04.209
Ramen noodles here, okay?

00:02:04.713 --> 00:02:06.323
This a low budget show, okay, we have

00:02:06.323 --> 00:02:07.854
to eat however we can.

00:02:08.418 --> 00:02:09.716
- Oh wow, this looks...

00:02:09.716 --> 00:02:12.221
- If you cannot make it, dump it, okay?

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:13.279
- Okay.

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.614
- There on the table in this order:

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:17.297
in the bowl, on the table, and

00:02:17.297 --> 00:02:18.096
then on the carpet, okay?

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.256
- Look at that.
- And save the carpet

00:02:19.256 --> 00:02:19.851
for the last.

00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:21.742
- (mumble) oh, that's oil.

00:02:21.862 --> 00:02:22.958
- Okay, yeah.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.548
- Okay.

00:02:25.524 --> 00:02:26.765
Here goes nothing.

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:40.909
- Well?!

00:02:44.127 --> 00:02:46.625
- Never in my life have I
tasted anything like that.

00:02:47.172 --> 00:02:48.587
- Okay, so what it taste like?

00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:49.731
- Not good.

00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:51.449
(laughs)

00:02:52.113 --> 00:02:53.481
Not good at all actually.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:54.714
- Let me tell you the two baddest

00:02:54.714 --> 00:02:58.032
chicks who I had on
this show before, okay?

00:02:59.601 --> 00:03:02.638
Would be you and Kelsey (mumble) do it

00:03:02.638 --> 00:03:03.881
'cause you all two don't back down,

00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:05.227
you're all like, "Okay, let's go,"

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:06.981
you know what I mean, 'cause most

00:03:06.981 --> 00:03:09.082
of the girls that y'all like, if I

00:03:09.082 --> 00:03:10.301
approach them with this, they gonna

00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:12.780
be like, "Oh my God, oh my God no,"

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.510
you know what I mean?

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.961
Meg's like, "Okay, let's do it."

00:03:15.254 --> 00:03:17.566
Know what I mean, it's
different, respect you, okay?

00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:19.273
That is, is it that gross though?

00:03:19.437 --> 00:03:20.956
- It's really, it's not pleasant.

00:03:21.344 --> 00:03:22.492
- This is not pleasant?

00:03:22.492 --> 00:03:23.874
- Nope, it's bad.

00:03:23.874 --> 00:03:24.814
- Like someone kicks you in the

00:03:24.814 --> 00:03:25.909
balls, that's unpleasant.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.334
- Well it's very oily and...

00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:32.200
I mean...

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.656
- Damn, I ain't eat these in forever.

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:34.480
- Yeah, I know.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.028
- Started from the bottom, now I'm here!

00:03:37.852 --> 00:03:38.837
Okay?

00:03:39.423 --> 00:03:40.065
- It's good though.

00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:41.339
- That's good, that's really good.

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:43.306
I'd have that all the time.

00:03:43.482 --> 00:03:44.351
- [Skyy] Tipsy Bartender!

00:03:44.655 --> 00:03:46.227
And there you have it!
^- Yes.

00:03:46.507 --> 00:03:47.945
- Watermelon ice cubes!

00:03:48.434 --> 00:03:50.267
- Super cool.
^- Try it.

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:51.627
You can kind of break them up

00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:52.807
to flavor the drink a little bit,

00:03:52.807 --> 00:03:54.454
to give it a watermelon flavor.

00:03:54.746 --> 00:03:56.091
- That's a great idea.

00:03:57.567 --> 00:03:59.251
- But it keeps your glass cold

00:03:59.251 --> 00:04:00.734
just like regular ice cubes.
