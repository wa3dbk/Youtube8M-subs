Hello and welcome to Cupcake Addiction's Football
Helmet Cupcake Tutorial where I'm going to

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.420
be showing you how to make these adorable
and really really simple football helmet cupcakes,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.070
perfect for football parties, perfect for
sporting events, and perfect for the Superbowl.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.930
The things that you will need today:
I've got a little bit of sticky tape.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.430
I've got some white fondant, just a small
amount of white fondant.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.320
A cupcake to frost.
A little bit of cornflour just in a shaker.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.720
I've got some frosting that I've tinted green.
I've got a sharp knife.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.480
A regular knife.
And a fondant rolling pin.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.840
And I'm also using a printable template that
I've made for you guys today which is going

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.570
to be our little football helmet template.
So I'll leave links to the frosting and the

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.080
template in the description box below.
But let's get started.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.820
That first thing that you're going to do is
you want to frost up your cupcake. So you're

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.030
going to take just a generous amount of that
green frosting and we're just going to pile

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.809
it on all the way up to the top, nice and
high.

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.730
If you haven't already checked out my channel,
My Cupcake Addiction, make sure that you head

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.770
on over and have a look. There are over 250
awesome tutorials. There's plenty more sporting

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.330
stuff and all things cupcake, cakepop and
sweet-related for you to sink your teeth into.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.780
Alright, so you've got a bit of a rough mound
of frosting. Now you want to use the back

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.300
of your knife and just scrape that frosting
down towards the cupcake liner. But try not

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.970
to get it too far over the cupcake liner if
you can avoid it and then you want to just

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.000
use just the back of your knife. You'll notice
I'm wiping my knife in between each swipe

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.860
but I'm just swiping across the top, taking
some of that frosting off but in the process

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.170
I'm also smoothing it out into a really nice,
smooth mound.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.170
Alright, so next you want to roll out your
little bit of fondant. This is such a simple

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.531
cupcake. So I'm just going to roll it out
into a little bit of a sausage to get our

00:01:50.531 --> 00:01:54.991
shape started and pop a little bit of cornflour
down just to prepare our surface, and then

00:01:54.991 --> 00:02:00.160
you want to roll it out quite thin into a
bit of a rectangle-y shape piece. Perfect!

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.810
Once you've rolled that out, just take your
knife and you can trim of any excess and pop

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.010
it back into your zip lock bag because we
only really need one little of strip and it's

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.819
only going to be enough to cover the width
of our cupcake. So I'm just going to use my

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.000
knife and I'm just going to trim down and
you want to strip about that wide. So whatever

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.150
width you go with, try to make sure that all
of your cupcakes are roughly the same. Pick

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.280
up that piece of fondant, position it in the
middle, and I position it in the middle first

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.400
because then if it's a little bit short, you
can just pull it a fraction so that it meets

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.750
up with either end. Be careful not to get
any frosting on your hands here and mess up

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.280
your white fondant. Making sure it's nice
and in the middle, just pat it down across

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.060
that dome so that it sorts of blends in with
it and then tuck your little edges under.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.450
Perfect!
Now you want to just prepare your template.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.700
So I've provided this template for you in
a number of colors. You've got 4 different

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.710
colors and I've printed mine out on a 210gsm
cards, so it's not on paper. It's actually

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.990
on a slightly thicker paper straw or a light
card board. So I just want to fold it over

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.662
at the back, and I know that my cupcake sizes
like it about that big. So this is a bit of

00:03:07.662 --> 00:03:12.220
a one-size-fits-all cupcake template, and
you just want to sticky tape it at the back.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.901
And then you want to make sure that you're
looking front on to your cupcake so that you

00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:24.410
can drop your cupcake straight in. Perfect!
Now what you want is sort of a snug fit here.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.990
So now I'm going to take my knife, and I'm
actually going to push that cupcake down on

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.740
the sides, and that's going to push it in
really really nice and snug with that cupcake

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.350
wrapper. And then, because we're going to
[have] mess up our sides a little bit, you

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.930
want to just take your frosting back and try
not to get too much frosting over the edges

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.740
here but we're just going to sort of neaten
up that frosting and blend that cupcake in

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.600
with that cupcake wrapper. Perfect! Make sure
that you remove any excess frosting from around

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.760
these sides of your wrapper so you've got
a really nice, neat helmet.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.740
But in a nutshell, that is your completed
Superbowl helmet cupcake. You can do those

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.020
in a range of colors, your team colors, absolutely
whatever you like. Make them your own. I hope

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.160
you guys have enjoyed this really really sweet
and simple cupcake decorating idea for your

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.530
Superbowl party or for your next sporting
event. Thanks very much for tuning in to My

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.489
