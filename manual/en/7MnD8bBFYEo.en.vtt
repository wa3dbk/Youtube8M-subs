00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.749
Hi, I'm Emily Larew and we're going to work
on our hip dips and circles with heel pops.

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:13.570
So, turning around, what you're going to do
is your hips are going to actually start dipping

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.081
from the side, so you want to bring them up
to the right, and you're going to sit and

00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:23.841
pop, sit and stay. So we're just doing the
motion, we're not really hitting the pop right

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:29.840
now, but we're coming back to the center each
time. So all I'm doing is going around up,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.030
around up, around up, around up. So looking
from the side, you're just seeing I'm not

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.140
going front or back, I'm just dipping side
up, side up. So it's a little half circle

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.400
like I'm doing a moon shape. All right, then
what you're going to do is you add that pop

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.590
to it, your hip dips, from getting it back
to the top is, you're going to scoop it--what

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.960
I want you to do is add your shoulders and
drop them. And you're actually going to do

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.489
a little heel pop. It's not a major one because
you don't want to do this, pop, hip and hop,

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:10.710
make it small. You have one, two, three, drop
it down, five, six, seven, eight. So you're

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.850
just going to lift your shoulders and drop
them in place. So ready, try it one more time.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:21.859
Five, six, to the right. One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight. Good. Let's

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:27.740
do the circles or the heel pops. Now, I've
always been saying keep your knees bent. You

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.820
want to keep them straight now, so we have
a little bit of a different variation of your

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.049
hip circle. We're going to move it to the
right. What's going to happen is your knees

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:43.439
are straight, your just popping your heels
as you go around. Go to the left, pop your

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.479
heels, keep them straight. So, very easy,
we're going to go--just do it slow one more

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.249
time. One, two, three, four, left, six, seven,
eight. Let's add a little bit quicker pop.

00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:00.509
A one and two, three and four, five and six,
seven and eight. So you're having something

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.030
different to do that helps you add different
pops. So those are your hip dips and your

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.060
hip circles with heel pops.
