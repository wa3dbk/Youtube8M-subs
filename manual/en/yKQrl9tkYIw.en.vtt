00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.380
OK, let's start.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.680
Has it begun?

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.860
What do we start with? What should we say first? Hi?

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.700
Oh, I do not dare to stand here if anything should happen. I need to sit down.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.500
Should we say something like "Good day" or "Hi"?

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.520
Julie, should we say "Hi" first?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.920
Yes, I think...
Ehm.. Say..

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.540
You must somehow invite them to the table..

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.640
Yes, we should say hello then. Greet.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.740
Okay..

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.240
Spell "Hi"

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.660
Yes, ok.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.640
Hi..

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.960
This will never work..

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.740
It's because you want to quit!

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.780
Damn

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.880
I told you that this was just nonsense... 
Soda? No thank you..

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.720
Say...

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.020
Let's start over.. Spell "Hi" again ..

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.800
This is...
There is no point.. It's not working.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.960
Oh shit!

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.680
Are you kidding me?!

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.860
Ok, you know what.. Now..

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.180
Now.. I just want to go home..

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.340
You can't just leave now!

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.620
No.. I don't dare to leave.. I can't leave now..

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.620
Oh my god.. It moved itself!!

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.540
Take away the glass..

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.900
Seriously, move the glass away.
I don't dare to have it here now.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.860
That was just sick..

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.420
We need to continue this!
But you guys..

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.740
The spirit is here.. Like right now..!

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.700
Now you have to...
Yeah, no shit! Damn..

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.660
What if it does something to me over here..

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.820
I'm like all alone over here..
Damn, i'm next to the window too..

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.000
What should we say to him now?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.100
I'm not doing this anymore..
Yes, come on!

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.940
This is so cool!!

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.580
Can you please follow me home..

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.660
No, pull yourself together..

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.420
I should never have joined this..

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.380
We have to ask if it is a woman or a man..

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.760
Seriously.. I can see flashes of light in front of the screen..

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.700
It's super creepy..

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.480
I have never experienced anything like this happened before when I have played this game.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.320
Shit, I thought the door opened up..

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.200
God, I got frightened..

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.400
Should we seriously continue now..?

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.040
What should we ask about then?

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.620
Ok guys, we need to continue..!

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.000
We should ask for a sign then..

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.800
Ok....

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.520
1..

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.340
2.. 3..

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.700
"Give us a sign"

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.860
Nothing happens..

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.580
One more time?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.120
Nothing is happening..

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.620
Watch!
It dangles..

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.600
Holy f*ck..

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.400
Damn. The whole thing dangles..!

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.540
Damn..

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.220
Ok, let's do one more..

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.440
Check that...

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.660
1.. 2.. 3..
"Give us a sign"
