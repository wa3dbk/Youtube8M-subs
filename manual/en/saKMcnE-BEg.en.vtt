Level12 is a new innovative product idea for indoor climbing.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:32.000
It’s a laser propped device which allows you to create and climb an unlimited number of boulder routes.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Level12 features four different modes – Choose, Create, Play and Train

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.000
The “choose” mode allows you to select predefined boulder problems.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Holds and Steps are projected onto the wall while you climb

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.500
With Level12 you can also define your own boulder.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.000
Simply go to “Create”. Select holds and steps on the touch screen.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Once you are ready, your own boulder can be saved, shared with your friends and replayed at any time.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Go ahead, challenge your friends!

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.000
With the “play” mode you can access predesigned games for training, or just for fun.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.000
This feature is great for climbing classes and individual training.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.000
With Level12 you can help beginners with lead-climbing.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.000
In the “training” mode the outline of an advanced climber shows you exactly how to move your body.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.000
You can also add clip positions, rest positions and other information.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.900
Level12 consists of a camera, a laser projector and a touch interface. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.400
All together it fits into a shoe box.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.000
Level12 can be used in any indoor environment

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and its low maintenance.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
New routes or games can be created within minutes.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Level12 is currently in development

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
