[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:04.985
Hey there, "Game/Show."

00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:06.560
This is Jamin, obviously.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.185
I'm at my office-- this lovely
office that we have here--

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:12.880
and I got some new glasses,
which is also pretty cool.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.730
And that's the good news.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.520
So the bad news is that if
you love games this week,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.710
this has kind of
been a crappy week

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.110
to be someone who calls
themselves, quote-unquote,

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.320
"a gamer."

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.370
I don't need to belabor
you with all the things

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.860
that have been happening.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.595
But the short list, obviously,
is Anita Sarkeesian's video

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:36.000
and her being forced to leave
her home because of threats

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.140
of violence.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.960
Zoe Quinn, another
game developer,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.310
who had a former, past--
whatever-- someone

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.630
write some nasty things
about her on the internet,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.910
and her being attacked
in comment section.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.950
This pretty crazy.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.310
We had someone-- a
group of hackers--

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.800
take down PlayStation
Network and then threaten

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.395
to bring down the plane of
the president of Sony Online

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.509
Entertainment.

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:05.050
Given all the other
crazy things that

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.820
have been happening this
summer, obviously, this

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.790
is certainly a
little embarrassing

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.780
for me, just as someone
who loves games,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.180
to feel like there is a segment
of gamer culture, as it were,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.040
that maybe is not behaving
the most appropriately.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.830
So two big thoughts about this.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.390
Well, first of all, I
don't need to walk you

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.090
through my specific argument.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.590
I've been through both
sides of the debate,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.492
specifically around feminism and
the role of women video games.

00:01:34.492 --> 00:01:35.950
I did an episode
about it that I'll

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.074
link to in the description.

00:01:37.074 --> 00:01:41.180
I did a companion episode
about the disposability of men,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.430
particularly in violent video
games, which I will also

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.847
link to in the description.

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:47.180
There's a lovely essay, I
think, in the "New Statesman,"

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.137
which sums up my thoughts
about Anita Sarkeesian.

00:01:51.137 --> 00:01:53.470
Again, I don't need to belabor
you with that stuff here.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.380
I have two specific things that
I do want to talk to all of you

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.500
at "Game/Show" about that
are definitely related.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.250
I think the first is that I
don't think, at this point,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.115
we're even really talking about
game journalism or feminism

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:07.789
at this point.

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.289
I don't think we're
actually talking

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.169
about any of those things.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.570
I think we're talking
about something else.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.403
And I think it can be
explained by a concept

00:02:13.403 --> 00:02:15.194
that I've talked
about past episodes.

00:02:15.194 --> 00:02:16.860
It's known as
ingroup-outgroup dynamics.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.090
It's been studied by
sociologists, specifically

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.220
this concept of
ingroup favoritism.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.920
And it works like this.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.036
You identify with
certain people that you

00:02:26.036 --> 00:02:27.660
share interests in
common, and then you

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.220
create some sort
of social identity.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.150
That's essentially your ingroup.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.840
When someone from the
outside comes in and either

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.510
wants to be a part
of the ingroup,

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.624
or challenges core beliefs
of what your ingroup has,

00:02:39.624 --> 00:02:40.540
then people freak out.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.873
And I think that's a lot of
what we're seeing right now,

00:02:42.873 --> 00:02:47.580
is that there's a segment of
people who consider themselves

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.850
gamers and own that tag,
and that they feel basically

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.570
under attack.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.962
They feel under threat.

00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:54.920
And I think understanding
that dynamic at least

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.515
gives some context for why
what we're seeing is happening.

00:02:57.515 --> 00:03:00.000
And I think it also
expands it in the sense

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.420
that this is not
something that's

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.775
just limited to gamer behavior,
but it's a problem elsewhere

00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:06.900
in the world.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.775
The second thing is a
little bit more proactive.

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:14.440
If you're someone
who loves games,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.730
every time somebody
does something--

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.460
whether it's something
violent or something racist

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.530
or misogynistic, or whatever
it might be-- any time

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.230
somebody does something like
that in the name of games,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.740
you carry that burden
along with you.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.249
Because to the outside world,
people who don't play games,

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:33.915
they get a limited
amount of perspective

00:03:33.915 --> 00:03:36.300
in terms of what it means to
be someone who plays games.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.540
So every time something pops
up-- and you saw it this week.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.720
There were articles in
"Slate." there are articles

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.720
in the "New York Times."

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.150
There are articles elsewhere.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.270
Any time something pops up
that casts a particular light

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.430
on gamers, as it were, then we
all sort of carry that burden

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.040
and carry that
expectation with us.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.456
And so that means
that we all have

00:03:54.456 --> 00:03:57.130
a collective
responsibility to maintain

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.410
our public identity as a group.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.045
If we don't, then
all of a sudden you

00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:02.920
end up with a community
that you don't really

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.390
want to be a part
of, which is kind

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.642
of how I'm feeling right now.

00:04:05.642 --> 00:04:07.850
Like maybe I feel a little
embarrassed about the fact

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.690
I have to explain to
people that someone

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.165
who's giving a critique--
regardless of how you feel

00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:14.540
about that critique--
someone who

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.149
gave a critique of a particular
game or a set of games

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.890
had to be chased from their home
because the internet stormed

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:22.600
upon them.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.060
That's pretty
embarrassing for me.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.226
Maybe you feel the same way.

00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:26.880
Maybe you don't.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.930
Regardless, I would ask that,
for those of you out there who

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.130
don't necessarily agree
with Anita Sarkeesian--

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.710
you don't necessarily agree
with Zoe Quinn, whoever it might

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.160
be-- take a look at what
it is that you're writing

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.045
on the internet, and read it out
loud to someone in real life.

00:04:41.045 --> 00:04:42.910
And if you feel like
there's something

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.920
that you would write
down that you feel

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.997
comfortable saying to
another person to their face,

00:04:47.997 --> 00:04:48.580
then go ahead.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.192
Hit Enter.

00:04:49.192 --> 00:04:50.150
Put it on the internet.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.733
You should feel very
proud about that.

00:04:51.733 --> 00:04:54.290
If you don't, then you
probably shouldn't post it.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.147
This seems very
straightforward, but there's

00:04:56.147 --> 00:04:58.230
this thing called the
online disinhibition effect,

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.705
where people make a
disconnect between what they

00:05:00.705 --> 00:05:02.080
do in their online
lives and what

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.320
they do in their offline lives.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.950
And so I think we have a
responsibility, obviously,

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.740
to knowledge that and to made
sure that we're saying kind

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.674
and meaningful things.

00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:10.090
The other thing
is that, if you're

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.550
someone who wants to be a
part of this gamer community,

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.350
and you see something that you
don't like, your form of action

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.650
could be very different.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.900
It could be a simple downvote.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.050
It could be a conversation,
whatever it might be.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.049
One of the things I've
been super excited about,

00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:27.760
I've been super proud of, is the
fact that "Game/Show's" comment

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.695
section is awesome, right?

00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:33.680
And it happens in, of all
places, YouTube, right?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.950
So it's a show about games,
it's happening on YouTube,

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.500
and there's, generally speaking,
an air of civility and wit

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.982
and intellect that's happening
on our comment board.

00:05:43.982 --> 00:05:46.890
So I feel like if it can happen
there, it can happen anywhere.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.130
But we all have to
work at it together.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.006
Anyway, those are
my basic thoughts.

00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:52.380
It's been kind of
a rough week, I

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.107
think, for people
who love games,

00:05:54.107 --> 00:05:55.190
but we'll work through it.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.355
It's growing pains.

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:57.480
It's growing pains, I hope.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.570
One can only hope.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.400
Anyway, we'll be back next week
with some special stuff that's

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.524
happening with
"Game/Show," and I can't

00:06:04.524 --> 00:06:05.690
wait to share that with you.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.398
And I hope that you
have a great weekend.

00:06:07.398 --> 00:06:08.560
And see you soon.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.340
