Hi guys, welcome to ways to fatten your wallet
and investing video.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:14.960
This is an investing concepts video regarding
EPS, otherwise known as earnings per share

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.180
that is what EPS stands for.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.360
What is EPS?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.780
Why is it important?

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.580
As I said, EPS stands for earnings per share.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.220
Why is that important?

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.590
EPS is important to the financial community.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.960
What do I mean by the financial community?

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:43.740
Well, I mean investors like you and I, or
investing institutions, pension funds, other

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:51.670
funds, fund managers, etc and they need a
simple way to analyze companies and one of

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.609
the easiest ways to analyze companies is by
looking at the earnings and the earning per

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:57.609
share.

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.850
Let us just do a quick example here.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.610
Imagine if we have a company which has EPS
of 10p.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.470
So it is 10p,of earnings per share.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:22.060
Let us say...yeh the share price is 100p then
you have the next concept which is the PE

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.500
ratio, which is the priced earnings ratio.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.420
That means the earnings per share divided
by the share price itself.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.310
In this example, it is a PE of 10.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.310
The reason why EPS is important to the financial
community is they want to see a growth in

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.500
the share price, how does that happen?

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:51.660
One of the ways it happens is when the earnings
go up, so the financial community will, if

00:01:51.660 --> 00:02:03.960
you imagin this is 2012... base their appraisals
of a stock or business on the earnings growth

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.640
and the earnings of the company.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:14.260
Let us say the earnings of this company increase,..
in this case it is increasing by 50%, in this

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:22.670
case it is increasing slightly less, and the
share price stays roughly p, a priced earnings

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.150
ratio of 10, 10 times the earning of 15p = 150p.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:36.609
The 20p earnings, if you times that by 10,
let us just say it goes up and it will go

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:42.159
up to 200p, so in 2 years the price has doubled.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:49.700
If the financial community believe this is
a gross stock, then it might appraise the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.900
company slightly higher,.. institutions might
start buying, and in this case the PE might

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:04.000
rise, the share price might rise higher if
it was a PE of let's say 15, then we are talking

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.129
300p.

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:13.799
So in 2 years, the share price has tripled,
and that is why earnings per share is a very

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.810
important concept for investing.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:30.389
