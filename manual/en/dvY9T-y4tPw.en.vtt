Kelo: Hey, let me join in.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.900
Hinto:Don't be sad. Sure being omega sucks.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.540
Hinto: You get last pickings at meal time, the sleeping hours are lousy and you get treated like a chew toy from time to time.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.240
Hinto: But I was told that the omega is the fortitude of the pack.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.820
Hinto: To keep the peace.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.200
Huata: At the cost of my peace?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.240
Hinto: Don't be like that.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.300
Hinto: You're not doomed to be omega forever.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.580
Hinto: We just have to do something to show your worth to the pack.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.980
Huata: You're right.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.440
Huata: What if we found a big meal for the pack.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.760
Huata: If so we should leave the territorial perimeter.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.060
Hinto: I Didn't take you for the adventurous type.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.060
Hinto: Sounds like fun, let's go for it.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.420
Huata: We need to plan this out.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.020
Hinto: We'll wait until everyone's asleep.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.620
Hinto: Then will make our move.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.520
Anemy: I'm starving.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.500

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.840
Ash: Sleep, You'll forget about hunger in your dreams.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.960
Kelo: Give it up.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.720
Kelo: You're not gonna be crawling into tall grass with him anytime soon.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.740
Trot: What is that suppose to mean?!

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.900
Kelo: That you've been replaced, but you already know that.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.840
Trot: Maybe he's right.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.000
Trot: I've have been replaced.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.600
Trot: I'm unworthy.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.520

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.500
Hinto So, your pack was just your mother and siblings?

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.280
Huata: We were all separated by humans.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.800

Hinto: You we'ren't kidding.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.420
Huata: We should take down an adult.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.660
Hinto: But their huge we can't possibly take one down alone.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.880
Huata: That's why we need to go back and get the rest of the pack.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.800
Hinto:  I'll wait here.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500
