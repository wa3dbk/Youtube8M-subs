don't have carrots but I got some mixed

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.570
veggies let's get back inside where it's
warm okay I got to crock pots here

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.200
because I got a lot of ingredients i'm
going to put in plus my wife she likes a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.420
lot of potatoes and no onions and i like
just a few potatoes and as many onions

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.310
as you can fit and what I got is two and
a half cans of beef broth and each crock

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.659
pot I got a split a package of mixed
veggies in each one of these and if it's

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.729
not enough I'll open this up put some
more in but I got a lot of meat so I'm

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.340
going to wick life see how much room I
got it I got some celery I got some

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.090
taters they got some onion and I got
this a peep roast isn't it hon is this a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.329
beef roast yeah there's a big rope that
we cut down into smaller sections I'm

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:28.579
going to cube this cut it into little
cubes and then I'm gonna sear it in my

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:38.670
wok and let's get started all right
there's my celery enema potatoes and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.870
there is state a test at the taters
since she loves them so much that's got

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.260
a little celery on their team now fixing
to get to work on onions all right I put

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.370
a little bit of olive oil in the bottom
of the pan spring with a bunch of

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.190
dehydrated onion flakes in there and
about two shots of liquid smoke now i'm

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.880
gonna i'm actually going to cook these
and then put them in the pots i'm hoping

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.019
everything will soften up and cook down
a little bit because I sort of ran out

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.890
of room let me show you without making
you dizzy I'm out of room over here but

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.590
onions are almost as important as
meeting in my opinion

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.069
I think I can I think I can make it fit
all right i'll show you when i get this

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:35.269
all cooked up oh yeah i'm gonna make a
cake man i got I don't know what I drank

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.610
too much coffee or something it could
cook a coffee so uh when i get to stew

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.650
made we're making cake boy it's getting
there I just dumped the liquid out now i

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:54.860
wanna i guess you call sear it some may
call it black in it that's if I if I get

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.549
caught up in something else it'll
probably be blackened not quite lacking

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:20.870
let's give my wife for sure okay I'll
give her a couple more well that didn't

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:30.460
turn out to be that much meat after all
man man there is no room in there no

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:42.289
hope I sure hope I can match this down
in there yeah that's going to take some

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:48.020
mash and I need both hands for that so I
don't spill but there we go I'll see you

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:55.070
in about six hours oh man it smells so
good you would not believe how good this

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:07.250
tastes mm-hmm I have made a few stews
before and this is the best one and this

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.940
the first time I've cooked the meat in
the pan and then put it in crock pot so

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:19.310
that might be the answer right there boy
that's good team smells good there's one

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.370
more thing I put in there that neglect
the dimension it was sort of an

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.639
afterthought and that was a package a
lift in beef and onion soup mix one

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.300
package for each crock-pot
and my wife hadn't tried hers yet but

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.370
only difference is hers doesn't have
onions well that was a on I hadn't made

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:48.150
the cake yet just I've been I've been
writing names down and here's my third

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.610
day of writing for my contest and I've
had to take a break because my hand was

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.669
