Now to finish off the eye look, we're going
to definitely do that cat's eye eyeliner.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.150
I'm going to my trusty black powder eyeliner
and I'm using it wet. I'm taking a little

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:21.320
bit of water and I'm dampening my brush and
dipping it into the black and making my own

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.189
liquid eyeliner. This is great because you
can take any eye shadow and make it an eyeliner

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.090
by wetting the brush. It just goes on really
smooth if you have a nice angle brush. You

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.660
want to start at the end of the eye and you
want a really dramatic kind of swoop up for

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:50.170
the cat's eye. Really bring it out. A nice
peak on the end. Then you want to take it

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.810
in. As you take it in, it should get thinner
and thinner. This is a pretty harsh line.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:06.740
You don't want it to look smoky or smudged.
You want it to have a pretty fine edge line.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.590
Take your time. Be patient and really draw
this well. Once it dries, you can't budge

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.590
in, but you can add onto it. You can make
it thicker and thicker depending on what you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:28.620
want to do. This is a really glam look, so
I'm defiantly going to accentuate this kind

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:41.069
of wing on her eye right here. I'm going to
bring it out and get it really, really dark.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:51.539
Open for me. Look back this way. Awesome.
Close again. Really make sure it's very, very

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:59.469
dark. Take your time and be patient and get
this eyeliner to look perfect. Look at that.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.130
How dramatic does that look already?
