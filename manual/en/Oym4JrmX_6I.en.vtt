00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:10.020
In this last movie, you'll finish off texturing the scene with the help of a free 
downloadable utility that will help you design Substance Maps interactively.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.570
Substance Maps in 3ds Max were originally developed by a company called Allegorithmic.

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:25.418
Using a web browser, go to the Allegorithmic page at www.allegorithmic.com 

00:00:27.848 --> 00:00:36.468
On the Products page, choose the "player" product. This is a free utility that will simplify 
your workflow as you work with Substance Maps.

00:00:37.407 --> 00:00:40.426
Download the application and install it on your system.

00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:47.252
Start the application and load a Substance file. Use the Stones_01 file you worked with 
in the last movie.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.775
You get two feedback windows, one in 2D and one in 3D.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.772
You can orbit around the 3D view using Alt+MMB just like in 3ds Max.

00:00:58.396 --> 00:01:04.451
Adjust the parameters, for example the Rock Amount value to see the effect in real-time.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.553
Play with other sliders such as Rock Size or Shape Shift.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.070
Try editing color information like Saturation, Luminosity and others.

00:01:15.632 --> 00:01:20.870
The advantage of course, is that you get immediate feedback to what variations 
you want the map to have.

00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:31.420
You can also see the other channels contained into the Substance file, such as Normal, Specular, 
Bump, Height and Displacement.

00:01:31.762 --> 00:01:41.300
The Difference between Height and Displacement is that the Height map is not affected 
by the Relief Balance slider but the Displacement map is.

00:01:50.107 --> 00:01:54.720
When you're done, you can proceed to 3ds Max is a couple of different ways.

00:01:55.551 --> 00:02:01.051
One way is to extract bitmaps from the Substance player and lead a conventional workflow.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:10.023
You can choose an image type that suits you, an image resolution and a folder 
where to save the extracted files,

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.720
and ultimately use these extracted images in the proper channel on a material 
that you design in 3ds Max.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.610
The other method is to simply apply a Substance map in 3ds Max,

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:09.277
load the same substance you loaded in the player,

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:20.154
and then all you need to do is duplicate the values you end up with into 
the Slate Material Editor in 3ds Max

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:27.355
However, and as explained in the last movie, Substance Maps handle gamma differently from bitmaps.

00:03:27.792 --> 00:03:37.443
Ensure you add a Color Correction map at the Diffuse level, 
and set the Lightness &gt; Advanced Gamma Contrast to 0.45~0.55.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.090
This will get you close to the display in the player, although you can adjust 
other color correction values as well.

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.616
With that in mind, go back to the Fuji house and take a look how you can design its textures.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.870
You will experiment with a substance map for the roof. In the player, 
load the Old_Painted_Planks substance.

00:04:02.484 --> 00:04:05.896
Play with the values until you get a look that you like.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.170
In 3ds Max, create a material based on the same substance.

00:04:54.727 --> 00:05:02.740
Apart from the Diffuse channel, wire the Normal and Bump channel as you have learned 
in the last movie.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.090
Do not forget to add a Color Correction map to adjust the gamma Correction.

00:05:36.706 --> 00:05:38.981
Render the scene to view the results.

00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:44.109
Keep on experimenting with the player and transposing the values to the Slate Material Editor.

00:05:44.855 --> 00:05:48.692
Try the Cane substance for the walls.

00:05:59.381 --> 00:06:04.494
Create a Material for this substance in 3ds Max and apply it to the walls.

00:06:28.665 --> 00:06:32.966
Add the Normal and Bump maps to the material as you have done before.

00:06:40.993 --> 00:06:46.775
In this particular case, you will need to rotate the map 90 degrees for the canes to run horizontally.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.740
With Substance Maps, you only need to do this once.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:56.930
With a conventional workflow, you'd need to rotate every image you created for the various channels.

00:06:57.663 --> 00:07:02.775
Add a Color Correction Map and adjust gamma correction and render the scene.

00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:26.820
Keep on working on your scene. Try the Wood_White_Cedar map for the floor, railings and wall frames.

00:07:27.802 --> 00:07:31.965
Use the Asphalt substance for the steps in the garden.

00:07:32.946 --> 00:07:37.215
Feel free to experiment with other substances if you feel like it.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.830
This concludes this three-part series on how to work with Substance Maps. 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.400
We hope you found the instruction useful.
