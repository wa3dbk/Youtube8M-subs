00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.880
This guitar...
it's not a very pretty guitar.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.480
I bought this when I first
came to Nashville in 1982.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.220
I was playing in a group.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.780
Don Kelly was in the band.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.480
Don was always known to
hire hot guitar players. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.480
New guys in town.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.090
He was like the place to be in town,
where all the musicians were.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.280
It was kind of like the
"musician's musician" type gig.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.400
We would play on the show.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.280
I was playing in this little club.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.600
It was in Murfreesboro town.
Kind of a honky-tonk dive.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.980
I was about 22 yrs old or
something like that.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.480
One day he goes...

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.920
 "You need to go
get yourself a new guitar..."

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.730
"...that's good for country."

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.700
Because I was playing jazzy stuff.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.680
I think it was Hagstrom Swede
I was playing.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.480
"That's not quite the Nashville guitar."

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.480
"It's a good guitar, but
not what you need here. "

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.480
"You need get like a Telecaster."

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.600
He was doing a lot of stuff like
Merle Haggard and Buck Owens.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.480
And all the west coast kind of
country stuff.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.230
I said "Oh yeah, I love those."

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.680
So we all went out to the
music store one day.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.180
And these were hanging up in...

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.570
...Hewgley's music store
outside of Nashville.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.480
He bought one and
I bought one for like $300.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.460
This was $300.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.480
It wasn't painted...
This is how it looked.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.980
Somebody had stripped
the paint and lacquer off it.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
He was gonna repaint it.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.760
He primed it and was going to
repaint it, you know.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.980
And before he did it,
he trade it in for something.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.730
He took it in and trade it in.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.250
So it came like this.
It's like a car primer.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.780
And Don had a cream colored one.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.780
Actually, he picked this one
and I picked the other one.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.130
We played them out live and I said...

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.980
"I kind of like that
grey one better."

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.730
And he goes
"Well, just take that one."

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.680
"I'll take the other one.
It doesn't really matter to me."

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.480
This is how I got this.
And I never had it...

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.720
But I did experiment with it,
so it's a little bit of a hybrid.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.470
I had middle pickup put into it.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.410
It sort of caught on...

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.100
Lot of people are putting
middle pickup.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.480
Pickup in the middle
with the volume knobs here.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.280
Joe Glaser put that in.
He's a guitar builder in town.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.760
So it has this Seymour Duncan
pickup in the middle.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.690
And he put extra volume knob for it.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.630
So, when you...

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.250
It's just a volume.
When you turn it and...

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.460
...with the back, you can
bleed in the volume of that.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.480
So you get in and out of phase.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.320
That's a sound I use more
with an EQ. Attack move.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.730
Rather than trying to duplicate
a Stratocaster sound.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.160
It takes a little of the
annoying high-end out of it...

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.180
...if you just bleed the
little of the volume on it.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.910
Other than the middle pickup
and the volume...

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.930
...it's same as any Telecaster.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.820
If you put it in a neck position
and turn it on...

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.980
...you get these two.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.130
If you are in the middle...

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.480
This is the main volume and
this is just for that. 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.610
You just get the middle.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.800
Just the middle.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.680
Anyway, I play this in club.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.450
You can see all the smoke
that's inlayed in there...

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.250
...from all the years of playing in
honky-tonk.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.250
Cigarette smoke and
all the lovely, toxic stuff.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.280
Just kind of made its way into
the wood there.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.280
But it sounds so good,
I would never...

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.730
Of course, it wasn't for
the superficiality of it.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.730
I kept it the same because
I thought it sounded good.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.960
I found that less lacquer
on the guitar....

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.380
...like on this guitar here,
just an oil finish on it.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.070
It's the best way to do the neck.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.140
Also when you're playing on a
hot day and you get sweaty...

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.910
...you get hung up on it. 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.380
So you're using bunch of
lubricant which...

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.940
...can make the strings go bad fast.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.720
This is all wore off. Originally,
it wasn't like that, of course.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.820
I find it better to make guitars
with oil finishes and stuff.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.090
And actually,the sound of
the body of the guitar...

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.100
...sounds better when the
lacquer starts to rub off.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.480
You get the wood sound into it.
It breathes, you know.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.730
Surprising enough,
even solid body guitar...

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.250
...the wood plays a big part in
the sound of the guitar.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.720
Oh right because...
Good question.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.100
When we were doing the...

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.980
There's a song we had on
The Player's album called...

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.480
"Don't Try This at Home"

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.450
Which start off with a hot
country picking kind of thing.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.020
It goes like...

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.280
There's a part in it, where we go...

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.980
It goes...

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.730
We are in G at that point,
we go from E to G.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.230
Then it goes to a slow shuffle.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.400
Slow blues.
So when I'm doing all that...

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.510
I would switch back.
I'd pick up...

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.260
You know, getting into the...

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.980
So you get that nice pickup
sound this guitar has.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.960
It's a nice switch up.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.300
Of course and then we go
back to the fast thing... 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.730
You know, it starts picking up... 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.380
And in the mean time,
when someone's soloing...

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.130
I go back and grab that and
I'm doing back to country thing.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.270
PCI: Great contrast.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.980
Did you see that?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.530
So that's kind of what that is.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.980
