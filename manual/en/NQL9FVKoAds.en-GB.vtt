00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.620
Kia ora Chrisziina, come in, come in girls.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.890
Mere and Pounamu have eczema.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.080
Using lots of moisturiser many times a day
is really important for children like Mere

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.440
and Pounamu.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.770
The skin has a very important role in protecting us from the outside world.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.120
 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.180
It's helpful to think of the skin as being
like a brick wall which protects us from irritants

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.130
and infections and even allergens.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.990
When you have active eczema this wall becomes leaky and this means that irritants and allergens

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.240
can come in more easily causing further inflammation and worsening the eczema.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.890
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.579
Regular and generous use of moisturisers reduces inflammation and supports the natural barrier

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.720
function of the skin.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.970
Before applying creams for your child's eczema, make sure your own hands are clean.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.390
 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.070
Skin with eczema can get infected easily so
avoid putting your hands into a tub of cream.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.789
This can introduce infection. It's better
to spoon out your moisturiser onto a dish

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.740
or paper towel and use this cream to apply
to your child's skin.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.609
 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.499
So you take your cream and I tend to dot it
down the skin and then smooth it, and you

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:20.459
smooth it with the way that the hair grows
on the body. Because if you rub up and down

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:24.950
it irritates the skin. So you just smooth
it down like this and you can just leave it

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.369
to soak in. You don't have to rub it all the
way in.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:28.649
 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.819
Cream can be applied many times a day - at
least twice a day but as often as 5 or 6 times

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.189
when eczema is active.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:43.759
For small babies it's often convenient to
apply creams with each nappy change.

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.729
With an older child again apply moisturiser
several times during the day - after a bath

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.529
or shower and then 1 or 2 other times. Apply
the cream and smooth on down the arm or leg

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:59.319
in the direction of the hair growth.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:04.310
Try and involve your child with putting on
their own creams as much as possible so they

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.899
get confident with putting them on themselves
when they're at school.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:09.920
Remember

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.239
Use lots of moisturiser.

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.540
Use it at least twice a day - more if possible.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.140
Use it all over the body, including the face.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.400
If your child still has red, itchy, active
eczema please see your doctor or nurse.
