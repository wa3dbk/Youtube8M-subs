00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It was a dream come true: Miniatur Wunderland was the outbound bet at the show "You Bet!"

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
For years we have hoped for this chance.|

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In the Christmas broadcast of "You Bet!" on Dec. 5th 2009 it happened, at last.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Our 1200 m² layout was turned into a fully equipped TV-studio

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
by the German TV-channel ZDF.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
For the first time in our 9-year history, we had to close the doors to our guests.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
With 7 cameras we were conncted to the AWD-hall in Bremen, and the betting candidate Jürgen Seliger.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Only for this broadcast, altogether 3 km of cable were run, and about 80 spotlights were installed.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The 37-year old merchant from Kempten had to memorize all sights in Miniatur Wunderland,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and assign numerous details to their locations on the layout.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This gigantic challenge was made even more difficult, because the betting candidate had to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
direct the cameras from Bremen via live broadcast to the right locations in Miniatur Wunderland.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Where normally our air conditioning provides fresh air above 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
200.000 figurines, and thousands of miniature buildings, 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
a rail-guided speedcam was installed. Thus, a limitless flyover was possible.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Numerous additional cameras supported Jüregen in finding the images.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Out of 1000 images distributed among the audience, Gottschalk selected five,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
of which Seliger hat to find four.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Without failing once, he mastered this challenge with flying colours.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
He was richly rewarded by the TV audience:

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
67 percent of the people voted clearly for the Allgeaurean super-brain,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
crowning him the betting king of the show.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This was one of the 5 best results

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
ever reached in the 30-year history of  the German "You Bet!"

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
By the way, nothing of the cable-chaos in Wunderland was visible anymore next day,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
because we opened the doors again to our guests, early next morning.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Of course, we did not neglect the opportunity to ask our betting candidate some questions:

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Q: What is it like for you to return to Wunderland?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
A: It is great to come back to Wunderland.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I am returning to friends.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It was very nice here during my learning phase, that's why I

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
will definitely come back to Wunderland as often as possible.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm still not tired of all those details, and will look for all of them again in the future.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I will always keep my treasured memories of Wunderland.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Q: How did it feel to become the betting king?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
A: I have not at all anticipated to win this prize.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
All I cared about was winning my bet.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Everything else was unimportant.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Also, I did not expect to win the car.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I'm still not realizing the whole scope.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Seemingly, a lot of people had fun with this, and I'm happy about that.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
What an exciting night.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We went to the aftershow party, and met all those people there again.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I got so many congratulations and photos.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It was so much fun...and felt just great.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Q: How was it to meet Michelle Huntziker?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
A: You won't ever guess: she's intersted in model railroads.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
She even used to have her own model railroad.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Of course, I immediately offered to help her with it, but it's not a topic anymore.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Q: How did you manage to memorize all those details?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
A: I visualized being on a journey.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
For example, in the Hamburg layout there is an allotment garden area.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
There is a horse patrol woman, probably from a hamburg police series.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
She's sitting on her horse in the middle of the allotment garden area.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Further to the left, there is a pool party with three people.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But there is only one pair of shoes in front of the pool.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I asked myself, what the horse patrol woman is doing there:

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
she's solving the case of the stolen shoes!

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
This way I was able to memorize the images in an order, by visualizing stories about each one.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Let's put it to the test...

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
That one has to be in the Harz region.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
There is a pasture with heaps of bulls.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
This policeman is right in the middle of them.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Ah...baloney - he is in the Knuffingen region...-

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
It's his colleague.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
A bull (Germ coll. for "cop") among bulls.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Layout America! On a platform nearby the Everglades.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
We're looking for these two odd birds.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Here they are, on the platform of the Everglades.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
These are the overweight twins in Scandinavia.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I would say, to the right of the lock keeper.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
We are going to Scandinavia.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Here, the two fat twins in Scandinavia.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Identifiable by this red tie.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
That's our Mafia Killer

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
He's on the top of the Tchibo building in Hamburg.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Let's go!

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
We can't see the detail right now, let's wait a moment until dawn.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Right now, we are strolling past one of my favorite motives:

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The little green ship in the historic warehouse district.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
We're walking towards the Tchibo house.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
There, on top of that roof is the Mafia Killer.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Q: Very good...one last question:

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Will you come and visit us again in the future?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Of course, I will return to Wunderland.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
No doubt!

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I want to visit my old buddies, for example my friend James Dean,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
who is still leaning against that door.
