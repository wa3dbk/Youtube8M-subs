00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.629
We need really versatile pieces of

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:07.980
equipment for what we're doing, because

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.009
we're using loaders as, as loadouts, as

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:12.950
stockpiled machines, and at the face.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.089
We're using them for just for what

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.950
they're designed for, it and they're

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.720
engineered well. Right now we're running

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.400
a 400, we got a 450, and a 500, and then we

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.520
also have a 340 DX excavator. I'd rate

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.990
them as high as any any machines out

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.890
there. Typical day, load several trucks a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.420
day, pushing material into bins, I even

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.490
sort material with it, with a grapple and

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.920
stuff like that. Comfortable cab, good

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.630
heat, air conditioning, just, you know, all

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.430
the good things. Another thing I like

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.510
about its the high lift capability.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.790
Coming over these open top trailers, and

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.620
still have room to go, and be able to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.480
completely dump, I've never experienced

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.510
that before. We have three hydraulic

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.090
loaders, and we've had very, very good

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.680
luck with those machines ever since we

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.440
got 'em. In one year, we put almost 5,000

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.450
hours on a machine. Considering there's

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.550
only 2,000 working hours, we're

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.770
working long days, and double-shifting it.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.460
The machine is very fuel-efficient,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.430
structurally, it's it's a sound machine,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.020
the steel plates that go out to the hinge

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.750
joints, it's a big, heavy chunk of steel,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.659
simple in design, but it works very, very

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.770
well. The loader sees at least six hours

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.810
and sometimes twelve hours of use every day,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.540
but every day, 7 days a week, 365 days a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.820
year, and the loader has not let us down,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.880
you know, cold mornings, hot days, it just

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.940
runs. We didn't know much about the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.950
Doosan when we first got into him, it was

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.549
kind of a, let's try it type thing, and it

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.640
panned out great for us. For value and in

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.840
the power and what we were doing with the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.390
machines, it's, you know, overall it's the

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.130
best machine that we found on the market.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.320
I mean, we're in demo and we work them

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.380
hard, and they stand up to what we're

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.159
doing, you know, it's a great machine. For

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.819
the bulk of my general work, the DX225

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.030
is a 24-ton class machine, and it's the

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.480
excellent size for all general of work.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.830
The operation of it is very

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.799
comfortable, it's very easy to run, it's

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.019
just a great fit, and it just really has

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.630
worked well for me. We're a scrap metal

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.510
processor, we have a Doosan excavator

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.849
with a shear,  and we use it to process

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.450
some of the bigger items, I-beams, we

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.819
shear 'em, make them in the stakes. I

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.799
would say the scrap industry is probably

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.989
the harshest industry for a piece of

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.920
equipment, anywhere. I work my machines

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.870
8-10 hours a day in the harshest

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.739
environment, I mean we punish 'em, I expect it

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.500
to be durable. I run my machines for

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.900
10,000 hours. The durability, I've got

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.690
over 7,000 hours now, and it just runs

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.690
great. It has a power, the weight, the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.859
balance, it is an excellent design. Two

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.930
machines, I've already got over 20,000

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.030
hours on. My third one I've had for three

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.209
years and had no major issues whatsoever,

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.400
end of story. Doosan is known for doing

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.220
what they do and doing it well, and I

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.380
think that says a lot for the fact the

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.160
machines are just plain well-built and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.930
reliable. If you were to take the Doosan

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.650
name off it and just run the loader,

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.970
you'd find a machine that would be

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.380
comparable to any other machine you

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.239
would find and probably even better, and

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.769
then you put the Doosan name on it with

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.260
the guarantee behind it, where you can

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.720
get your parts within 48 hours,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.370
definitely improves your confidence, you

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.989
know, in the manufacturer and in your

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.090
dealer that, you know, if you do have a

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.799
breakdown, which everyone has breakdowns,

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.480
you're going to get the parts you need

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.980
in a reasonable amount of time. We've got very good dealer

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.230
support and in our area, when we need

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.459
something they're right there. That's one

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.900
of the most important things when you

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.790
buy a machine, if you don't have the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.560
support, we count on all our machines,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.890
with them internet parts guarantee is

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.599
is very important, you're not going

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.450
to get hung out there. My experience with

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.870
the local dealer and the parts and the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.000
service, customer support, troubleshooting,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.340
any issues, have been a cinch. The

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.410
manufacturer's saying he's going to be

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.090
committed, then I know I can always get

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.270
parts anytime. You know, it's peace of mind and

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.700
that comes into play, I've had other

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.200
machines where I've had something break

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.460
down and you have to wait for it to get

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.130
shipped around the world, you know

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.320
sometimes the cost of a part or the cost

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.330
of shipping, there's nothing compared to

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.389
the downtime. You know, and as far as

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.120
value, I think it's as good a value you

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.380
can find when you're buying a wheel

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.870
loader. It makes them, you know, a logical

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.240
choice. But the thing is to know that you

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.389
have a company that's been around, and

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.000
is planning on being around.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.530
You have to run what's going to work for

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.440
you, and what makes you money. I mean every time

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.139
I talk to a guy driving the other yellow

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.000
equipment, they always sit there and say,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.130
oh but you don't get your money back. I

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.770
don't buy stuff the resell it, i buy it

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.080
to run it. All of that just is huge in

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.960
the decision when you buy a machine, so

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.750
why not buy a machine from a company

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.849
like that? They're committed to their

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.740
product, you know, they'll be here 10

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.570
years from now. They know what they're

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.599
doing.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.100
you
