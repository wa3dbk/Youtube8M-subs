When he discovers that a boy named Ali is
a very talented batsman, he decides to go

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.810
any length to give Ali proper training.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.680
Ishaan usually looks after day-to-day shop
activities as he has genuine interest in anything

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.680
cricket-related.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.680
Omi: He is the son of the Hindu priest of
the local temple.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.350
His family enjoys great respect among the
people.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.980
Through Omi's parents and maternal uncle,
they readily get a place to start their business.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.239
He is a rather dumb boy and has not many dreams,
but likes to concentrate on having a healthy

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.239
body.

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.319
However, he resents growing up and being a
saint like his father.

He is a religious person and eventually takes
active part in his maternal uncle's religious

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:22.739
politics.

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.099
He is however confused about his religious
views which are mainly influenced by Bittoo

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.099
Mama.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.340
Vidya: She is Ishan's younger sister.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.790

free from the constraints of a typical middle-class

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.040
family and society, to go to Mumbai, do a
course in PR and become independent.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.069
She however despises maths which is required
for her medical entrance exams.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.730
Hence, Ish asks Govind to take her mathematics
tuition.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.290
However, in between their tuition they fall
in love which is kept a secret from everyone.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.220
Only Omi figures out the relationship Govind
and Vidya share and also reminds Govind about

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.689
the consequences of Ish finding out about
the love birds.

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.919
Ali: One of the students in Ish's coaching
classes and a great batsman because of a rare

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:12.550
gift of nature.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.810
However, he doesn't play too much cricket
as he gets tired After 3 or 4 Balls and enjoys

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.700
playing marbles.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.130
He is a Muslim boy and respects Ish like a
Guru.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.829
He too, like Ishaan is patriotic at heart.

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.749

and wants to play in the Indian side.

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:35.540
Bittoo Mama: He is the maternal uncle of Omi.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.530

to rent the place to the three friends for

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.829
the Cricket Shop business.

He is an active member of a Hindu political
Party.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.469
He follows the preachings of Parekh-ji, a
political-cum-spiritual leader and has complete

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:52.019
faith in him.

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.620

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:02.390
Mama is not fond of Govind as he is an agnostic.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.599
He is the main antagonist of the story.

Ali to take his education seriously despite

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.340
his mediocre financial condition.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.940

they go to visit Ali in his house.
