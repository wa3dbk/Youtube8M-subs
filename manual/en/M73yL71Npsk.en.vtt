00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.120
Activity 3 as your first
modelling activity

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.520
we're going to make
this simple chair form,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.920
a scale model of a chair.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You need a corn flake packet

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.480
or some sort of thin cardboard box
to use as a raw material

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.480
and I've redrawn the figure that
appears in your modelling workbook

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.320
on the inside of the cardboard box.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.280
But an easier way of doing this would
be to take a photocopy of the page.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.360
I've done a photocopy of my drawing

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.280
but you could take a photocopy
from the image in the workbook.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.600
Then stick it down
onto the cardboard simply like that

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.920
either using some sort
of simple paper adhesive

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.640
or an aerosol glue.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.720
But I've redrawn it onto the card

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:49.040
so it's a simple case then of cutting
out the shapes from the cardboard.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.760
Try and cut carefully to your lines.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.040
And you want to end up
with three rectangular shapes,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.640
exactly like the three
in the workbook.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.400
We have two sides
and we have the seat and back.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.760
Now to get this to fold
I need to score it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.520
and to score it
I'm going to use my scissors

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.200
and I'm going to use a safety rule.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.600
I put that onto the line
that I've already drawn

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.440
and draw that across like that.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.480
Then this will fold
to give me a seat and back.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.360
So I want to now attach
the seat and back to the side.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.800
So we've got the line that indicates
where it's going to go to.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.560
Simply hold that in place there
with a piece of cellotape.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.760
And simply
wrap that around like that.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.960
Another piece for the junction
of the back rest and the arm.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.520
Trying to get it
as close as I can to the back.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.480
And you simply repeat that procedure
for the other side of the arm.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.840
And here's the one I've made earlier.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.080
You can see there are four bits
of cellotape holding that together

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.240
and we've got our scale model
of a very simple flat-pack chair.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.200
Don't throw that away.
We're going to use that again

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.120
in one of the sketching activities
later in the workbook.
