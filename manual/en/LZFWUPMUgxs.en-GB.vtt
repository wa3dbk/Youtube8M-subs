00:00:01.074 --> 00:00:06.349
But microbes don't only eat oil. Microbes 
is a hard word. Is what I am learning from


00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:10.627
this one. Let's not do microbes again; 
damn biology.


00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.364
For once, it's best not to be special.
Here's to being part of the herd.

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:21.072
That's terrible. The closest thing we have
to a law governing space is the outer

00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:26.562
space treaty: a law first drawn up in...oh
damnit what it where...

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.619
If a trait helps an organism produce
offsprings...if a trait for an organism

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:40.279
helps... Evidence from chimpanzees 
exist...it exists.


00:00:40.377 --> 00:00:47.317
This suggests that the ancestor err ahha.
A test, a deadline at work, a difficult

00:00:47.317 --> 00:00:53.087
conversation...a traffic jam...I don't 
know why I am having trouble here.

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:57.659
Ahh...the autumn season...crisp
temperatures...awh man

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.589
The autumn season: crisp weather, layers
of clothing and the beautiful color

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:19.129
trees; it's okay. So chimps who have less 
gray matter...oh...???????????

00:01:19.336 --> 00:01:26.376
Visi...no. Journeying into the valley
often elicits an emotional err...damnit


00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:31.276
As well as the kinds of sugar an amino 
acid that you go into the reaction. You go


00:01:31.342 --> 00:01:36.032
into a reaction? Exoplanets are faint and 
tiny; so must are directed by in-detect

00:01:36.032 --> 00:01:41.672
methods...in-detect? But the most
immediate consequences of sleep

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:46.025
deprivation is that we can think as well 
and some rechearchs...re - chearchearchers


00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:50.975
What's a rechearhs? It can relieve stress,
bla...sorry. It can relieve stress, lower

00:01:50.975 --> 00:02:00.625
ba...God, I can't. It can lower blood 
pressure. Is it Nevadah or Navadah? Ahh...

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:08.115
If you pull lightly on the slingshot, the 
projectile won't go very far.

00:02:08.115 --> 00:02:18.205
(plays ukulele). Feel that, it's manmade 
earthquake...want me to do it again. I

00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:23.585
hope no one ever sees this video. Why does
orange juice...oh bleep...why I put it

00:02:23.585 --> 00:02:32.495
down? Greater force equals greater 
distance. I was just gonna... okay. For

00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:37.625
Scientifc American, instant egg...
What's it called? For Scientific American,

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:45.935
Tina Finemaryn. For Acientfic American...
For Scientific American, 60 second egghead

00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:51.285
, I'm Larry Greenmyer...cut. For 60 second
...sigh. (Whisper) For Scientific American

00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:59.555
, instant egghead, I'm John Matson. Can I
do it again? Yeah. Good. You gonna keep


00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:03.555
keep all these outtakes right.
conclusion: (background music).
