Hi, This is Dave for Expert Village. Today
we’re going to make some Cornish game hens

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.390
with autumn fruits. So now we’ll make the
marinade for our Cornish game hens with fall

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.420
fruits. Uh, what we’ll need to do first,
is add our wet ingredients, so we want a half

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:27.349
a cup of red wine vinegar.
This marinade will make enough for four whole

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:40.330
game hens, we want a quarter of a cup of olive
oil, you want 2 tablespoons of dried oregano,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:50.600
I’m just going to, a couple of large pinches,
will be enough. I’m going to add salt and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.070
pepper, now this is just to taste, but we’ll
just, I like to be a little medium with the

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.939
salt, you can always add more later if you
need to. Black pepper, we’re going to need

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.859
about, oh, I’d say just half a teaspoon
or so of that as well, because you can always

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:24.499
add that as well later. OK, we’ll add the
apricots right in, this is about a cup, a

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:33.840
cup of pitted prunes. These are going to add
great sweet flavor to the dish. We’re going

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.840
to put in, oh, about half a cup of the olives
and you can even add some of the, some of

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.770
the juice to it, that’s going to be just
fine. That’s going to add a nice, little

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.909
bit of a bitter flavor to it as well. That’s
going to taste very well with everything else.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:02:00.460
OK we’re going to add our chopped garlic;
this is about four cloves or so, and add some

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:13.750
capers, and along with some of their juice,
and now we’ll take care of all the ingredients

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.610
just for the marinade.
