00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.560
Part of composing or putting together a production

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.459
is the recording of real instruments such as
Vocals, Guitar, or Bass.

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:11.950
Pro Tools SE makes this process quick,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.229
easy, and fun.

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:15.849
So from the Quick Start Menu

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.880
I'm going to open up my original MIDI session,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.849
when it comes up, you can see my tracks.

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.490
There's the MIDI region that we applied Swing to.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.599
We also applied swing to the drum loop, but not the drum fill.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.239
and also to our other loop.

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.000
let's just take a listen so what we've got so far.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.990
So I'm going to record a real bass guitar on the mono
track that was already in our session.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.900
I'll just move it to the top of the Track list.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.600
I'll double-click it and give it a name.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.330
By naming your tracks ahead of time, you'll
find it easier to manage your session

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.720
as it gets bigger.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.780
Now I need to set the correct input to record from.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.060
I'm using a Fast Track which has a Mic input for channel 1,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.890
and a Line, or Instrument input for channel 2.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.310
My Bass is plugged into the instrument channel, which
is input two,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.880
so I'll choose input two on the track.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.020
I'll Record enable the track and test my Bass level.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.050
Now the level is a bit on the low side so I'm going to 
turn the gain knob up on the top

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.000
of the Fast Track. Until my level is louder with more Pre Amp gain. 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.060
Now that's too much.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.799
You can hear it clipping the Input.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.000
Back it off just a bit.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.400
Now that sounds great.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.390
So I'm going to just record from on the top of the track

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.220
so up to the Transport, hit Record,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.220
and then off we go.

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.769
Hit Spacebar to end the recording,

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.489
you can now see the recorded region,

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.489
let's take a listen to playback.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.989
Nice!

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.640
Now I'm a bit unsure about the second half of the recording

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.529
so I'll just position the Insertion point at bar five,

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:07.000
and then press Number Pad 3 to start recording again.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.010
Spacebar to Stop,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.269
and Spacebar to listen to Playback.

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:37.329
Now another type of recording is Loop recording.

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.969
I want to just concentrate on these four bars of my arrangement,

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.870
I'll make a selection of represents the portion

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.489
that I want to work on.

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.819
And then I'll press Number Pad 5 to engage Loop Record,

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.099
and Number Pad 4

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.439
to engage Loop Playback.

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:00.000
You see the Transport Icons change to indicate this.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Pass number two.

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.000
And something different again.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.039
Spacebar will end the Recording.

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:39.360
So now you can right-click directly on the region itself and
choose from any one of those 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.010
three distinctly different takes.

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:52.800
And if I don't like that particular pass, I can right-click

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.860
and choose another take. Take Two.

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:08.979
Now when you finished the recording process
don't forget to take the track out of

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.789
Record ready. A good habit to get into.

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.960
I'll finish off by selecting the tail end of the recording
with the Selector Tool,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.960
and then I'll just delete it.
