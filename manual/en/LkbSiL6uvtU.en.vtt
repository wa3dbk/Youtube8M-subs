00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.180
We want to divide a decimal by a whole number.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.000
Here we have four point three divided by two. Here we have

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.380
seven point eight, three divided by nine.  Remember division can be expressed in several ways.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.160
To divide a decimal by a whole number, we'll first rewrite this

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.320
as a long division problem. So we'll have four point three

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.720
divided by

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.800
two. And this is a pretty  straightforward process when dividing by a whole number.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.860
What we need to do is take this decimal point and move it up into our quotient.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.780
Once we do this we can divide as we
normally would.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.340
We first asked how many twos there are in four, that would be two.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.000
Two times two is four, and now we subtract,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.600
that would be zero. And now that we already have our decimal point in our quotient,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.360
we go ahead ignore it so we'll just bring down the next digit, which is three.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.440
And now need to determine how many twos there are in three, and that would be one.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.400
One times two is two, then we subtract, and that would be one.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.960
But when dividing a decimal by a whole number,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.840
we can't use the remainder notation. We have to keep dividing

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.580
until this decimal either terminates or starts to repeat.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.180
So the way we do that is we can add extra zeros here

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.120
on the end of four point three. Remember  adding a zero to what would be the hundredths place value,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.119
is not going to change the value of four point three. So once we add this digit we can

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.139
bring it down,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.580
and then ask many twos there are in ten? Well there are five twos in ten,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.960
two times five is ten, and now when we subtract, the differences is zero,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.040
so we're done, which means this decimal is terminating,

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:51.760
and the quotient is two point one, five, or two and fifteen hundredths.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.360
Our second example is written in fraction form,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.300
but our fraction bar does represent
division. So we'll set this up in the same

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.820
way. we have seven

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.080
point eight, three divided by nine.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.800
And again as long as we're dividing by a whole number,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.260
we just need to move the decimal point up into our quotient,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.700
and then we can divide as we normally
would, disregarding the decimal.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.280
So we first need to determine how many nines there would be in seventy-eight,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.580
that would be eight because eight times nine is seventy-two.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.280
As long as this difference is less than
nine we know this eight is correct.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.200
So we have six and this would be zero.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.220
Bring down the next digit which is three. And now we ask, how many nines there are

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.120
in sixty-three, that would be seven.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.580
Seven times nine is sixty-three, this difference is zero.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.940
We've used all the digits so we're done. So this quotient is equal to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.320
point eight, seven, or eighty-seven hundredths.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.380
And often what you'll see text books do is put a zero in the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:08.140
ones column. It's not required but sometimes we'll see it written like this

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.300
In the next video, we'll take a look at how we divide us decimal by another decimal.
