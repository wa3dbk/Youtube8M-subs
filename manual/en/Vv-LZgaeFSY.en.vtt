00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.300
The CT Tech brings Airo in.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.980
In our situation, they bring it in the night before.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.570
We have marks on the floor showing

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.230
whether it’s head first or feet first and I post it appropriately.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.100
Generally, the table and the scanner are in the room while the nurses are setting up.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.440
At that point, anesthesia brings the patient in on a gurney

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.560
and they will anesthetize the patient because the vast majority of our cases we’re doing prone.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.880
Once all the IVs have been started and the foley has been inserted,

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.550
we turn the patient to the prone position on the Trumpf table

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.160
and we do a collision check.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.880
The instruments can be calibrated anywhere along the procedure.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.980
For us, it varies. Sometimes they are calibrated while we’re positioning the patient

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.320
and the nurse will calibrate the instruments at that time.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.360
There are other times that it may be done while we’re prepping and draping,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.260
or it could be done while we’re exposing the spine.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.840
So, all the instruments are calibrated before we’re ready to actually use them.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.560
If we’re going to do a percutaneous case, we have two options.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.040
My preference is to attach the clamp at the spinous process.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.060
I’ll make a small incision and attach the clamp to that.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.460
An alternative is to place two pins in the iliac crest.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.640
Once the patient is prepped and draped and the clamp is attached, we’re ready to scan.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.720
We’ll then place a clear plastic drape

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.470
over the patient and we have the anesthesiologist move the table

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.830
to the pre-set positon for scanning.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.940
Once the table is in the scan position,

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.360
everybody leaves the room except for the nurse anesthetist

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.570
who has lead on, and they would step back from the table

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.410
and do the actual scan while everybody else was outside of the room.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.560
We then return to the room,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.190
reposition the scanner and the table and take the drape off.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.760
By the time we have done that, the images would have been sent to

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.440
the Brainlab navigation system and we would be ready to implant screws.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.720
It’s important that you check with the pointer on known anatomical landmarks

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.560
and make sure that it is as accurate as you want.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.230
Then reposition the table to the operative position and you’re ready to operate and insert screws.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.090
On average it takes 6-8 minutes.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.180
Generally, at the end of the case, I’ll take an X-Ray to check the position of the screws,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.860
but I would not re-scan. If anywhere along the line I’m concerned about any of the screws

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.540
then I will re-scan at the end.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.780
If I do re-scan, I usually re-scan at 10-20% less than what the original scan was.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.000
For me, the advantage of Airo is

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.020
that it’s a true 32-slice CT scanner.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.440
That means there is less scatter radiation

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.160
and better image quality than the cone
beam systems

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.040
Along with that being a true CT scanner, Airo allows a larger field of view.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.340
For example, I could scan from the skull down to the sacrum

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.810
and it takes about 45 seconds to do the entire scan.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.650
It also allows me to adjust radiation dosage by working with Airo.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.220
It allows me to have lesser radiation dosage for patients.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.320
And it’s got the largest bore of any of the scanners that’s out there.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.230
With that, I don’t have to compromise how I position the patient

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.650
in order to be able to scan intraoperatively.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.800
And the image quality;

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.840
to date, I have not found a patient or part of the spine I have not been able to image adequately

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.820
using intraoperative CT with Airo.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.500
And finally it allows auto registration.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.060
From the time I scan to the time I’m ready to put in screws is a matter of seconds

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.990
because Airo auto registers.
