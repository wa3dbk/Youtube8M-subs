00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.880
So let's check out the beauty of Ipe Lumber

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.150
it's dark, dense and does a fantastic job in
outdoor projects

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.480
 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.469
 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.189
and what's it like to work with?

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.939
well, keep watching and we'll show you.

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.330
The primary applications for ipe are
flooring, decking,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.929
and patio furniture

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.800
but it has its place in other fine
projects like this carved letter opener

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.000
and cutting boards

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.300
here, ipe is used as an accent to other
exotic woods

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.910
and though it makes excellent woodwork the ipe tree is known throughout central and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.850
south america as an ornamental tree
with bright yellow flowers

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.610
because ipe is so dense and heavy it
might make you think it's terrible to work with

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.640
but that's not entirely true

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.080
we're going to test it out

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.000
grazing the surface on a planer with a helical head this ipe board never

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.530
chipped out

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.530
using a dedicated twenty-four-tooth
ripping blade watch how smoothly ipe rips

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.770
there are no burns

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.700
Just a nice, clean edge

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.090
and watch what happens when we switch
to a sixty-tooth cross-cutting blade

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.090
to make a cross cut

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.320
i'd say that's a pretty good result

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.710
you want to see how it does in a router?
check this out

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.710
Here's a three eighths inch round over

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.080
A good quality carbide-tipped router bit does a really nice job

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.680
okay... let's test some finishes.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.760
we'll try two different finishes no
stains, no dyes. Here's a clear Danish

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.760
Oil, which is a blend of tung oil and varnish.

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:28.439
on the other end of this board, we'll wipe on a shellac sanding sealer and then

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.059
spray three coats of satin lacquer

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.709
now that everything's dry, let's
compare them

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.539
The oil finish really enhances that bold
chocolate color

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:45.359
but check out what lacquer does

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.969
spray lacquer goes on very smoothly and
it likes to bring out that hint of

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.799
green color that you see in the wood

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.829
