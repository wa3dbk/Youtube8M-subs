00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:18.080
I came here two years ago and I came with
Richard De Aragues who made Closer to the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.119
Edge, you know the Isle Of Man TT Documentary
which was just phenomenal you know as we were

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.310
walking through, he was kid of, this god that
had made this wonderful movie so it was a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.100
great kind of entrance into the TT and I think
like a lot of things, the first time you come

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.970
here it gets into your blood and all you want
to do is come back, you of all people know

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.340
that, but then watching the guys go round
is just, its a brutal race, you know the seniors

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.670
today 6 laps 2 hours.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.699
You know a lot of people say to you that when
you go to the TT for the first time, it is

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:57.150
going to blow your mind, its indescribable,
the experience and you go, yeah well sure

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.400
whatever but we went down to ago's leap down
here and it's amazing because to get to this

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.350
lady's little place, which is a gate with
concrete walls everywhere and then there is

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.960
a foot pavement with a curb that is just about
that high and the riders are going bombing

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.000
past anyway so you go through people's gardens,
you know you go through five or six gardens,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.690
we walked though and there was a couple eating
their lunch and you sort of go hi, anyway

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:32.160
so you end up in this girl's driveway and
she gives you a pint of lager and you sit

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.560
there and we're all chatting about walking
and someone says, ok there coming and you

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.940
hear this noise and they come down Bray hill
and around that little right hander which

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.070
looks like nothing but when you are going
fast and they come and i swear to god that

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.560
where you and I are, this far away from you
and I comes John McGuiness on the back wheel

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.000
just screaming past at 170 (274kph), 180 (290kph)
miles per hour that was the first time and

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.750
I was in shock absolute shock my hand was
shaking, I couldn't believe what I had just

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.110
seen, I just think its Bonkers.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.970
It's great being a spectator here as well
isn't it.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.970
A lot more relaxing.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.200
And if you don't mind me asking, what is it
about motorcycles that you love?

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.629
I don't know, it's funny because my dad and
his dad never rode motorbikes and my mums

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:29.709
side, no one ever rode motorbikes and I suppose
I can bring it all the way down to my mate

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.440
Tommy Rockford in Ireland where I grew up
and he had a Maaco, I think it was a Maaco

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.969
400 and those were the bikes in the day and
I convinced him, I was only tiny and I convinced

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:47.599
him to let me go on the motorbike and I heard
this 2 stroke engine and I was too small to

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.569
touch my feet on the ground so he put me on
the bike and stuck it in first gear and I

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.159
went around this field a few times and then
fell off and that was it, I was hooked for

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:01.169
life but I think when you travel on a motorcycle,
do long distances on a motorcycle, you go

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:07.010
to other countries, I think it's an amazing
way to use it.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.549
Yo go to Africa on the motorbike and you stop
in a village and you are part of the environment,

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.829
so to stop and ask directions, you are in
their environment, so people are immediately

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.310
interested in who you are, where you are coming
from, where you are going and all that kind

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.739
of stuff and if turn up in a land rover or
a jeep you stop and you have to get out of

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.109
your environment into their environment, you
are already one removed, so I think your experience

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:40.530
on a motorcycle is much richer and that it
is harder, when it rains, it rains, when it

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.329
is dusty, you really feel it, I just love
it, can't think of anything better.
