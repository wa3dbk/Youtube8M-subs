00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.760
Hello and welcome to Cupcake Addiction's Harry
Potter Sorting Hat Tutorial where I'll be

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.620
showing you how to make this great Sorting
Hat cupcake from Harry Potter.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.010
Tools and equipment that we will be using
today:

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.289
I've got some red buttercream frosting. Now
I've used our perfectly pipeable buttercream

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.760
frosting. We do have a recipe for that on
our channel My Cupcake Addiction so I'll leave

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.350
a link for that in the description box below.
I've dyed it a vibrant red. For those of your

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.320
that follow the channel, you know my favorite
red in the world is AmeriColor Tulip red.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.472
It's fantastic and vibrant and gets me the
best red color for my buttercream. I've got

00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:41.300
that in a disposable piping bag and I've paired
it with the Loyal number 20 piping nozzle.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.670
But any nice, round, smooth piping nozzle
will do.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.239
I've got a cupcake ready to ice.
I've got just a knife.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.440
I've got a piece of fudge. This is soft fudge.
I've used caramel fudge there. But you can

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.309
also use chocolate if you want your Sorting
Hat to be a little bit darker.

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.100
And a piece of baking paper or greaseproof
paper.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.940
Firstly, we want to take our piece of caramel
fudge. And you'll see there how easy it is

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.281
just to push it out of shape. So it's not
a caramel chew. It's quite a bit softer and

00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:13.670
quite a bit easier to work with. And I just
want to give it a little knead. Don't overwork

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.300
it. You just want it to be pliable. But if
you overwork it, it will start to get quite

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.540
soft. So what we're going to do, after we've
got it in a nice little ball is you want to

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.940
tear off that 1/3 of the ball. So you should
have a ball about 2/3 the size of the larger

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:37.790
ball, and one about 1/3. Maybe just a touch
more on that small one.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.100
So we're going to take the smaller ball first
of all and just roll it into a ball and push

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.470
it out. So push it out with your fingers and
then you can just pull it and maneuver it.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.960
So this is going to be the bottom of our Sorting
Hat or the brim of our Sorting Hat. And you

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.250
do want that to be quite wide. So you'll see
here, I'm just pulling it. Now the Sorting

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.110
Hat is very kind of old and saggy and... So
it doesn't need to be a perfect circle which

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.159
is why I'm not opting for a circle cutter
or anything like that for this.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.420
Place that down on your piece of baking paper
and just lift up some of the little sort of

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.849
edges off it, give it that floppy kind of
a look.

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.540
Now we're going to take the other 2/3 of our
piece of caramel fudge. Roll it into a ball

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.150
and then using the palm of your hands just
taper it down into a bit of a cone shape.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.170
Take your cone. Give it a good hit on the
table. That's going to give us a nice, flat

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.209
bottom on the cone. And we're going to fashion
this into the top of the Sorting Hat. So to

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:46.842
do that, I'm going to start with the tip and
I'm just going to bend it over. So that you

00:02:46.842 --> 00:02:50.370
can see it from the front. This is going to
be the front of my Sorting Hat.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.269
Now I want to do the mouth. So I'm going to
take that knife and I'm going to cut a nice

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:04.450
kind of a grumpy looking hole in his face.
So I'm going to cut it quite deep. And then

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.360
I'm going to push him back down on to it.
So you can see there, as I'm pushing, I'm

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.249
just pulling those, the sides of that mouth
down so he's looking nice and grumpy as he

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:16.739
is.
And then I'm going to take my little fingers

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.330
and I'm just going to make an indent there
for one eye and an indent there for the other

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.010
eye. Now using the back of my knife, because
I want this to be fatter than the mouth, thicker

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:37.919
than the mouth. I am just going to take my
tip and just push it in there.

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.550
Now you can take your knife and just give
him a few kind of just wrinkles around the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.610
place. And don't worry if he starts to push
out of shape a little bit because we're going

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.319
to shape him onto our little piece of fudge.
So I just popped a few wrinkles on the back.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.019
Make sure with his... the top of his hat too
that it is kind of tilting around so that

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.980
you can see it from the front. You want to
see the tip of that hat from the front so

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.560
people know what he is.
Now take that. And you shouldn't need anything

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.499
to affix it because the caramel fudge will
be quite soft and quite sticky. So pick the

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:12.909
best side of your brim that you want to have
facing forward and sit him down.

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:18.580
Once he's down, just take your fingers and
just gently push around the edges so that

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:26.800
he attaches nicely. You don't really want
to blend it in or anything.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.920
There you've got your really cool Harry Potter
Sorting Hat. Now I would ideally put that

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.080
back in the fridge for about 5 minutes just
because we've been handling that caramel fudge

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.560
and it will be quite soft. I'm not going to
because I'm hopeful that I will get it off

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.510
that piece of greaseproof paper, definitely
do put it on the greaseproof paper though.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.160
I'm going to stick it straight onto the cupcake.
I opted for red, yellow, and blue for my Harry

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.230
Potter-themed cupcake because Harry Potter's
scarf is red and yellow and the snitch lives

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.730
in the skies so blue seems appropriate.
So I'm just going to do one of our lovely

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.750
low swirls and we've got a whole tutorial
dedicated to this. I'm going to just take

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.760
it up a little bit higher than I normally
would. Pick your best side for your low swirl.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:15.790
And it is going to be as easy as pulling that
Sorting Hat off and pushing him down onto

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.030
the cupcake.
So there you've got a fantastically easy Harry

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.041
Potter Sorting Hat cupcake, the perfect companion
to our snitch cupcake and our Harry Potter

00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:30.470
broom and glasses cupcake.
We hope you've enjoyed this tutorial as much

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.000
as we've enjoyed making it for you and thank
you very much for watching.
