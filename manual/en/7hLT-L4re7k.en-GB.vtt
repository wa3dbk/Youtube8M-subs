00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.069
I could stand here and tell you facts like
most processed foods with vanilla flavouring

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.340
actually get their flavour from a beaver's
anal gland and wee but we're going to get

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.570
more serious right now. Here are the things
you should know, that corporations don't want

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.820
you to know.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.710
Let's take a look at one of the biggest, most
controversial food corporations -- Monsanto.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.619
They're responsible for providing roughly
90% of genetically modified organism seeds

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:36.080
in the world. Being GMOs means they can produce
their own pesticide and survive toxic herbicides.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.180
Toxic herbicides that Monsanto also sell,
such as the weed killer RoundUp.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.530
But get this. President Barack Obama passed
the Monsanto Protection Act in 2013 which

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.109
granted immunity to GMOs in federal courts
meaning that if future research reveals and

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:58.910
proves that GMOs can cause significant health
problems, well, nothing can be done to stop

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.960
the spread, use or sales.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.620
One last thing you might not know... Monsanto
are responsible for spending 46 million dollars

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.540
alongside other huge corporations to kill
Proposition 37, which would have made labelling

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.180
GMO foods in the US compulsory. This makes
the US the only developed country in the world

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.990
to not tell people whether what they're eating
is GMO or not.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.880
You may be lured in by natural, organic products
that promise the grass is greener on the other

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.290
side but there are traps in this long grass.
Some of these companies are just subsidiaries

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.469
of other large corporations, such as our favourite
bad news giver, Monsanto. Big corporations

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.860
buy smaller companies and thus increase their
market shares and power.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.820
For example, only four companies worldwide
are responsible for breeding factory-farmed

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.820
chickens.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.289
Here's just a glimpse into some of the companies
you might have thought represented the individual,

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.079
that actually don't.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.030
Coca Cola owns Vitamin Water, Minute Maid,
Honest Tea

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.329
General Mills owns Nature Valley

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.189
Heinz owns Weightwatchers

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.149
Nestle owns Pelligrino and Perrier

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.950
PepsiCo owns Tropicana, Quaker and Naked Juice

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.240
If you want to see the full list, check that
out in the link in the description below.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.940
Millions of antibiotics are fed to animals
in factory farms for growth enhancement, a

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.360
technique that has long been FDA-approved.
In Germany, one third of antibiotics sold

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.180
are used in animal production, in China one
half, in the US eight times more antibiotics

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.930
are used in factory farms than in hospitals.
This is important to us because it increases

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.989
our resistance to antibiotics and in doing
so increases the risk of incurable infections.

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.440
The World Health Organisation says this is
one of the most serious threats for human

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.440
health.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.670
A new report from the Natural Resources Defense
Council gathered FDA documents under the Freedom

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.110
of Information Act that revealed that 30 potentially
harmful antibiotics remained on the market

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.879
in order to feed the animals.

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.760
Avinash Kar, an attorney for the NRDC states
"The FDA knew the risks, but they still haven't

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.970
done anything to revoke the approval of these
drugs." The FDA's response has been to phase

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.879
out all medically important antimicrobials,
but they've called it 'voluntary' for which

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.440
they have been criticised.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.980
Millions of farmers and agricultural workers
are poisoned by pesticides every year -- an

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.380
estimated 40,000 of them fatally - although
many go unreported. These agricultural workers

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.629
also include 132 million or 70% of all working
children worldwide.

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.209
With many of these farmers being undocumented
immigrants, a survey in New Mexico revealed

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.689
that workers were told if they didn't work
directly with pesticides they would lose their

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.129
jobs.

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.689
Occupational and Environmental Health Director
of Farmworker Justice Virginia Ruiz has said

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:03.629
even though the workers could take precautions,
"the close proximity of agricultural fields

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.659
to residential areas and schools makes it
nearly impossible for farm workers and their

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:14.860
families to escape exposure because pesticides
are in the air they breathe and the food they

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.870
eat, and the soil where they work and play."

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.170
It's not only pesticides. Marine life is being
wiped out due to over-use of fertiliser. The

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.910
2008 journal "Science Daily" reported that
around the globe about 400 coastal regions,

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.850
covering an area equal to that of the UK,
were dead because of fertiliser causing toxicity

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.340
by releasing ammonia into the water.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.690
The typical fast food burger is made from
the bits of rubbish meat left over from the

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.740
good stuff. Some of you may know this although
you will put it to the back of your mind.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.410
What you might not know is that by smacking
these off cuts together, bacteria like e.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.010
Coli can thrive, so they clean it off. With
ammonia.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.800
The USDA lets a company called Beef Products
pipe the raw meat and expose it to ammonia

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.090
gas. The ammonia poisoning our marine life,
is also used in the food we eat.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.170
"This is not a health issue.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.540
This is not a health issue this is an 'I'm
grossed out by this' issue." Reminds me of

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.550
a certain beavers anal gland...

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.060
A few major global companies dictate what
goes in the food chain, whether it's prices,

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.170
working conditions, expulsion from land, patents
on seeds, and even in some cases government

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.850
policies.
