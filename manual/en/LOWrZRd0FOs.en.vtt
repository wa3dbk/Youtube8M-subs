Cars.com Auto Review

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.790
hi I'm Kelsey Mays for cars dot com
minivan segment is something a shrinking

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.320
one but

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.960
Toyota thinks it's up to see a comeback
and hopes you can snag a bigger chunk of

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.920
those buyers with it

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.560
redesigned 2011 Sienna we have a video
from the LA Auto Show where this was

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.220
introduced

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.840
talking about some of the mini-vans
anterior aspect there and take you

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.200
through

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.529
some of our initial driving impressions
and talk about partnering 30 will offer

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.869
the

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.260
outgoing Sienna's 3.5 liter 6

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.540
just gonna be a four-cylinder engine
which is pretty rare for me

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.640
we driven both them they matched to a
six-speed automatic transmissions

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.720
kinda has a tendency to hunt for Gears a
little bit

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.040
fortunately the v6 has enough power to
overcome that is really

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.800
passing power and he's being as a nice
early exhaust note

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.640
quicker I think in the AFC for five-year
Honda Odyssey

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.829
as quick as perhaps the four leader
Chrysler Town and Country

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.470
before summer comes from the Highlander
crossover and

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.570
manza wagon actually there's enough
power around town soberly the London

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.240
that does sound a little raspy year not
quite as ever find this year

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.369
reading hard on the only time we really
so what we want more power those on the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.069
highway where high-speed 60 to 70 miles
per hour

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.859
passing kinda runs the engine Osteen in
the last Sienna

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.469
ride quality years really x1 the things
we r

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:28.390
crazy about the brake pedal does seem a
bit much

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.659
did notice road noise on the highway
just seems to be a little bit too much

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.220
power steering assist at highway speeds
during field but lose

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.170
takes a few too many corrections stay on
course there's a sport-tuned

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.200
s the model which has difference during
T and that might address on those issues

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.369
third row seats fold flat into the floor

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.690
nomad their mini vans he's been doing
this for quite a while we are impressed

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.330
by how

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.790
well do them I mean is all pretty easy

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.440
there you got a flat load floor if you
need more cargo in the second row seat

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.680
go up like this new lock in the places
for

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.610
forward anchored position they're
awesome removable player says maximum

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.869
cargo volume: about 250 cubic feet it's
pretty impressive

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.690
in for many men so this unit comes
through on utility

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.620
and remains were the more comfortable
mini-vans out there you can get past the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.130
stigma

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.180
owning quintessential my mobile
certainly is worth a look
