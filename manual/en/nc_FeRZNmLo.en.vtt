Hi, my name is Dave Andrews, today I'm going
to show you how to format a hard drive in

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:24.489
Linux. Let's go to our Linux command line.
And the very first thing we're going to do

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:35.450
is do a change directory to the slash DEV
folder. Let's do an LS and do SD star. This

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.890
shows you the drives that are connected. I
have SDA which is our first hard drive, the

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.920
primary one, and it has several partitions.
I then have SDB which is our second hard drive.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:58.250
I'm going to format SDB. To do so, let's run
the CF disk command by saying pseudo CF disk,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:07.479
and then a slash S - DEV slash SDB. This opens
up the partition drive - partition table for

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.780
our second hard drive. Move an arrow over
to select over. We want to create a primary

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.420
partition. It fills the entire drive. After
we've made that, let's just select write and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:32.240
say yes. That writes the partition table to
our second disk. Once it's done writing, select

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.350
quit. Now we're back to the command line.
What we're going to do now is format that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:49.260
hard drive. So you want to do pseudo MKFS
which is Make File System, space, and then

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:57.939
SDB one, which is the first partition on hard
drive B. That has just formatted our new hard

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:07.629
drive. My name is Dave Andrews, and I've just
showed you how to format a hard drive in Linux.
