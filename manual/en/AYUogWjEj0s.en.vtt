ery

00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:05.104
reminiscent of your tattooing.

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:06.605
It's strong line weights.

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:09.108
Everything is very sharp
when it comes to your outlines.

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:11.511
Overall, the design
is lined up nicely.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.545
(Dave)
Craig.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:13.679
(Chris)
The detail on the kanji is nice.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.114
I like the depth,
cutting out the clay,

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:17.050
give it some strength
and weight to it.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.619
The lines on the ends
of the arms and the legs

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.421
seem pretty rapidly
scratched in.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.090
The craftsmanship could have
been a little cleaner.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.658

Dave.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.527
(Oliver)
I'm having a hard time
with how light the flowers are.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.729
They're really hard to read
from any sort of distance.

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:32.465
What's missing here is
really hard cut-in angles

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.000
just to give 'em
the craftsmanship

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.736
and the finished look
of getting a clean line.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:37.970
(Dave)
Duffy.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.505
One of the things I like
about your design,

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:42.108
they don't always have to be
straight lines to be effective,

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:46.212
and the depths of your lines are
very deliberate and symmetrical,

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:49.982
so it really gives this thing
a standout look from a distance.

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:51.317
Kruseman.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:52.718
(Chris)
Great use of the space.

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:55.220
I like the way that you used
the tools for different effects.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.490
And overall,
the craftsmanship is very strong

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.958
because of the depths,
the cutouts,

00:00:58.958 --> 00:00:59.959
the different line weights.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:00.960
It's a really strong piece.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.463
Thank you very much.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:04.697
(Dave)
Kito.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:05.698
(Oliver)
The amount of depth
you were able

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.066
to cut out of this thing
and keep it

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.136
as clean and crisp as it is,
it's very sharp,

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.338
gives it a lot
of dynamic shadowing

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.607
that just makes it
very legible from a distance.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.976
- Strong look.
- I appreciate it.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:18.243
(Dave)
Big Ceeze.

00:01:18.243 --> 00:01:19.845
(Oliver)
From a distance,
it's hard to read,

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:21.547
but it has
a very unfinished look to it.

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:23.482 align:end position:100%
I mean, I'm not a sculptor,
you know.

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.484
If you would have varied
your line weights a little bit

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:28.354
to make the images stronger
so that it's not all the same,

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.290
then it wouldn't be
as camouflage.

In a medium that you've
never used before,

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.860 line:0%
attempting a koi fish

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.798 line:0%
and a lot of intricate
Japanese detailed subject matter

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:41.701 line:0%
was absolutely the worst way
of going about this.

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:47.306
Today, we're testing lines
on Dogu sculptures.

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:49.275
Who excelled in your mind
today, Oliver?

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.643
(Oliver)
Definitely Chris.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.712
The attention to detail
inside the big cutouts

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:53.979
took a lot of work.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.648
(Oliver)
It looks like
a manufactured piece.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:58.150
I definitely think that Matt's
stands out strong to me.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.919
(Chris)
The water was
incredibly simple,

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.455
but it's some of the best water
we've seen, ever.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:05.825
(Dave)
Kruseman gave us some
impressive work on this thing.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:08.228
(Chris)
His layout, both front and back,
were very beautiful.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.729
We've seen Kruseman struggle
in these flash challenges

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.732
in the past,
and maybe this is the rebirth

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:14.200
in Kruseman
in this competition.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.035
I think Kruseman
turned it on today.

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:17.469
We gotta pick it down
to a win.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:18.971
- We all agreed?
- Yeah.

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:20.907
- Let's let 'em know.
- All right.

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:25.311 align:end position:100%
Today, you had to create
an elaborate design

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.480 align:end position:100%
on an ancient
Japanese figure.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.182
The judges have decided

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:31.718
the winner of today's
flash challenge is...
