00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.160
First we're going to shell our shrimp. The
best way to do that is by the legs. you just

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.020
release the membranes all the way down to
the final shell. You want to leave the last

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.990
one and the tail on for this particular dish,
for presentation purposes. We'll do that to

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:30.869
all the shrimp, just like so. It peels off
really easy if you run your finger down and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:49.600
release all the legs, just like that.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.120
What you can do with the shells, what I do,
I use the shells for a seafood stock. For

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.230
this particular dish I'm not going to do that
because we have a lot of seafood to work with,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.860
so there will be a lot of flavor in our stock.
What I usually do, if I don't need the shells,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.240
shrimp shells or lobster shells, I'll wrap
them up and freeze them. So if you're ever

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.130
making a seafood sauce, a bisque, or what
have you, you can use these shells as a base.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.220
You can cook them off in butter, add water,
and just let it reduce, and you'll have a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.930
real nice fish stock. It's a good start for
any seafood soup or bisque. Now we're going

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.799
to clean the shrimp. What you need to do is
cut down the back side, and then you clean

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.490
out any debris that might be in there. How
you can tell that it's the back side of the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.140
shrimp, this is the inside, this is the back
side. The best way to cut the shrimp without

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.009
cutting yourself, a lot of people try to be
fancy with the knife, like this. What I do,

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.049
I place the base of the knife on the cutting
board, and I don't pick it up, I leave it

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.130
like this. That way you have more control
of the knife, more control of the shrimp;

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:25.879
and you just pick it up, like so. Just like
that. We have the shrimp cut, and this is

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.760
what we're cleaning out. This is pretty much
waste from the shrimp. You don't want that,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.950
it's very gritty so try to make it a point
to clean this out. We'll just run it under

00:02:38.950 --> 00:03:10.610
water really quick, get rid of all that.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.930
The shrimp, is clean. Now we're going to check
the snapper for bones. Typically, snapper

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.030
will have a bone trail, usually right here,
you can feel it. If you run your finger down,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.330
it goes about halfway down, and there they
are. They start here, and they go down here.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:35.060
The best way to get the bones out is find
the trail. Start at the very end of the bone

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:49.620
trail, cut a "V", like so. No more bones,
beautiful. With that done, we can get started

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.419
on our Seafood Newburg.
