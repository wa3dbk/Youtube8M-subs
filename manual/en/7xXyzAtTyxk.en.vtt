00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:14.226
Hello, Bonjour, Guten Tag, Hola

00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:18.125
Yes, I am Tom Deacon and I am a Southampton FC fan.

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:21.826
We have produced some of the best british players of the last few years,

00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:26.143
we have had Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Francis Benali,

00:00:26.143 --> 00:00:29.742
Actually we got promoted last season back up in to the English Premier League!

00:00:29.742 --> 00:00:34.111
and you never know, this time next year we could be for the first time entering...

00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:35.588
the Champions League.

00:00:35.588 --> 00:00:37.930
Fingers crossed, it could happen, why are you doubting it?

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.302
Until then, this season, for the duration of the Champions League,

00:00:41.302 --> 00:00:43.792
I am going to be trading in my red and white stripes,

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:46.416
(they used to be a lot bigger on last season's kit)

00:00:46.416 --> 00:00:49.615
and I am going to become, The Eurofan.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.346
I have been given the best job in football,

00:00:52.346 --> 00:00:55.435
I am going to be travelling all over Europe following the Champions League,

00:00:55.435 --> 00:01:00.761
and in every single city I go to I am going to become a fan of the home team.

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.239
I'm just going to have a wicked time,

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.096
but right now, I'm here.

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:08.679
This is where my Eurofan journey starts.

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:10.102
Could you move that please?!

00:01:10.326 --> 00:01:11.920
Thank you.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.587
Pronto.

00:01:13.587 --> 00:01:14.630
Little bit quicker.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.856
Sorry about that,

00:01:15.856 --> 00:01:18.796
Yes, this is my very own desk,

00:01:18.796 --> 00:01:22.426
in the corner of one of COPA90's many studios.

00:01:22.426 --> 00:01:28.247
Now yes, it doesn't look like much now, but, oh...

00:01:30.108 --> 00:01:31.459
I thought that was going to be more impressive,

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:36.563
err yeah, basically wherever I go, to the clubs and the city,

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:39.805
I am going to get more stuff to make this in to kind of like a scrap book of my journey,

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.142
but I really need your help, you could send something in,

00:01:42.142 --> 00:01:48.375
like a TV, a sofa, maybe a little fridge here, maybe a lamp?

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:49.693
This one is broken.

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:52.267
What I do have though is this, in the corner...

00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:54.777
I have got a map. Now what I have done, I have been quite busy,

00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:58.123
because I have put all of the thirty0two teams playing in the Champions League

00:01:58.123 --> 00:02:02.527
on to the map, don't look too closely because my geography is not that good.

00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:05.178
Listen; the most exciting thing about this Eurofan trip...

00:02:05.178 --> 00:02:07.331
is that I get to do it with you guys.

00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:12.845
Yes you can watch me, but this is the digital age, you can help me each week,

00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:15.114
you can tell me what I need to know about your club,

00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:16.813
and where to go in your city, 

00:02:16.813 --> 00:02:19.249
and even better still we could meet up and hang out.

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:20.933
You might be able to pick me up from the airport,

00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:22.474
or take me for a kickabout,

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:25.808
or maybe you own a fancy restaurant that we could come and eat at with all the other fans,

00:02:25.808 --> 00:02:28.619
or maybe you own a five star hotel that I could stay at,

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:32.827
or maybe you have a sofa that I can sleep on,

00:02:32.827 --> 00:02:36.947
all you need to do is leave me a comment or a video response,

00:02:36.963 --> 00:02:39.092
kind of like this.

00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:42.655
Hi, Tom, you seem like a really cool guy, 

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:45.806
and I would know, because I am a very successful businessman.

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:50.804
I run hotels and restaurants all across Europe in many of the Champions League cities.

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:53.313
So why don't you come and stay,

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:56.505
I would love that, because you're great.

00:02:56.505 --> 00:03:00.042
Wow so there you go, you know how to do it, there are no excuses,

00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:03.959
My Eurofan journey starts now, and you can watch it,

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:05.279
and better still be part of it,

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.879
by subscribing to COPA90 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.111
Go on do it now.

00:03:12.096 --> 00:03:14.139
It's alright I'll wait.

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:18.195
Go on. Still going to wait here.

00:03:19.702 --> 00:03:21.228
Seriously hurry up.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.144
No go on it doesn't take long, go and do it.

00:03:26.545 --> 00:03:28.259
Honestly, you wont regret it.
