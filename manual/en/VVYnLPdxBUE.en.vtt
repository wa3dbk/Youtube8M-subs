00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.250
- Hey.
- Elena.

00:00:07.252 --> 00:00:08.968
Thank God
I know someone.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.203
I'm glad you came.
Are you thirsty?

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:14.704
You know, you used to read me
bedtime stories.

00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:16.590
And now I'm
giving you beer.

00:00:16.592 --> 00:00:18.591
Sounds about right.
[Laughs]

00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:26.012
If my dad
could see me now.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.547
How are you...

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:30.515
Doing with everything?

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.651
I'm trudging through
my denial phase...

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:37.819
Dreaming up
conspiracy theories.

00:00:40.238 --> 00:00:42.439
My first weekend home
from boarding school,

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:44.774
my dad smelt cigarette smoke
on my clothes

00:00:44.776 --> 00:00:46.742
before I even
walked in the door.

00:00:46.744 --> 00:00:49.276
He would have noticed
a gas leak in the house.

00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:52.495
So you... you don't think
that it was an accident?

00:00:52.497 --> 00:00:53.912
I know there's
no investigation,

00:00:53.914 --> 00:00:55.564
that everyone's
calling it an accident,

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.416
but the shooting at the church,
it just feels like...

00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:01.400
like something wicked this way comes.
I know, right?

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:03.868
It's like this town's
cursed or something.

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:07.004
Hey, April, why don't you go
look around the house,

00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:09.205
and I'll find you
in a little bit.

00:01:09.207 --> 00:01:10.506
Ok.

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:14.959
Did I forget
to uninvite you?

00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:16.377
Did you blow up
her dad's house

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:17.761
to get revenge
on the council?

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.045
I don't give a damn

00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:21.513
about some dodgy
middle-aged council.

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:24.432
You come into my house,
throw around false accusations,

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:26.933
and then you have the nerve
to drink my beer?

00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:36.139
My ring.

00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:40.591
Give it back.

00:01:40.593 --> 00:01:42.059
Get it yourself.

00:01:43.394 --> 00:01:44.778
No!

00:01:58.373 --> 00:01:59.956
[Metal grinding]

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.836
Damon give that to you?

00:02:22.838 --> 00:02:25.138
Yes, reluctantly.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.056
Stefan, she's...
she's not gonna stop.

00:02:28.058 --> 00:02:31.142
She's just gonna keep
pushing and pushing.

00:02:31.144 --> 00:02:33.560
Well, if you want
to kill her,

00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.227
I'm not gonna stop you.

00:02:37.442 --> 00:02:39.480
But, see,
here's what'll happen.

00:02:40.565 --> 00:02:43.899
It'll feel really good
for about 10 seconds,

00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:45.067
and then after that,

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.769
tens and thousands of vampires
all over the world will start to die.

00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:52.655
Every vampire
she ever turned will die.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.442
See, rage is
a really powerful feeling...

00:03:02.412 --> 00:03:05.913
But guilt...
Take it from me...

00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:09.281
It'll destroy you.

00:03:11.151 --> 00:03:13.484
So you can either
go after her,

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:17.319
or you can get on the back
of my motorcycle...

00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:18.504
[Music playing]

00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:21.206
And we can get
the hell out of here.

00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:39.434
Leaving so soon?

00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:42.302
No.

00:03:42.304 --> 00:03:43.469
Not just yet.

00:03:44.304 --> 00:03:46.221
I never got a drink.

00:03:49.975 --> 00:03:50.974
[Cheering]

00:03:50.976 --> 00:03:52.559
Chug! Chug! Chug!

00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:53.976
Chug! Chug! Chug!

00:03:53.978 --> 00:03:56.310
Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

00:03:56.312 --> 00:03:57.612
Chug! Chug! Chug!

00:03:57.614 --> 00:03:59.396
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

00:03:59.398 --> 00:04:00.647
Chug! Chug! Chug!

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:04.282
Chug! Chug! [Cheering]

00:04:07.185 --> 00:04:08.735
Now I'm ready to go.

00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:24.245
[Gasps]

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.833
What in the hell?
