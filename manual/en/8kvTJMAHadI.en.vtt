00:00:00.878 --> 00:00:02.965
- Hey everybody, it is Wednesday,

00:00:02.965 --> 00:00:05.446
and that means I'm on my
website, katimorton.com.

00:00:05.446 --> 00:00:07.195
If you haven't gone on there,
you should check it out.

00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:08.242
It's really cool.

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:09.556
Also, I'm on YouTube.

00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:12.100
So if you asked your questions
below yesterday's video

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.780
or the video before, I have compiled them

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.667
and I'm going to answer
them for you right now.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:21.081
So, the first question, and
this is something I get a lot,

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:23.500
from many of you, all different flavors

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.229
of the same type of question.

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:26.949
Now, this question says,

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.174
"I'm wondering why I feel so inadequate,

00:00:29.174 --> 00:00:31.598
and what to do, or what do I do,

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.545
to believe that I'm not.

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:34.810
I've missed two exams this week

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.037
with a written note from my therapist,

00:00:36.037 --> 00:00:37.170
and I just feel awful.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.725
It seems like my low self esteem voices

00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:41.059
have crossed over from telling
me that I'm an awful person

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.320
to also contaminating the only part of me

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.929
that I still believed
was good, my academics.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.494
Now, I don't even believe
that I can do that anymore.

00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:50.154
How do I keep this from spreading

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:52.571
into all aspects of my life?"

00:00:53.513 --> 00:00:54.901
I get questions like this all the time.

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:56.528
And just like you're saying,

00:00:56.528 --> 00:00:58.362
it's almost like you
know what you need to do,

00:00:58.362 --> 00:00:59.462
but it's really hard.

00:00:59.462 --> 00:01:00.952
And I know it's a lot of hard work,

00:01:00.952 --> 00:01:03.625
but we have to talk back to those voices.

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:05.753
Like you said, it feels like those

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:08.010
low self esteem voices have crossed over.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.064
And they will take over everything

00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:13.062
if we don't tell them to shut the hell up.

00:01:13.062 --> 00:01:15.499
And it's not as easy
as that, unfortunately.

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:17.867
Unfortunately, we really have
to start talking back to them

00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:20.486
and telling them positive things.

00:01:20.486 --> 00:01:23.497
It's like you have to negate
every negative with a positive.

00:01:23.497 --> 00:01:25.783
And truthfully, in the therapy world,

00:01:25.783 --> 00:01:28.366
we like a ratio of five to one.

00:01:29.364 --> 00:01:30.826
I almost said five to
five, what am I doing?

00:01:30.826 --> 00:01:32.123
Five to one.

00:01:32.123 --> 00:01:34.243
Five positives to every one negative.

00:01:34.243 --> 00:01:37.468
Now, I know that that's like
an overwhelming goal right now,

00:01:37.468 --> 00:01:39.689
but I would like to get it more,

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.350
for every five bad things, we
have like three good things.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.474
Let's try to make it more one to one

00:01:46.474 --> 00:01:48.247
and move in that direction,

00:01:48.247 --> 00:01:50.323
because you will feel a difference.

00:01:50.323 --> 00:01:53.117
Now, we're all gonna have
times we feel really down.

00:01:53.117 --> 00:01:55.752
And it can be because
of a stressful event,

00:01:55.752 --> 00:01:58.189
something's happening
and it's shaken us out

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.842
of our regular routine.

00:01:59.842 --> 00:02:03.056
But talking back and constantly doing it,

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:05.078
I know it's hard word,
I know it's annoying,

00:02:05.078 --> 00:02:06.385
but if you haven't taken a look

00:02:06.385 --> 00:02:08.037
at my eating disorder workbook,

00:02:08.037 --> 00:02:09.626
task one is talking back to that voice

00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:11.598
and it gives you kind of
an idea of where to start.

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:14.017
So even if you don't have an
eating disorder or something,

00:02:14.017 --> 00:02:16.944
you can download that and work on it.

00:02:16.944 --> 00:02:18.191
And my self-harm workbook

00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:20.429
is coming out very, very,
very soon, so stay tuned.

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.457
And I know that's not
an easy answer to take,

00:02:23.457 --> 00:02:25.928
but I promise it will help, okay?

00:02:25.928 --> 00:02:27.303
Question number two.

00:02:27.303 --> 00:02:28.389
"Is it normal for your eating disorder

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.236
to go through ups and downs?

00:02:30.236 --> 00:02:32.296
A couple months ago, it got a lot worse.

00:02:32.296 --> 00:02:34.199
But now it's kinda slowing down.

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:36.282
Do EDs stay consistent,
or do they typically

00:02:36.282 --> 00:02:37.988
go through these different
levels of intensity

00:02:37.988 --> 00:02:40.333
depending on what other
stressors you're dealing with?

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:41.785
Thank you so much, I
hope you're doing well.

00:02:41.785 --> 00:02:42.924
Love your videos."

00:02:42.924 --> 00:02:44.674
Um, it's very normal.

00:02:46.224 --> 00:02:48.182
To be honest, I think
almost all my clients

00:02:48.182 --> 00:02:50.056
go through that wave thing.

00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:52.646
I find the only time that
it's really consistently

00:02:52.646 --> 00:02:55.673
shitty and the eating
disorder's taken over,

00:02:55.673 --> 00:02:59.824
is when we have hit
what I call rock bottom.

00:02:59.824 --> 00:03:01.616
Everybody's rock bottom is different,

00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:03.263
but some of my clients, when
they go into residential,

00:03:03.263 --> 00:03:04.473
they'll be in their rock bottom.

00:03:04.473 --> 00:03:06.309
Some people, it won't be until being

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:08.451
in residential for a month,

00:03:08.451 --> 00:03:09.747
and then they'll be like, ugh,

00:03:09.747 --> 00:03:10.859
they'll feel how bad it was.

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.951
But it's very normal because,
like I've said before,

00:03:12.951 --> 00:03:14.272
the reason we have our eating disorder

00:03:14.272 --> 00:03:17.088
is because it's a coping
skill for whatever's going on.

00:03:17.088 --> 00:03:18.648
So if we're stressed out,

00:03:18.648 --> 00:03:23.125
if we have a really tough
time being around family,

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:24.842
we know family stuff is coming up,

00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:27.444
that can really send us through the roof.

00:03:27.444 --> 00:03:29.889
And that can be why our
eating disorder flares up.

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.605
And then when things are
calm, it will calm down

00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:33.784
because there's less need
for that coping skill.

00:03:33.784 --> 00:03:35.112
Okay, does that make sense?

00:03:35.112 --> 00:03:37.626
Question number three.

00:03:37.626 --> 00:03:39.386
"Can eating disorders be genetic?"

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:40.823
Now, I get this question a lot,

00:03:40.823 --> 00:03:42.658
and a lot of people
have wondered about it.

00:03:42.658 --> 00:03:44.581
And this person says,

00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:46.917
"After I started having
bulimic/anorexic behaviors,

00:03:46.917 --> 00:03:48.974
I found out that my
mother also had bulimia."

00:03:48.974 --> 00:03:51.681
So, a lot of my clients
will find that out.

00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:53.170
Just like I said in my video yesterday,

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.961
about disordered eating,
that a lot of my parents

00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:59.732
have those behaviors, almost
like eating disorder lite.

00:03:59.732 --> 00:04:03.565
It's like, they've kinda
got it, a little bit.

00:04:04.787 --> 00:04:06.303
But we used to think,
back in the '70s and '80s

00:04:06.303 --> 00:04:07.341
when eating disorders first became

00:04:07.341 --> 00:04:09.998
hot topics, people talk about it,

00:04:09.998 --> 00:04:12.851
they thought it was like,
a problem that we had

00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:14.734
because our parents were over controlling,

00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:16.852
and we were just acting out.

00:04:16.852 --> 00:04:18.754
And they thought it was only women.

00:04:18.754 --> 00:04:20.617
And we've learned a lot since then, right?

00:04:20.617 --> 00:04:21.791
And we've come a long way.

00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:24.249
And now they believe that
there is a link, genetically.

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:27.287
And from what I've read,
because I get alerts

00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:29.479
every time they talk
about eating disorders,

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.457
and one of the, well, actually,

00:04:31.457 --> 00:04:32.949
I guess about three of
the articles I read,

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.766
all agreed that there is
something in our chromosomes,

00:04:35.766 --> 00:04:37.866
chromosome one and
chromosome 10, they believe,

00:04:37.866 --> 00:04:42.033
are looking that they may
lead to eating disorders,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.346
and they may be what causes it.

00:04:45.346 --> 00:04:47.904
Now, I think it's always the
nature and nurture together

00:04:47.904 --> 00:04:49.105
that create the problem.

00:04:49.105 --> 00:04:50.545
Because some of us can be predisposed

00:04:50.545 --> 00:04:51.759
to have a lot of things,

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.769
but if we're not put in a
situation where we have a trauma,

00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:59.393
or we get so stressed out, we
have our first panic attack.

00:04:59.393 --> 00:05:01.384
If we're not put in those situations,

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:02.927
some things may never come about.

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:04.534
So I believe it's both,

00:05:04.534 --> 00:05:06.150
but I do believe there's
a genetic component,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.252
and they link it to chromosomes
one and chromosome 10.

00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:10.085
Okay?

00:05:11.413 --> 00:05:13.416
Now, final question.

00:05:13.416 --> 00:05:15.113
"What are your thoughts on parents

00:05:15.113 --> 00:05:17.322
who search their child's
room for self-harm tools,

00:05:17.322 --> 00:05:19.957
diet pills, et cetera?"

00:05:19.957 --> 00:05:22.072
I always tell my parents that...

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:23.465
My parents, I call them
mine because they come

00:05:23.465 --> 00:05:25.008
to my office to talk to me about things.

00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:26.382
But the parents who come into my office,

00:05:26.382 --> 00:05:28.021
I always tell them that
you're not the food police,

00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:29.084
you're not the self-harm police,

00:05:29.084 --> 00:05:30.923
you're just not the police.

00:05:30.923 --> 00:05:32.757
And I encourage my clients

00:05:32.757 --> 00:05:35.297
to bring things to me and
to leave them with me.

00:05:35.297 --> 00:05:37.350
I won't throw them out, we
can always get them back.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.823
We kind of reach an agreement

00:05:38.823 --> 00:05:39.966
where they can bring things in to be safe

00:05:39.966 --> 00:05:41.753
when they're not with me.

00:05:41.753 --> 00:05:43.503
I don't encourage it.

00:05:44.973 --> 00:05:47.025
I wouldn't say I look down on it,

00:05:47.025 --> 00:05:48.377
and I'm like shame, shame, shame.

00:05:48.377 --> 00:05:50.080
Because they're really
doing it out of love,

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.126
but I'm not a huge fan.

00:05:52.126 --> 00:05:53.965
I don't really think that it's helpful

00:05:53.965 --> 00:05:56.644
because it's not treating
the underlying issue.

00:05:56.644 --> 00:05:58.223
We're just taking away the tools,

00:05:58.223 --> 00:05:59.854
and we all we can get new tools

00:05:59.854 --> 00:06:01.743
and we can find new hiding places.

00:06:01.743 --> 00:06:02.751
Trust me, I've had clients hide things

00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:04.472
in the craziest of places.

00:06:04.472 --> 00:06:05.630
Where there's a will, there's a way.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.180
So I would say no.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.311
I think we need to treat
the underlying issue,

00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:11.478
and when we're struggling,

00:06:12.475 --> 00:06:13.577
we'll gladly give that stuff up.

00:06:13.577 --> 00:06:14.598
You don't need to go
searching through things.

00:06:14.598 --> 00:06:15.719
And it feels like a violation.

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:18.164
So, it doesn't really build on
the whole trust thing, okay?

00:06:18.164 --> 00:06:21.083
Now, no journal topic today, I'm sorry.

00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:23.639
But I have something
important to talk about

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.666
because there have been
changes to YouTube.

00:06:25.666 --> 00:06:28.032
And some of you will leave comments below.

00:06:28.032 --> 00:06:29.524
And I won't be able to comment back

00:06:29.524 --> 00:06:32.457
because you have to add me to
your circles on Google Plus.

00:06:32.457 --> 00:06:35.731
Now, if any of you have a
way to sign into Youtube,

00:06:35.731 --> 00:06:37.755
you have a name and whatever,

00:06:37.755 --> 00:06:39.474
not necessarily even a
channel, you have a sign-in,

00:06:39.474 --> 00:06:41.545
you can have a Google Plus.

00:06:41.545 --> 00:06:42.882
And you can find me in Google
Plus, and you can add me.

00:06:42.882 --> 00:06:47.851
And also they want you to plus
one things as well as like.

00:06:47.851 --> 00:06:51.002
So, try to do that so we
can keep spreading awareness

00:06:51.002 --> 00:06:52.327
because our community is growing

00:06:52.327 --> 00:06:54.166
and everybody is helping
everybody, and it's wonderful.

00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:57.242
So, we wanna keep that energy
and that momentum going,

00:06:57.242 --> 00:07:00.022
and since they're kinda
changing the rules of the game,

00:07:00.022 --> 00:07:01.191
a lot of people are getting pissed off

00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:03.612
but it's still a great vehicle
for us to reach others,

00:07:03.612 --> 00:07:04.645
don't you think?

00:07:04.645 --> 00:07:06.290
So make sure you like them,
as well as give me a plus one.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.121
Which sounds like I'm
going to an event with you,

00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:10.288
right, you're my plus one.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.864
But that's what they want you to do.

00:07:12.864 --> 00:07:16.064
And so, if some of you
are commenting below,

00:07:16.064 --> 00:07:18.241
and you're like, hey Kati,
you're not responding,

00:07:18.241 --> 00:07:20.626
I'm trying but if you haven't
added me to your circles,

00:07:20.626 --> 00:07:22.921
I can't respond back.

00:07:22.921 --> 00:07:24.772
And I've tried to kind
of let some of you know,

00:07:24.772 --> 00:07:26.645
and send you messages and stuff,

00:07:26.645 --> 00:07:28.450
but it's a little trickier now.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.377
But yeah, so we're gonna
keep working on it.

00:07:30.377 --> 00:07:31.698
And also, if you add me on Google Plus,

00:07:31.698 --> 00:07:32.808
you get alerted more quickly

00:07:32.808 --> 00:07:34.552
and I actually get your comments faster,

00:07:34.552 --> 00:07:36.036
and they come up on
top of everything else.

00:07:36.036 --> 00:07:37.808
So, they'll get approved faster

00:07:37.808 --> 00:07:39.381
and commented back on faster,

00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:41.175
so that's a little plus, right?

00:07:41.175 --> 00:07:43.227
Okay, and I think that's it.

00:07:43.227 --> 00:07:44.234
If any of you have questions about that,

00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:45.653
or concerns, let me know.

00:07:45.653 --> 00:07:47.152
And I'm learning as you're learning,

00:07:47.152 --> 00:07:48.903
and we'll keeping together towards

00:07:48.903 --> 00:07:52.203
a healthy mind and a healthy body.

00:07:52.203 --> 00:07:53.452
And I'll see you all tomorrow
on Thursday on Twitter.

00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:54.650
So ask your questions, use the #katiefaq

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.116
and I'll see you then.

00:07:56.116 --> 00:07:56.949
Bye.
