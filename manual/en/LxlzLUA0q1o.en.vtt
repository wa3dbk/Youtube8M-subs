00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:06.770
Hello it's Ruglovermary for Luv-A-Rug in Victoria and today I am highlighting 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.909
this hand knotted Pakistan rug

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:10.870
here is the back to show

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.949
that

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.389
you can see the pattern and you can see

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.169
the knots and the fringes come out from

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.960
the rug themselves, they are not attached afterwards

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.480
with this rug we're going to clean it

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.349
and then we are going to remove the fringes cause they are getting

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.539
a bit worn and there are some stains in
them as well

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.260
there's also something else

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.770
something unique about this trug

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.220
the client has a dog and

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.890
the dog decided that it was going to clean up a spill and you can see right

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.320
here

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.490
that there is some texture damage from the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.859
Silvia of the dog the fibers are

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.720
matted down

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.000
and flattened

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.589
and right now it looks like there could be
textural

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.940
difference but hopefully after cleaning that will bounce back

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.260
so if you have a pet that

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.950
is

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.200
constantly licking the carpet due to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.190
spills or when they

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.960
bath themselves to stop this from
happening

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.020
you can just sprinkle a little black pepper on the rug

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.590
and once they get a nose full of that or a tongue full

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.270
it would be very unpleasant and help deter them

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.420
from constantly licking your rugs

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.970
or your wall to wall

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.650
as well

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.790
so that just doesn't happen all the time
to cause

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.450
these areas

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.010
of textural difference

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.850
so this has been RugloverMary

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.600
showing you a hand knotted Pakistan rug before the fringes

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.860
and cleaning it happened

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.280
an the textural difference hopefully

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.170
we will disappear

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.409
so when you have this happened

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:11.969
Luv-A-Rug can easily help your rug look

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.619
like new again

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.479
this has been RugloverMary

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:17.339
