Hi. I'm David Hill with New York Habitat.

00:00:02.076 --> 00:00:05.231
Welcome to another New York Habitat video tour of London.

00:00:05.231 --> 00:00:08.791
Today we will be exploring Canary Wharf and Docklands.

00:00:28.137 --> 00:00:31.607
Canary Wharf is one of the two main financial centres in London

00:00:31.607 --> 00:00:33.206
alongside the City of London.

00:00:33.206 --> 00:00:35.891
Nearly 100,000 people work in Canary Wharf

00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:38.622
and it is home to some of the UK's tallest buildings,

00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:43.376
housing some of the world's major financial and media organisations.

00:01:10.517 --> 00:01:14.079
Canary Wharf and the Docklands area are in the east of London

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.996
focussing on the Isle of Dogs.

00:01:15.996 --> 00:01:19.588
North of the River Thames this runs from Limehouse in the East

00:01:19.588 --> 00:01:22.826
to London City Airport in the West.

00:01:27.124 --> 00:01:29.814
Cabot Square, named after the Italian explorer

00:01:29.814 --> 00:01:32.779
is one of the central squares in the heart of Canary Wharf

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:35.500
next to the Canary Wharf DLR station.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.172
Home to several renowned investment and retail banks

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:41.550
it is a thriving metropolis with several restaurants

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.326
and a large shopping centre.

00:02:22.248 --> 00:02:25.639
West India Quay is a stone's throw from Cabot Square.

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.559
Since its heyday as a major quay involved in shipping goods

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:32.699
such as tea, sugar, and rum, it has undergone major development.

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.826
With the London Docks no longer in operation

00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:39.310
West India Quay has retained some of its historic charm on the outside

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.342
but now provides residential housing, hotels,

00:02:42.342 --> 00:02:45.623
and restaurants for the Canary Wharf locals.

00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:02.784
Telling the story of the river Thames,

00:03:02.784 --> 00:03:06.226
the Museum of London Docklands is a fascinating historical journey

00:03:06.226 --> 00:03:09.080
starting with the Roman settlement in AD43

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.039
through to the modern day development

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.459
with some wonderful galleries.

00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:32.799
New York Habitat has a number of apartment opportunities

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.221
in the Canary Wharf and Docklands area.

00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:38.110
Renowned for its modern wharf-side developments

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.377
why not check out nyhabitat.com

00:03:40.377 --> 00:03:43.433
to find some of these hidden gems.

00:03:48.736 --> 00:03:51.176
At the south end of the Isle of Dogs,

00:03:51.176 --> 00:03:54.495
Island Gardens has some fantastic views across the river.

00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:57.486
Looking across, you will catch views of Greenwich Hospital,

00:03:57.486 --> 00:04:01.244
National Maritime Museum, and the Cutty Sark.

00:04:17.508 --> 00:04:20.179
Did you know you could walk under the river Thames?!

00:04:20.179 --> 00:04:23.960
This tunnel beneath the river has been open since 1902!

00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:27.789
Built to replace an unreliable ferry service,

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.422
this 370 metre tunnel will take you from Island Gardens

00:04:31.422 --> 00:04:32.570
to the south side of the river

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.806
near to the Cutty Sark in Greenwich.

00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:48.157
In the 18th century

00:04:48.157 --> 00:04:50.855
the River Thames was drained and development started.

00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:53.982
As a tidal river it was at risk of flooding

00:04:53.982 --> 00:04:59.132
but the Thames Barrier, completed in 1984, now protects the city.

00:05:13.743 --> 00:05:16.923
London's most central airport is right here in Docklands.

00:05:16.923 --> 00:05:20.385
Opened in 1988 it has become a trans-Atlantic hub

00:05:20.385 --> 00:05:23.853
seeing more than 3 million passengers per year.

00:05:31.997 --> 00:05:34.719
There are a number of ways of travelling to and from

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:36.267
Canary Wharf and Docklands.

00:05:36.267 --> 00:05:38.469
There is the Thames Clipper water-bus service.

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.736
The Jubilee line of the London underground.

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:45.997
And the popular and fully automated Docklands Light Railway (or DLR).

00:06:00.311 --> 00:06:01.827
This is Canary Wharf.

00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:04.922
With over 240 shops, bars, and restaurants,

00:06:04.922 --> 00:06:07.627
this area has plenty to offer.

00:06:07.627 --> 00:06:11.175
A key business location or a quiet place to sit and relax,

00:06:11.175 --> 00:06:13.952
there is plenty to see and do.

00:06:14.251 --> 00:06:16.966
Well, we've come to the end of our video tour

00:06:16.966 --> 00:06:19.128
of Canary Wharf and Docklands.
