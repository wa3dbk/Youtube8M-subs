00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.609
You know last couple of days whenever
I'm cooking something these birds are

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.930
coming and making a lot of noise and when I'm cooking I don't like to be disturbed

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.689
trust me after today's dish none of these
birds will disturb me

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.129

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.430
going to cook Quail, these quails are from the farm

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.320
just like chicken so I have hurt no
birds they'll still come and do all the noise

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.510
these quails are very popular in india
and lot of people do it but if you

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.970
don't they are available in lot of these
poultry shops just go pick some and make

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.040
it because they're very delicious.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.720
These are Quails skinless just give them
gashes because what I'm going to do is

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.070
fry method in other sessions i'm going
to show you how to make curry with this

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.530
bird but today we're going to make fry
method use a nice red chilli paste

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.790
because of the nice color we give this
preparation a nice look;  in the red

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.799
chilli paste, add some chopped coriander,
ginger garlic paste, turmeric, garam

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.909
masala powder some coriander powder,
pepper powder, salt

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.899
this should be enough and then squeeze
in some lime juice

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:59.880
just mix this and when this is mixed
nicely just add half a teaspoon or 1

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.130
teaspoon of all-purpose flour

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.159
that should be good enough have to use
my hands

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.179
just this is going to be kind of a dry paste that is how we want it.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.160
now take this quails and then apply the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.150
masala all out just into the gashes just
apply. Quails are kind of small so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.650
don't expect a lot of meat from it but
every bite is very delicious

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.900
now this is done make sure that this
masala is applied all through you want

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.520
this quails to be slightly dry out with
this masala so just leave it in the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.080
fridge for 2 - 3 hours and then they will
slightly dry out. After resting these

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.970
birds for two hours

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.770
they are ready to go into the oil, you know make sure that the oil is not too

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.660
hot just it has to be medium hot that's
when you'll get your quail nicely fried

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.910
so in a medium hot oil

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.030
just drop the bird and make sure that the bird

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.780
is immersed in the oil and you can fry 2 -3 birds at a time

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.530
it's not a big deal now look at them
look at this awesome quails and how do

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.520
we eat this

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.350
see unlike like chicken these birds have
certain rules once you pick it up in

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.130
your hands

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.150
you cannot put it back on the plate the
only thing you're going to put it back

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.090
is one or two bones which are not chewable

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.070
otherwise most of the bird is chewable depending on how well you fry, the way i

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.420
fried pretty much all the bones are also chewable, dear friends

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.450
this is one of the delicacies and you
can just marinate and fry it the way

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.280
