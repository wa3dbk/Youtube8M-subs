00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.959
Dashes, a la Shmoop.

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:09.370
Robert is a dashing young man.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.370
With his romantic and adventurous nature,
thereÕs nothing he loves so much as sweeping

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.469
the ladies off their feetÉ

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.850
Éwith his amazing grammar.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.869
And which punctuation mark does dashing Robert
like to deploy in his quest for love?

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.000
Why, the dash, of course.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.250
A dash is a dramatic kind of punctuation mark.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.250
While a colon may go unnoticed in the middle
of a sentenceÉ

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.670
Ébecause it does nothing more than serve
as a setup to additional informationÉ

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.260
Éa dash signals that something exciting is
about to happen.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.300
It tells us to buckle our seat belts, because
the ride is about to get all kinds of bumpy.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.430
For example, letÕs say dashing Robert is
discussing his vacation plans with a lady

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.430
friend.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.050
He tells her, ÒI have a destination in mindÉcolonÉmy
Aunt MerleÕs lake house.Ó

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.930
Robert would use the colon because, letÕs
be honest, Aunt MerleÕs lake house is totally

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.710
bleh, and not worthy of a dash.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.270
However, if Robert has somewhere more exotic
and exciting planned for his vacation, heÕd

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.630
say, ÒI have a destination in mindÉdashÉa
cruise around the Med on my luxurious yacht.Ó

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.970
A cruise around the Med?

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.310
How dashing!

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.999
Or what if Robert is telling one of his conquests
what he likes for dinner?

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:26.619
ÒI eat the same thing every Thursday nightÉcolonÉmacaroni
and cheese with a sliced-up hot dog weenie.Ó

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.479
Sorry, Bob, but Kraft out of a box only merits
a colon.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.310
However, if Robert says instead, ÒI eat the
same thing every Thursday nightÉdashÉthe

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.840
nine-course tasting menu from The French LaundryÓÉ

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.579
Éwell, five-hundred-dollar dinners from Michelin-starred
restaurants deserve a dash.

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.159
Now that weÕve talked a little about how
dashes are full of dramaÉ

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.869
ÉletÕs talk about the different types of
dashes.

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.450
First comes the em dash, which is longÉ

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.899
Éand then the en dash, which is short.

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.479
In most sentences, like our examples involving
Robert, we use the longer em dash, which can

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.920
be inserted into a sentence in one of two
waysÉ

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.560
Éeither from the ÒSpecial CharacterÓ menu
in WordÉ

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.969
Éor by typing two hyphens next to one another.

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:15.350
The hyphen key is in between the zero key
and the equal sign key at the top of a keyboard.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.250
Whatever happens, donÕt screw up and accidentally
put a hyphen in place of a dash.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.730
Hyphens are used to split or join wordsÉ

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.840
Énot to signal to the reader that thereÕs
impending awesomeness ahead.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.750
As for the en, or short, dash, its only use
is to indicate a range of inclusive numbers.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.720
For example, if dashing Robert were to e-mail
one of his girlfriends with a message that

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.820
includes the dates heÕs going to be in ParisÉ

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.010
ÉheÕd bust out the en dash.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.250
If Robert wants to let another lady friend
know when to meet for their weekly tango lesson,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.190
heÕd send her a note like this oneÉ

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.530
ÉÒWe will dance every Wednesday night at
8 pm from January firstÉen dashÉJanuary

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.960
twenty-ninth.Ó

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.030
Essentially, the en dash is taking the place
of the word ÒtoÓ in this example.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.550
One final note about dashes, be they of the
em or the en varietyÉ

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.600
We can put a space on either side of a dash,
so that our sentence would read, ÒDashing

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.600
Robert gave Girlfriend Number Three a very
special present for her birthdayÉspaceÉem

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.900
dashÉspaceÉa pug puppy.Ó

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.730
Or, we can leave out those spaces, so that
we end up with, ÒDashing Robert gave Girlfriend

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.720
Number Three a very special present for her
birthdayÉem dashÉa pug puppy.Ó

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.400
We can use spaces on either side of a dash,
or not.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.820
ItÕs a stylistic decision on the authorÕs
part.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.220
Just be sure to keep it consistent.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.320
And nowÉ dashing Robert must away.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:57.520
He has so much to doÉdashÉand so many more
hearts 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.650
to stealÉ
