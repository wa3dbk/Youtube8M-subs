On behalf of Expert Village, I'm Eric Williams
and I'm here to tell you about reading music.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.589
So following up with our discussion of flats,
let's take a look at sharps. If we move to

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:19.790
the next measure, we have an f and we know
that because we are in the base clef and the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:26.520
base clef has the dot above and below f line
so that is a dead give a way; if you want

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.550
to try your good boys does fine always and
it will also bring you to f. Anyway here's

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.590
f and the very next note is f with a sharp
symbol in front of it. That means to raise

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:48.290
the f a half step higher. Then the very note
is also on f but we have that natural sign

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.420
in front of the f. So I'll bet by now you'll
understand why that's there but let me tell

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:03.100
you anyway. This f sharp would normally impact
this f and make it a sharp also because that

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.980
is the rules of accidental. Accidentals by
the way is the name for all of these things

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:16.520
we are talking about. Accidentals incorporate
flats symbols, sharp symbols and natural symbols.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:25.210
So the accidental on the f sharp would normally
make this an f sharp but since in this case

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.960
we don't want this to be sharp, we have to
use the natural sign to reduce this back to

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.990
regular f. We have f, f sharp and f natural.
Again, why we don't have a natural sign in

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.780
front of this f is because it is understood
it is plain f and we don't need to put a natural

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.671
in front of it. That would just confuse people
and you don't want that. So we've got f, f

00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:57.940
sharp and f natural because all of this is
already confusing enough. Hopefully this makes

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.010
more sense. This explains flats and sharps
and naturals.
