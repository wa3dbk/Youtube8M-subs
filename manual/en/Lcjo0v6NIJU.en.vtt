TRAVIS WAACK: Okay, let's talk about leading
our teammates in passing. And when we say

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:17.419
leading, we're leading by throwing the ball
into an area, not necessarily a spot on our

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:25.039
teammate, but an area, a general area, somewhere
in front of them. So we're leading--when I

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.699
say leading, we're throwing the ball in front
of our teammate who's running the down the

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.670
court with us or if we're standing and they're
running, cutting towards the basket for a

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.760
layup. We want to put that ball in a general
area in front of them. And the spot that we

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.020
want to do is right anywhere in between the
numbers. I'll shoot for the numbers. If it's

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.860
too low and they're cutting to the basket,
they got to reach down and then bring it all

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.850
the way up, and all of that takes time. And
so we want to lead them in the best way to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:04.299
get good at learning how to pass and leading
your teammates is practice. It takes a lot

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:12.040
of practice; it takes timing, efficiency and
lots of practice. And it depends on how fast

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.280
they're coming down the court, at what angle,
and like I say, lots of practice. But you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.759
want to lead them with that ball in front
of them somewhere in an area that's hitting

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.700
them right here or hitting them right here
while they're in stride, so that they can

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.060
easily catch that ball and get into their
ready position or continue on in their stride

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.249
and shoot a layup. So very important leading,
lots of practice, the ball is in front of

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:43.109
them, and we'll give you a demonstration.
Okay, so we've got Scott. He's going to be

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.759
demonstrating how he's just running down the
side and we're going to throw it--we're going

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.420
to use a bounce pass in front of him a little
bit. Hopefully, it's in position enough where

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.270
he can just continue his stride and continue
with it and making a lay-up. So we're going

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.679
to lead him; he's running down the floor,
bounce pass; he catches it and lays it up

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:00.450
for two.
