00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:05.940
I'm Mark Williams with pickup trucks dot
com were here at canobie ranch

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.030
where we've had the opportunity to drive
the brand new 2014 Chevy Silverado for

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.070
the first time

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.250
we have the six versions v-8 versions
LT's Lt zzzz

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.270
c70 ones we even saw a high country

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.360
but we got to toe we got to carry
payload

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.990
and we got to do some offroading here
our impressions

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.070
from the very first moment

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.660
we step inside this interior that's the
biggest thing that hits me right off the

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.560
bat the steering wheel feel

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.790
and the seats provide a hugely
comfortable interior that

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.060
there was a really there before it might
be class-leading in the segment

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.680
once you get the truck out on the road
that's where it also gets impressive the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.380
steering

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.440
the geometry the frame the suspension

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.260
all those things seem to be working
together incredibly well

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.250
to give it much better handling more
dynamic feel to the driver in the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.320
steering wheel is you

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.339
go through some other Twistys or even if
even if you rob on the throttle

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.679
the response is there it's smart this is
a computer that once

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:12.729
to give you the best fuel economy
possible if your gonna drive that way

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.429
the engines themselves

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.289
are pretty impressive for 4.3 is
obviously an old architecture

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.850
but the updated new engine 285
horsepower 305 pounds a torque

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.709
very impressive %uh definitely the most
impressive torque numbers in the segment

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.740
3 over 300 for pounds a torque is
amazing for a v6

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.619
we had a chance to toe with it I think
about a five thousand-pound trailer

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.200
it worked hard you could tell it was
working hard but it was working very

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.669
comfortably as well

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:48.700
the 53 we got the numbers on that 355
horsepower

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.369
383 for pounds at work on that very
comfortable towing

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.969
I'll I think we had a six thousand pound
trailer and an eighty five hundred-pound

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:57.659
trailer

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.919
and it did incredibly well hit the
tow/haul mode

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:04.799
it seems very smart about when to hold
those gears

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.229
climbing grades and has a very very
intelligent hill descent

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.630
kinda odd downshifting capability

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.530
in the software program that can detect
whether or not you wanna stay in a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.390
higher gear

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.450
going down a great we had a chance to
drive a lot a different versions but the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.910
53 in particular

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.670
allowed us to drive the furthest
distance on the drive roots if they gave

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.930
us

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.790
which meant that we were able to gauge a
little bit a fuel economy and over the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.020
probably fifty or sixty miles that we
were able to

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.920
to run and over that stretch we got
about twenty two and a half miles per

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.660
gallon we weren't trying

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.020
to do any hyper Meiling so for us with
the 53 in the cylinder deactivation that

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.260
lets us know with the little icon on the
dash

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.030
that it's in the form own it was pretty
impressive how long that he for mod

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.360
would

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.990
hold before it kicked back in to be a
Mozart really does

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.130
give you that benefit four cylinders
getting fuel

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.080
a for when you need it in those light
load situations

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.700
and then only when it needs to does it
kick in those remaining

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.290
four cylinders to actually go no and we
saw that even when we were telling it

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.210
would kick into

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.740
four-cylinder mode and even when we were
in tow/haul mode

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.030
that wouldn't cut it out which is the
way it used to in the old

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.450
GM pickup trucks but it would still
actually hold that year

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.110
and if it was comfortable to be in four
cylinder motor would still be

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.600
me really like the opportunity we got to
take some other z71 package Silverados

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.930
out on a a pretty decent off-road course
said it allowed us to get outta

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.069
borrowing going to for low a little bit
climbing over some rocks we get went

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.700
down some

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.500
a pretty steep hills we were able to try
out the hill descent control which is

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.630
brand new for the soul

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.680
Silverado it also has a hill hold mold
regardless of what kinda trailer what

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.959
kind of way here telling you to hold it
for three or four seconds on a hill

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.340
so you have time to take your foot off
the brake and get onto the throttle

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.790
and offs also works in reverse as well
too if you happen to be climbing up the

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.400
hill

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.270
and after hit the brakes it'll hold it
as long as you stay in reverse

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.600
for three seconds and then to hit the
throttle then release it you'll be able

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.450
to climb back up that hill

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.560
the off-road course in particular was
pretty amazing nothing spectacularly new

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.419
or different

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.340
still the same transfer case you still
have the Auto four wheel drive mode

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.340
where you can set it

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.689
and forget it also has four high for it
locks

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:32.590
the front and rear driveshaft as well as
for low for the serious

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.629
you know serious situations where you
need to climb rocks

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.669
with a lot a tour suspension seem to
feel pretty well

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.879
mono tube shocks for the z71 package

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:47.050
gives it a nice firm and Steph a ride on
pavement

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.009
and also gave it I plenty of firm
control

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.330
when we were going at higher speeds over
some other rougher terrain on the offer

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.379
of course as well

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.879
if I had to talk about the things that I
didn't like they'd be pretty nit picky

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:03.210
things and they mostly have to do with
the interior

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.860
I'd like to see what gear I mean
regardless of whether I mean driver

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.729
Emmanuel

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.979
manual I can see we still have the
column shifter

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.039
but in order to see what you're you're
in you've gotta go into manual and then

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.009
you've got a

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.360
you you've got a physically go up or
down in order to know what you're you're

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.340
going into

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.729
sometimes that's a good thing generally
speaking I would like to see

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.749
what gear I mean regardless of whether a
driver or in manual mode

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:33.020
I secondly maybe this column shifter
especially with how cool summer this

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.789
center stack

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.330
works and how nice the console is on
these new packages both in the LT

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.719
the LTZ the z71 especially the high
country

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:45.379
I think I'd like to see some kind ever
auto stickers

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:50.559
something that both ramen for dinner
pretty good job with

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:54.789
so there you have it a very impressive
improvement for the Chevy Silverado

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.479
not a perfect truck but as is gonna give
the competition

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.529
a lot of things to worry about if you
want to hear

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.860

truck go to pick up trucks dot com to
