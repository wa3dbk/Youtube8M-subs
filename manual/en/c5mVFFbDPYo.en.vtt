Hello everyone this is Breanna Rutter author
of the book the natural hair Bible and founder

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.910
of howtoblackhair.com and for these special
videos I love to answer all of the questions

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.020
you all send me via email so of you have any
questions that you would like for me to answer

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.810
be sure to check out the description box for
additional information so this video is inspired

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.800
by a lady named Rose who emailed me a question
about braids she specifically wanted to know

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.960
how to actually clear the build up around
the base of her braids like cornrow braids

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.060
and box braids so is really excited to answer
this question for you because I know a lot

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.740
of you always ask me how to wash my hair in
braids are why keep my scalp fresh and clean

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.960
it moisturized and this ties back it's also
how to release build up around the base of

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.960
your braids so my first tip that I want to
give you Rose when clearing that build up

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.510
around your braids is that specifically I'm
going to talk about cornrow braids first so

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.990
when you want to clear the build up you want
to make sure to use a warm (wet) washcloth

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.530
to wipe the edges of your hair now you will
prematurely have build up on your braids if

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.490
you use a lot of products like gel or mousse
and things like that because sometimes I like

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.390
to gel down my edges or my baby hairs with
a little bit of hair gel and if I continue

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.640
to do that every day I will have build up
around my hairline so if you see build up

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.840
around your hair line but not around the rest
of your hair that's probably because you have

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.810
product build up and in that situation what
you want to do is use a warm (wet) washcloth

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.420
you want to gently wipe down your edges and
then when you finish clearing off your build

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.760
up you want to apply a little bit of oil to
keep your hair moisturized now in regards

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.160
to box braids if you have build up around
the base of your braids that means you need

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.229
to wash your hair sometimes it can be product
build up and sometimes this is the buildup

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.950
of dead skin cells which over time can cause
or actually lead to dandruff so what you want

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.650
to do is make sure you wash your hair not
really easy to wash her hair especially in

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.150
individual braids or twists you specifically
want to know how to clear build up around

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.459
your box braids so what you want to do is
use your regular shampoo that used to wash

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.799
your hair your regular conditioner that use
the wash your hair as well and you want to

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.629
dilute the to so get some kind applicator
bottle and fill it with probably one part

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.069
shampoo two-part water and then the same for
your conditioner because you want the shampoo

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.719
and you want the conditioner to be loose so
that it can really wash your braids thoroughly

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.969
and it won't have a lot of thick shampoo that
you have to get out because it'll to keep

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:52.389
sudsing up your hair you have a lot of product
left in your hair if you don't make sure to

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.980
dilute your shampoo and conditioner for doing
so so when you dilute your shampoo your applicator

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.930
bottle you squirt all of your parts you are
gonna gently use the pads of your fingers

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.499
and run them down your part you don't want
to scrub vigorously as if you were washing

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:12.010
on hair and you definitely don't want to use
your nails just use the pads of your fingers

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.040
and gently massage her scalp around the base
of your braids and then rinse out that shampoo

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.669
with warm water and then also when you go
with your conditioner you want to do the same

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:26.459
thing make sure its diluted applicator bottle
squirt all over your part and then you want

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.430
to gently massage and rinsed out as well you
just have to make sure that everything you

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.579
use all of your products using to wash and
condition your hair have been diluted so you

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:42.400
can easily rinse it out of your style so when
it comes to actually drying your hair after

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.159
you released all this product build up or
dandruff and things like that what you want

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:53.549
to do is gently pat pat dry your cornrow braids
or your box braids depending on which one

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.859
your way you want to make sure to pat them
tile dry and then what you want to do is take

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.189
a little bit of oil in your hand lubricate
your hands and run them down your parts and

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:10.049
down your braids to further lock and moisture
which is water so I hope that's help you Rose

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.809
so what you just want to do if you prematurely
have build up around the hair line is probably

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:20.019
because of product build up so use a warm
cloth as I stated to make she wiped it down

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.060
and if you have product around the base of
your braids specifically like box braids you

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.150
want to wash and condition your hair so I
