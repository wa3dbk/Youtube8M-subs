00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.370
Hello and welcome.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.999
I'm Viviane with foodandstyle.com.

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:14.000
The best thing about grape or cherry tomatoes
is how sweet and flavorful they are.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.380
And when you bake them, that sweetness and
flavor gets even more concentrated.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.940
But the one drawback is that, when cooked,
they tend to become very watery.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.800
So, to prevent that, we need to remove all
the juices and seeds before we bake the tomatoes.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.040
And for that, I have a very quick and easy
method to show you.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.380
With a paring knife, make two slits in the
shape of a cross at the top of the tomatoes,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.290
and then squeeze to release the juice and
seeds.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:54.809
Place the tomatoes in a non-stick baking pan.

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.929
You want the pan to be large enough that the
tomatoes lay in a single layer.

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:04.450
Drizzle with the honey &amp; olive oil.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:11.250
Sprinkle with the sea salt and black pepper.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.750
And now, toss well with your hands until the
tomatoes are well coated.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.570
Now spread in a single layer.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:30.220
Here they are!

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.860
These honey-roasted grape tomatoes are so
versatile... use them as a garnish, or as

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.500
a side veggie.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.790
Make a sauce or a dip with them.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.990
Toss them with a salad or pasta.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.480
But them on top of a pizza.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.440
Or make a beautiful tart with them.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:57.640
No matter what recipe you end up using them
in, they will be delicious.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.270
Enjoy!
