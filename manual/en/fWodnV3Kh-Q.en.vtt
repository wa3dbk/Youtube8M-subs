00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.350
Hello everyone, my name is Ashe.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.100
I come bearing gifts from my talk with Bioware,
on Knights of the Fallen Empire.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.100
A mix of both fairly new and very new details.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.320
A couple things mentioned during the Cantina
fan event at San Diego Comic Con, but everything

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.380
else?

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.380
Completely new.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.890
I hope you enjoy - onto the news!

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.810
If you don't know, once Fallen Empire hits
this October, players will have the opportunity

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.830
to get an instant level 60 character.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.469
Here is what you need to know.

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:43.469
1.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.850
Your character will be, of course, equipped
with gear powerful enough to deal with episode

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.850
1.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.850
2.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.039
You won't start with money right off the bat,
because the devs want to avoid scammers grabbing

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.350
more credits and unbalancing the whole system.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.350
3.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.269
As it's been confirmed, players won't be able
to choose past decisions for these new characters.

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.630
But now we know - your class will determine
the default choices for your character.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.040
Bioware based it similarly like Mass Effect
2, where there's a default (and please forgive

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.640
me for using this word) there's a default
canon for decisions made.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.340
If you play a Jedi, for example, it's expected
that your character chose dominantly light

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.650
side decisions.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.670
For Sith, dark side.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.670
4.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.960
Those who grab new level 60s will also get
another character slot.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.350
So don't worry about deleting any of your
previous characters.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.860
They're safe.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.450
Bioware's focus is giving the players something
that has been asked for quite some time: story.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.530
The devs feel like they neglected the story,
and with end-game content, and they want to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.310
make said content relevant no matter what
happens down the line, all the way until the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.530
last chapter.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.200
They want to make something that hits the
heart, something reminiscent of Knights of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.730
the Old Republic.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.940
For those who are trying out TOR for the first
time or are looking to come back after a long

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.120
hiatus, this expansion is for you.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.800
The expansion is way bigger than Shadows of
Revan.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.900
Your character is central to the plot.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.430
As the Outlander, you'll be fighting an "impossible"
threat and your choices that you have made

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.220
throughout the progression of your class story,
as well as the previous expansions...well,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.319
you will see how your choices have affected
your allies, your friends, and your loved

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.319
ones.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.069
Emphasis on loved ones, because I got a couple
new details regarding romances.

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.879
One of the qualms that players had was the
lack of communication or even reaction when

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.319
romancing say Theron or Lana, when you're
in a pre-existing relationship or even already

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.319
married.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.890
In Knights of the Fallen Empire, there will
be overlap with relationships, and while there

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.109
necessarily won't be a duel in the street,
your companion knows.

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.459
Your love interest knows.

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.459
Expect some choice words.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.629
I will say though that with Fallen Empire,
the devs stated that there is not enough time

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:02.730
with the new characters to "get hitched" (their
words, not mine), however, the ultimate goal

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.670
with the romances is to make a decision, to
commit one way or another.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.030
That's where things will go.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.230
And considering the possibility that you might
kill a companion, choose wisely.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.620
Now, for a little bit of background on the
episodes.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.799
To remind you, the episodic content is free
for subscribers, as a reward for those who

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.980
have stayed loyal to the game.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.659
And the game will reward greatly.

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:36.829
There's at least, let me reiterate, at least
one hour of story content per Chapter, per

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:37.829
month.

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.720
Some of the chapters are shorter than others,
some noticeably longer.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.790
How long you actually play each chapter will,
of course, depend on your own playing style,

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.569
but there's a lot of meat to fill you up.

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.079
Episode 1 is going to start technically as
a tutorial, where the abilities are a bit

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.901
restricted so newer players can get familiar
with the rotation, and from there more and

00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:00.689
more abilities will be added.

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.299
It doesn't feel like a tutorial, however,
as Bioware calls their solution to the new

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:12.690
player situation an "elegant approach to the
UI" so that it simply offers accessibility,

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.799
and doesn't hinder the experience.

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.550
New players will have a fun time easily catching
up, while older players scoff and laugh, running

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.450
smack right through to enjoy the story.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.160
Now these are purely outliers, because while
these are very important, I'll be discussing

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.210
them at a later time, which I'll get into
later.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.800
As you well know, the level cap is being raised
to 65.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.729
New abilities will come.

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.139
Fallen Empire will have one epic story, but
no specific class missions.

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.940
Flashpoints, as you may know, will now have
story modes, so you can finish them solo.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.930
In the next game update 3.3, not only will
Yavin 4 be a stronghold, which everyone already

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.580
knows, but Togruta are very much joining this
update as well.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.860
And the most important one - besides the flashpoints,
the operations, galactic starfighter, the

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.750
main story, and all the rest...in Fallen Empire,
there will be new content.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.259
And let's just say that in regards to how
different this new content is compared to

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:19.919
everything I just named, Bioware is being
very tightlipped until closer to the release.

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:20.919
More to come!

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:21.919
Thanks for watching.

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.620
Now, here comes the real news.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.729
My good friend MD, known for her own Mass
Effect and Dragon Age vids - the two of us

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:35.819
will be talking about everything we just discussed,
in much greater detail, in a new monthly series

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.100
that will have its first episode next week.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.280
This is an opportunity to really dive into
what Knights of the Fallen Empire is all about,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.190
but more relevant to your interests, we want
your feedback every episode, because your

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.170
best ideas will go straight to the developers.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.879
This is a chance not only to get your questions
answered, but to get what you really want

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:59.280
out of a Star Wars title.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.759
MD and I are so ridiculously focused on story,
and we strongly believe that Fallen Empire

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:10.009
is practically the KOTOR 3 we never had, so
we want you all to be there with us.

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.009
Monday.

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.009
Subscribe to me.

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:13.009
Subscribe to MD.

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:20.020
And be ready, because this is the beginning
of a very long ride.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.400
My name is Ashe, take care, and may the force
ever serve you.
