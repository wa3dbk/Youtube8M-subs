Hi, this is David Duke, Welcome to Expert
Village. In this next clip, we will show how

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.849
you control the glider. When you're actually
flying, flying, you'll be in this position,

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.630
with your hands down on the base tube. This
is a weight-shift glider; all of my weight

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.630
is being supported through my hips, right
up into the CG of the glider, the center of

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.009
gravity of the glider. So the glider pivots
off of that point. By shifting my weight,

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:34.520
the glider wants to move various directions,
and that's how I, how I control it. To control

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:42.579
the speed, we control the speed at which we
dive or climb, by diving more, I put my weight

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.539
forward, and the nose gets heavy, the glider
dives, and picks up speed. Just like a kid

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.350
on a skateboard going downhill, with a certain
amount of speed, I can then go up a certain

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.800
distance. So I push my weight back, and I
can climb all the way until, just like that

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.230
kid, I run out of speed. At the top, before
you start rolling backwards, that's called

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.400
stall. So as you get to the top, and you feel
the glider slowing down, you pull in back

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.570
down to neutral speed, and you fly off at
your new altitude. To turn the glider, you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.430
simply load one of the wings with weight.
So you put your hip over here, where your

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.790
center of gravity is, and that wing gets heavy,
and the glider turns, and you coordinate the

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.431
turn by pushing back, and the glider carves
through the turn. If you need to, you can

00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:30.350
pull in a little bit and adjust your speed
in that turn, until you've achieved the perfect

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.720
bank and perfect speed for that bank. Ok,
since this is a weight shift glider, I need

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.560
to actually move the center of my mass over
to one side or not. If I were to just rotate

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.750
here, you can see that my body doesn't, my
body's comfortable hanging, I don't want to

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.700
return to neutral. So a lot of people think
I'm over to this side, why isn't it turning,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.060
to the left? That's cause I haven't actually
moved any weight. If I move my, if I lead

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.180
with my feet, and get my weight over here,
you can see that I have to have shifted something,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.950
because when I let go, I swing back to neutral.
Whereas here, when I let go, I haven't shifted

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.271
any weight, I could sit here all day, I haven't
moved anything. You have to actually move

00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:14.169
your weight, to get it to turn. And your Instructor
will go through that with you.
