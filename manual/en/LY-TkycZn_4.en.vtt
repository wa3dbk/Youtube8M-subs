00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.819
I hate pokeballs

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:06.740
it's dark inside

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.680
it's lonely

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.719
and 'she' is not here with me

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:20.719
but 
I am never inside for long

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.330
she knows that I do not like it

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.320
she is so strong and kind and she loves me
so much

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.360
even though I am small and weak

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.829
I want to be stronger for her

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.370
so I never complain about pokeballs

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.370
and I know she will always let me out

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.100
its been so long

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.899
I wonder what happened

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:13.259
maybe she forgot about me...

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.639
maybe.....

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:19.689
maybe she doesnt love me anymore.....

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:25.990
No I'm sure there's a good reason there has
to be

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.729
there has to....

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.729

she's gonna fix it

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.299
she has to

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.659
she wouldnt let me die
