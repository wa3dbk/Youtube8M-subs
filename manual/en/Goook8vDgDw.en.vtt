00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.450
we decided to include Warrior in the story line because ultimately, he is a fan favourite

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.270
Everyone knows The Warrior, he's up there with the likes of Hogan, and Andre.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.770
He's an icon.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.900
He was larger than life.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.640
He was just so vibrant, so loud.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.100
The way he spoke was unlike anything else. 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.430
The way he wrestled was unlike anybody else.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.100
He just had this energy, like a ball of fire. 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.040
Everything he did, it was exciting, it was loud. 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.419
It was impactful, it was in your face. 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.359
When you say his name, you just know it brings back your childhood. 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.940
It makes you feel happy and appreciative of what he did for you as a fan. 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.460
Warrior is awesome because he was unlike anyone else. 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.500
He was strong and fast, and unmatched when it came to sheer power.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.590
He did things that were just spectacular.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.470
He looked like a superhero!

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.590
He sprinted to the ring and shook the ropes and was all crazy!

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.990
I mean, he was just awesome. It was fun to watch. 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.160
He had a lot of very quick.. And very fast-paced matches. 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.240
I mean the greatest ultimate warrior matches are a minute long. 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.020
Ding ding ding. Boom boom boom. 1, 2, 3, See ya, bye. 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.820
You blink and the match is done. He's on the ropes. Just out there, explosive. 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.560
His matches were not necessarily the longest, but some of the most impactful

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.500
that the industry has ever seen. 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.260
We tried to try and capture that, we did that with a lot of quick time events

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.860
and things that kind of push the player through and let them enjoy the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.500
experience of Warrior's quick, fast wrestling style. 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.760
You get to play in championship vs championship matches,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.180
Steel cage matches, and 2 -on-3 matches.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.060
He beat Macho man Randy Savage at Wrestlemania VII to retire him

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.240
and that was one of the most memorable matches in my opinion

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.340
in the history of WWE.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.450
He beat Hulk Hogan at wrestlemania, that was hard for a Hulkamaniac

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.950
like himself to take. 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.030
We have a bodybag match with the Undertaker that I think is going to be

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.890
fun to play as well.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.760
And Warrior again going after the Undertaker!

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.240
Another Piledriver!

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.760
Are you kidding me!?

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.799
As a kid, I grew up the biggest Ultimate Warrior fan. 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.620
I used to paint my face, put streamers on my arms

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.320
run around the house annoying my mom. 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.980
Being able to really focus on him this year was a huge goal. 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.940
Especially in light of his passing last year, 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.060
we really wanted to honor him. 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.649
There's no one else like the Ultimate Warrior. 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:26.540
Even the rip offs have never even come close. 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.320
He was a genuine article, and I feel like the showcase

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.240
does a great job of bringing that to you.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.360
This showcase is 100% a tribute to the Warrior.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.540
His life, his great achievements.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.040
He's an icon to all of us. 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.540
