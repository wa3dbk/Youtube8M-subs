00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.000
It’s almost Summer here. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.500
And it’s time for ice cream, ice bar, iced coffee, bubble tea, etc. 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:31.790
So, today I am making extremely simple cold dessert.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.880
First, add in two packages of yogurt into a mixing bowl. 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:48.290
Today I am using Yoplait plain and it's 6 oz. in total.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:55.290
Then add in 1/3 cup of sweet red beans. 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.910
If you don’t have sweet red beans. 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.710
You can use sweet red beans for patbingsoo. 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.790
You can find this at any Asian supermarket.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:20.000
Then stir until combined.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And taste it 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If you want, you can add honey.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:44.830
Today I am adding 1 teaspoon of acacia honey. 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.120
Then stir until homogeneously mixed.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:05.620
And fill the ice pop molds with mixture.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.920
I am making only two ice pops today but you can easily double or triple the portion. 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:23.410
Just remember that I used 2 parts yogurt and 1 part sweet red beans.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.750
Okay.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.540
And store these in the freezer for only 3 hours. 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.250
It’s better to enjoy on the same day.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.040
Out of freezer, place the pops in the warm water for 5 sec. 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.550
This way it’s easier to remove the mold.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.130
Voila! 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:05.460
My parents love this, because it’s like a healthier version of old Korean ice pop, B.B.Big.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.250
Bon appetit. 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.750
Frozen yogurt with sweet red beans. 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.750
I love this. 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.750
Bye!
