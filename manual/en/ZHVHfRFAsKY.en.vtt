Hi, I'm Seth the Guitar Guy at www.TheGuitarGuy.org. I have taught

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.330
guitar for almost thirty years and specialize in guitar instruction for

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.460
guitar students that want to learn guitar
fast. I'm here today with Amanda,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.910
who had her first lesson last week.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.400
Now how are the calluses coming? Are you getting calluses on your fingers?
Um, I haven't.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.500
I don't know if that's 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.380
bad or not, but I haven't.
But are your fingers hurting?
No.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.549
Not at all?

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:32.439
That's great!

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.999
Amanda how much, uh, do 

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:35.570
you practice every day?

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.100
Um, I've practiced about

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.930
thirty minutes or more. 
Thirty minutes or more every day, and
that's just exactly what I asked you to do, so thank you.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.860
Okay, now we're going to go to our G chord,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.480
and go ahead and show us how you do the G
chord with your thumb and your fingers.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.670
Good, and let's go to the C chord.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.900
And the D7.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.400
Okay, make sure you get your first finger on the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.400
second string.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.229
This one. On the second string.
Oh! Okay.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.759
Okay, so.

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.759
Okay, let's go ahead and do the D7 now.
Good!

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.909
Okay, so Amanda has her thumb and fingers working very well,

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.930
and she's doing the chords very well! When you think she's only been doing 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.420
this for a week, it's amazing. Now,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.820
when I asked her earlier she said,"Well, I'm still not getting my chord changes fast enough."

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.930
I said,"Amanda, I didn't expect you to do that in one week!"

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.189
And she said,"Well, actually I'm doing pretty good, it's just going from the G

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.180
to the C that's kind of hard,"

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.030
and that's quite a typical thing when people first start out, that's

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.520
the hard one for them. 
So Amanda, you've learned the D7;

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.939
now we want to learn the chord D.

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:10.779
So this goes on the

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.279
third string,

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:17.349
second fret.

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.399
And then the second finger on  the first string. Good!

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:21.359
And then 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.619
the third finger on the third fret,

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:28.489
on the second string.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.569
Okay, on the...

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.279
So it'd be on the second string with your third finger.

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.309
There you go!

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:36.409
Okay, now

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.379
the thumb does the same 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:44.409
pattern as on the D7, so go ahead and try the D now.

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.819
Good! So now she has the D down very well, and you already know the G, 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.989
so there is one more to learn today, and this is the A7.

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.539
So put your second finger on the...

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:56.719
There, perfect!

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.909
And then your third finger on the second string.

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.749
Okay, now this time, the bass is going to play the fifth,

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:11.749
and then the sixth, just like on the C chord,
so let's go ahead and do that.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.010
Good! So she's going to do-

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.609
she's going to work on D, G, and A7 this week,

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.989
and then she will be working on She'll Be Coming Round The Mountain again,

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.979
this time in the key of D,

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:28.129
and so she'll be able to sing it a lot louder next week, and it will sound a lot

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.379
better!
