Hello, I'm JB, I work at Austin Homebrew Supply
here in beautiful Austin, Texas, and today

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.539
we're discussing a little bit about equipment,
process, procedure, a couple other things

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.630
regarding making your own beer at home, making
your own wine at home, or cider or what have

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:28.070
you. Now in this particular segment right
now I'm going to talk about beer making, and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.309
not just beer making but actually grinding
your own grain. Ok? Now here at the Homebrew

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:41.239
shop we have a mill, we offer it as a service
to our customers. All you have to do is you

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.449
come in, place your order. I will mill your
grain for no charge, ok? Unless you buy like

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.069
a giant bag of it or something, I'd have to
mill the whole thing or, but when you journey

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:56.600
into the store, you want me to mill some grain?
No problem. I'll just go over there and I'll

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.839
run it through the mill. Now, a lot of people
really want control over everything, including

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.710
not to have to come in here and ask me to
mill the grain, ok? Subsequently, like a lot

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.800
of different hobbies, we offer everything
you would possibly need including a mill.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:21.210
So this is an example of a home mill for home
brewing. A little different than like a coffee

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.911
mill, it has a particular setting between
the two rollers, there's a couple of rollers

00:01:27.911 --> 00:01:34.090
down inside of here. There's a particular
gap between them that allows the grain to

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.170
be crushed but not pulverized and de-floured.
When you're making beer you do not want the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.780
grain to be pulverized into flower. You just
want to break the husk off of it. So, these

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:54.590
mills that we sell have a design to crack
the barley, most beer is made out of barley,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.580
so to crack the barley without turning it
into flour. So, this is just one example of

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.390
the mills that you can find here at Austin
Homebrew Supply.
