00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hey, Ana.  Did you know there's more than 150 jobs in the Army?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Wow.  With that many, how do you even pick one?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, to be an Army Volunteer member, you don't have to pick one,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but you've got to be chosen.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I had a chance to go into the studio and see and hear one of the Army's most rockin' jobs.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Roll that beautiful music footage.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
[drum sticks rattling] [♪bass guitar playing♪]

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's just a warmup.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The Army Volunteers are getting ready to hit the road,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
tour the U.S., and rock out.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
[♪Volunteers playing upbeat music♪]

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We have a great time together.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I work with some of the most talented musicians in the world,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and just to be a part of that, I kind of pinch myself sometimes

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and it's like, "Wow.  I'm here."  It's an amazing experience.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
[♪music continues♪]

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
[Torres] Staff Sergeant Randy Wight finds inspiration behind the music.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
[Wight] You see the impact in a way that's so personal and close to home.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
[♪Wight singing "Proud to be an American"♪]

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I had the honor to meet a World War I veteran,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
who, at the end of our program during our meet and greet time

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
had asked me to come up.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
He had had a note that he had written to his wife while he was a POW,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and he was wondering if there was some way that I could sing 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
or make a melody out of the words that he had written to her,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so that struck me like a bolt of lightning.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
[♪upbeat music♪]

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
[Torres] For Boucher, setting an example for girls is a key note. [♪♪]

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
[Boucher] Being able to serve as a female role model. [♪♪]

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
[Torres] Even the ones close to home.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
She says, "Mommy, I need to tell you something."

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And I said, "Okay." 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
"Are you sure this is not going to hurt your feelings?"

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
"No.  It's fine.  Whatever you have to say, you can say."

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
"Mommy, I really don't care about your singing."  [laughs]

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
[Torres] Wight shares music with his family too. [♪♪]

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
[Wight] We've recorded together.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Karaoke night at the Wight house.  Yeah, it's very different.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And I have very forgiving neighbors.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
[♪Bon Jovi's "Wanted Dead or Alive"♪]

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
[♪upbeat music♪]

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
[Torres] They all consider themselves family.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Boucher and Wight agree that being a part of the Volunteers can't be beat.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Sergeant Ashleigh Torres, Fort Meade, Maryland.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
What a family.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Speaking of families, this is Ana Allen's last show here at SRTV.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
We're going to miss you so much.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Well, I'll miss you guys too,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
but I'm still going to be part of the Army family.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I'll still get to tell the Army story,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but this time just from American Forces Network in Korea.
