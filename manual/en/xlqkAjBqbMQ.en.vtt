00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.210
So many viewers ask me questions about

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.500
how to make their own topical vitamin c products.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.350
I’m not sure if it’s because commercially
available products

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.660
tend to be fairly expensive or maybe,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.220
because oral forms of vitamin c are so readily
available,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.230
that it just seems logical that you should
be able to make your own serum.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.900
Today I’ll give you my take.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.900
Hello,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.519
I'm Dr. Neal Schultz.

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:23.519
[pause]

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.489
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.509
Let's start exploring this topic with simply
dissolving

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:48.450
the crystals of vitamin c that are in this
capsule or tablet, in water...

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.800
...If you put the resulting solution of dissolved
vitamin c on your skin,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.170
as soon as the water evaporates, the vitamin
c

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.140
that was dissolved in the water will re crystallize
on your skin

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.150
before it can be absorbed.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.570
Since crystallized vitamin c can’t be absorbed
into your skin,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.320
it can’t work as an antioxidant.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.960
See, you need a carrier to hold the vitamin
c molecule in the solution

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.780
so it can penetrate into your skin cells.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:29.240
If you have sufficient chemistry skills to
grind up vitamin c...

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:40.719
...and use a carrier like propylene glycol
or glycerin,

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.829
and you know how to calculate and measure
the amount of ascorbic acid you need,

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.810
you can solubilize it and mix it properly.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.859
That in theory, could yield a functioning,

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.399
topical vitamin c product.

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.139
However, the problem here is that you are
just going to have ascorbic acid,

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:58.829
regular vitamin c, which is water soluble

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.189
so it doesn't penetrate the lipid membranes
of skin cells very well.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.779
Because it’s acidic, it can be irritating
when applied to the skin.

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:11.740
And lastly, the acidic form is unstable because
it’s very quickly oxidized,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.980
and thereby inactivated.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.880
For those reasons, if you’re going to make
a topical vitamin c product,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.820
you really want to use the ester form of vitamin
c, not the acid form.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.010
The advantages to esters are that, first,
because they are fat soluble,

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.790
they better penetrate the lipid based barrier
of your skin.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.450
Second, because they are not acidic they tend
to be less irritating.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.350
And third, the fatty groups on the esters
increase the stability of the vitamin c

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.870
so its not as easily oxidized and inactivated.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.170
At the end of the day,

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.420
when the vitamin c ester is absorbed into
the skin,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.820
it then is changed back to regular ascorbic
acid,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.010
so what you’ve done is in a non irritating
fashion…

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.200
you’ve effected better penetration at higher
levels and maintained stability

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.190
by using an esterified form.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.660
Creating this is beyond the scope of most
amateur chemists.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.110
The final reason to not DIY vitamin c is that

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.590
since it’s so difficult to assess the efficacy
of topical antioxidants,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.650
especially at home, by using a DIY vitamin
c product,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.370
while they might feel nice, you could go on
for months or years

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.590
wasting your time with a product that doesn’t
work.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.800
So your take away today is,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.970
why take a chance on a product you don’t
know

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.010
and miss out on the very valuable benefits
available from

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:49.950
professionally prepared topical antioxidants.
