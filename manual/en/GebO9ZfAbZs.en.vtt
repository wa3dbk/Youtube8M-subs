00:00:03.132 --> 00:00:05.172
Is Karma Real?

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:08.362
Sure It Is.

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:17.762
'I helped an elderly person take her groceries
to her car, that's karma points for me!' or

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:24.452
'I killed a big bug, now I'm going to get
bad karma', sound familiar?

00:00:24.452 --> 00:00:29.112
It's not possible to verify whether you'll
truly be paid back for these actions, but

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:33.322
there's one way we see that karma is very
real.

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:36.141
If you put goodness in, you get goodness out.

00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:38.312
Give love, receive love.

00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:40.092
Hate and be hated.

00:00:40.092 --> 00:00:42.072
Can you see the karmic pattern?

00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:47.822
If you take care of your neighbor's cats while
they are away, you're performing a service

00:00:47.822 --> 00:00:48.822
to others.

00:00:48.822 --> 00:00:52.621
It's likely your neighbor will repay you with
kindness by taking care of your pets while

00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:57.702
you're away, or inviting you for dinner, buying
you a gift and so on.

00:00:57.702 --> 00:00:59.531
Put in and get out.

00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:05.112
Another example, you drive aggressively, tailgating
all the time, swearing and sounding your horn

00:01:05.112 --> 00:01:08.202
at motorists just for being on the road.

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:13.422
Likely, sooner or later, you'll have a car
accident or be a victim of road rage yourself.

00:01:13.422 --> 00:01:15.942
The karmic forces come back around.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:20.582
In this way we see that karma exists in our
everyday lives, all the time.

00:01:20.582 --> 00:01:26.402
In studying Buddhism, we learn that karma
is a Sanskrit word meaning 'action'.

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:32.232
It refers to the initial positive, neutral
or negative action.

00:01:32.232 --> 00:01:37.892
The polarity (positive or negative) of the
intention for the action is the deciding factor.

00:01:37.892 --> 00:01:44.442
It is the effect of karma that comes back
around - 'karma' is the initial action.

00:01:44.442 --> 00:01:50.712
Buddhism outlines how karma (actions) in one
lifetime can result in effects showing up

00:01:50.712 --> 00:01:54.942
sometime in the same lifetime or in a future
incarnation.

00:01:54.942 --> 00:02:01.332
Seeds are sown by karmic actions, but may
not germinate into effects until some other

00:02:01.332 --> 00:02:03.012
lifetime.

00:02:03.012 --> 00:02:08.462
Good actions are a cause of reincarnation
in a lifetime of mainly happiness, and negative

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:12.781
actions result in a lifetime of increased
suffering.

00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:16.152
So karma is the root of future happiness.

00:02:16.152 --> 00:02:20.781
Although this Buddhist belief is of course
wise and respectable - alternatively, it may

00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:26.302
be true that having spent a life of being
negative to others, upon physical death, the

00:02:26.302 --> 00:02:31.082
spirit might examine it's own behavior and
opt for a new lifetime of increased suffering

00:02:31.082 --> 00:02:34.111
for it's own learning and spiritual advancement.

00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:39.242
This could be possible, rather than having
a punishment or sentence of sorts, being imposed

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:42.932
open the spirit in the allocation of a new
life of suffering.

00:02:42.932 --> 00:02:50.221
So, after the forgetting (being born with
a clean slate) a spirit lives out the new

00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:55.751
lifetime in human form - either positively,
neutrally or negatively orientated in it's

00:02:55.751 --> 00:02:57.391
intentions and behavior.

00:02:57.391 --> 00:03:04.322
Then upon death, the spirit performs an evaluation,
perhaps with help, and chooses a new lifetime

00:03:04.322 --> 00:03:09.501
in whatever time-space appropriate, to balance
out it's learning and experiences as it sees

00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:10.501
fit.

00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:14.552
All for the greater good of the universe.

00:03:14.552 --> 00:03:19.992
Thinking about karma in it's basic form then,
we can know for sure that karma is real - you

00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:22.761
get back out what you put in.

00:03:22.761 --> 00:03:29.591
So, how about putting in higher vibrational
energies such as love, empathy and compassion

00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.852
through your actions.

00:03:30.852 --> 00:03:50.221
Do it more and more and see the results, in
this lifetime and the next!
