00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.130
okay see you just got your DSLR or maybe you're
thinking about getting one

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.840
or maybe you've had one for a while but
you want to take your skills to the next

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.110
level
well the best place to do that is right

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.150
here right now
I was in the exact same spot you were

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.369
several years ago
when I got my DSLR and I didn't know what

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.400
the settings were I didn't know how
to take a picture

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.320
huh I made all the mistakes that everyone
makes

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.980
when they're trying to figure things out
on their own so if you're like me

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.050
chances are you pictures are out of focus
they're blurry

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.380
they don't have the correct white balance
they're not composed properly the

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.640
exposures probably off
the not colorful enough or word you're

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.930
just taking pictures of
really boring things that no one wants

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.230
to look at now I was in that same place
years ago but after years of experimentation

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.190
years of looking into forms reading books
and watching YouTube videos I finally

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.150
have figured out the best and fastest way to fix all those problems

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.960
the people go through in the beginning
know you could do the same thing I did

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.100
where you spend years upon years experimenting
but chances are you want to speed up your

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.170
results
fairly quickly and that's why I've compiled

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.170
the best essential core information about photography into this online video

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.990
course
you're gonna get a huge jumpstart at photography

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.610
in general
you see most courses they only teach you

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.170
a fragment what you need to know and leave
out the rest they don't cover the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.340
big picture
some courses will teach you how to use

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.920
your physical DSLR
but they won't teach you about composition

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.130
other courses
will teach you about post-production but

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.070
they won't teach you about light
but in this course everything is contained

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.979
in a big picture format so you can get
the big picture idea of what is going

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.040
on and what makes a good picture the course

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.350
is divided up
into for modules the first module

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.620
is just all about mastering your DSLR
camera ill show you how to pick up your DSLR

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.360
and understand what all the buttons are
on your camera

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.400
so you can have the confidence to know
what settings you need to adjust

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.910
when you're taking pictures have a certain
subject in a certain situation

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.150
so in this module I'll be going over things
like

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.150
the aperture shutter speed ISO exposure
focusing modes metering modes the white

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.790
balance
all my good stuff is all in module one

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.020
so after completing module one who have
a complete understanding

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.050
pure physical DSLR camera and then you
will be able to move on to module

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.630
two which is all about photography equipment
now i DSLR camera body is technically

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.910
photography equipment and i do compare
and contrast

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.319
different types DSLR you can get a feel
about if you're

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.349
if you thinking about getting a DSLR then
this module will help you as well

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.580
but out also be comparing and contrasting
different types of lenses

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.819
when you would want to use certain lenses
in certain situations and when

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.950
wouldn't you
I'll be reviewing different types of filters

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.720
the could put on the lenses to
get certain affects

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.430
and I'll also be doing a thorough review
of all the lighting equipment that i use

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.340
just to give you an idea of the industry
standard of what you can have in your

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.900
kit to get good images and then after
that all done we'll move on to module

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.370
three
which is all about composition now when

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.860
you're holding your DSLR in your hands
and your looking through the viewfinder

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.239
it's all nice and dandy that you know
when all the settings doing everything

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.610
