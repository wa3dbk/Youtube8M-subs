00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:12.519
Hey Cookaholics, Chef Kendra today were making
one of Americas Chinese food dishes.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.379
We’re making orange chicken.

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.500
So let’s do what we do let’s head into
the kitchen and make it happen.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.789
OK were going to grab one of our juicers.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.740
This one is electric but I use this one when
I’m juicing a lot of things like I’m going

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.483
to set up a little bar and I need a lot of
lime juice and lemon juice.

00:00:27.483 --> 00:00:29.320
We’re just going to use this one.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.170
We’ve got a big fat old orange here that
needs to go on a diet and we’re going to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.190
help it out.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.829
You want to wash your orange before you zest
it.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.579
Because it has a lot of waxy build up and
you really don’t want that.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.620
And what we’re going to do is use this microplane
to zest this.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.250
And what this is going to do is take off just
enough of the peel to retain all its oil,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.850
but not get the white part which is extremely
bitter.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.750
Chef Kendra learned you that.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:07.070
Alright now we’re just going to use our
fingers and get this into our bowl.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.300
So we’re just going to take this thing and
juice our orange, it’s very simple to do.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.300
There is a version of orange chicken in China,
I mean several versions.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.550
But this version is very American.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.580
It’s one of those things you know, it comes
over and get changed around.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.680
It gets Americanized for the American palette.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.000
And I got to say though that I have a special
place in my heart for orange chicken.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.940
The next thing we’re going to do is add
this corn starch to a little water.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.870
Kind of mix this into a smooth paste.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.070
We’re going to turn this pot on low.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.540
We’re adding water.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.700
Sugar.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.180
That fresh orange juice.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.670
White vinegar.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.229
A little oil.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.810
That corn starch.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.060
Ketchup.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.390
Chopped garlic and onion powder.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.560
Honey.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:35.870
The last thing we’re going to add to this
is the zest.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.920
That goes in.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.120
Now I’m going to whisk all this up a little
bit.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.350
And what we’re going to do here is mix this
up well of course and then we’re going to

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.930
slowly let it get a little thick.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.040
That corn starch will make it thick and it’s
going to be delicious.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.250
You might not.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.470
I don’t know.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.670
But there is a chance, Cookaholics, that you
will never go to Panda Express for this again.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.260
I mean there is a chance that could go down.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.080
So you’ve been warned.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.280
We have some chicken thighs that we’ve cut
into one inch pieces.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.730
You can definitely use chicken breast.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.010
Orange chicken is basically; well it’s traditionally
made in this country with chicken breast and

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.069
it’s very good that way.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.220
It doesn’t really matter.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.650
I had thighs on hand so that’s what I used.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.950
You can check out my orange chicken wings
recipe if you hit that link below.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.380
And if you need the recipe to this orange
chicken, Panda Express style recipe that will

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.980
be at chefkendraseasycooking.com.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:49.040
We’ve got a egg in this bowl and we’re
whisking it up.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.790
Now we’re going to add some flour.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.820
Corn starch.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.190
Baking powder.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.240
Salt.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.240
And water.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:16.790
We’re going to whisk this up and this is
going to be our batter to cook our chicken

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.410
in.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.280
And as always you’re looking for basically
a pancake consistency.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.310
What’s your favorite type of cuisine?

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.910
I mean I like all kinds of food.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.210
I think that every culture has delicious food.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.070
Every single one of them you can find something
that’s good.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.160
My favorites of course are American we’ll
start there.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.990
I like Vietnamese, I like Indian food, I like
Mexican food and I like Chinese.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.990
food.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.150
So that’s all we need to do here.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.340
Now I’m going to put the chicken into the
batter.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.570
I’m just going to mix the chicken into the
batter.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.850
Now we’re ready to fry this stuff up, Son.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.730
OK, we have a high sided pan here and we’re
going to add some oil to that.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.300
Not much maybe a tablespoon and one half or
two tablespoons, something like that.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.090
I’m just going to swish it around a little
bit.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.650
We’re going to get this hot I’m going
to put this over medium heat.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.810
So we got them in here we’re just basically
going to stir fry them up a little bit.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.990
And we’re going to cook them until they
are crispy and done.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.530
I could have deep fried this but I decided
not to.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.990
If you want to deep fry these you can go ahead.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.910
I’m putting all the chicken back in here.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:48.419
OK now we’ve added the sauce and we’re
just going to mix it all around and let the

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:56.000
heat from the pan and from the last bit of
chicken we cooked heat up our sauce.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.360
That’s wassup guys.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:06.260
We’re going to plate it then we’re going
to eat it.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.940
OK guys if you want to check out my last video
you can do so right over there.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.940
Share my videos.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.490
Now let’s taste this stuff.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.640
It has that burst of freshness from orange
juice we used.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.680
We used that fresh orange juice which really
makes big difference.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.540
This is delicious.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.790
Oh my gosh.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.760
I’m going to go eat some more.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.850
But if you haven’t already subscribe.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.850
Chef Kendra is out.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.851
Peace.
