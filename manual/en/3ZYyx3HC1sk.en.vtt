Big alligators will eat smaller pythons. Bigger pythons will eat smaller alligators.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.400
That’s a fact here in the Everglades.

00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:28.517
Both incidents have been observed. 

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:56.567
When a hungry big python comes across an alligator, he will eat it.

00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:00.633
 The python will attack the alligator, constrict it and swallow it whole.

00:01:00.836 --> 00:01:02.836
Just like he would swallow a bird or a rabbit.

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:30.367
Pythons kill by constrictions. What that means is, they usually 
 coil around the prey’s chest cavity. Very powerful.

00:01:30.604 --> 00:01:36.104
 And as the prey animal exhales, the python squeezes tighter and tighter.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.500
It actually stops the heart from beating and it 
 stops the air from flowing into the lungs.

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:53.370
The victim suffocates to death. But alligators can lower their 
 heart rate to one or two beats per minute.

00:01:54.133 --> 00:02:00.130
And there are occasions when the python thinks that the 
 alligator is dead and begin to swallowing it.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:08.800
But the alligator might recovers in a few minutes and 
 begins to fight, while he is inside the python.

00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:12.930
If the alligator recovers during or after it being swallowed by the python,

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:17.570
the alligator can cause life threatening damage to the python’s organs.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:27.740
The python’s life is at risk at that moment. Hence, if the 
 alligator recovers inside the python, it could kill the snake.
