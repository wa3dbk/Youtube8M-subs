00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.120
Focus released a brand new time trial bike

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.150
in time for the Tour de France: the Izalco Chrono, and AG2R La Mondiale

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.380
successfully debuted the

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.990
bike here. This is the ride of the team's, and France's,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.340
top finisher in the Tour: 23-year-old Romain Bardet.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.279
While this Focus shares a similar aesthetic
to many of its' rivals time trial bikes,

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.519
this is principally due to the UCI guidelines
that restrict the evolution of time

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:26.609
trial bike design.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.679
That said, while it may appear similar,
there are a lot of details on this bike

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.050
that set it apart. Integration is key to this
frame set, particularly at the front end.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.649
The brakes, fork and steerer all stretch the
strict UCI rules to breaking point.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.219
The geometry rulebook has also been
rewritten to allow a greater range

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.340
of rider sizes to be accommodated. Team
sponsor Fizik

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.809
don't have an aero bar as yet, and although the
mechanics have taped the branding on

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:50.410
these up,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.789
the foam pads clearly say that Deda is the
manufacturer.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.930
Fizik do have time trial saddles well
and truly covered though,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.329
and Bardet has chosen the specific Ares model
shorter than a standard saddle

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.960
to allow him to get as far forward as
possible while again still conforming to

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.950
UCI rules.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.810
Campagnolo provide the group set
including the stunning Bora Ultra crank

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.060
set. The rest of the group set is mechanical
Record 11.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.220
AG2R La Mondiale forego both the
electronic EPS

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.720
and also Super Record mechanical on their
TT bikes, showing that even top pros have

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.549
restrictions placed on their equipment
sometimes. Bardet runs a large 54

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:25.110
chainring,

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.240
and an 11-23 cassette, just about the only
time that

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.070
these compact sets get used these days.
Look Aero Blade pedals

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.400
are another nod to the specialised nature of this
bike in the quest to go as fast as

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.990
possible.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.210
Finally, from the same stable as Campagnolo,
Fulcrum provide the wheels.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.899
The full disc at the back and a deep at the
front, although for this shoot, a 50mm deep

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.960
was the only wheel at hand - normally
it would be an 80.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.229

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.509
