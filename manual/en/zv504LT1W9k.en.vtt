00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.180
We're going to begin a zombie makeup application.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.520
There are several different types of zombie,
but we're going to be doing the flesh falling

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.880
off the face zombie.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.480
These are simple things that you can do to
create a really cool effect with things that

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.960
you have around the house and some liquid
latex.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.829
You want to first make sure that you're not
allergic to liquid latex by putting a little

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.079
blot on your wrist or on your neck somewhere
to make sure that you don't get rashy or itchy.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.950
The first thing I'm going to do for this makeup
application is start with the teeth.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.280
I'm just going to dry the teeth out.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.969
I'm going to have you open your mouth and
keep your mouth open.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:56.510
I'm going to lift up here and just dry these
teeth out.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.179
Then I'm going to add some black tooth decay.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:09.000
This is a Ben Nye product, and I'm going to
paint this right directly onto the teeth.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.680
Try to keep your mouth open until the paint
has dried.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.650
You don't have to worry because this is made
specifically for your teeth.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.920
You don't want to get it on your gums if you
can avoid that.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.940
Just try to keep it on the teeth.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.140
Okay.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.740
I'm going to move on to another color.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.630
This is decay.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.220
Open.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.600
These are dry, so you need to close and swallow.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.390
Okay.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.430
I'm just going to paint that over the top.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.170
Just pretty much an overall totally disgusting
look.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.820
You can tap that out.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.650
Okay.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.480
Relax.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.140
Then I'm going to add nicotine on top of that.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.310
Okay.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.659
Leave your mouth open for a minute.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:25.260
Now that we've got some pretty disgusting
teeth we're going to start to add the base

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.980
of the makeup.
