This is John Mendez with Expert Village. I
am going to mix the resin and the hardener

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:20.040
for the enamel for the frame. Like I said
before the enamel is when you mix the resin

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.834
and the hardener plus a pigment and then you
bake it and then it becomes an enamel. And

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:34.469
to get equal parts sometimes you can pour
them out by sight or by measuring cup but

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.059
I like to use eye droppers. This way you are
not using too much because whatever you don't

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.609
use is going to cure and then you have wasted
product so it's all about keeping your costs

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:55.109
down. So what I do is I take the eye dropper
and I fill one up. Try to get as much excess

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:03.170
off of it as possible. And this one is our
hardener, so it doesn't matter which one you

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:17.310
start with. I just drop in as many drops as
I want. We will go with four and you want

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.600
to keep this in the hardener because if you
use the other one, the resin with it in the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.509
same eye dropper, they will fuse together.
It will just clump up because it will start

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:40.939
to cure right away. So use a new eye dropper
for the resin and we will get four drops out

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:51.820
of that and you will have an equal part. Then
you will want to mix that. I use a wooden

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:59.730
stick. Just mix that up like that and there
you have your resin and hardener.
