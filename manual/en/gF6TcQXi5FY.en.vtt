00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.629
Released just before Thanksgiving in 1992,
this $28-million dollar animated musical fantasy

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.410
was the most successful of the year, eventually
grossing over half a billion at the worldwide

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.460
box office.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.449
Ron Clements and John Musker adapt the ancient
Arab folktale for the big screen with a cast

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.499
of familiar voices, led by Scott Weinger of
"Full House" fame.

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.980
The 90-minute story follows Weinger as the
title character, a poor street urchin who

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.599
uncovers a magical genie after falling in
love with a beautiful princess.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.140
He's motivated early by a passing prince who
reminds him, "You were born a street rat,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.530
you'll die a street rat."

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:56.310
As one of 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:07.689
the 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.000
all-time great animated characters in cinema
history, Robin Williams is perfectly cast

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.520
as the bright blue genie - hilariously rattling
off a string jokes, sight-gags, anachronism

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.840
impersonations, and even singing a song or
two.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.070
In fact, the famous comic improvised so much,
the movie recorded over 15 hours of material

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.570
for his role, and prevented the script from
being eligible for a Best Adapted Screenplay

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.570
nomination.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.810
It may seem common place today, but twenty
years ago, having a major movie star voice

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.250
an animated character was a relatively new
concept - but thankfully it paid off, Williams'

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.440
manic and memorable performance alone makes
this worth seeing.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.320
Particularly fantastic is his introductory
song and dance number, "Friend Like Me"...

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.180
which flies by with some extremely unique
and inventive animation, backed by Alan Menken's

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.380
wonderful music.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.070
Jonathan Freeman, Linda Larkin, and the annoyingly
foul-mouthed Gilbert Gotfried portray the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.970
rest of the colorful, if stereotypical cast.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.330
Special mention needs to be made for Frank
Welker, an extremely talented, but generally

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.930
unknown voice-over artist who has nearly 1,000
credits to his name... mostly all specializing

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.020
in animal sounds and other unique vocal effects.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.040
Here, he provides personalities and voices
for Abu the monkey, and Rajah the tiger, among

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.130
other characters.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.519
His career has been so prolific that the combined
gross of all his projects is second all-time

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.270
behind only Samuel L. Jackson.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.580
Back to the film though... at its heart, it's
a fun adventure set in an exotic location

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.850
with likable characters, a simplistic romance
plot, and plenty of goofy high jinks.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.600
As expected, Disney's trademark animation
style is vibrant and beautifully rendered,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.760
especially in the film's Oscar-winning sequence
for "A Whole New World".

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.540
As has been my faux-criticism of all children's
films... the quickly paced story is a touch

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.510
heavy-handed at rushed at times, but the characters
and music provide for a lovely experience

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.310
that reminds kids it's important to be true
to yourself, and not get wrapped up in materialistic

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.349
endeavors.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.900
Eventually spawning two sequels, a TV series,
toys, video games, merchandise, and a Broadway

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.690
play, this G-rated movie is a timeless classic
people of all ages can enjoy again and again.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.569
"Aladdin", "Sparkling fable with hilarious
moments."

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:00.880
Now let's read some of your reviews.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:09.129
"Aladdin" on the rate-o-matic... a double
NINE.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.371
You applauded the musical numbers, and of
course - Robin Williams as the genie, you

00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:14.070
thought the movie was AWESOME.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.200
Since it's so hard to separate this picture
from my childhood, I simply won't.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.840
I loved it then, and I still do today.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.170
I think it's AWESOME as well.
