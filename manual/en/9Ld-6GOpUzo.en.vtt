When you're walking around the
White House floors and seeing

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:13.667
all the rooms where so much has
happened and so much history is

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:16.467
kind of -- I mean, it's truly
one of the most amazing

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:18.767
experiences one could
have, it really is.

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:20.967

We're all little elves
running around, so...

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:23.734
Volunteer:
And it happens so much faster
than one could ever imagine,

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:26.900
I mean, we're doing,
what is it, 18, 20 rooms?

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.800
The First Lady:
This would not be possible if
it weren't for the 85 fabulous

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.333
volunteers who took time out of
their busy lives to come from

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.767
all parts of the country to
help us decorate this house,

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:40.300
and it happens overnight.

It's been really inspiring
to watch all these talented

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.667
designers put this
plan together.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:48.834
We're all volunteers,
we're not paid.

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:53.033

I have been climbing scaffolding,

I have been down on the
floor skirting trees,

00:00:57.734 --> 00:01:01.266
I have been organizing
floral arrangements,

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.934
I have been placing
Poinsettias, everything and

This year's theme
is "Joy to All."

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:29.200
It celebrates the many joys
of the holiday seasons,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.800
the joy of giving and
service to others,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.300
the joy of sharing our blessings
with one another, and of course,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.467
the joy of welcoming our friends
and families as guests into our

I can see why people really
want to come and visit the White

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
House over the holidays,
because it's really --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.934
it even takes on a more
magical experience.

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:52.700
I'm in the Oregon
Air National Guard,

I've been in the
Guard for 22 years,

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:59.000
and I wanted to nominate my
partner to become a volunteer

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.734
and thought, well, now that the
Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy has

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:04.433
been repealed, I can
actually write the letter.

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:06.033
Before, I would never dare.

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:09.600
The First Lady:
Throughout the holiday season,
more than 90,000 people will

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.800
come from all around the
world to see this house,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.867

holiday season is truly special.
