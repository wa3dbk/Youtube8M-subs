"The True Shelf Life of Cooking Oils"

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:07.076
When you look at a bottle 
of oil in the grocery store,

00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:09.237
there’s a “best-before” date,

00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:13.217
advising consumers how long they have to 
consume it before it starts going rancid,

00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:14.906
and builds up oxidation products

00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:18.505
that can be particularly 
harmful to human health.

00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:22.161
Here are the best-before 
dates for eight culinary oils:

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:26.093
almond oil, avocado oil, 
hazelnut, macadamia,

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:30.239
grapeseed, rice bran, toasted 
sesame, and walnut oil.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.838
These are the best-before 
dates in numbers of months,

00:00:33.838 --> 00:00:36.017
counting from the day the oil is made.

00:00:36.017 --> 00:00:40.585
So, if you made a batch of 
walnut oil on January 1, 2012,

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:42.535
the best-before date 
printed on the bottle

00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:47.245
from that batch would be 12 
months later — January 1, 2013.

00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:49.993
Now, this is making some 
pretty strict assumptions.

00:00:49.993 --> 00:00:53.115
This is assuming you are 
keeping the oil in the refrigerator

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:56.277
in a airtight, dark container, 
so it’s not exposed to air,

00:00:56.277 --> 00:00:57.840
room temperature, or light—

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.284
particularly after it’s opened.

00:01:00.284 --> 00:01:01.993
Now, these scientists were skeptical

00:01:01.993 --> 00:01:04.717
that the companies were 
printing accurate dates.

00:01:04.717 --> 00:01:06.516
And so, they put all the oils to the test

00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:10.742
to find out what the true 
expiration dates were.

00:01:10.742 --> 00:01:13.039
Would it match what the companies say?

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.947
Would the companies 
put a longer duration,

00:01:14.947 --> 00:01:18.118
trying to make the oil appear 
more stable than it really is?

00:01:18.118 --> 00:01:20.755
Or, would they put a shorter duration,

00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:25.464
trying to encourage people to buy 
their product more frequently?

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:28.218
For rice bran oil, the 
company said seven months.

00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:31.999
And actual estimated shelf 
life found in the tests?

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:33.350
6.5 months.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.142
Not bad, pretty close.

00:01:35.142 --> 00:01:37.913
In some cases, though, the 
truth was stretched one way;

00:01:37.913 --> 00:01:39.844
in others, it was 
stretched the other way.

00:01:39.844 --> 00:01:41.564
Look at almond oil.

00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:43.406
They said it would last over a year,

00:01:43.406 --> 00:01:46.631
and it really only stayed 
good for three months.

00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:49.375
And remember, that’s three 
months in the fridge, in the dark—

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:53.504
and after production, 
not after when you buy it.

00:01:53.504 --> 00:01:56.871
Macadamia and walnut oil 
were the real outliers, though.

00:01:56.871 --> 00:02:00.627
Mac oil lasted longest; over a year.

00:02:00.627 --> 00:02:03.753
The company totally 
undersold its stability.

00:02:03.753 --> 00:02:06.181
But for walnut oil, they said a year,

00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:11.173
and it only lasted about 
two and a half weeks—

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:18.495
according to rancidity 
testing with the “Rancimat.”
