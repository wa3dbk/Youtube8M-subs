Quick question: If all the fish in an aquarium
die...does that make it a dead pool..59fifty

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.810
hat?

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.229
Instead of going out in the rain, stay inside

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.590
costumes...

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.159

a variety of different games...

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.530
But if you'd rather skip the creating a game
step, play Lumen.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.500
Lumen is a fun and free puzzle platformer
that finds you as a little girl in a nightmare.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.870

platforms and take polaroids of objects in

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.569
order to manipulate them...

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.950

play some Donkey Kong Jenga and while you

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.700
wait for the ambulance to arrive hang up these
really cool Pokémon prints by Rebekhaart...

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:58.460
Sadly, because of the rain the ambulance didn't
arrive in time so your friend is in Calvin

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.840

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.690
