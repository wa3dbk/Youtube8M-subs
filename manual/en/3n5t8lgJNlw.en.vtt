00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.000
- TWO WEEKS AGO, OUR NEXT GUEST
POSTED A VIDEO OF HERSELF

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.700
SPEAKING GIBBERISH
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.133
YOU HEARD ME.

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:09.500
TODAY THAT VIDEO HAS MORE THAN
10 MILLION VIEWS ON YOUTUBE.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.566
TAKE A LOOK.

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:13.566
- [speaking indistinct
gibberish]

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.566
I TELL--I KEEL IN MY BONES.

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:22.833
DUMB THINGS, INNIT?

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:24.833
IT'S LIKE A MIRACULOUSLY
MARBLEIZING FELT PEN.

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:28.666
LIKE A ORDINARY SENTENCE
OF A MARINATING FOLLOW ROW.

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:32.166
- ALL THE WAY FROM FINLAND,
PLEASE WELCOME SARA FORSBERG.

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.166
[cheers and applause]

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:41.833
HOW ARE YOU?

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:45.333
[cheers and applause]

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:48.433
WELL, SARA,
SO YOU LIVE IN FINLAND NOW

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:49.833
OR HAVE YOU
MOVED HERE SINCE?

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:51.666
- NO, I LIVE IN FINLAND STILL.
- STILL.

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.000
AND WHAT'S--WHERE--
WHERE IN FINLAND?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.666
- IT'S THIS TINY TOWN
CALLED PIETARSAARI.

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.166
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TRY TO PRONOUNCE THAT.

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.133
- PIETARSAARI.
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.833
AND, YEAH, WE'VE BEEN
MOVING AROUND QUITE A BIT.

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.000
LIKE, WHEN I WAS A KID,
WE LIVED IN TEXAS

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.466
AND WE LIVED IN ENGLAND

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.766
AND THEN WE CAME BACK
TO FINLAND.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.633
- SO AND WHAT GOT YOU
TO START DOING

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:13.000
ALL THESE DIFFERENT ACCENTS
AND--

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU ARE SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.600
LIKE PORTUGUESE OR WHATEVER,
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.100
YOU'RE JUST SOUNDING LIKE IT.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.333
- YEAH, I'M JUST PRETENDING
LIKE ALWAYS.

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.466
- DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:24.033
IT WAS GONNA PICK UP
THIS MUCH TRACTION?

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:25.166
- NO, NO IDEA.

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.666
I MEAN, I LITERALLY
PUT OUT THE VIDEO,

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.333
I WENT TO BED, AND THEN THE--

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:32.166
LIKE, THE MORNING I WOKE UP,
IT HAD HIT OVER 100,000 HITS.

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.666
- IT'S AMAZING.
IT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE.

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.133
SO IT GAVE ME AN IDEA.

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.133
I'M GONNA PUT 45 SECONDS
ON THE CLOCK, AND YOU'RE--

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:40.100
I'M GONNA TRY TO GUESS
WHICH ACCENT YOU'RE DOING, OKAY?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.400
- GREAT.
- SO...

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.666
- OKAY.

00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.666
[speaking gibberish]

00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:46.500
- UH, FRENCH.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.000
- [speaking gibberish]

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.433
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:53.333
[laughter]
- AM I THAT BAD?

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.633
- NO, THAT'S JUST I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE.

00:01:55.633 --> 00:02:00.100
- [speaking gibberish]

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.400
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT'S
WHAT THE JAPANESE SOUNDED LIKE.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.666
[laughter]

00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:06.666
- [speaking gibberish]

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:11.533
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:12.666
[laughter]

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.833
THAT'S AMERICAN?
- OH, MY GOD. YEAH.

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:15.900
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.133
- IT WAS GIBBERISH.

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:18.600
THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT,
ISN'T IT?

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.833
- OH, THE WHOLE THING WAS--
YOU'RE DOING GIBBERISH AMERICAN.

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:26.666
[speaking gibberish]

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:28.333
THIS IS THE STUPIDEST GAME
I EVER--

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:30.333
[laughter]

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:31.833
I COULDN'T GUESS ANY OF THAT.

00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:32.833
ALL RIGHT.

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:36.666
[cheers and applause]

00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:39.166
SO I UNDERSTAND
WHEN YOU FILM YOURSELF,

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:40.500
YOU'RE BALANCING THE CAMERA

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.100
ON ALL KINDS
OF DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.933
YOU HAVE TO SIT THE CAMERA
ON THINGS, RIGHT?

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:46.066
- YEAH, I GET WHATEVER I FIND
AROUND THE HOUSE.

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:47.366
THAT WOULD BE LIKE,
I DON'T KNOW,

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:50.000
TEA BOXES, RYE BREAD,
AND WHATEVER, SO--

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.066
- ALL RIGHT, SO I THOUGHT
I WOULD GIVE YOU SOMETHING,

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:54.333
A LITTLE GIFT
SO YOU CAN STEADY YOUR CAMERA,

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:55.666
'CAUSE I THINK YOUR--

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:58.666
YOU DESERVE SOMETHING
BETTER TO PUT A CAMERA ON.

00:02:58.666 --> 00:02:59.933

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:01.266
