00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.860
The jewels of the Central and South America
rain forest certainly are the Poison Dart

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.660
or Poison Arrow frogs.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.620
These frogs are beautifully colored, as you
can see.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.560
They get their name, of course, from the natives
that inhabit these areas use them in hunting.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.560
What they do is catch an adult frog they would
rub the tip of the arrow or the tip of the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.369
poison dart they are using on the frogs back.

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.759
They have to agitate the frog a little bit
in order to get the frog to secrete the toxic

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.640
poisons that naturally come out of their skin.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.070
That poison would then be dried onto the arrow
or the dart and they use that to catch things

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.000
way high in the canopy where without these
frogs assisting them they would never be able

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to get their food.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.680
It's very difficult for anybody that lives
in the rain forest to catch something.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.350
The trees are 80 to 100 feet high.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.000
So, the poison dart frogs are animals that
mankind uses almost as a tool to live in a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.960
very inhospitable area.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.530
They get the poison, however it's not a natural
thing that comes out of their back.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.020
We've learned over the years that the frogs
acquire this poison through a series of events.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.040
A small ant would eat the root of a plant,
that ant would get eaten by another insect,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.030
and the frog would eat that insect and the
toxins are passed on, possibly from the plant

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.020
itself all the way through into the frogs
body and therefore out of it's skin.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.610
That's how they make that poison.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.009
There's probably 100 different Poison Dart,
Poison Arrow frogs out there, but only very

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.770
few of them are that toxic to humans.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.670
One in particular comes from Columbia is called
the terribilis frog.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.740
It's poison is so potent that just touching
it, it could permeate your skin and cause

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.740
death.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.880
These animals are highly sought-after by the
Indians there who know enough to grab a leaf

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.380
and wrap it around the frog to hold on to
it.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.670
Sometimes they put them over a flame to get
the frog incensed, and he produces the poison.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.910
They'll use that poison, but they always thank
the frog for using the poison, and they let

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.409
him go and release him back into the forest.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.159
No frogs are hurt in the making of that film.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.869
It's very, very important.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.931
People of the forest have a way of understanding
that, rather then destroying the animal, they

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:14.560
use them to their advantage.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.720
So, Poison Dart frogs have a great relationship
with the people of the forest in Central and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.010
South America.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.570
They are indeed the jewels.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.230
Look at these fantastic colors.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.520
This is just a small variety we have in front
of us.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.160
Poison Dart, Poison Arrow frogs.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.519
You can't make this stuff up.
