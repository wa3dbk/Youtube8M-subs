00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.140
Training or racing your now able to set a
profile for all your bikes or at least up

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.260
to 10 which is great if you're into multiple
disciplines such as road, mountain biking

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.010
or cyclocross. Yer the touch screen carried
on from the 800, it's a lot more clear as

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.010
well the graphics and the interface on the
screen so you've got a lot more options for

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.980
how many different data profiles you can have
on the actual device. Once you power on your

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.050
unit you'll see a home screen which looks
quite similar to this one, from the main menu

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.840
select tools, which is the spanner symbol
in the bottom left hand corner. Select activity

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.980
profiles, my racing days are over so there's
only really one option for me, select training

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.000
pages, and here you've got the option to turn
on or off up to 5 separate training pages

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.640
each of which can have up to 10 data fields,
I'm going to concentrate on page 1, it only

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.640
gives you a small space for each data field,
I prefer to have around 6 or perhaps 7. Once

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.720
you've decided how many fields you want press
on the tick button now at this point we can

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.150
decide exactly what data we want to see in
each of the fields, just press on one of the

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.150
boxes and go down and chose which field you
want. I do quite like to have lap distance

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.490
at the top I also like seeing my average power
for a lap that's what I like to see on one

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.370
of my screens when I'm out training. Press
again on the tick button and then navigate

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:46.370
all the way back to the start and then when
you press ride see that screen appears exactly

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.549
how you selected it. If you just want to change
one single data field, rather than going through

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:59.549
all those options you simply press and hold
on one of the data fields and again it will

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.820
bring up the menu for the different data categories.
If you're in need of a little motivation to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.150
push your performance the 810 still offers
a virtual training partner, once you've clicked

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.120
on ride scroll across and you'll see this
screen here. This is a digital depiction of

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.840
your goal speed versus your speed in real
time or a little man / women who you can follow.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.290
You can also, just like on the Garmin 800
change the data fields whether you want them

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.290
on or off on the map screen. Go to settings,
activity profiles, train, training pages and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.319
the map profile is a little further down.
Press on map, as you can see I've already

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.410
got 2 data fields on their you can have them
on or off, you can make it a custom one as

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.410
well so you can either have them on when navigating
or not navigating click on 2 data fields and

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.989
again you can customise exactly what you want
to see here so navigation is a good one to

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.750
use, distance to destination once you're done
just go back until you get to the home page.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.470
