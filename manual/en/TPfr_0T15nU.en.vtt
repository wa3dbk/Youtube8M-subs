00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm going as soon as possible under the bridge. Only the AMX 13 can be there first.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Not good! I have 140 HP left. It is miracle I'm still alive.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Cut! I fired into the side of IS-4 two magazines, without effect.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Our IS-4 calls for the attack. Although I'm still loading HE, but you have to help him.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The end of the magazine, I rush to the enemy base. IS-4 should deal with him. Already a 5-8 :-(

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Oh, shit, arty. And I still have to reload half a minute :-(

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
He will hit me for billionl ... I'm not looking death in the face. Run! 5-9 :-(

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Damn Tiger! Still reloading!

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
The second miracle! Arty didn't kill me! The Third Miracle: Tiger missed!

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Luck! 8-9 and I'm going to cap! Loading, just in case.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Faster KT, faster! I'm here at the bottom of the ladder food. 9-9!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I asked KT for shielding me. I have more cap points, 0 armor and 140 hp.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
There was a full IS-8! And we have only 79 cap!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We had :-( He hit KT and now he wants to hit me.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
But I can stab him.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Bastards clearly aiming at me! 99 cap! Just a little bit!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
He aimed at me, hit the KT, and we have 100! cap!

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Miracles limit exhausted :-)
