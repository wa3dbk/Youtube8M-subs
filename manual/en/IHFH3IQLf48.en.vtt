00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.320
Hey everyone!

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.080
Jaystepher with Straight And Crossroad Base Plates by Lego City.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.060
Set number 7280.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.640
Contains two pieces.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.880
Recommended building ages are 5 through 12.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.740
So I'm taking it we are getting just one of each.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.180
Here's the back.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.420
Let's open it up and see what's inside.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.580
It is packaged in shrink wrap.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.099
Okay!

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.160
So indeed we do have two pieces.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.540
So here we have the crossroad

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.100
and the straight road base plates. 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.780
These are measured 32 by 32 studs.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.420
They are the dark grey with white print work.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.440
This one, of course, has a six-stud wide sidewalk on either side of the road,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:43.720
and of course the crossroad has four 6 by 6 studs.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.720
These will be perfect for any Lego city.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.700
Lego Town.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.120
It is flat and smooth for vehicles to drive across.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.780
Let's talk about the pros of these.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.940
Of course it will save a lot of time to make the roads for your city.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.020
Everything's printed.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.480
The cons are that these are sold together.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.380
So for example, if you needed straight aways

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.020
or just the intersections,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.740
it will be totally impossible because they are only sold in groups of two.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.200
So if you waned six straight aways, you're also getting six intersections.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.480
That's a bummer.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.740
I'm not sure why Lego sales them that way.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.980
Be nice if they sold them separately.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.400
So if I wanted to buy seven of these,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.040
I don't have to buy seven of the intersections.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.040
So indeed there are two base place.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.300
So this is the Straight and Crossroad Base Plates by Lego City.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.700
Set number 7280.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.900
Contains two pieces.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.900
Recommended building ages are 5 through 12.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.620
Not a whole lot to say about this set

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.760
seeing that it only has two pieces.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.660
Thank you for watching!
