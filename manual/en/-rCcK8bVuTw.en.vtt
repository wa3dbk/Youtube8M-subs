00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.150
This is my anchor knife

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.040
I think it's a useful tool and

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.600
I take it almost everywhere I go, and in this

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.370
video I want to introduce it to you in detail

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.330
It is certainly called anchor knife, because in the

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.060
wooden handle a small brass anchor is inserted

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.270
This anchor refers to the maritime origin of this knife

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.790
It has been developed for british sailors 150 years ago

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.200
The blade has a very particular shape,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.870
it has a straight edge and a curved back

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.300
And because this shape looks like a sheep's foot

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.640
such blades are called sheepsfoot blades

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.090
Who ever watched "Shaun, The Sheep"

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.210
can imagine it roughly

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.610
There were two reasons for this design:

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.520
first you can cut a rope in a special way - 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.470
how this exactly works, I'll show you later

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.890
The second reason is the absence of a dangerous knifepoint

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.780
You can't hurt yourself that easily

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.480
on a swaying ship

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.140
Furthermore the former sailors

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.060
shouldn't be given a tool 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.160
with whom they could hurt each other

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.420
Before I tell you

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.750
what an awesome knife the anchor knife is

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.560
I'll show you three things

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.560
it isn't really useful for

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.760
First, as just mentioned

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.430
due to the lack of a decent knifepoint

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.080
you can hardly stick the knife into something

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.450
It is even dangerous to try this

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.240
At such an attempt the blade can

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.050
easily snap back and hurt your hand

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.220
Secondly: with this knife it is laborious to

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.570
scratch something off a flat surface

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.570
You just can't reach the surface 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.160
close enough with the blade

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.280
Third: the major disadvantage in my opinion

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.400
The anchor knife is not a good

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.650
alternative for a butter knife

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.370
Of course you can cut your cutlet

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.800
or dice your cheese with it,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.890
but in doing so, the knifepoint is always

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.760
dragged across the plate or the chopping

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.660
board and may blunt very rapidly

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.430
And if you want to butter a slice

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.150
of bread you have to turn

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.660
the blade, otherwise the knifepoint

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.360
will tear the bread

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.480
I must admit that an OPINEL would

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.260
be the better choice here

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.700
And now to the many reasons

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.570
why I like my anchor knife

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.700
It's an excellent working knife

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.700
which facilitates my daily routines

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.490
It helps me to open

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.860
cartons and packaging

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.810
The straight edge can be applied

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.810
without great force like an utility knife

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.020
The blade is ideal for

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.960
cutting along a ruler

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.540
on a cutting pad

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.540
Other materials like leather

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.540
or rubber are cleft very cleanly

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.540
With your forefinger you can put

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.540
some extra pressure onto the blade

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.640
In a "peel-an-apple-position" the anchor

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.500
knife lies perfectly in your hand

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.140
Like this you cannot only peel apples

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.050
or other food, but you can

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.130
also strip a cable

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.550
sharpen a pencil

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.510
or shorten a stick

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.250
Generally, you can work very well

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.650
on wood with this knife

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.010
Since the straight blade is

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.180
slightly directed towards the front,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.470
you won't slip of the tip

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.530
while carving

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.420
In addition, the tip is shaped

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.780
like that of a knife for notch carving

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.460
So you can carve

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.220
very precisely in wood

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.880
Furthermore, the anchor knife 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.660
very convenient for gardening

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.020
The quality of the anchor knife

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.650
turns out to be very alarming

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.250
I have no problem to

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.190
open a can with it

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.660
I would release my LAGUIOLE

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.360
from this kind of procedure

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.360
Don't try this at home

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.920
As announced, I'll now demonstrate

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.120
a primary application of the anchor knive

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.620
namely the neat cleaving of a rope

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.900
That's why the

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.610
anchor knife is sometimes

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.030
called "rope knife"

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.920
The rope is placed on an suitable

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.050
base and the blade is put onto it

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.810
Now you have to strike strongly at the back of

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.640
the blade, eg. with a belaying pin

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.020
or a piece of wood

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.830
The result is a clean

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.390
and fringeless cut

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.080
You need not use the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.390
anchor knife for cutting

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.900
to enjoy it

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.500
The fine wooden handle can

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.500
also give you a haptic pleasure

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.080
The anchor knife is not the

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.460
only one with a sheepsfoot blade

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.460
These are two working knives which

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.460
have the same shape

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.350
Simply the anchor is missing

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.720
This little knife is used by

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.290
gardeners for grafting plants

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.470
To produce an extremely clean cut

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.720
the blade is only sharpened at one side

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.310
Sometimes a manufacturer launches a

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.060
classic knife in a version

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.520
with a sheepsfoot blade

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.920
This for example is a french DOUK-DOUK,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.920
a very rare model

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.980
This old sailorÂ´s knife with marlinspike

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.410
has no sheepsfoot blade by the way

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.340
The edge is straight, too

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.670
but the back isn't that curved

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.820
Furthermore it is spikyer. Blades

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.110
shaped like this are called WHARNCLIFFE

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.380
The design of the anchor knife is

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.560
not protected by the way,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.070
anyone can produce it

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.780
With LÃ¼tters, Otter-Messer, Klaas and

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.190
Linder there are four current

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.400
providers only from Solingen,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.380
but it is also produced in

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.130
France, Spain and Italy

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.050
In France it is also called:

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.460
"Le London"

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.040
There are knives in different

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.560
sizes and variants

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.690
The blade is often available as

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.160
either stainless or made of carbon steel

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.240
Some manufacturers provide it

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.670
with a lanyard ring or a

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.530
drilled hole at the end of the handle

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.650
At cheap knives like this one the

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.570
anchor is sometimes only glued on

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.790
At last, one word about the sharpness

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.450
It's no problem to

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.090
cut some piece of paper

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.090
But it may also be a bit more than that

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.090
Of course, that's only a showpiece

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.980
but maybe I could demonstrate to you

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.460
what a useful item

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.990
this small knife is

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.910
Bye ...

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.910
and take care of your fingers!
