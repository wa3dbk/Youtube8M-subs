00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.090
COMM: In Los Angeles a pair of engineers have

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.979
taken the idea of car pooling literally, converting
a cadillac into a hot tub.

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:20.960
Affectionately named Carpool de Ville, the vehicle is
fully functional as both a car and a spa.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.110
DUNCAN: Hello, I'm Duncan Forster.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.810
PHIL: And I'm Phil Weicker

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.849
DUNCAN: And we'd like to introduce you to the Carpool de Ville.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.110
COMM: After building an earlier prototype

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.610
out of a 1982 Chevy Malibu, Duncan and Phil decided to embark on a new project, that would

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.980
let them attempt the land speed record for
the world's fastest hot tub and a Kickstarter

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.800
campaign followed. The starting point for
the project was a 1969 Cadillac Coup de Ville,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.740
which they bought for $800.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.200
COMM: Over 6 years, they stripped the car

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.000
and fitted a custom-built fibre glass tub,
along with a range of other features.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.820
DUNCAN: The original 472 cubic inch Cadillac

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.490
V8 has been restored to a top running order.
Components not relevant to the Carpool de

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.130
Ville were removed and most notably the
alternator was upgraded to deliver the power

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.000
necessary to operate the hot tub related accessories.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.890
PHIL: The stark suspension system has been

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.880
replaced with air bags. In addition to easily
accommodating the added water weight, this airized

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.740
suspension features a four wheel independent
adjustment.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.659
COMM: The dashboard gauges and steering

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.320
column have been made watertight and a boat throttle controls the car's standard automatic transmission.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.409
DUNCAN: The controls are also sealed and located

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.930
well above the water line. Switches control
the suspension while information about gear

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.880
selection, turn indication and headlights
appear on this display. The trunk has been converted

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.430
into the carpool's physical plant, it contains
the inverter, that delivers the DC current

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.680
and the performance alternator to this AC
1.5 horse power spa pump. Additionally there

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.859
is an electric heater, a filter and an overflow tank which allows water to be cycled

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:20.350
back into the tub as it is needed. The components related to the pneumatic suspension are back here as well.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.600
PHIL: For indoor use auxiliary water and power

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.620
connections are located here, this outlet
is for the electric heater and can accept

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.790
110 or 220 volt power input. Stainless steel heat exchanges deliver heat from the engine's

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.139
cooling system into the water in the tub. While the engine is running the system can be turned

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.340
on and off and is tied in to the main controls
for the hot tub.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.430
COMM: With the Carpool de Ville now fully

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.720
functional it was time to make their bid for
the record books.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.470
DUNCAN: In August of 2014 we took the Carpool

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.230
de Ville to the historic speed way in Bonnaville,
Utah, in an attempt to set the land speed record

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.010
for the worlds fastest hot tub.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.000
COMM: However, their official attempt was to be thwarted.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.639
DUNCAN: For the first time in decades the

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:09.370
time trial event was cancelled on account
of there being water on the course, not ours,

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.300
but the irony wasn't lost on us!

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.980
COMM: Determined to get something from their

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.200
trip, the pair decided to stage their own time trial.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.520
PHIL: We found a patch of dry mud and marked

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:25.029
out our own course. We timed our run and collected
GPS data using various smart phones confirming that

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.290
we achieved a top speed of 50 miles per
hour.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.109
DUNCAN: We were limited by course length and

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.089
conditions. Although there are presently no
other known contenders for the record, we expect that

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:41.930
under the right circumstances the Carpool
de Ville ought to be able to go a lot faster.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.059
COMM: Maybe next summer Duncan and Phil can

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:51.109
return to Utah and officially take the record
for the world's fastest hot tub.
