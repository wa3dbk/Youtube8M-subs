00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:05.238
Let me try the Gumbo.

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:07.340 align:start size:91% position:9%
My expert Chef,
Ron Duprat,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.441 align:start size:91% position:9%
is revisiting
Spirits on Bourbon

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:11.177 align:start size:91% position:9%
in New Orleans,
Louisiana.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:12.678 align:start size:91% position:9%
I wanna test
whether the Gumbo

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:14.513 align:start size:91% position:9%
is still being
cooked properly.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:17.350 align:start size:91% position:9%
Last time, he literally
threw up from it.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.918 size:84% position:42%
Let see what happens.

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.087
Okay, guys,
this is the moment
of truth.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:22.055
<i> Cross your fingers.</i>

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:36.869
I approve.

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.371
<i> You did an excellent job</i>â– 

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.073
since the last
time I was here.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.809
It's just cooked
to perfection.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.144
The Gumbo is great.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.546
And in Louisiana,
that's critical.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:47.947
I applaud you for that.

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:49.315
Brad:
<i> Well, thanks a lot, man. We've
 been working hard</i>

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.883 align:start size:59% position:41%
to keep up to
your standards.

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:52.118
We did it.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.086
Now, let's check
the temperature.

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:58.625
Ice cold.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:06.265 align:start size:56% position:44%
Wow, perfect
178 degrees.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:07.633
<i> Everything is clean,</i>

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:10.002 align:start size:75% position:25%
the Gumbo recipe
is perfect,

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:13.272
consistence, I mean,
the fryer is clean,

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:15.908
<i> perfect, everything
 is date label,</i>

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:17.810 align:start size:91% position:9%
that's an
excellent job.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.146 line:0%
Brad:
<i> Ron loving the Gumbo
 two years after he left</i>

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.748 line:0%
and still saying it tastes
the same meant a lot to us.

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:25.084 line:0%
<i> Just proved that consistency
 and doing the same thing</i>

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.286
<i> and the recipe is right,
 it's important.</i>

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:29.255
Brad making magic.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.157
Tell me what
you think about that.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:40.767
Excellent.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.001
Fantastic.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.603
That's what I was
hoping to hear.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.806
This exact same
way two years ago.

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:47.941
My compliment, man,

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.142
you're doing
an outstanding job.

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:53.112
<i> Jon Taffer
 would be very proud of
 what you're doing.</i>

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:54.880
<i> Consistency,
 that's what you were
 always pushing,</i>

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.016
consistency.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:00.019
Our sales
last year were up over
a million dollars

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:02.188
and it's still growing
to this point.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.457
<i> Since the show,
 we've already went
 through over</i>

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.693
<i> a hundred thousand
 skeleton cups.</i>

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.660
We're buying
so many cups we had to buy
a warehouse

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.463
<i> to store all these cups in.</i>

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.498
<i> Right here,
 the order just came in.</i>

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:14.567
That'll last us
maybe three months.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:18.003 align:start size:63% position:38%
<i> Over here, we
 have our graveyard
 of barber chairs.</i>

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:19.472 align:start size:53% position:47%
So many people
come in the bar,

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.840 align:start size:59% position:41%
they got shots
in the shot chair,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.142 size:78% position:61%
we just go
through them.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.378
( cheering )

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:30.250
The shot chair
revenue has been
unbelievable.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.851
Every night
we're going through

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.719
<i> five to six bottles
 of liquor</i>

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.523
<i> just out of the shot
 chair alone.</i>

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:38.157
Man:
Yeah.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:40.259
I knew this chair
would be a hit.

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:41.493
It's a moneymaker

00:02:41.493 --> 00:02:44.430
and it's great to see
the money coming in.
