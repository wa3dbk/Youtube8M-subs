00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.309
Welcome to Blue Angels Robotics, my name is
Emma. In this video, I am going to teach you

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.310
how to measure the Reflected

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.220
Light Intensity with the color sensor. If
you want to learn how to follow a line

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.539
smoothly, this is important to get ready for that lesson.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.060
The Reflected Light Intensity mode measures

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.629
the total amount of light entering the sensor.
This includes the reflection of

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:43.339
the red LED, plus any lights in the room.
To reduce the noise from other light sources,

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:44.659
the sensor should be positioned

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:50.549
close to (but not touching) the surface being
measured. If you want to verify whether the

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:51.690
color sensor’s position is

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.400
appropriate, turn on or off the room light
and check whether the Reflected Light Intensity

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.689
value is still same.
Now, let’s measure. Press the right brick

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:10.250
button twice to go to the “Brick App”
tab. You’ll see the first app named “Port

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.920
View”, and it’s highlighted by default.
Press the “Center” button to enter to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.170
the port view. I don’t have any sensor

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.930
connected to port 1 now, so you see it shows
“NONE”. Click the “Right” brick button

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.780
twice to see the port 3 value. It

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:38.310
shows “3: COL-REFLECT” 83%. The intensity
of the light is measured as a percentage from

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.100
0 to 100. 0 means very dark, and

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:52.049
100 means very bright. When you move closer
to the dark line, the RLI value reduces.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.510
To let the robot follow this line,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.450
you can program the right motor moving forward
when the RLI value is high. And once it finds

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.250
the back line, both motors

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.909
can be programmed moving forward to follow
the line.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.599
If your computer is connected to the EV3,
you can also check the RLI value on the computer.

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.769
Click “Port View”, and check

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.000
what current value is for port 3. Move your
EV3 around, and see how the value changes here.
