Hi Dan

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Are you all ready for the transplant?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.500
I am ready as ever

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Good.  So you've had your pre-meds.  And..

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They gave me some...I don't know what the first ones were...two big pills.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And then she put some Benadryl, liquid Benadryl, in the line

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And then she put something else in there.  I don't know what that was.  Oh, that was probably Ativan.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But um, I'm getting a mixture of things that will prevent some allergic reactions

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because there are preservatives in the stem cells.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Alright...and you're already starting to feel a little drowsy and loopy.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.500
I am

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
From the Benadryl.  And she said most people sleep right through the transplant because of the Benadryl

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So we're not expecting you to be awake to much longer

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So I thought I'd get your thoughts on it now.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.500
Are you excited that this

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500
Did she put the Benadryl in this?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So, are you excited that this is the very last procedure that you'll have to have done?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
From here on out, it's just recovery

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I don't know

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You're going to miss it aren't you?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Chemo's been fun

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.500
I know

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.000
It gives me something to talk about

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Alright....stem cells are here

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Yayy....hiccup

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
hiccup

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.000
hiccup

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:25.000
-- Watching the stem cells drip down the tube --

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They're in!

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Cancer's out, good stuff's in

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Alright, here we are.  The end of the transfusion...or the stem cells.   Second bag.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
How many millions of stem cells was it?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
11.2 million cells

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Alright and it didn't take very long

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
