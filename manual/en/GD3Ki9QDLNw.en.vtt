00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.180
Men losing their hair is not an uncommon sign.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.600
In fact, this is become quite a regular part
of male existence, and many men have come

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.640
to accept it and expect it when you know when
it comes to their hair thinning stage.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.390
But for women who spend a ton of time taking
care of our crowning glory and spend tons

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.890
of money on it, female hair loss can be a
catastrophic event, to say the least.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.200
Female hair loss has a higher impact than
hair loss in men.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.950
It is more embarassing as the female hair
attacts more attention than male counterparts.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.540
Women are often expected to have a long thick
flowing hair while the expectation aren't

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.930
really set high for men.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.110
As women's hair are covering our ears and
our shoulders, suddenly losing it or having

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.530
thinning hair can be really devastating.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.759
I used to having a full head of hair as well
and can cause depression or lead to self-esteem,

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.140
and even may drive some women to just stay
inside to avoid having people see them in

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.240
their thinning hair.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.180
A common hair loss treatment use today is
designed for both men and women.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.440
But there are some hair loss treatments that
are designed specifically for women only.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.070
Each of these hair loss treatments are designed
to focus on the individual cause of the hair

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.220
loss.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.300
Some of the treatments are built for the hormonal
changes and imbalances of women experienced.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.760
And, the treatments will try to balance the
hormones to prevent future hair loss.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.700
On the other hand, for female hair loss caused
solely by medical conditions such as chemotherapy

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.729
which is really difficult to avoid and remedy,
the only recourse can only be to wear a wig

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.070
or a hat.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.150
Or, if you don't have total hair loss and
only partial or thinning hair, then someone

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.560
can wear extensions along with a good diet
regimen to promote hair growth.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.970
There are also lots of other women hair loss
products that really work well to stimulate

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.670
the scalp and the hair follicle to regrow
hair.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.469
And, this has been proven to be really effective.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.430
With all that being said, the main thing is
here is to be focus on looking for a hair

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.529
loss treatment that is good for you.

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.489
Remember, we all don't have the same kind
of head.

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.780
And, it's also good to keep your head cool
and don't ever hesitate to ask for help.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.500
Because really female hair loss isn't as uncommon
as it may seem.
