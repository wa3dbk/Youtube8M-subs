[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:09.210
I'm from Brooklyn.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.600
I live in Los Angeles.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.300
I went to the School
of Visual Arts.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.230
To me the best living
was to paint faces.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.080
A lot of people will
associate men and makeup

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.020
with rock and roll.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.140
But I always say
I'm more vaudeville

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.860
than I am rock and roll.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.950
And I'm more Charlie
Chaplin than Keith Richards.

00:00:29.365 --> 00:00:30.990
The world has come
to a different place

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.280
now, when it comes to men
taking care of themselves.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.530
I think more men spend more time
in the mirror than women do.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.260
Why should the girl
get all the attention?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.300
So guys do need a
little bit, you know?

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.790
But small measures.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.150
Small measures are important.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.850
So for me, it's just
like a little bit

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.000
of tinted moisturizer.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.125
It reduces redness.

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:53.500
I do have a couple of pencils
here that I'm going to use,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.900
because I do want to make the
eyes a little bit more edgy.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.230
One's like a real reddy brown,
and the other is a true black.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.363
And I think when it comes to
a man, it's gotta be tougher.

00:01:07.363 --> 00:01:08.780
So if you use
something that's got

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.460
more like a reddy
brown base to it,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.740
it just looks more lived in.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.980
It looks a little
bit more tired.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.070
Not Keith Richards
tired, but tired, like,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.900
in a hot, sexy way.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.440
Skin I think looks fine.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.330
I just put, again, a little
bit of moisturizer cream.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.670
Maybe a little bit of powder.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.652
Just because we don't
want to shine, either.

00:01:32.652 --> 00:01:34.110
The thing I like
about this powder,

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.840
too, is that it has a
luster to it, a little glow,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.000
as opposed to looking like
a flat, powdered face.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm going to fill my brows
in just a little bit.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.350
It's just eyeshadow.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.820
And this is a great,
like, taupe-y gray.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.590
Just feathers in a
little bit of color.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.100
And then I think I have a
little bit more masculine shape

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.860
to the brow, you know?

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.300
This also can be used, too.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.830
I mean, you can
use eyeshadow, too,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.440
to kind of fill in
gaps in the beard.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.030
Like, I got this weird spot.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.900
No hair grows there.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.580
I don't know what happened.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.220
So I'll sometimes, if I
had more of a grow out,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.370
I would pick up a little
shadow and just dot it

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.050
in to fill in some of the gaps.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.190
You could also use it if
you wanted to fill in--

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.980
you know, if you have
a real lame mustache,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.320
you can fill in with a
little bit of shadow.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.210
I think guys that care
about how they look

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.880
should absolutely feel
comfortable with wearing

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.360
tinted moisturizer, a
concealer, brow set.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.090
You know, whatever you need.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.980
Because I think that there
is nothing wrong with it.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.660
I think another thing a guy
has to have is lip conditioner.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.180
Prep and Prime lip is
nice, because it's not--

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.690
like, I think a lot of times
when guys put lip balm on,

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.820
it's really glossy
and really shiny.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.850
And this is sort of--

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.530
it gives moisture but
it's really low luster.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.600
It's in some nice,
masculine packaging.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.150
Yeah man, just putting
on my Prep and Prime.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.650
Let's start doing some eye work.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.720
I like reddy brown
to get in there.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.760
Just on the inside of the
eye is where I usually start.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.990
And I just don't worry about
it getting on kind of messy,

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.290
because we want it to be messy.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.960
Already that looks hot.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.500
You're turning into Iggy Pop.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.992
I think Iggy would approve.

00:03:34.992 --> 00:03:36.450
One of the cool
things that you can

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.830
do when you put this
inside your eyes,

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.280
you kind of cause
it really hard.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.150
It'll sort of squeeze the color
out and it gets even messier.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.152
I'm going to put a
little on top, too.

00:03:45.152 --> 00:03:47.610
It's not one of those things
where I'm, like, oh, every guy

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.770
needs to wear eyeliner.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.030
I come from a family of cops.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.666
My brother is going to be
like, I'm not wearing eyeliner.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:59.040
But for me, for this look
today, I'm feeling like it.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.810
Just blending out this
with a soft brush.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.590
Black, the most important,
is going to go inside now.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.030
And this is where it really
starts to get interesting.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.660
Some of my biggest inspirations
are Charlie Chaplin

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.360
and Rudolph Valentino.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.510
You know, men of that era.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.230
So I like playing with the
eye being the only expression

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.670
that they had, really.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.828
The Little Tramp
was a smoky eye.

00:04:26.828 --> 00:04:28.450
This is kind of a tricky part.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.210
We're going to line
the inner top part.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.030
Flip back the eye
and get in there.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.550
It's gross.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.375
It's really hard to do,
but it looks really good.

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:42.240
I think even right now, this
is probably too structured.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.600
So I'm going to add something
to kind of mush it up and really

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.480
get it a little crazier.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.200
So we're going to use
a gloss on the eye

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.250
to move this product around.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.380
Squeeze a tiny bit onto there.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.214
We're just pressing
it on the eye.

00:05:01.214 --> 00:05:03.977
And you can see how
much shine it creates.

00:05:03.977 --> 00:05:06.060
We're going to throw a
little bit underneath, too.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.500
This is the fun part, where
you just kind of wipe it

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.987
into the lashes and blend it.

00:05:17.987 --> 00:05:19.570
And then we're going
to go underneath.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.480
We're going to lift it
up into the eye there.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.730
We'll take a little bit
of that black on the top

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.870
and dot it in between.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.280
I'm feeling the need for a
little bit more strength,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.496
I think.

00:05:35.496 --> 00:05:38.720
If I kind of stipple the brush,
it'll break it up a little bit.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.140
So it won't be a
perfect black line.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.895
That's a hot look.

00:05:45.895 --> 00:05:47.770
I'm John Stapleton and
I'm going out tonight.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.220
