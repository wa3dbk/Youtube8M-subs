00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.040
Hello everyone

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.659
Can I ask you a question?

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.590
Are you suffering from age spots?

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.570
If your answer is yes, I guess you are over
40 too, ha?

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.610
Don't worry, you are not the only one dealing
with this problem.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.150
Although women are the ones who are mostly
worried about this, we, men, like to have

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.740
nice skin too :) Imagine that :)

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:28.130
I am currently at age 50 and few years ago
I have noticed some bad changes on my skin,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.770
you can guess, I started to get age spots.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.480
Since I find myself still very attractive
(and single btw) I decided to do something

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.480
about it.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.560
So, after spending few thousands of dollars
on medical treatments that did not work, finally

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.470
I have found a natural and fast and most importantly,
cheap solution.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:56.600
I mean really, those medical treatments cost
from $700-$1000 and you have to repeat them

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.440
few times for it to work, so you will spend
at least few thousands of dollars for some

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.700
overpriced medical treatment that might not
work, and on the other side, you can heal

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.490
yourself with natural things which are much
healthier and better for your skin.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.410
Anyway, maybe you were wondering why in the
hell am I telling you this and why am I filming

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.640
this video in the first place?

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.930
The answer is simple, I know how you feel,
I know that all of you want to look nice and

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.810
attractive, I know that you don't want to
spend too much money, and I know you don't

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.680
have too much time to waste.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.900
And yes, I am a good guy and I like to help
people too :) You are welcome :)

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:50.430
Enough small talk, here are few simple solutions
that involve home remedies, all natural of

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.920
course, which I have found about through one
product that I bought few years ago.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.200
To prevent age spots (liver spots) the best
thing to do is avoiding sun exposure which

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.509
will help prevent additional sun damage and
dark skin spots.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.329
Wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high
SPF level in areas of sun exposure such as

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:20.440
the face, neck, hands, and arms since those
are the areas that are affected the first.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:31.840
This natural treatment will prevent and reduce
sun spots and age spots on face effectively.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.959
There are also some other home remedies like
lemon juice - lemon juice is the best natural

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.870
dark spot corrector.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:55.829
Then, green papaya home remedy, buttermilk,
tea tree oil, apple cider, vinegar, onion

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.439
juice and many, many more.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:18.739
Unfortunately, I am not sure how to apply
all this remedies 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:34.060
on your skin, I guess I am too old to remember
everything, but I have found the link where

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.569
I got that instructions which you can see
in the description.

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:52.090
Take a look, buy it, it's really not expensive
and try it.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:01.189
Let me know how did it go in the comments.

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:07.979
Good luck ladies, and all the gentleman too.
