00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.380
well what in your view to proffer is on the
basics of CSS

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.500
in this of theories were going to be learning
just some of the basics of how did you form

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.880
any imposition with yes

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.290
this doesn't seem to have any prior experience
with the the offense

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.470
those in the village him now

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.790
if you have it you think it now before a meeting
if you're if you know could he feels a little

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.839
bit rusty

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.820
you may want to look at are each you know
think videos prior to watch it

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.180
but the only thing we assume I hear is that
you had to do that you know

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.270
you can download the introduction to CSS documents at www.createthenet.com  to be working with you this

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.170
action

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.150
as for instance that styles of their three
places that they can be created

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.590
you can create his hair styles in lorain

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.630
internally

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.640
warren external style sheet

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.250
in this class were going to assume that all
of your style are always going to be kept

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.570
and external style issues

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.710
that's going to be the maximum amount of flexibility
the maximum use of that work you put into

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.139
your style she's

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:32.479
and you know I I think you should avoid in
line styles of if at all possible

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.090
and only use and colonels

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.420
of styles are kept internally had section
of houston that she

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.940
of only was absolutely necessary

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.900
and you know later video you're going to see
how to block how to what work with those two

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.190
types of styles

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.490
but for right now we're just going to be working
with external style she

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.920
now the first thing that I need to do is they
need to actually create this that she

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.229
now I'm working here and really for you get
at CSIS files and anything at all anything

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.860
from know pat are simple tax you know all
the way up to a program like training for

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.349
during the very gives you a lot of different
shortcuts a lot of kids and help

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.439
of in writing your CSS so I would recommend
that you consider investing school

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.979
on life

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.289

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:38.789
so here again and remember having him L block
an open I need to create external style she

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:44.489
adrienne leader to do that all I have to do
is go to the filing you include me

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.049
when I did that this a new dialogue box is
going to come out

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.859
they're I'm going to select CSS as the page
think that I'm going to create

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.120
and that is we're going to create

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.950
and I know

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.139
yeah but CSS document

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.730
that is really propose

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.689
this information in the head in part

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.350
of your CSS %uh document

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.779
you can just leave them alone it is an essential
to have it there

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:16.439
on but doesn't that on detract from anything

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.539
and that created a kind of the final minutes
let's say

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:22.790
and I needed saying

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.969
that's fine

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:27.609
and I just finished diet that the effects

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.629
you're still has the spouse should always
have the stand today at CSIS on

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.089
and a quick saying

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:41.089
and you're going to see madrid weaver window
I now have style that see us

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:47.919
now do think that they've created a style
she is Friday of a web site doesn't mean

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:53.339
the fear of document is automatically going
to pick it up on

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:59.599
for example I created the styles CSS she you
can see it's right near same

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.679
all director is this basically well she

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:09.679
if I go ahead really quickly increases style
the for the head

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:12.949
did it change my life

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:14.119
on haiti

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:16.119
two

00:04:16.119 --> 00:04:21.139
the aerial far instead of times new ground

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.179
and I'm glad to see Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 basic each PML

00:04:25.179 --> 00:04:27.669
you're going to see that my heading

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.399
has it changed here at all

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:37.039
so before I can actually use his style she
I need to attach it to the states can help

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.750
to do that

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.370
indicate didn't come overnight handles section
over here

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.780
and I'm actually in the CSS style section

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.310
and the right clinic and it's a attached battle
she

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.090
the textile she is somewhere I'm you know
exactly how the pact to include browsing to

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.809
find it

00:04:56.809 --> 00:05:01.949
but since lifestyle changes in the same directory
and that

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.769
other to go ahead and just take the name of
this that she here

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:12.180
and the incredibly true that only import the
styles and intervals of the just lovely

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.310
no the competitive

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.210
and you're going to see

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.189
now that this but for them this tunnel she
has been attached

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:22.530
this document

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.979
my head was violence change

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.149
then the fall out is now

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:31.960
ariel is a times in a row

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.469
and you can see years he has asked the house
to simply by looking right over here

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:40.479
on it could be all button and you'll see there's
style she

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.479
and if I could that monitor lots of the leaks
in the class

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.229
the list of styles that are in there

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.810
and I he didn't click on

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.059
each one here

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:55.029
if you have anything left my age you know
about you but this is one of the advantages

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:56.509
of dreaming or

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.610
and I can see that properties four eight walk

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.460
I think the character have property

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.240
and I think it's like the CSS property at
what point caller

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.150
and then I can click here in chains

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.669
a different color

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.000
I mean it looks like we're just make it stand
now

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.870
and you'll see those changes

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.360
have been made inside

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.840
my document

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.490
in light of the styles

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:29.409
you're going to see that that's style with
automatically updated as well

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.219
widening a couple different changes here are
some of the farm and you know and it clicked

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:36.070
save all

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.710
their next meeting at we're going to talk
about the three different kinds of

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.370
styles that you can create

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.649
the three basic kinds of stuff that you can
create

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:52.649
all textiles class styles and ID's

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:59.050
also introduction to CSS Layouts the high
definition well the by seven point eighty

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.949
he's going to create the net back on

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:07.419
we up with these videos the video sharing
services they always shrink the video size

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:08.270
down

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.790
he creates equality

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.899
so you cannot little bit fuzzy

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:16.699
if you would go to the %uh website you can
see the for a solution versions

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.139
well these deaths
