Hello, I'm Martin Dorey and you are watching AdoramaTV.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.809
Today I'm going to be looking at resolution,
frame rates,

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.269
and fields of view on the GoPro Hero 3+ Black Edition camera.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.619
AdoramaTV presents,

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.479
Capture the Action with Martin Dorey.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.660
All GoPro cameras have different resolution,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.849
frame rate options, and a choice of field of view

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.710
and some of them are better for some things than others, some are great for action,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.239
some give great detail and some are
fantastic for slow-motion.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.140
Knowing which one to use, when, is the key
to getting

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.520
great action footage. We've been out on our bikes

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.100
to demonstrate to you how each setting
can affect your picture.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.260
Firstly let's talk about resolution,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.600
the resolution is the amount of
information thats captured on the camera sensor,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.910
it would affect the size and the quality
of your picture.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.750
The higher the resolution the
better-quality the picture.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.750
the lower resolution, the lower the quality. Now

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.010
the thing about resolution is that its
only as good as the device you're going

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.299
to be playing it back on,

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.140
so if you can be playing your video is
back on 4k high-definition television

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.750
then you'll want to set the resolution
on your camera 4k

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.070
because the quality will be justified However

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.270
if your videos are going to end up on
YouTube or Facebook,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.549
then you don't need to shoot at such a
high resolution because all you'll do

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.409
is use up memory, so you shoot at an
appropriate resolution.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.650
As you can see from this clip the
picture is super crisp and clear

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.840
with detail in the blacks and whites and
lot of good color representation,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.640
in what are actually a challenging range
of colors. This is fantastic quality

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.500
and great if you want to speed up footage,
show it on a 4k TV

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.820
or even take high-quality 8 megapixel
stills from your footage.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.750
At the other end of the scale you can
shoot at a resolution of 720

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.329
and you've got a choice of fields of view, of
narrow, medium

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.000
and wide and even super wide

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.700
and you can shoot at 25, 24, 50,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.660
or 100 frames a second. Now this stuff
isn't going to be as good as the 4k

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.340
quality

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.760
but it's going to be perfectly
acceptable for YouTube, and actually is really versatile.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.980
Hi, Martin Dorey here, don't forget to check
out Adorama's latest competition to win

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.880
some amazing prizes!

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.860
Right frames per second,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.090
now the frames per second rate that you shoot at

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.670
is really important to your footage. All standard videos

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.800
either run at 25 or 24 frames a second, this
is the number of pictures

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.000
that the video takes each second to give you a smooth movement.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Now if you shoot at 25 frames per second

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.080
and then play it back at 25 frames per
second it runs at normal speed,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.900
if you shoot 50 frames a second and then
play that video back at 25 frames a

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.410
second,

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.680
your video will run at half speed. This is
how you get slow motion and this is why

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.020
the frames per second

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.300
are so important when you're shooting on
your GoPro. If you want super slow motion

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.090
you can shoot at 100 frames per second
and that will allow you to slow it down

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.220
four times and still be a really lovely
smooth peace video, even

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.700
on the WVGA  setting, you can shoot

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.150
at 240 frames per second which will give you

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.170
super slow motion. I use this setting

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.190
WVGA at 240 frames per second to shoot
this clip

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.239
of me trying to keep up with my daughter on her bike.

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.110
The resolution is standard definition
but it's super slow motion,

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.160
it's a really, really great option if you
want to capture

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.709
and slow down fast action. Let's talk about

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.270
aspect ratio next very briefly. The aspect ratio

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.720
is the shape of your screen, okay,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.160
and on the GoPro you can shoot in 17x9

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.140
which is wide screen format, 16x9 which

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.480
isn't quite as wide, or 4x3.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.700
Now the sensor on the GoPro is shaped 4x3,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.079
so when you shoot in 16x9 it will

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.890
chop the top and bottom off the frame to
give you a wide framed picture,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.320
the same with 17x9. So let's look at the
difference between 16x9

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.250
and 4x3 in these two clips,
when you play them side by side

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.750
it's quite obvious, the clip on the
left is shot in ultra-wide 19x9,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.700
at 1080 resolution while the clip on the right is shot at 960

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.160
within aspect ratio of 4x3. What's
interesting about the GoPro

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.360
is that you could also shoot in super
view, now

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.630
they say it's the most immersive video
picture available,

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.110
and actually it is, the reason for this
is super view uses the entire 4x3 sensor

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.760
and it stretches the sides, so you get the
full height,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.810
and the full width of the sensor but with extra width

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.570
so it shoots at a 16x9 format, it looks
super wide

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.670
it's got super great quality, it's really lovely.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.980
You can see this really clearly in this clip, see how charlie's arms are stretched each side of her,

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.710
and we are able to see a lot more headroom, and a lot further down her body,

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.050
you're getting a really wide angle of view.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.760
Sometimes you aren't going to be its get close enough
to your subject, to be able to see everything

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.200
that's when you use your fields of view.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.760
Now on some resolutions you've got options,
you can shoot wide,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.190
you can shoot medium, and you can shoot
narrow fields of view.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.160
This is exactly the same as zooming in
or zooming out on a standard camera,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.670
or changing the lens. At 1080, you can
also choose a range of frame rates

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.950
with really good quality thats useful for
a range of applications,

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.910
add to that the benefit of being able to
change the field of view

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.070
and actually it starts to be a really good
option for most productions

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.320
and when you consider you add super

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.930
view into that at 1080 and you can start to
see how this is a setting

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.430
for most things. Let's take a look at the
1080 super view again,

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.080
see how there's lots of image top and
bottom, it really puts you there in the action,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.139
and even with the sun looking straight
down the lens,

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.850
or with a strong backlight, it still
holds the picture quality,

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.570
it really is astounding so if in doubt, that's the one to go for.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.720
Okay that's it for now

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.810
