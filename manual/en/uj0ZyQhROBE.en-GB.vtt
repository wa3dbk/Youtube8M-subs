00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:18.650
So here's this week's key question - which
is faster around the tight and twisty infield

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.699
track at Rockingham Motor Speedway, a works
Honda BTCC car, a works Honda British Superbike,

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.099
or a McLaren MP4-12C Spider?

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:39.379
I guess it must seem slightly mad to be comparing
a road car with a full-on British Touring

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:47.899
Car and a full-on British Superbike. But actually
if you do the maths, the old McLaren could

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.170
actually stand a bit of a chance here because
it doesn't weigh that much more than a touring

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.530
car. It weighs just under 1500kg whereas the
minimum weight for the touring car is 1280.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.250
Okay, there's a difference there but it's
not gigantic. And the trade-off for that is

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.350
that the McLaren, of course, has 630 odd horsepower
whereas the touring car, they've just told

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.680
me, only has about 350 maybe 360 if they run
a little bit more boost. So really, in a straight

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.090
line, the McLaren should absolutely demolish
the touring car.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.240
The bike, however, is another matter. That
weighs about 160kg before you stick a rider

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.710
on it. And yet it's got very nearly 200bhp.
It has got 200bhp so when you do the maths

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.090
with that, the bike in a straight line should
just be incredible. And it is. I've already

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.599
seen him having a little practice run on it.
He just goes from over there to over there

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:56.841
in one blink of one eye. It's extraordinary
how fast it looks. So I don't know. We'll

00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:03.020
try a lap time in the McLaren and we'll do
a bit of data crunching and see where we end

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.020
up.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:13.420
To drive a BTCC car, we enlisted the services
of Gordon Shedden, aka Flash, who very nearly

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.900
won the championship this year driving this
very car. To ride the bike we persuaded 23-year-old

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.959
wonder boy Alex Lowes to don the exact same
Samsung Honda overalls in which he clinched

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.099
the British Superbike Championship this year
at Brands Hatch. And, of course, Muggins here

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.859
got to drive the McLaren.

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:44.040
You cannot complain about the poke of the
McLaren. It feels, I would suggest, a lot

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.600
quicker than the touring car purely, in a
straight line. The trouble is though that

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.490
it doesn't develop the middle corner grip.
I'm having to break miles earlier than I suspect

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.790
Gordon is in the touring car. And even the
traction, actually, now that the rear tyres

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.780
are starting to go off, isn't that great.
I mean there's no wheelspin there but I'm

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.959
not really getting as much as I need from
the back end of this car and now the brakes

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:22.530
have just started to go a little bit as well.
It is a very hot day though. It's just the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.580
difference between an absolutely bespoke competition
car and something that you can drive home

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.489
in at night and then down to Sainsbury's in
the next day.

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:40.260
Okay, what do I think? I reckon if the McLaren
can get within 4 seconds of the touring car

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.480
it will be doing incredibly well considering
it's got number plates on. If it can get within

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.680
8 seconds of the bike I'll be amazed because
the bike just looks outrageous. Let's see.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.700
Let's have a look at some data.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.290
But before we do that, have a look at this.
We just went out and did a few warm-up laps

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.049
for the cameras here basically. We put Alex
on the superbike upfront so that he could

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:14.249
set the pace. I asked him to go nice and slowly
so that us chaps in the cars could keep up.

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:19.440
Shedden was just about okay with that in the
BTCC car but I got dropped in the McLaren

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.610
after about 3 corners and after that, they
just disappeared. What surprised me most when

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.970
I was trying and failing to follow them, apart
from the fact that the bike was in a different

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.210
league and on the main pit straight, was the
extra corner speeds they could cap. I mean

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.690
you drive the McLaren in isolation and you
think, "Nothing in the universe could stay

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.220
with this." But in reality there is a massive
difference between them.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:52.221
And the biggest difference of all was at turn
seven which you can see here. At the apex,

00:04:52.221 --> 00:05:00.450
the BTCC car was doing 94mph whereas the McLaren
was understeering all over the place at just

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.550
78mph. I guess you can thank the BTCC car's
aero and it's slick tyres for that, plain

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.010
and simple. What was really spooky though
was finding out how fast the bike could get

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.000
through the corners. In most cases it could
carry at least as much corner speed as the

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.190
McLaren. And in the faster, steady state bends
it could almost stay with the BTCC car. And

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.070
then down the straights it just murdered them
both.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:35.280
So in the end, and despite the gallant efforts
of Flash and his Honda BTCC team, Alex Lowes

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.740
and his British Superbike were undisputed
king of the day. They beat the Honda BTCC

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:50.440
car by 2.3 seconds and thumped the McLaren
by 7 seconds. Even when Shedden climbed in

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:58.120
and had a go to verify the lap time. This
time two wheels rule. If you need proof, take

00:05:58.120 --> 00:07:32.531
a look at this. And if you're a car driver,
weep.
