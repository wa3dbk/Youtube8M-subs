00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.000
PI DataLink  

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.000
from OSIsoft allows you to bring PI System data into   

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.000
Microsoft Excel and since   

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.000
Excel is the world's tool of choice for numbers PI DataLink  

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.000
is a very common tool for OSIsoft users. PI DataLink  

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.000
is an Excel addin. It has a separate install   

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.000
file that's downloadable from OSIsoft.com  

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.000
and installed on top of Excel. Once installed   

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:27.000
PI DataLink appears on the Microsoft Excel ribbon   

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.000
bar. The handful or so of DataLink functions are   

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.000
available by clicking the ribbon buttons and are configured with easy to   

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.000
use sidebar wizards.   

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:39.000
Many people use PI DataLink for either building reports   

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.000
or analyzing their process. First   

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.000
reporting; before they first use PI DataLink we often   

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:48.000
find people copying or pasting or importing raw data from  

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:51.000
text files and with PI DataLink that's completely   

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:54.000
unneeded. Your sheets update with live data and you can ask for   

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.000
more data anytime. See, I'll ask for an extra day   

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.000
here and the spreadsheet updates with my new request. I use   

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.000
this to create reports. At the end of every day I open my   

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.000
reports spreadsheet and PI DataLink replaces yesterdays data   

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:09.000
with today's data and I email it off.  

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.000
I have a single spreadsheet template for all of my heat exchanger   

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:15.000
assets and all I need to do is select the heat exchanger from this   

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.000
drop down list and my spreadsheet calls the data for  

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.000
that heat exchanger. It's all from a single spreadsheet and I  

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:24.000
save the time I would otherwise spend collecting and formatting data from  

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.000
all over the plant. Next is  

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.000
analysis; so there are many native Microsoft Excel   

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.000
functions that are very powerful for analyzing data but they just aren't   

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:36.000
designed with time series data in mind and that's the type   

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.000
of data that the PI system collects for me to process.  

00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:42.000
So for instance say I have these sensor readings from the   

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.000
past twenty-four hours, if I want to see the   

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:48.000
maximum sensor reading every hour and what time that   

00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:51.000
reading happened PI DataLink has a function for that and can   

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:54.000
quickly tell me.   

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.000
To do the same thing with the native Microsoft Excel function I would need  

00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.000
to divide the raw data by hour, run a different maximum   

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.000
calculation for each hour and then cross reference with the   

00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:06.000
raw data to find the time that that maximum happened   

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:09.000
and well that's a lot of steps that PI DataLink can do in one  

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:12.000
step. And what's more, if all I want to see are the   

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:15.000
maximum hourly sensor readings I don't even need all the raw  

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.000
sensor data on my sheet at all; I can clear it away   

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.000
and now my spreadsheet files are much smaller and calculate much   

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.000
faster without all that raw data. The bottom line  

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:27.000
is PI DataLink puts PI System data in   

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:30.000
Excel. As a bonus spreadsheets run faster with smaller file   

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.000
sizes and I have special functions for working with all my   

00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.000
time series process data.   

00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:39.000
