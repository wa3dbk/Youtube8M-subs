hi guys welcome to MinnieMollyReviews so today

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.549
I am reviewing 'fairy dust'

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.889
by Paris Hilton and so...

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.090
this is the third review I've done of

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.430
her fragrances and down below is a link
to the playlist

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.869
and i have a playlist of every celebrity
i've done

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.140
so you can go check them out on my
channel and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.810
before i start i just want to give a big thank you
siena and perfumemaniac

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.860
for their letters, I really do love hearing from you
guys

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.989
it's so lovely to get such a lovely letter so

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.030
if anyone else wants to send me a letter

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.300
there's a link on my blog to my...

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.950
to the address you can send it to, so this is the box

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.340
it's very artistic i really like this box it's really cute

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.090
so it's obviously Paris Hilton as a fairy and then it goes round and i really like the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.590
detail and the colour I think it's just
the electric colour

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.890
of the blue that i love, and it goes onto the back as well with all the stars and the light

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.260
i really like it, it's one of them ones where

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.750
it's got detail

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.700
and like 3D detail to it as well, some of the stars are 3D

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.869
i don't know if you can see that? and then i also really love the

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.229
colours as well, so shiny! so shiny! i really like this one, it's on the back as well,

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.310
so it's also a

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.189
sleeve as well! so the bottle, it's

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.509
pretty plain compared to the box
and its a really

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.549
thin shape which I really like about this and

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.070
then it goes out like that, and the top of it.. the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.689
top is very modern and then it's got the bright blue like the box
and then it's got like this

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.810
this is like the frosted glass effect

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.270
for the fairy on it which is cute and then it's got the sparkle on the end.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.030
and i think it's cute and then it's got 'Paris Hilton' going around at the top.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.140
this is actually 30ml and to be honest it's quite
a big bottle for a 30ml

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.920
and I got this from 'body care' it's a drugstore in the UK

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.140
and it was only Â£8 so

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.239
you can find this for a really good price
online

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.840
and in store now so this was actually

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.010
released in 2008, it's really

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.470
i really like this fragrance, so the top notes are peony

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.069
and orange blossom, at the first spray you get like
this

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.470
fresh peony smell with like light

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.010
musk and then it's like mixed in with
the soft scent of

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.450
gardenia and the orange blossom is like
there as well but

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.470
it blends in more into the background rather
than the forefront of the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.110
fragrance the middle notes are gardenia

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.319
lotus and peach, so the middle notes are very

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.080
feminine and all blend really well together

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.150
the peach doesn't stand out in the scent

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.300
it does in some other scents you can really smell it

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.510
but you can't that much in this scent

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.209
but it does add a bit of a sweetness to the scent though, so the base notes are

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.900
patchouli musk and
vanilla cream

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.900
so the base is like very floral and musky

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.769
which makes it like right for a nighttime
wear and so

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.879
overall the scent is a musky white floral scent

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.349
which can be worn anytime of the year it can be
also

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.799
day or night, it's not one of these ones where it's specifically

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.069
for summer or specifically for winter, or day or night I think it's
just one's you can wear

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.159
whenever you like but personally

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.170
I think it would

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.190
be great to wear around springtime because it's
quite

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.299
fresh scent and I also I think it could
be someone's signature scent as well

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.379
it does remind me of some signature scents that i've got i do really

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.700
think that would be great for someone

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.879
when i'm saying about it being someone's

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.790
scent, i say that because it really
reminds me of

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.000
my mum's she's got like three main scents
she always wears

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.049
but this really reminded me of one of hers so

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.530
that's why I think it could be someone's signature scent because it reminds me of

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.259
my mum's signature scent and that's another
good reason as to why it could someone's

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.500
signature scent because it can take you
from being

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.000
a young age to an older age because
it's just one of these scents

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.850
where it smells great on any age. so here it is on my

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.960
board of many fragrances so i gave the box an 8

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.100
i really like the box i think it's really pretty and then i gave the

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.960
bottle a 7.5 and on the picture
actually

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.250
it's just the bottle you don't get to see the scent, i forgot to say this, the scent

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:53.250
is like a colour, like a yellow/gold colour, ooh! that makes my mouth look really weird!

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.460
and then i gave the scent a 7.5 because again it's one of these

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.860
every day scents which i just think are great for everyone!

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.199
okay so I'm about to go and do

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.240
