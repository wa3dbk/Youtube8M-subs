My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I'll be showing you some of

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:12.761
the new features on Mac OS 10.5 Leopard. Finally,
for my favorite new feature, that would be

00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:18.770
screen sharing. Essentially it's remote desktop,
but boiled down to a much simpler interface.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.590
It also saves you 300 bucks over buying a
remote desktop, which is always nice. First

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.020
thing you have to do is turn it on, so we're
going to go to system preferences. Click on

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.571
that. It's under internet and network, under
sharing right here. It's where file sharing

00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:38.710
has always been on the Macs. I would click
on screen sharing here, but I've got my screen

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.560
sharing turned on under remote management.
When I click on it I'm going to get this warning:

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.261
screen sharing is being controlled by the
remote management service. So what you do

00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:51.579
is you would click this on, ok your file sharing.
You would say who can and can't use it. I've

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.440
got mine set up so unknown users can only
read. Everyone can only read. I can read and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.510
write, obviously. Printer sharing, I'm going
to turn that on real quick. Web sharing. Say

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.130
you want other people to be able to view web
pages of the sites folder to this computer.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.140
I have no use for that, so I'm going to turn
it off. Remote login which is nice. I can

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.760
use SSH logins and get to my computer from
anywhere else. I have an SSH terminal. Remote

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.420
management. Remote Apple events, this turns
Apple events on. So I can send Apple events

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.799
to this computer from other locations. Xgrid
sharing which I don't have a use for, so I

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.250
have it turned off. Internet sharing which
allows another computer to, either over Ethernet

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.409
or firewire or even Bluetooth if you go to
Bluetooth sharing, actually piggyback on top

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.820
of your internet connection. So, for example,
if I wanted to use my iPhone to pick up the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.840
WiFi signal from my Macbook over Bluetooth
I could do that. It's overly complicated and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.150
kind of useless. But if you had two people
who were sharing a connection, it's kind of

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.500
nice. If one person has a data card and the
other person doesn't and you're working within

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.700
a few feet of each other, you can piggyback
a data card which is kind of cool. And Bluetooth

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.509
sharing tells you all what to do, so it's
all set up on this one. I'm going to go ahead

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.820
and close it and the next clip I'll actually
show you how it works.
