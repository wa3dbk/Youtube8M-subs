00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.100
Hi, I'm Scott from Powerslide

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.300
and we're gonna show you
the 10 most basic steps to start skating!

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.500
I've got some very special helpers today.
Milena &amp; Yannis.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.700
And we're gonna show you
all the steps you need.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.900
One of the most important things you
need to do, even straight out of the box,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.700
is check that all the axles are secure
and the bolts

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.800
holding the frame to the boots are secure.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.100
Also, it's a good idea
to check it regularly

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.100
because it can become loose
with regular skating.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.400
Now your skates are
ready to go,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.500
it´s time to find somewhere to skate.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.400
Preferebly find somewhere quiet
without too many cars or things like that.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.400
Also flat ground is a lot easier
when you're starting.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.600
The most important piece of
protective gear is the helmet!

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.400
make sure it fits snug on the head,
not to far forward, not to far back.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.440
Then you also need your body protection:
wrist guards,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.600
ellbow pads and knee pads, all fitting
snugly, not too tight not to lose.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.500
now we're ready to move
on to the first exercise.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.200
really simple:
just put 2 feet together like this.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.400
Just always straight up and down.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.000
Another tip you can do with this exercise
is to start on the grass.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.200
Just balance on the grass to
find your position under your feet.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.400
After you feel comfortable in this position,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.400
now we need to practice it rolling.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.700
It´s important that you bend a bit of your knees
so your balance is lower

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.800
and your lot more stable on your feet.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.200
So the next exercise, we`re going to look at
is balancing on one foot.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.900
It's very important that you learn
how to balance on one foot

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.200
because it will give you the confidence
you got to push harder and roll for longer.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.700
The first part of this exercise is

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.900
you simply find something stable
to hold on to

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.800
and then lift up one foot,
like so.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.400
Once you're confident with that,
go up on 1 foot and take the hands away

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.500
and just feel the balance like that.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.400
It's very important that you practice this
on the right and the left foot equally.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.400
And then once you build up
the confidence

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.600
of using something solid
to hold on to,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.200
it's time to practice it rolling!

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.800
Now that we have the balance
and things organized,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.800
it´s time to start looking at the push.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.600
It's very important that you learn
to push to the side,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.360
not too far back and not too far forward.
OK, to practice this exercise,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.900
put all your pressure on 1 foot,
then push off with the other foot

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.700
just like you do on a scooter.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.300
Like with the balance,
it´s very important
that you practice on both feet equally,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.600
so that you develop them
to be symmetrical.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.300
Now again, put all the pressure on this foot
and than scooter-push like so.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.700
Now that we've learned how to skate

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.100
and how to push,
it's very important

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.700
that we learn how to brake.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.500
All of our Powerslide skates
feature a heel brake

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.500
made from high quality rubber that is long lasting and safe.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.100
To practice the braking exercise,
put your hands on your knees

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.500
and extend your braking leg
with all the pressure through it.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.900
Exactly like so.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.000
Now we need to practice this rolling.
A fun game you can play:

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.300
make a line on the ground
and always try to stop before the line.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.700
(braking sound)

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.300
(braking sound)

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.800
So now we've looked at
skating in the straight line,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.900
it´s time to start thinking
about the corners.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.900
When looking at corners, 
the easiest way to turn the corner is to use your body.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.200
Think your body like a steering wheel in
a car.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.100
When you want to go left,
you turn left with your body like this.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.600
When you want to go right,
you turn right with your body like this.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.500
When practicing this exercise,
start on a bigger radius corner

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.200
and as you get more confident
and more advanced,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.000
slowly make the corner
tighter and tighter.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.300
It´s also important that you
practice turning left and right.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.000
The way we do this, is lay some cones or
other objects on the ground

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.800
and then slalom your body through them
using your body weight to turn,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.000
both left and right.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.600
The world is not flat.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.300
So therefore it´s also important to practice
jumping obstacles and things.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.600
At first, start just practicing
without an obstacle.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.700
Then step by step, practice jumping.
It´s important you always keep your feet

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.800
under your body, so therefore you have
complete balance. exactly like that.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.500
Now that we´ve been through many of the basic exercises,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.800
it´s important that we maybe start
looking at something more advanced.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.700
the most simple advanced exercise
is skating backwards.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.500
To skate backwards first we need to turn.
A simple 180 like so...

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.900
Turning the body first,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.900
and then the hips and
the rest of the body will follow.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.600
Thank you for watching this Powerslide tutorial!
We hope you learned something

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.500
and you can take it and
make skating more fun!

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.000
