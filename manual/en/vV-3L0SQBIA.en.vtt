00:00:00.857 --> 00:00:04.073
- You, my love, are the
most crystal clear molecules

00:00:04.073 --> 00:00:07.057
of hydrogen and oxygen I've ever seen.

00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:10.003
(upbeat techno music)

00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:11.759
Yeah, I was trying to woo my water.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.746
That's because there's an idea out there

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:16.858
that our actual thoughts
projected on water molecules

00:00:16.858 --> 00:00:20.249
can affect them positively or negatively.

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.861
This is an idea from Dr. Masaru Emoto,

00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:24.195
who had a bunch of experiments

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.511
on the cellular structure of water.

00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:28.866
And this became widely known in the film

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.890
What The Bleep Do We Know?

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.437
In his studies, Emoto filled
100 Petri dishes with water,

00:00:34.437 --> 00:00:36.917
and doused them with either good vibes

00:00:36.917 --> 00:00:38.918
or really bad vibes.

00:00:38.918 --> 00:00:40.437
Then he froze the Petri dishes

00:00:40.437 --> 00:00:42.372
and looked at them under a microscope.

00:00:42.372 --> 00:00:43.866
He reported that the ice crystals

00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.647
that had a bunch of positive thoughts

00:00:45.647 --> 00:00:47.752
were much more aesthetically pleasing

00:00:47.752 --> 00:00:50.511
and symmetrical and kind of
have these snowflake structures.

00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:53.163
But the ones that had
really bummer thoughts,

00:00:53.163 --> 00:00:56.617
they were jagged,
asymmetrical and dull looking.

00:00:56.617 --> 00:00:58.895
Amazing, right, proof that mere thoughts

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:00.921
could transform the physical world?

00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:02.945
Well, except that no scientist

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:05.096
could reproduce Emoto's results.

00:01:05.096 --> 00:01:06.264
First off, Emoto's experiments

00:01:06.264 --> 00:01:07.770
weren't considered very rigorous,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.241
they lacked basic scientific controls.

00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:12.228
Second, contaminants can easily change

00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:13.937
the structures of ice crystals,

00:01:13.937 --> 00:01:16.134
and third, the formation of ice crystals

00:01:16.134 --> 00:01:18.614
can really vary widely depending on

00:01:18.614 --> 00:01:19.972
the cooling rate of the water.

00:01:19.972 --> 00:01:23.024
But hey, why would we exalt
water to the mystical realm

00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:24.464
in the first place?

00:01:24.464 --> 00:01:26.722
Our ideas about water and cleanliness

00:01:26.722 --> 00:01:29.587
have undergone quite a
change over the centuries.

00:01:29.587 --> 00:01:32.686
Not only is access to clean
water a relatively new thing

00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:33.624
in human history,

00:01:33.624 --> 00:01:37.111
but that we should obssessively
cleanse ourselves with it

00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:39.475
is a really modern concept, too.

00:01:39.475 --> 00:01:41.224
According to Seven Johnson in his book

00:01:41.224 --> 00:01:45.138
How We Got to Now, Six Innovations
That Changed the World,

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.151
as a child, Louis the XIII of France

00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:50.379
was not bathed once until
he was seven years old.

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:53.314
This is how people rolled in the 1600s.

00:01:53.314 --> 00:01:55.279
Even if they were royalty

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:56.642
and they had a couple of
servants to bathe them,

00:01:56.642 --> 00:01:59.718
they were like, "Nah, I'm good."

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:03.064
That is until we humans began to associate

00:02:03.064 --> 00:02:05.370
morality with hardcore cleanliness.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.418
Oh, and we had a plumbing infrastructure

00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:10.926
free of diseased water
to plunge ourselves into,

00:02:10.926 --> 00:02:12.459
that is key.

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.972
Fast forward to today,

00:02:13.972 --> 00:02:16.974
and you see that the humble
liquid is being bottled

00:02:16.974 --> 00:02:20.192
and distributed with claims
of magical vitamin properties.

00:02:20.192 --> 00:02:22.355
Providence becomes a really big deal, too.

00:02:22.355 --> 00:02:23.677
You never see water bottles

00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:26.065
claiming that they came
from some murky lake.

00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:28.415
No, the water came up from on high,

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:29.913
gathered at a glacial spring,

00:02:29.913 --> 00:02:31.528
never having to soil itself

00:02:31.528 --> 00:02:33.471
with a descent down the mountain

00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:35.587
to where mere mortals dwell.

00:02:35.587 --> 00:02:37.190
But the truth is that water,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.062
no matter where it hails from,

00:02:39.062 --> 00:02:40.898
has at some point made contact

00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:43.870
with trace amounts of poo.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.856
Think of all the species that ever existed

00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:48.011
in the entire history of the world,

00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:51.201
and the millions of tons of dinosaur poo

00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:52.666
produced every single day

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:55.812
during the Triassic, Jurassic
and Cretaceous periods.

00:02:55.812 --> 00:02:57.576
That, as well as leaf litter,

00:02:57.576 --> 00:02:59.017
decomposing animals and insects,

00:02:59.017 --> 00:03:01.942
make up a good amount
of the layers of soil.

00:03:01.942 --> 00:03:04.070
And a river runs through that soil.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.825
The water you get from your faucet,

00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:07.779
well, it comes from two different places.

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:09.778
Lakes are rivers, that's surface water,

00:03:09.778 --> 00:03:11.637
or from wells, that's ground water

00:03:11.637 --> 00:03:13.232
collected in aquifers.

00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:16.844
It gets treated and then put
into the potable water supply.

00:03:16.844 --> 00:03:19.408
In fact, some areas use
recycled waste water.

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:21.722
That's right, water from the poopy tubes

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:23.173
of the sewer systems.

00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:24.119
It's cleaned, it's treated,

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:25.512
and then it's used as tap water.

00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:29.221
Which is great, right, especially
in drought stricken areas,

00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:31.585
except that some people
cannot get over the whole

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:32.673
toilet to tap thing,

00:03:32.673 --> 00:03:34.615
or what we call the yuck factor.

00:03:34.615 --> 00:03:36.170
Regardless of whether or not

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.671
we're making mental love to our water,

00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:39.946
or if we're screaming at it,

00:03:39.946 --> 00:03:42.463
or if we just can't get
our minds around the fact

00:03:42.463 --> 00:03:43.493
that the next drop of water

00:03:43.493 --> 00:03:46.433
may have once tangled with a
little bit of fecal matter,

00:03:46.433 --> 00:03:49.807
there remains an unsung
hero of the water world,

00:03:49.807 --> 00:03:51.452
and his name is John Leal.

00:03:51.452 --> 00:03:52.647
In Steven Johnson's book

00:03:52.647 --> 00:03:55.033
and PBS series How We Got to Now,

00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:57.570
he points out that we owe
our clean drinking water

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.499
to physician John Leal,

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.862
who surreptitiously tested his theory

00:04:01.862 --> 00:04:04.284
that chlorine could
make water safe to drink

00:04:04.284 --> 00:04:07.102
by then adding it to
Jersey City's water supply

00:04:07.102 --> 00:04:08.672
in the early 1900s.

00:04:08.672 --> 00:04:11.748
In doing so, he cut the infant
and child mortality rate

00:04:11.748 --> 00:04:13.924
in half over a 30 year period,

00:04:13.924 --> 00:04:17.141
not to mention making public
swimming pools a reality

00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:19.291
and the "Everybody out of the pool,

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:21.175
"we have an AFR alert,"

00:04:21.175 --> 00:04:23.131
an accidental fecal release,

00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:24.806
which kind of brings it all full circle.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.746
Hey, all you lifeguards and
former lifeguards out there,

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:30.005
let us know about your AFR incidents

00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:30.953
in the comments below,

00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:32.132
