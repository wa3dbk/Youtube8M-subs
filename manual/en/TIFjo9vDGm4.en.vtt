00:00:00.441 --> 00:00:01.521
- Hey guys.

00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:03.481
So spring is the season for weddings.

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:05.421
And today I'm coming
together with a few of my

00:00:05.421 --> 00:00:07.621
favorite channels, in the Kin Community

00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:10.561
for a bridal registry collaboration.

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:11.661
So what does that mean?

00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:13.081
Well, we thought it would be fun to get

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:15.101
together and show our favorite items

00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:16.661
to put on a bridal registry

00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:18.782
and then show you how you will use them.

00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:20.562
So if there are any young brides out there

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.822
putting your list
together, you are in luck.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:25.022
So, after my video is done, be sure to

00:00:25.022 --> 00:00:27.122
stick around and click
the rest of the thumbnails

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:29.102
in the playlist and you can see all of our

00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:31.002
suggestions and ideas.

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:33.921
So for my part, I love to
give champagne glasses.

00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:35.761
It's one of those things,
that as a new bride

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:38.261
you won't really end
up buying for yourself.

00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:40.701
So my favorite style of champagne glass

00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:42.241
is a champagne coupe.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.761
They were really popular in the 1930's

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.061
but you can also find them
at a lot of stores now a days

00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:49.301
because they are becoming back in fashion.

00:00:49.301 --> 00:00:51.681
The reason why I love this
style of champagne glass

00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:53.601
is because it's really multi-functional.

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:55.961
So you can serve champagne
in it, but there are also

00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:59.041
great for serving sorbets, or fancy punch,

00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:01.201
or the recipe that I'm
going to show you today.

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:05.021
A no-bake, decadent,
chocolate cheesecake mousse.

00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:06.761
One of my favorite desserts that takes

00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:08.661
hardly any time to put together.

00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:09.943
Let me show you how to make it.

00:01:09.943 --> 00:01:11.283
So the first thing we're going to do

00:01:11.283 --> 00:01:12.703
is create our whipped cream.

00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:14.603
This is what's going to
give that mousse a really

00:01:14.603 --> 00:01:16.182
delicate lightness.

00:01:16.182 --> 00:01:18.722
So, with an electric mixer,
you're going to whip together

00:01:18.722 --> 00:01:20.602
2 cups of heavy cream,

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:24.482
1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder,

00:01:24.482 --> 00:01:29.044
and 3/4 cup of powdered sugar.

00:01:29.044 --> 00:01:32.704
Go ahead and just whip that
up until stiff peaks form.

00:01:32.704 --> 00:01:35.264
You do want the stiff peaks
because we are going to be

00:01:35.264 --> 00:01:38.024
folding this mixture into
a cream cheese mixture

00:01:38.024 --> 00:01:39.664
and if you don't have it stiff enough,

00:01:39.664 --> 00:01:41.944
your whipped cream will start
to fall on you a little bit.

00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:43.844
So, just take it 'till
you get a nice stiff peak.

00:01:43.844 --> 00:01:46.844
Take that whipped cream and
transfer it to a large bowl.

00:01:46.844 --> 00:01:49.924
And this is what makes
this dessert even easier.

00:01:49.924 --> 00:01:51.844
You don't even have to clean out the bowl.

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:54.044
So in that bowl, we are going to add

00:01:54.044 --> 00:01:56.904
eight ounces of whipped cream cheese.

00:01:56.904 --> 00:01:58.344
Now, if you can't find the whipped kind

00:01:58.344 --> 00:02:00.824
you can also use the kind that
comes in a brick, it's okay.

00:02:00.824 --> 00:02:02.564
I like the whipped
because I find that it's

00:02:02.564 --> 00:02:05.044
just a little bit easier and
a little bit more decadent

00:02:05.044 --> 00:02:06.784
but not to worry, the
brick will still work.

00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:11.624
To that you're going to add
a 1/4 cup of powdered sugar.

00:02:11.624 --> 00:02:13.644
Just beat those two things together

00:02:13.644 --> 00:02:16.444
until you get a nice incorporated mixture.

00:02:16.444 --> 00:02:18.145
And then you're also going to add

00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:20.804
a teaspoon of vanilla extract.

00:02:20.804 --> 00:02:23.344
Once that's all combined,
we are then going to fold in

00:02:23.344 --> 00:02:24.744
our chocolate whipped cream.

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:28.384
Just in stages, lightening
the cream cheese mixture.

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.205
You also want to make sure you

00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:32.705
you don't have any steaks of chocolate.

00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:34.325
So just make sure it's nice and combined.

00:02:34.325 --> 00:02:36.778
You're not going to hurt it
any by combining it well.

00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:40.787
Okay, at this stage, we are
going to transfer this mixture

00:02:40.787 --> 00:02:44.147
into a pastry bag, fitted
with your favorite tip.

00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:47.947
Now, for me right now, I am
really into this Wilton 2D tip

00:02:47.947 --> 00:02:50.687
because I think that it creates
the most beautiful designs.

00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:52.847
And because this desert is so simple,

00:02:52.847 --> 00:02:55.227
and we're going to put
it in these fancy glasses

00:02:55.227 --> 00:02:57.407
a fancy tip will just
give you a lot of look.

00:02:57.407 --> 00:02:58.867
So I'll put a link in the description

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:00.267
if you want to know where to get it.

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:02.507
Then you are just going to
pipe a nice little mount

00:03:02.507 --> 00:03:05.527
of these chocolate cheesecake mousse

00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:07.687
in the bottom of your coupe cup.

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:11.427
And you will see you will have
one beautiful looking mousse.

00:03:11.427 --> 00:03:12.807
And if you didn't have this style glass,

00:03:12.807 --> 00:03:14.667
you could also use a little tumbler,

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:17.747
a margarita glass, really
any fancy glass that you can

00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:19.890
get a spoon into will do the trick.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.188
And then the finishing
touch is just to take

00:03:22.188 --> 00:03:25.889
about four to five of those
plain chocolate wafers,

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.931
usually see them in the
isle next to the ice cream

00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:28.737
for some reason.

00:03:28.737 --> 00:03:30.433
I don't know why but that's
where they usually are.

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:32.993
And just put them in a
resealable plastic bag.

00:03:32.993 --> 00:03:35.373
And with a rolling pin,
give them a good whack,

00:03:35.373 --> 00:03:37.133
just until you get a nice, fine, crumb.

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.136
And then we are going
to take those crumbs and

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:42.276
just dust them on top of each cup.

00:03:43.896 --> 00:03:46.156
And you will see, you will
have the most elegant looking

00:03:46.156 --> 00:03:48.996
dessert that took hardly
any time to put together.

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:51.616
You could just put them
in the fridge just as is.

00:03:51.616 --> 00:03:55.276
They're really great like
two to maybe four hours max

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:56.357
before you serve it.

00:03:56.357 --> 00:03:58.017
If you leave them there over night

00:03:58.017 --> 00:04:01.338
they'll start to get a
little bit of skin on it

00:04:01.338 --> 00:04:02.257
which isn't as nice.

00:04:02.257 --> 00:04:04.457
So I say just a few hours
in the fridge is fine.

00:04:04.457 --> 00:04:07.057
And you will see when
you dig into this mousse,

00:04:07.057 --> 00:04:09.217
it is so delicious and light.

00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:11.977
It has all the flavor of a cheesecake

00:04:11.977 --> 00:04:13.437
without all the work of a cheesecake.

00:04:13.437 --> 00:04:15.797
It also is a great gluten
free dessert if you

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.518
didn't add the cookies on top.

00:04:17.518 --> 00:04:19.017
And often times it could be hard to find

00:04:19.017 --> 00:04:20.517
good gluten free desserts.

00:04:20.517 --> 00:04:22.657
You might just want to add
a little chocolate covered

00:04:22.657 --> 00:04:24.877
espresso bean on top, if
you were going to do that.

00:04:24.877 --> 00:04:26.057
Alright you guys.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:27.437
I hope you give this one a try and

00:04:27.437 --> 00:04:28.977
let me know what you think.

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.377
And if you are getting married,

00:04:30.377 --> 00:04:32.777
or know anybody who's putting
together a bridal registry,

00:04:32.777 --> 00:04:34.977
share the playlist and
give them some good ideas.

00:04:34.977 --> 00:04:37.057
Alright you guys, I'll see
you back here next time

00:04:37.057 --> 00:04:38.597
for another delicious recipe.

00:04:38.597 --> 00:04:41.257
Until then.

00:04:41.537 --> 00:04:45.057
