00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:17.030
They say thoughts are the seeds of action 
And your actions are the seeds of change, and I'm changing

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.020
Wandering over red seas to forge new bonds
Because only feet on the move don't sink in the sand

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.080
Here in the land of the prophet Mohammad
I break bread with Qusai, KAHEDI and Ahmed

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.000
In a world of opposites like squares on a chessboard
Still, a brother is someone you look out for 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.900
That's right!

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.070
And we come together, write lyrics that unsettle
While filling our lungs deep with shisha smoke

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.110
Because that’s what we do, we’re rappers
The place is Jeddah, the gateway to Mecca

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.260
Together we stand like pilgrims at Umrah
Gain impressions, inspiration for our songs

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.070
Circus lays the beat, we perfect the verses
Together we're part of something bigger:

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.000
HIP HOP

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.100
We started walking with our hands together.
Proud of our heritage, and perfected our craft.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:13.130
It became a venture in unison, 
so we sang the words after calling.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.240
Let me start my speech “In the name of Allah”
Because my religion is Peace

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.030
Hijazi and proud,  never be shaken, and always looking forward

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.230
I speak the Qur'an language.  Arabic origin
And my ancestors blood is from Makkah &amp; Madinah

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.240
From the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Along side the Federal Republic of Germany

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.000
We joined hands in good intentions
Because we all are the sons of Adam

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.080
To 100%!

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.200
For the Hip Hop art I'm an ambassador

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.170
And my voice reaches the Minister, the Labor
The rich, the poor, old, and young

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.080
Standing in front of you representing a nation with a message

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.030
My weapon is the microphone.  Its words are effective

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.120
Bring down any walls between us like The Berlin Wall

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.070
And deliver the voice of the people to the millions

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.040
From the Islam flag .. One word in two
Home of the Palm tree, two swords, and The Custodians

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.260
We started walking with our hands together.
Proud of our heritage, and perfected our craft.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.210
It became a venture in unison, 
so we sang the words after calling.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.240
We started walking with our hands together.
Proud of our heritage, and perfected our craft.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.060
It became a venture in unison, 
so we sang the words after calling.
