Cross the river, climb the hill, then settle.

00:00:01.877 --> 00:00:02.877
Boom

00:00:02.877 --> 00:00:04.437
Culture is an asset

Free tech - This better not be Pottery

00:00:06.818 --> 00:00:08.268
Grow the capitol

Free tech free tech

00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:14.608
I'm in first place...surely it will last

00:00:14.608 --> 00:00:16.058
Settle some more

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:17.448

Pray for science

00:00:29.287 --> 00:00:31.568
We won't stay happy for long

00:00:35.788 --> 00:00:40.798
Mausoleum of Helicarnassus - profit from storing
the Great People's bodies

00:00:40.798 --> 00:00:42.948
Supplement the nutrition

00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:44.837
Counting down the days to counting

00:00:44.837 --> 00:00:46.657
Workers to sacrifice!

00:00:46.657 --> 00:00:47.758
Lighthouses

00:00:47.758 --> 00:00:49.948
Cure the coastal concrete

00:00:49.948 --> 00:00:51.858
Civilly serve the civilians

00:00:51.858 --> 00:00:53.288
Finish up the liber-tree

00:00:53.288 --> 00:00:55.218
Please and thank you

00:00:55.218 --> 00:00:57.148
Marketplaces all around

00:00:57.148 --> 00:00:59.988
The National College comes from Philosophy

00:00:59.988 --> 00:01:01.778
Walls can guard the granary

00:01:01.778 --> 00:01:03.228
Trade needs to expand

00:01:03.228 --> 00:01:06.268
Machu Picchu for more gold

00:01:06.268 --> 00:01:07.268
Hurry it up

00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:09.558
Foresee an Oracle!

00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:11.808
We could settle north or south...

00:01:11.808 --> 00:01:12.848
Sea trade is crucial

00:01:12.848 --> 00:01:16.158
Composite bowman ALSO crucial

00:01:16.158 --> 00:01:18.408
Free amphitheatre time

00:01:18.408 --> 00:01:20.738
Castles for keeping things medieval

00:01:20.738 --> 00:01:22.808
Education is close

00:01:22.808 --> 00:01:25.298
We'll need one castle per county

00:01:25.298 --> 00:01:27.598
Universities might be smart

00:01:27.598 --> 00:01:29.618
Hey look a religion, who cares

00:01:29.618 --> 00:01:31.248
Science for us!

00:01:31.248 --> 00:01:33.318
Dare to dive deep into the deep water

00:01:33.318 --> 00:01:37.688
1240 AD and we have met everybody now

00:01:37.688 --> 00:01:39.718
These pathfinder's can't be beat

00:01:39.718 --> 00:01:42.677
Machinery: decommission the composite bowmen

00:01:42.677 --> 00:01:45.348
World Congress founded - not by me

00:01:45.348 --> 00:01:47.438
Land the Elite and eat them

00:01:47.438 --> 00:01:49.868
The Western East India Company

00:01:49.868 --> 00:01:52.118
Enrich that hill with knowledge

00:01:52.118 --> 00:01:53.717
We need more cities

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:56.397
You go there and become the marble

00:01:56.397 --> 00:01:57.878
I'm sure he's fine

00:01:57.878 --> 00:01:59.537
Circus is in town

00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:00.878
Works for me!

00:02:00.878 --> 00:02:02.467
Let's fertilize

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:03.927
Books for all

00:02:03.927 --> 00:02:06.007
Trade is not maxed-out

00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:08.278
We are even more religious

00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:10.767
Patronage for a Forbidden Palace!

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:11.917
There she is

00:02:11.917 --> 00:02:13.317
Whoops

00:02:13.317 --> 00:02:15.147
We need more of these guys

00:02:15.147 --> 00:02:18.697
Hey look, science of the military persuasion

00:02:18.697 --> 00:02:21.397
Tensions at the border

00:02:21.397 --> 00:02:25.078
I think Brandenburg Gate would open things
up quite nice

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:26.787
Here comes the caravan

00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:29.748
We could get an ideology buy buying three
factories

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:30.878
Number two and...

00:02:30.878 --> 00:02:31.878
Number three!

00:02:31.878 --> 00:02:33.358
Three factories

00:02:33.358 --> 00:02:35.098
Well look at that.

00:02:35.098 --> 00:02:37.267
Better specialists are priority

00:02:37.267 --> 00:02:39.597
Settle more things

00:02:39.597 --> 00:02:42.078
I want this ivory and I want it now.

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:43.078
Very

00:02:43.078 --> 00:02:44.977
I think I've angered the Buffalo

00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:46.778
I will also be angering Brantford

00:02:46.778 --> 00:02:48.578
Oops, sorry

00:02:48.578 --> 00:02:50.537
Let's make science happen

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:52.108
And then some tourism

00:02:52.108 --> 00:02:53.608
Sunday fun day

00:02:53.608 --> 00:02:55.737
And alleviate the unhappiness

00:02:55.737 --> 00:02:58.207
This would REALLY alleviate things

00:02:58.207 --> 00:03:00.287
A temple for more faith

00:03:00.287 --> 00:03:03.328
Better golden ages and specialists are less
of a problem

00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:05.167
The final steps of alleviation

00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:08.367
The empire is happy... even though we're losing

00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:10.167
We can get some Golden Age in

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:12.297
We'll continue to trade

00:03:12.297 --> 00:03:14.667
Maybe an opera house over t here

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:16.937
Hermitage is permitted

00:03:16.937 --> 00:03:18.987
Brantford is on fire

00:03:18.987 --> 00:03:21.947
Here we see the peaceful lands, untouched
by war

00:03:21.947 --> 00:03:23.647
Happiness is crucial

00:03:23.647 --> 00:03:26.307
Walls for protection from wild Buffalo

00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:28.987
And we can get fridges in 5 turns

00:03:28.987 --> 00:03:31.858
If someone attacks us, we'll attack them back

00:03:31.858 --> 00:03:33.358
Praise Pagodas

00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:35.127
Alright alright what next

00:03:35.127 --> 00:03:37.477
Save up on garrison costs

00:03:37.477 --> 00:03:39.507
Submerge the submarines

00:03:39.507 --> 00:03:41.737
Maybe get at that oil right there

00:03:41.737 --> 00:03:43.727
A scientific fixture

00:03:43.727 --> 00:03:45.278
More tourism

00:03:45.278 --> 00:03:46.688
I'll just sit here and research

00:03:46.688 --> 00:03:49.638
Hmm, I can be host now

00:03:49.638 --> 00:03:52.097
Bring in that Legion I'm always talking about

00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:53.847
Group photo!

00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:55.787
Everyone is awaiting plastics

00:03:55.787 --> 00:03:57.767
What could possibly go wrong?

00:03:57.767 --> 00:04:01.127
I feel like this particular place will be
hard to defend

00:04:01.127 --> 00:04:04.367
I should finish up the Tradition tree A.S.A.P.

00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:06.797
Hydro plants: work those rivers

00:04:06.797 --> 00:04:08.917
We really like Hydro Plants

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:11.207
Every bit of culture counts

00:04:11.207 --> 00:04:12.947
Looks like a great idea

00:04:12.947 --> 00:04:15.757
I am not sure if I can win this game

00:04:15.757 --> 00:04:17.857
Now I am pretty sure I can't win this game

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:18.968
Well then

00:04:18.968 --> 00:04:22.158
Looks like our resources will be shifted to
firearms

00:04:22.158 --> 00:04:24.348
Submarines will surprise

00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:27.507
This is totally necessary now: stronger strength

00:04:27.507 --> 00:04:29.197
Pew pew pew

00:04:29.197 --> 00:04:31.327
It's us against the world

00:04:31.327 --> 00:04:32.757
Must stand your ground

00:04:32.757 --> 00:04:36.318
They barely had any ground to stand on

00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:38.648
Must keep the coast under control

00:04:38.648 --> 00:04:40.787
There is word of enemies afar

00:04:40.787 --> 00:04:43.208
Tomorrow we'll have atomic thoughts

00:04:43.208 --> 00:04:45.517
Tourism bonus because Germany

00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:47.568
Our pilots earn their wings

00:04:47.568 --> 00:04:50.368
The ecological solution won't be for 8 turns

00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:52.827
Take THAT you stupid farm

00:04:52.827 --> 00:04:54.588
Maybe I should protect the Great White North

00:04:54.588 --> 00:04:56.947
Hmmm... may need more subs

00:04:56.947 --> 00:04:58.028
Uh oh

00:04:58.028 --> 00:04:59.748
Everything is sort of collapsing

00:04:59.748 --> 00:05:02.558
I'm not sure how to keep morale up

00:05:02.558 --> 00:05:05.188
I'll just take some of our land back!

00:05:05.188 --> 00:05:07.378
Thinking rationally will lead to good things

00:05:07.378 --> 00:05:10.528
Of course the enemy is near he moved into
my place

00:05:10.528 --> 00:05:13.058
Upgrade to machine guns for... hope

00:05:13.058 --> 00:05:16.018
Maybe if we destroy all the horcruxes?

00:05:16.018 --> 00:05:18.098
He doesn't want to stop fighting

00:05:18.098 --> 00:05:21.137
Germany stopped fighting, I need some time
to regroup

00:05:21.137 --> 00:05:23.727
This whole being-attacked thing isn't very
fun

00:05:23.727 --> 00:05:24.727
Bang bang

00:05:24.727 --> 00:05:25.727
Boom bang

00:05:25.727 --> 00:05:28.628
How do I get them to leave me alone!

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:30.977
I am not even a powerful threat

00:05:30.977 --> 00:05:33.528
Soon I'll email my friends about this

00:05:33.528 --> 00:05:36.327
I can feel the rocket science going on overseas

00:05:36.327 --> 00:05:37.327
Internet in three...

00:05:37.327 --> 00:05:40.348
I was a little PREOCCUPIED

00:05:40.348 --> 00:05:42.218
They'll move in further soon

00:05:42.218 --> 00:05:43.727
No respect

00:05:43.727 --> 00:05:45.797
What if I shoot this one guy

00:05:45.797 --> 00:05:46.797
YES

00:05:46.797 --> 00:05:48.348
Ok then... trade... surely we can be delusional
about victory

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:48.368
Dang
